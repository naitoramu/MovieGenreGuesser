<i>you'd be alive.</i>

155
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:26,920
First off, I'm not gonna die.

156
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,172
You're not

That's why
you want to come with me.

Listen.

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,469
Dreams make good stories,

160

happens when we're awake.

'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

162

Look at you.
Put on some muscle?

00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:41,852
I did?

164
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,187
No.

Out of the question.

I've been training
my whole life.

176
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,492
What is the point

177
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:39,868
if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

178
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,203
You know why, Paul.

179
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:43,372
You're the future

00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,668
Yes.

182
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:49,378
And look where that got him.

183
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,051
I need you by my side.

184
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:59,179
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

185
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:00,806
What danger?

186
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:02,766
The Fremen? The desert?

187
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,810
Political danger.

188
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,940
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

189
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,067
and this threatens
the Emperor.

190
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,404
By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

191
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,573
he sets the stage for a war

192
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,783
which would weaken
both houses.

193
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:23,078
But if we hold firm,

194
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:25,247
and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

195
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,624
we could be stronger
than ever.

196
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,334
What does that mean?

197
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:30,544
Mining spice,

198
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:32,129
keeping the Fremen
in their place?

199
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:33,422
We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

200
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,923
No.

201
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,135
By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

202
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:40,929
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

203
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:43,515
Here on Caladan,

204
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,101
we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

205
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:50,022
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

206
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,068
I want you sitting in
on my Council.

207
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:56,528
Learn what I do.

208
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,363
What if I'm not, Dad?

209
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,408
Not what?

210
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,454
The future of House Atreides.

211
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:09,291
[Leto sighs]

212
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,260
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

213
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,058
I wanted to be a pilot.

214
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:28,685
You never told me that.

215
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,815
Your grandfather said,

216
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,652
"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

217
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,364
He's called to it,
and he answers."

218
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:43,951
And if your answer is no...

219
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:50,248
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

220
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,335
my son.

221
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,432
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

222
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,771
In their memory...

223
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:17,109
give it a try.

224
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,826
[grunting]

225
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:28,120
[Gurney] Don't stand
with your back to the door.

226
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:30,872
How many times
do we have to tell you?

227
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,374
[Paul grunts]
I could tell it was you

228
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,209
by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

229
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:37,045
[Gurney] Someone
might imitate my stride.

230
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,380
[Paul] I know the difference.

231
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,048
Are you the new
Weapons Master?

232
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,885
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

233
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:46,388
Choose your blade.

234
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,223
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

235
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,350
Give us a song instead.

236
00:16:54,938 --> 00:16:56,023
[smacks lips] That's rude.

237
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:58,608
[Paul grunts]

238
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:02,654

[panting]

242
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,083
[Gurney] Come on.

243
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,168
Come on.

244
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,461
Old man.

245
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:18,712
[exhales forcefully]

246

00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:31,683
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

249

[groans]

250
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:40,609
I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

251
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,902
- Mood?
- Yeah.

252
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:43,111
What's mood to do with it?

253
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,946
You fight
when the necessity arises,

254
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,031
no matter the mood.

255
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:47,199
Now fight!

256

00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,705
Come on!

- [device beeps]
- I have you.

259
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:09,554
Aye.

260
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:11,306
But look down, my lord.

261
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,975
You'd have joined me in death.

262
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,936
I see you found the mood.

[devices deactivate]

265
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:29,741
Will it be that bad?

266
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:32,327
You don't get it, do you?

267
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,662
You don't really understand

268
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,415
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

269
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,335
For 80 years,

270
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:42,546
Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

271
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:45,132
80 years of owning
the spice fields.

272
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:47,342
Can you imagine the wealth?

273
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:49,344
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

274
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:51,930
You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

275
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:55,058
They're not human,
they're brutal!

276
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:57,060
You have to be ready.

277
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:09,281

[Vladimir] Rabban.

280
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:47,152
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis.

281
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:49,529
It's done.

282
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:51,114
[Vladimir] Very good.

283
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:56,203
Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

284
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:58,330
How can the Emperor

285
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,957
[shouting]
take everything we've built

286
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,335
and give it to that Duke?

287
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:04,711
How?

288
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:07,714
Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

What does he mean?

00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,018
When is a gift not a gift?

292
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,315
The Atreides' voice is rising,

293
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:28,693
and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

294
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,949
A dangerous, jealous man.

Get dressed and come with me.

What is this?

The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

She's now Truthsayer

Why?

She wants to know
about your dreams.

How does she know
about my dreams?

311
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:43,745
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

312
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:46,206
He only needs a moment.

[Dr. Yueh] Hello, young master.

00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,086

to check your vitals.

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,777
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

364
00:26:44,861 --> 00:26:47,488
- [whirring intensifies]
- [Paul grunts]

365
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,324
And I'll face my fear
and I'll permit it

366
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,533
to pass over me
and through me.

367
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,834
[ominous music playing]

368
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:03,504
[dramatic lamentation music
playing]

369
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,840
[searing]

370
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:07,258
And when it has gone past...

371
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,811
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path. [gasps]

372
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:24,567
{\an8}[sobs] And where the fear
has gone,

373
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:26,444
{\an8}there will be nothing.

374
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,950
Only I will remain.

375
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,498
Enough.

376
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:40,792
- [panting]
- [whirring fading]

377
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:57,725
Like sifting sand
through a screen,

378
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,395
we sift people.

379
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:03,356
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

380
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,024
like an animal,

381
00:28:05,108 --> 00:28:07,318
we could not let you live.

382
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:10,071
You inherit too much power.

383
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:11,280
What, because
I'm a duke's son?

384
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:14,158
Because you are Jessica's son.

385
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,869
You have more
than one birthright, boy.

386
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,539
Jessica?

387
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:28,923
You've been training him
in the Way.

388
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,013
Tell me about these dreams.

389
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:38,224
- I had one tonight.
- What did you see?

390
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:42,520
A girl.

391
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:44,272
On Arrakis.

392
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,732
Have you dreamt of her before?

393
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,154
Many times.

394
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,908
Do you often dream
things that happen

395
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:57,160
just as you dreamed them?

396
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,873
Not exactly.

397
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:07,128
Goodbye, young human.

398
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,547
I hope you live.

399
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,474
[Lady Jessica]
Did you have to go that far?

400
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,309
[Mohiam] You chose
to train him in the Way,

401
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,311
in defiance of our rule.

402
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,937
He wields our power.

403
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:27,815
He had to be
tested to the limits.

404
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,152
So much potential,
wasted in a male.

405
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:33,196
You were told
to bear only daughters.

406
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,655
But you, in your pride,

407
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,657
thought you could
produce the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

408
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,159
Was I wrong?

409
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,995
You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

410
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:43,331
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

411
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,459
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

412
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,379
But our plans
are measured in centuries.

413
00:29:50,463 --> 00:29:52,006
We have other prospects

414
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:54,467
if he fails his promise.

415
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:59,555
Do you see so little hope?

416
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:01,015
[Mohiam] On Arrakis,
we have done

417
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,725
all we can for you.

418
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:04,644
A path has been laid.

419
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:06,979
Let's hope
he doesn't squander it.

420
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:15,988
[voices murmuring
indistinctly]

421
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:50,064
[breathes heavily]

422
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:55,570
[Lady Jessica] Paul.

423
00:30:56,445 --> 00:30:58,030
[Paul] What does it mean?

424
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,075
That I could be The One?

425
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:02,493
[Lady Jessica] You heard.

426
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:07,123
The Bene Gesserit serve

427
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:09,709
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

428
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:12,003
but there's more to it.

429
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:14,630
You steer the politics
of the Imperium

430
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:16,132
from the shadows.

431
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:17,842
I know.

432
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:20,386
You don't know everything.

433
00:31:20,469 --> 00:31:22,763
For thousands of years,

434
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,474
we've been carefully
crossings bloodlines

435
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:27,685
- to bring forth...
- The One?

436
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,313
A mind...

437
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:36,402
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

438
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:39,030
Past and future.

439
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,326
Who can help us
into a better future.

440
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,204
We think he's very close now.

441
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:51,334
Some believe he's here.

442
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:57,340
All part of a plan.

443
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:16,233
[slow dramatic music playing]

444
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,771
[slow dramatic music
continues]

445
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:13,809
[spaceship lands]

446
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:16,479
Shield.

447
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:29,033
[metallic groan]

448
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:32,995
[metallic thudding]

449
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,164
[door opens]

450
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:00,815
"My lungs taste
the air of Time,

451
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,900
Blown past falling sand..."

452

[band playing
patriotic music]

454
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,696
Thufir Hawat.

455
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,660
Young master!

456
00:35:54,743 --> 00:35:57,037
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

457
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,039
Exciting, to say the least.

458
00:35:59,748 --> 00:36:01,584
My lord.

459
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,294
How are you, old friend?

460
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:05,713
My advance team
has secured the city.

461
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,799
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

462
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:11,760
My lady.

463
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:18,184

471
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:54,970
Don't be fooled
by the welcome.

472
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:56,931
They follow
their old masters' rules.

473
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,140
Mandatory attendance.

474
00:36:58,224 --> 00:37:00,517
That's Harkonnen love
out there.

475
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,604
[crowd continues chanting]

476
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,609
Atreides!

477
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:12,279
[soldiers chanting]
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

Atreides! Atreides!

480
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:23,540
[Thufir] Let's get you
out of the sun.

481
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:26,126
The heat can kill
in this place.

482

[ornithopters powering up]

483
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:44,103
They were pointing at us.

484
00:37:45,104 --> 00:37:46,438
What are they shouting?

485
00:37:46,522 --> 00:37:50,442
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>
"Voice from the Outer World."

486
00:37:50,526 --> 00:37:53,237
It's their name for "messiah."

487
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,615
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

488
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:59,159
Planting superstitions.

489
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,037
Preparing the way, Paul.

490
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:04,456
These people
have waited for centuries

491
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,292
for the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

492
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:08,085
They see you,

493
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,838
they see the signs.

494
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,884
They see
what they've been told to see.

495
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:22,016
We're good to go.

496
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:06,852
[Thufir] Shield Wall.

Protects the city
from the weather

498
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:10,397
and the worms.

499
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,450
[eerie dramatic music playing]

500
00:39:57,236 --> 00:40:00,072
[Gurney] The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

501
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:04,451
[Leto] Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

502
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,078
on our comms system.

503
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:10,749
It's so quiet.

504
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:13,836
[Gurney] Yeah.

505
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:15,796
That's what worries me, too.

506
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,304
[Leto] There's the spaceport

507
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,015
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

508
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:29,184
Our two
most vulnerable points.

509
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:30,561
I want you guarding them.

510
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:33,272
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

511
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:35,399
- we're dead here.
- [Lanville] My lord.

512
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:38,110
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

513
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:42,322
[Leto sighs]

514
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,992
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

515
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,536
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

516
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:49,163
That's what they say.

517
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,873
That's what they say.

518
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,130
[Thufir] Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

519
00:41:13,896 --> 00:41:15,397
What is your name?

520
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:17,649
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

521
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:21,487
[Lady Jessica]
The rest of you may go.

522
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,696
Thank you.

523
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,950
Shadout.

524
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:28,827
It's an old Chakobsa word.

525
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:31,038
"Well-dipper."

526
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,916
{\an8}[speaking Chakobsa]

527
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,209
{\an8}[in English]
You know the ancient tongues?

528
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,752
I know many things.

529
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:40,005
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:42,132
{\an8}[in sign language]

531

{\an8}[speaking]
If you mean to harm me,

532
00:41:43,842 --> 00:41:46,345
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

533
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:48,931
it won't be enough.

534
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:53,185
The weapon is meant as a gift

535
00:41:54,102 --> 00:41:56,313
if you are truly The One.

536
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,747
Do you know this?

537
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:16,708
It's a crysknife.

538
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:21,922
Do you know its meaning?

A maker of the deep desert.

When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

544
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,943
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

[Paul] Hello.

553
00:43:50,844 --> 00:43:53,555
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

554
00:43:55,724 --> 00:43:57,976
They're out here.

555
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,687
[gardener] Hmm.
Fremen pilgrims.

556
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,731
They don't care
about heatstroke.

557
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,694
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

558
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,906
[gardener] Oh,
these aren't indigenous.

559
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:13,450
They can't survive without me.

560
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:14,743
Each one of these

562

Twenty palm trees.

A hundred lives.

564
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,172
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

565
00:44:27,255 --> 00:44:28,674
No, no, no.

566
00:44:28,757 --> 00:44:30,342
These are sacred.

[Thufir] We won't see profits
like that for a while.

659
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,375
[Paul] But who's
meant to arbitrate?

660
00:50:37,459 --> 00:50:38,668
Isn't there
a Judge of the Change

661
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:40,045
to oversee the transition?

662
00:50:40,128 --> 00:50:41,546
Who did the Emperor appoint?

663
00:50:41,629 --> 00:50:44,424

I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:52,515
I wouldn't recommend it,
my lord.

668
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,060
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

669

A meeting's long overdue.

670
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,897
And we'll get
a bit of Imperial protection.

00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:01,858

[Paul] Well,

682
00:51:46,194 --> 00:51:48,154
For four weeks,
I lived with the Fremen.

00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,322
Hidden in the desert,

684
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:51,116

called a <i>sietch.</i>

685

Stilgar, the leader
of that <i>sietch,</i>

has come with me
to meet you, sire.

00:51:54,452 --> 00:51:56,788
This <i>sietch,</i> how is it hidden?

688
00:51:56,871 --> 00:51:57,956
It's underground.

689
00:51:58,039 --> 00:51:59,999
Arrakis is filled
with caverns.

690
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,751
How big was the place?

691
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:04,295
I'd say 10,000 people.

692
00:52:04,379 --> 00:52:05,922
And there are
hundreds of <i>sietches.</i>

693
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:08,550
Millions of Fremen.

694
00:52:09,342 --> 00:52:10,802
You were right.

695
00:52:10,885 --> 00:52:14,222
The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

696
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:16,516
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

697
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:18,059
I never saw them.

698
00:52:18,143 --> 00:52:20,854
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

699
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,522
And I gotta tell you,

700
00:52:22,605 --> 00:52:25,024
I have never come
so close to dying.

701
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,902
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

709

Let him pass.

710

712
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:10,195
Mm.

the personal dignity

00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:24,125
[Stilgar] Hmm.

719
00:53:25,543 --> 00:53:27,003
[inhales deeply]

720
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:28,880
[Duncan] Hold.

721
00:53:30,131 --> 00:53:32,050
[clears throat]
Thank you, Stilgar,

722
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:35,553
for the gift
of your body's moisture.

723
00:53:35,637 --> 00:53:37,972
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

724
00:53:43,645 --> 00:53:44,812
[Leto snorts]

725
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,065
[Leto] I'm glad you've come.

726
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:49,943
I believe your people and mine

727
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:51,319
have much
to offer one another.

728
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:52,779
No, no, you are Outworlders.

729
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,530
You come here for the spice,

730
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:57,075
you take it,
giving nothing in return.

731
00:53:58,826 --> 00:53:59,869
That's true.

732
00:54:01,788 --> 00:54:04,707
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

733
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,335
Name what you want.

734
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:08,628
If it's in my power to grant,

735
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:10,171
I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

736
00:54:10,255 --> 00:54:13,132
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our <i>sietches.</i>

737
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:16,052
Do not trespass in our lands.

738
00:54:16,135 --> 00:54:19,597
The desert was ours
long before you came.

739
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:21,474
So, come and dig your spice,

740
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:22,767
but when you have it,

741
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,978
go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

742
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,854
and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

743
00:54:26,938 --> 00:54:29,732
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

744
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:32,402
[Leto] Gurney, just...
Just a moment.

745
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:33,820
The Emperor

746
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,656
has given me Arrakis
as my fief

747
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:38,491
to rule and protect.

748
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:41,077
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

749
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,997
if duty compels me.

750
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,000
But your <i>sietches</i>
will be yours forever.

751
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,669
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

752
00:54:54,173 --> 00:54:56,009
That's very honorable.

753
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:58,761
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

754
00:54:58,845 --> 00:55:01,014
[Paul] Won't you stay?

755
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,473
We would honor you.

756
00:55:02,557 --> 00:55:05,643
Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

757
00:55:07,603 --> 00:55:08,855
{\an8}[speaking Chakobsa]

758
00:55:17,322 --> 00:55:18,573
I don't like him.

759
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:20,908
Our plan bears fruit.

760
00:55:20,992 --> 00:55:22,410
But it will take time?

761
00:55:22,493 --> 00:55:23,745
Yes.

762
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:26,998
It will take time.

763
00:55:29,751 --> 00:55:31,127
Here, this is for you.

764
00:55:35,214 --> 00:55:37,216
It's a paracompass.

765
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,802
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

766
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:42,513
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

767
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:44,724
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

768
00:55:44,807 --> 00:55:46,476
[Paul] The Fremen make these?

769
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,394
And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

770
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:49,896
and all kinds
of ingenious things.

771
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,939
[Gurney] What the hell
is a sand compactor?

772
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,234
[Duncan]
That's a sand compactor.

774
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,238
My God, man,
you've gone native.

775
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:00,615
You admire them.

776
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:03,409
I do.

777
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,162
They're fierce but loyal.

778
00:56:06,245 --> 00:56:08,039
They're attuned to the desert.

779
00:56:08,122 --> 00:56:09,374
Part of it.

780
00:56:09,457 --> 00:56:11,584
It's part of them.

781
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:12,835
You wait till you see it.

782
00:56:13,669 --> 00:56:15,088

My lord Duke.

793
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:12,478
Welcome to Arrakis.

794
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,647
[Paul] You're
the Imperial Ecologist.

795
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,649
Thank you for the stillsuits.

796
00:57:16,732 --> 00:57:18,818
They are of Fremen make.

797
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:19,986

With your permission, sire,

799
00:57:21,446 --> 00:57:22,822
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

800
00:57:22,905 --> 00:57:24,031
[Leto] Whoa.

801
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,950
It's all right.

802
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,787
It's all right.

803
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:33,458
[chuckles lightly] Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

804
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:39,172
A stillsuit

805
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:43,217
is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

806
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:44,886
Even this early
in the morning,

807
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:47,763
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

808
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:50,933
It cools the body

809
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:54,854
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

810
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:58,232
Your body's movements
provide the power.

811
00:57:58,316 --> 00:58:00,026
Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

812
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,195
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

813
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:03,529
[Leto] Mm.

814
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:04,947
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

815
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:07,325
more than a thimbleful
of water a day.

816
00:58:07,408 --> 00:58:08,743
[Leto] Most impressive.

00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:11,787
Let's have a look at you, lad.

818
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,541
You've...

819
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:16,834
worn a stillsuit before?

820
00:58:16,918 --> 00:58:18,544
No, this is my first time.

821

Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

822
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,301
Who taught you to do that?

823
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:27,428
It seemed the right way.

Now, come and see

your livelihood depends.

00:59:25,736 --> 00:59:26,946
What would you do

831
00:59:27,029 --> 00:59:28,573
if your ornithopter
went down out here?

832
00:59:28,656 --> 00:59:30,783
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

833
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:32,451
It's worm territory.

834
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:36,163
Dust cloud.

835
00:59:37,248 --> 00:59:39,458
[Leto] I see it.

836
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,669
That's one of your harvesters.

You can see the spice

If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

01:00:33,095 --> 01:00:35,723

when they attack.

849
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,401
If you are patient,

850
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,363
we should see one.

851
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:51,906
A worm always comes?

852
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:54,784
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

853
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:56,952
Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

854
01:00:57,036 --> 01:00:59,538
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

855
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:00,873
It attracts the worms

856
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:03,626

into a killing frenzy.

I'm sorry, my lord.

1088
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:29,535
But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

[Leto breathing raggedly]

1090
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,081
Why?

1091
01:22:33,957 --> 01:22:36,000
I had no choice.

1092
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:39,921
The Harkonnens
have my wife, Wanna.

1093
01:22:40,004 --> 01:22:42,548
They take her apart
like a doll.

1094
01:22:43,549 --> 01:22:45,677
I will buy her freedom.

1095
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,345
And you are the price.

1096
01:22:50,682 --> 01:22:53,726
For Paul.
I will do what I can.

1097
01:22:54,435 --> 01:22:56,145
And you

1098
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:58,106
will kill a man for me.

1099
01:23:02,485 --> 01:23:06,030
I'm going to replace
your peg tooth.

1100
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:11,035
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

1101
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:15,373
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

1102
01:23:15,456 --> 01:23:18,167
It will be your last breath.

1103
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:20,586
But if you choose
your moment well,

1104
01:23:21,879 --> 01:23:24,173

[trooper 1]
She's highborn enough for me.

Let's feed the kid
to the worms.

1125

Paul.

1254
01:40:48,717 --> 01:40:50,802
Paul Atreides.

1255
01:40:50,886 --> 01:40:53,847
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1256
01:40:53,930 --> 01:40:57,434
You are
the Duke Paul Atreides.

1257
01:40:57,517 --> 01:41:00,312
You know who you are.

1258

It's recycled water
from the tent.

1270

1271
01:42:32,904 --> 01:42:34,614

1290
01:44:07,958 --> 01:44:09,292
My lord Duke.

1291
01:44:23,056 --> 01:44:24,057
Here.

1292
01:44:26,142 --> 01:44:27,644

1293

1294

1295
01:44:38,905 --> 01:44:41,032
There must have been
10 legions, hundreds of ships.

1296
01:44:41,116 --> 01:44:43,159
There were Sardaukar
with them.

1297
01:44:43,243 --> 01:44:45,787
- At least two battalions.
- What? Are you sure?

1298
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:48,540
You cross swords
with a Sardaukar,

1300
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:54,838
[Lady Jessica sighs] So,
the Emperor's taken a side.

What says

1302
01:44:58,133 --> 01:45:00,176
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1303
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,220
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

[Dr. Kynes] The storm

1310
01:45:40,633 --> 01:45:41,760
We'll be safe here.

1311
01:45:43,303 --> 01:45:45,555
Do you know
what this place is?

1312
01:45:45,638 --> 01:45:48,058
It's an old
ecological testing station.

1313
01:45:51,436 --> 01:45:53,271
They were meant
to tame the planet.

1314
01:45:53,355 --> 01:45:55,774
Free the water
locked beneath the sands.

1315
01:45:58,777 --> 01:46:01,404
Arrakis could have been
a paradise.

1316
01:46:01,488 --> 01:46:02,614
The work had begun,

1317
01:46:02,697 --> 01:46:04,366
but then the spice
was discovered.

1318
01:46:04,449 --> 01:46:07,452
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1328

[Paul] You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1329
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:12,475
Dr. Kynes?

1330
01:47:13,726 --> 01:47:15,979
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1331
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:18,148
The Sardaukar coming

1332
01:47:18,231 --> 01:47:19,941
and picking them off
one by one.

1333
01:47:22,902 --> 01:47:24,529
Only together
can they stand a chance

1334
01:47:24,612 --> 01:47:26,114
against the Imperium.

1335
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:30,326
Would you bear witness?

1336
01:47:30,410 --> 01:47:33,538
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1337
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:36,541
If they believe me,

1338
01:47:36,624 --> 01:47:38,334
there would be general warfare

1339
01:47:38,418 --> 01:47:40,628
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1340
01:47:40,712 --> 01:47:42,297
Chaos

1341
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:43,840
across the Imperium.

1342
01:47:43,923 --> 01:47:45,341
Suppose I presented
the Emperor

1343
01:47:45,425 --> 01:47:47,886
with an alternative to chaos.

1344
01:47:47,969 --> 01:47:49,888
The Emperor has no sons.

1345
01:47:49,971 --> 01:47:51,973
And his daughters
have yet to marry.

1346
01:47:52,056 --> 01:47:54,851
You'd make a play
for the throne?

1347
01:47:54,934 --> 01:47:56,686
The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

1348
01:47:56,769 --> 01:47:58,438
He brought you here
to kill you.

1349
01:47:58,521 --> 01:48:01,024
What don't you understand?

1350
01:48:01,107 --> 01:48:04,277

a Fremen warrior

1357

and lost him in battle.

1358
01:48:31,262 --> 01:48:34,974

and are known by many names.

1360

As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1361
01:48:47,529 --> 01:48:49,447
I could make
a paradise of Arrakis

1362

02:14:16,681 --> 02:14:18,308
The boy is young.

1607
02:14:18,391 --> 02:14:20,602
He can learn our ways.

1608
02:14:20,685 --> 02:14:23,313
He may have sanctuary.

1609
02:14:23,396 --> 02:14:25,732
But the woman is untrained...

1610
02:14:28,401 --> 02:14:29,903
and too old to learn.

1611
02:14:33,573 --> 02:14:35,658
[low tense music playing]

1612
02:14:42,707 --> 02:14:43,917
[sniffles]

1613
02:14:49,089 --> 02:14:50,423
[grunting]

1614
02:14:56,429 --> 02:14:57,430
[groans]

1615
02:15:01,267 --> 02:15:03,394
- [both grunt]
- [Stilgar] back, you dogs.

1616
02:15:05,021 --> 02:15:07,232
She'll cut my throat.

1617
02:15:12,195 --> 02:15:14,697
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1618
02:15:14,781 --> 02:15:16,449
And a fighter?

1619
02:15:16,533 --> 02:15:18,701
Conversation ran short.

1620
02:15:18,785 --> 02:15:20,995
[Stilgar] Peace, woman.

1621
02:15:21,079 --> 02:15:22,413
Peace.

1622
02:15:23,206 --> 02:15:24,749
I judged hastily.

1623
02:15:28,837 --> 02:15:29,921
[sniffs]

1624
02:15:31,089 --> 02:15:32,715
[Stilgar grunts]

1625
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:35,552
{\an8}[speaking Chakobsa]

1626
02:16:03,955 --> 02:16:06,374
[girl in English] <i>I would not
have let you hurt my friends.</i>

1627
02:16:31,649 --> 02:16:34,235
They say you're the <i>Mahdi.</i>

1628
02:16:34,319 --> 02:16:36,154
But you look
like a little boy.

1629
02:16:37,655 --> 02:16:39,115
You chose the hardest way up.

1630
02:16:39,199 --> 02:16:40,533
Follow me.

1631
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:45,830
{\an8}[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]

1632
02:16:47,999 --> 02:16:49,584
[in English] Give it to me.

1633
02:16:56,507 --> 02:16:58,218
You will have
your own maula pistol

1634
02:16:58,301 --> 02:17:00,220
when you've earned it.

1635
02:17:00,303 --> 02:17:01,346
Give it to me.

1636
02:17:07,101 --> 02:17:09,229
Chani, take charge
of the newcomers.

1637
02:17:09,312 --> 02:17:11,940
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1638
02:17:12,023 --> 02:17:13,441
[Jamis] I will not have them.

1639
02:17:20,365 --> 02:17:21,783
[Stilgar] Jamis,

1640
02:17:21,866 --> 02:17:24,202
I have spoken. Be still.

1641
02:17:24,285 --> 02:17:25,870
[Jamis] You talk like a leader.

1642
02:17:26,871 --> 02:17:28,748
But the strongest leads.

1643
02:17:30,041 --> 02:17:31,834
She bested you.

1644
02:17:33,253 --> 02:17:35,546
I invoke the amtal.

1645
02:17:35,630 --> 02:17:38,049
[Stilgar] You may not challenge
a <i>Sayyadina.</i>

1646
02:17:38,132 --> 02:17:39,634
Then who will fight
in her name?

1647
02:17:39,717 --> 02:17:42,470
Jamis, don't do this.

1648
02:17:42,553 --> 02:17:44,639
Don't. The night is fading.

1649
02:17:44,722 --> 02:17:47,642
Then the sun
will witness this death.

1650
02:17:47,725 --> 02:17:49,769
Where is her champion?

1651
02:18:00,613 --> 02:18:02,615
I accept her champion.

1652
02:18:25,763 --> 02:18:27,890
[slow dramatic music playing]

1653
02:18:32,103 --> 02:18:33,271
[grunting]

1654
02:18:34,772 --> 02:18:38,693

[breathing heavily]

1662
02:19:36,042 --> 02:19:38,503
I don't believe
you're the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1663
02:19:40,004 --> 02:19:42,048
But I want you
to die with honor.

1664
02:19:53,518 --> 02:19:56,354
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

1665
02:19:59,607 --> 02:20:01,984
It's made
from a tooth of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1666
02:20:02,068 --> 02:20:03,778
The great sandworm.

1667
02:20:05,405 --> 02:20:08,199
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

1668
02:20:12,495 --> 02:20:14,872
[Jamis shouts]
Where is the Outworlder?

1669
02:20:19,210 --> 02:20:21,129
Jamis is a good fighter.

1670
02:20:22,088 --> 02:20:23,756
He won't let you suffer.

1671
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:26,843
Chani...

1672
02:20:29,971 --> 02:20:31,013

1674
02:20:39,063 --> 02:20:40,273
Never mind.

[slow dramatic music
continues]

1676
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:37,788
May thy knife
chip and shatter.

1677
02:21:45,588 --> 02:21:47,548
You should welcome my blade.

1678
02:21:51,052 --> 02:21:52,803
This world will kill you.

1679
02:21:56,182 --> 02:21:57,725
Quicker this way.

[yells]

1687
02:22:44,522 --> 02:22:46,107
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

1688
02:22:46,190 --> 02:22:47,858
Only death is the test of it.

- Is he toying with him?
- No.

Paul has never killed a man.

You're one of us now.

A life for a life.

Come with us to <i>Sietch</i> Tabr.

No.

Paul needs to get off-world.

1711
02:25:27,643 --> 02:25:29,729
You must have ways.
You have smugglers,

1712
02:25:29,812 --> 02:25:31,063
you have ships.

- [Paul] No.
- [Lady Jessica] You have...

The Emperor sent us
to this place.

1715
02:25:36,861 --> 02:25:38,612
And my father came,

1716
02:25:39,530 --> 02:25:41,824
not for spice,

1717
02:25:41,907 --> 02:25:44,201
not for the riches,

1718
02:25:44,285 --> 02:25:46,412
but for the strength
of your people.

1719
02:25:49,415 --> 02:25:51,500
My road leads into the desert.

1720
02:25:54,170 --> 02:25:55,546
I can see it.

If you'll have us,

1722
