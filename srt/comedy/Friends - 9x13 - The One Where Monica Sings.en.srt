1
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,173
- Hey.
- Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,260
Look, can we talk
about what happened here last night?

3
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:13,222
Sure. Just give me a second
to get all huffy and weird like you.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,227
You believe that whoever did something
last night did what they did or didn't do?

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,523
Okay, you really don't know
what I'm talking about?

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,192
- No.
- Okay. Last night, after the party...

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,946
...I saw Rachel kissing that jerk
from her office out on your balcony.

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,572
Our balcony? Seriously?

9
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,117
That's so funny. I told Monica
we should put lights on our balcony...

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,954
...and she said, "No, no. It's too cold.
Nobody will go out there. " And I said:

11
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,582
"Maybe if we put some lights
out there they will."

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,630
Right, that's what I came over to talk
about. I saw Rachel kissing some guy...

13
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,551
...on your balcony,
even though there were no lights!

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,471
So are you gonna talk to her?

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,517
Why? Why should I? I mean,
if she wants to move on, that's fine.

16
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,312
You know when "that's fine" sounds
true? When someone yells it and spits.

17
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,776
No, I'm serious. I mean, if she wants
to date people, fine. I don't care.

18
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,112
But at least she could have told me.

19
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,783
You know, I've been putting my life on
hold and concentrating on Emma.

20
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:19,622
But if she wants to go out there kissing
guys she barely knows, then so will I.

21
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,918
Very funny! Ross is gay!

22
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,296
No, no.
Good, so you're moving on.

23
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,966
Do you have any idea
where you're moving on to?

24
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,052
I've got plenty of opportunities.

25
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:37,723
Just now, there was some woman
at the coffeehouse smiled at me.

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,437
And then the other day on the subway,
a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.

27
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,442
Dude, don't rub my face
in your crazy single life.

28
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,362
And there's an anthropologist
at school...

29
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,282
...who totally came on to me during
the interdepartmental potluck dinner.

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,118
Why did I get married?

31
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,039

34
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,755
Hey, let me ask you guys something.

35
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,715
I'm having new headshots
taken tomorrow.

36
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,219
The photographer said she thinks
I should have my eyebrows waxed.

37
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,680
Is that weird for a guy?

38
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,057
- Well, it depends.
- On?

39
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,102
On how far along he is
in the sex-change process.

40
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,732
No, I totally disagree. I think it's fine
for a guy to do something like that.

41
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,484
Especially an actor.

42
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,571
I mean, not that you need to.
Your eyebrows are...

43
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,577
Stop it, you guys. Stop staring,
you're freaking me out.

44
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,080
Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.

45
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,583
Oh, man, now I have to get
those done too?

46
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,838
- Wow, talk about high maintenance.
- You dye your hair.

47
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,258
- I'm a woman.
- Double standards!

48
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,512
Before I forget, are you coming
to Mike's piano bar tonight?

49
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,558
- Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
- But everybody sings. It's so fun.

50
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,896
Last time, this adorable old man got up
there, forgot all the words, flipped out...

51
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,441
...and everyone booed him off the stage.
It was so funny.

52
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,112
Look, I'm not good at singing.

53
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:01,450
Oh, what's the matter? You scared?
You afraid I'm a better singer?

54
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,828
You afraid I'm gonna beat you
at singing?

55
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:09,583
Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.

56
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,795
Wow, I must be growing up.

57
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:18,842
Okay, fine. Just please come and
support Mike. You don't have to sing.

58
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:23,180
So I don't have to sing, and I can just sit
there and pass judgment on others?

59
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,640
- While drinking.
- I'm there.

60
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,646
Hi, you guys.
Listen, I really need your help.

61
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,315
I think I did something
really stupid.

62
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:37,152
Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something
so beautiful out of it.

63
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,574
No, not that.
I kissed Gavin last night.

64
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,867
- My God.
- You kissed him?

65
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,620
Yeah, it was after the party,
we were on the balcony...

66
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,165
Wait, wait, wait. I was at home
the whole time. How did I miss that?

67
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:54,503
Well, it was the end of the party. You
were probably ironing wrapping paper.

68
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,922
Oh, yeah.

69
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,510
So how did you end up kissing?

70
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,054
We were all alone
and he was being really nice...

71
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,433
...and he gave me this scarf.
- I thought you hated him.

72
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,352
Well, there is a thin line
between love and hate...

73
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:15,107
...and it turns out that line
is a scarf.

74
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,528
Are you thinking of starting
something up with this guy?

75
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,740
I don't know. It's so complicated.
I work with this guy.

76
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,451
I have the baby, and I have Ross.
I don't know what to do.

77
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,871
And I have to be at the office
and see Gavin in 10 minutes.

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,625
Sounds like you need to think
about what you want and talk to Gavin.

79
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,754
- And you definitely should talk to Ross.
- Or...

80
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,508
...I could call in sick
and not deal with it at all.

81
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,512
Wow! Five months maternity leave,
you're back for four days...

82
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,975
...kiss a co-worker and call in sick.
They are lucky to have you.

83
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,025
- Hi.
- Hi.

84
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:03,989
- I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
- Name?

85
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,950
Chandler Bing.

86
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,870
Okay, very good.

87
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,249
Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,
and Sonya will be right with you.

88
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,500
Okay. Thanks.

89
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,841
I touched the stuff.

90
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,927
I'll take care of it.

91
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,474
Thanks.

92
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,727
So do you...?
Do you get a lot of guys in here?

93
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,688
- Oh, absolutely.
- Oh, good.

94
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,526
- You looking to meet somebody?
- All right, let's just do this.

95
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,363
Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.

96
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,283
First, I want to tweeze
some of the strays, okay?

97
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,411
- Now, this may sting just a little bit.
- I have an extremely high threshold...

98
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,666
Holy Mother of God!
Oh, my face! My face!

99
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,008
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

100
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,553
It's just a bit of shock, that's all.

101
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,183
- But I'll be fine. You can go again.
- Okay.

102
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,354
Sorry.

103
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,154
Damn it, woman!

104
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,879
It's the most eligible man in New York.
How's the moving on going?

105
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:29,593
Not well. I went on the subway again
and someone did sit on my hand...

106
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,722
...but that person was neither female
nor wearing pants.

107
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,102
Maybe you're going about this
the wrong way. I mean, think about it:

108
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,732
Single white male, divorced three times,
two illegitimate children.

109
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,612
The personal ad writes itself.

110
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,575
You know, that's funny. Yeah.
So do you think you'll ever work again?

111
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,372
What are you doing?
You know I can only dish it out.

112
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,627
I can't believe Rachel just moved on
and didn't say anything to me.

113
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,421
Maybe she didn't move on.

114
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,216
Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,
one-time birthday thing.

115
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,386
No, a month ago, she gave her number
to some guy in a bar.

116
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,679
- Did she go out with him?
- No. When he called...

117
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,349
...I threw the message away.

118
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,185
The highroad.

119
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:25,399
All right, you know what? Enough.
Enough talking. I have to get moving.

120
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:30,654
Hey, check out those two blonds
over there. Hey, come with me.

121
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,491
Are you trying to get
everybody divorced?

122
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,578
You don't have to do anything.
It'll just be easier if it's two of us.

123
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:42,082
Like college, remember? First, you
break the ice with some kind of a joke...

124
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:46,336
...so they know you're the funny one. I
swoop in with interesting conversation...

125
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,757
...so they'll see that I'm the brilliant,
brooding sexy one.

126
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,179
I thought I got to make the jokes.

127
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:01,143
- Don't you have to be at work?
- Oh, come on.

128
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:08,817
Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler.
This is my friend Ross right here.

129
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,569
We were wondering...

130
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,740
...if you're up for it, we only need
six more people for a human pyramid.

131
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,619
Swoop. Swoop.

132
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:26,459
Hey, I notice
you're reading the paper.

133
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,963
Another flood in Europe, huh?

134
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,425
Here's a question:

135
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:39,848
Would you rather drown
or be burned alive?

136
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:45,604
- I'm sorry, we're just leaving.
- Okay.

137
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,442
We still got it.

138
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,539
- Who is it?
- Gavin. I brought you some soup.

139
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,208
- Why?
- I heard your were sick.

140
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,254
Oh, right! Hold on,
let me just clean up in here a little bit.

141
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,100
Hello, Gavin.

142
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,978
I missed you at work.
How you feeling?

143
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,898
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.

144
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,235
Oh, good. Because I was having
a totally paranoid moment...

145
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,613
...where I thought you
called in sick to avoid me.

146
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,741
Oh, no, no, no.

147
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,578
So I had fun last night.

148
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,248
So did I.

149
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,170
Exactly how contagious
is this thing you have?

150
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:56,591
Is it a cold from standing on
the balcony, or did a monkey bite you?

151
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,012
- It's just a cold.
- Do you have a fever?

152
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,473
Let me see.

153
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,897
What? What is it?
What's the matter?

154
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,566
What's Ross doing to you
in that picture?

155
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,487
Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.

156
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:20,074
He thought it would be funny.

157
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,492
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

158
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,661
- Ross.
- Yeah.

159
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,666
What's the deal with you guys? I don't
wanna get in the middle of anything.

160
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:33,879
You're not getting in the middle
of anything. Don't worry about Ross.

161
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,464
Hide! That's Ross! Hide!

162
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,343
- Hide! Hide!
- Yeah, but you said not to worry...

163
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,304
I lied and I'm not sick either!
Just stay behind the curtain!

164
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,477
- Hi.
- Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.

165
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,523
No. I'm here to take Emma
to your mother's, remember?

166
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,316
Right. Yes, yes.

167
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,361
- Don't panic.
- What?

168
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,780
There is a man behind your curtain.

169
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,576
- I have Mace in my purse.
- No, that's okay! No, no, no.

170
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:08,789
This is my business associate Gavin
being silly. Come out from behind there.

171
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,168
Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.

172
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,588
It was my idea to stand there.

173
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:21,051
- Hello. I'll just go get Emma.
- Okay.

174
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,472
So...

175
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,434
...why did I have to hide?
- I thought it was Ross.

176
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,395
I thought there was nothing
going on between you.

177
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,564
There isn't. There totally isn't.

178
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:39,319
You hear keys in the hall and you jump
like a bronco coming out of the chute.

179
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,782
I used to be a rodeo clown.

180
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,246
All right, look, Gavin...

181
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:55,711
...I guess I felt guilty
that you were here...

182
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,880
...which I shouldn't.

183
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,633
You know, Ross and I
are not in a relationship...

184
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,346
...but he is the father of my child.
And, you know...

185
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:10,142
...we do live together. And plus,
there's just so much history, you know?

186
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,228
It's just...
I don't know.

187
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:16,523
- I'm sorry. I'm just all over the place.
- It's okay.

188
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,652
It's probably not my place,
but can I give you a piece of advice?

189
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,281
- Yes.
- You should talk to Ross about all this.

190
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,785
People keep saying that.

191
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,122
I'm sorry, Gavin.

192
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,957
Don't be.

193
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,793
It's just bad timing.

194
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,255
So seriously, rodeo clown?

195
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,800
One of the best, ma'am.
One of the best.

196
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:15,916
Oh, she's my girlfriend.
That's not just how we do it here.

197
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,669
I'm gonna take a little break,
and when we come back...

198
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:22,214
...we've got Kenneth singing
"I Touch Myself."

199
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,550
I'm not here to judge.

200
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,224
- You have got to sing.
- No, I told you I can't.

201
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,894
But you would have so much fun.
And you have a really nice voice.

202
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:39,648
- When have you heard me sing?
- All the time, when you're cooking.

203
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,442
- What?
- Yeah, you're always singing:

204
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,402
"Yummy", "yummy", "yummy"
<i>I've got love in my tummy</i>

205
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,405
Yeah, I do rock that one.

206
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,786
Isn't there just a little part of you
that wants to get up there?

207
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:57,040
Just a little. But, God, it's so scary.

208
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,209
I don't even know what I would sing.

209
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:02,087
- Well, I've got a book around...
- "Delta Dawn."

210
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,059
Hi. I couldn't help but notice,
but that's an unusual necklace.

211
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,104
You already hit on me an hour ago.

212
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,442
Right. So that's a firm no?

213
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,244
I don't believe this.
I just keep striking out.

214
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,871
I don't get it either.

215
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,749
I mean, you're obviously desperate.

216
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,753
You're asking women
how they wanna be killed.

217
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,048
This is great.
Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys...

218
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:50,094
...until she finds the one she wants,
and I'm gonna die alone.

219
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:53,263
By drowning or...?

220
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,894
- Why would he break up with me?
- I don't know, sweetie.

221
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:03,357
All I ever wanted was to just love him
and have him love me back.

222
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:07,278
I mean, am I so unlovable?

223
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,572
- Wow.
- I know.

224
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,460
All right. That was Kenneth with his...

225
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:27,422
...much too literal rendition
of "I Touch Myself."

226
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,802
Coming up next, we've got Monica
singing "Delta Dawn."

227
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,889
Wait. I can't sing in
front of all these people.

228
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,474
Just pretend they're not
even here. It's okay.

229
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:42,312
Once that spotlight hits you, it's so
bright, you won't see anyone anyway.

230
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,611
Hi, I'm Monica. And I'm going
to be singing "Delta Dawn."

231
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:18,265
- Can you totally see through her shirt?
- Like an x-ray.

232
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:22,186
Bad day not to wear a bra.

233
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,118
I need your help.

234
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,246
Wow, it seems serious.

235
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:45,000
What seems to be the problem,
Ashley Judd?

236
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:49,171
I'm getting new headshots taken.
So I went to get my eyebrows shaped.

237
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,299
I'm sorry.
Moment to make fun of that, please.

238
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:57,137
I may be a sissy, but I'll still
pound you into the ground.

239
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:01,183
Look, it hurt so bad, I could only
let her do one eyebrow, and now...

240
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,103
...they don't match!

241
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:20,535
It's like a baby caterpillar
chasing its mama.

242
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,872
You got to help me out, okay?
Look, I have a magic marker.

243
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,000
Fill in the skinny one
so I don't look stupid for my pictures.

244
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,795
Okay, first of all, this is green.

245
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:33,048
- What the hell am I supposed to do?!
- I will help you out...

246
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:37,845
...but you have to promise you won't
tell anyone what I'm about to tell you.

247
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,639
What? What?

248
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,308
Okay.

249
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:45,602
You know how most kids get their
allowance from mowing the lawn...

250
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:50,357
...or taking out the garbage?
Well, I earned mine...

251
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:56,488
...by plucking the eyebrows of my father
and his "business partners."

252
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,911
Oh, my God.

253
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,665
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need
my help, "Victor% Victoria."

254
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,919
No, no, no. I do. I do.
I need your help.

255
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:13,756
But, Chandler, I don't know if I can take
any more plucking. It hurt so bad.

256
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:18,719
Not with my combination of ice cubes,
aloe vera and my gentle...

257
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:22,431
...self-loathing touch.

258
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,741
I'm sorry, the song's over.

259
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:46,288
- Did you see me up there?
- Every little bit of you.

260
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:51,126
I can't believe I sang
in front of people and they liked me.

261
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,921
Did you hear that guy shouting,
"Look at those tips"?

262
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,966
I mean, did I really help
you get a lot of tips?

263
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,259
Sure.

264
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:04,556
- Mon, not that you didn't sound good...
- Good?

265
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:08,185
Didn't you hear them? I was great!

266
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:13,023
Thank you so much for making me
do this. That is the best gift ever.

267
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,985
Also a good gift: Underwear.

268
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,366
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

269
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:26,661
Public bathrooms freak me out. I can't
even pee, let alone do anything else.

270
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,708
But what's great is, you don't
mind talking about it.

271
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:35,504
It is so amazing that I met you on the
same day that Eric broke up with me...

272
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,550
...because it's like, you lose a boyfriend,
and you get a boyfriend.

273
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:46,848
No, don't worry. This is not some
rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.

274
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,566
Good choice, Ross.

275
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,529
Hey. Hi. There you are.

276
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:04,324
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- Hello. Well, here I am.

277
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,494
My mom is not bringing
the baby back until 9:00.

278
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:12,207
So I was hoping you and I
could have a chance to kind of...

279
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,463
- Somebody here?
- Oh, yeah. That's Michelle.

280
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:20,799
- Who?
- Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.

281
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,679
- You've been seeing someone?
- Yeah, didn't I mention that?

282
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,766
I mean, we haven't been
going out too long...

283
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:32,811
...but there's this amazing
connection between us.

284
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:36,773
I mean, in fact just before you came in,
she called me her boyfriend.

285
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,986
I thought it was a little too soon,
but also, it felt kind of nice.

286
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:46,950
What are you taking amoxicillin for?

287
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:55,376
How great is this?
You're already comfortable enough...

288
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,253
...to look through my stuff.

289
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,881
I'm sorry, Michelle,
this is my roommate, Rachel.

290
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,174
And I'm also Emma's mother.

291
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:07,430
- Who's Emma?
- I told you about my daughter.

292
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,057
This is your daughter?

293
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,560
I could be your new mommy.

294
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:24,989
And done.

295
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,825
Oh, my God.

296
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,077
I didn't feel a thing.
Hey, are you still looking for a job?

297
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:34,831
Because you could tweeze circles
around that sadistic bitch at the salon.

298
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,462
- Thanks. Wanna see what it looks like?
- Yeah.

299
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:44,383
They totally match.
They look great.

300
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,720
They look great. How you doing?

301
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:52,183
Yeah, I think it looks pretty good.
I was a little worried I was...

302
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,102
...uncovering a birthmark
right about there...

303
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:58,355
...but it turned out to be
a little piece of chocolate.

304
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:01,108
- Chandler, thank you so much.
- No problem.

305
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:04,737
Listen, that was a pretty
girlie hour we just spent.

306
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,364
We should do something manly
to make up for it.

307
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,742
Yeah.

308
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:15,372
- Curl my eyelashes.
- Yeah!

309
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,422
For my next song, I think I'll sing
something a little more upbeat, all right?

310
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:27,593
How about the Pointer Sisters'
"I'm So Excited"?

311
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,095
And make it bouncy.

312
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:33,223
Well, you can probably take care of that
on your end.

313
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:38,145
I'm sorry I'm late. You'll understand
when you see Joey.

314
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:41,899
Honey, you're just in time.
I'm about to sing another song.

315
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,818
- Really? In front of all these people?
- And they love me.

316
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:49,239
- Oh, my God.
- She gives the people what they want.

317
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:51,950
All right, watch.

318
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:12,095
Are those my wife's nipples?

319
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:16,391
Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before.
I wouldn't have let her go up again.

320
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,519
I've got to stop this.

321
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:35,327
Who cares? They still love me.

322
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,293
You, touching yourself! Out!

323
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,175
Wow! She does that a lot.

324
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:55,180
Ross, you didn't tell me
you were a doctor.

325
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:58,517
Wait a minute. You haven't even
told her you are a doctor yet?

326
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,644
How long have you known her,
like an hour?

327
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:03,981
Actually, about an hour and a half.

328
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:08,735
I told you it wasn't long, but there's
an amazing connection between us.

329
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,238
You feel that too?

330
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:16,118
- I thought that that was just me.
- Are you kidding?

331
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:20,247
- Do you wanna go away this weekend?
- We'll see.

332
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,833
Ross, what's going on here?

333
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,961
Are we just bringing strange women
back to the apartment now?

334
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,672
I don't know. Are we just kissing
guys on balconies?

335
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,843
- How do you know about that?
- Through the magic of sight.

336
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:40,226
- I was here, putting our child to sleep...
- Emma.

337
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:45,397
When I looked through the window
and saw you kissing a guy...

338
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:47,566
...you've known for what, a week?

339
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:51,570
God, is that what this is all about?
You bring her up here to get back at me?

340
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,282
No, actually, see, I had to pee
because I can't use public bathrooms...

341
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:59,787
...because of the doody parasites.
- Okay, Michelle, it's time to go.

342
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:02,706
- Well, call me.
- Okay.

343
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,667
Wait, you don't have
my phone number.

344
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:08,045
You know what?
If it's meant to be, I'll guess it.

345
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,882
Bye-bye.

346
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:14,551
Score.

347
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,429
Did you not like her? Because I was
hoping we could come...

348
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:19,640
...to your kissing parties
on the balcony.

349
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:23,393
I can't believe you are making a big deal
about this. It was one kiss!

350
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,188
- One guy. One time!
- Oh, really?

351
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,024
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

352
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,569
Oh, yeah.

353
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,531
- What about the guy from the bar?
- Who?

354
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,867
The guy you gave your number to.

355
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:43,330
- How do you know about that?
- Because he called here looking for you.

356
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:47,626
So don't tell me kissing this guy
from work is a one-time thing.

357
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:51,130
Because you've been out there
in bars and on balconies...

358
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:55,467
...for over a month now. And you
don't even have the courtesy to tell me.

359
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:59,179
- Why didn't I get that message?
- What?

360
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:03,141
From the guy in the bar?
Why didn't I get that message?

361
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,520
Because I folded it up
and put it in my pants pocket.

362
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:09,857
Do you not look there?

363
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,360
Ross.

364
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,574
I never gave it to you.

365
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,450
Why?

366
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,829
- I don't know.
- Oh, God, you know what? I don't...

367
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,750
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to decide...

368
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,836
...what messages
I should or should not get?!

369
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,964
Who am I? I'm the guy
who's taking care of our baby...

370
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:37,426
...while you're at bars meeting guys!
- I cannot believe you.

371
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:41,806
I actually came in here hoping to have
a mature conversation about us.

372
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,558
But I can't do that with someone
who hides my messages...

373
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,561
...and brings crazy women
back to my apartment!

374
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:52,065
Hey, none of the sane ones
wanted to come back with me!

375
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,779
That's not the point, okay?
The point is...

376
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:01,992
...you are the one who moved on
and didn't tell anyone.

377
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:06,330
Oh, God, Ross,
this is just so messed up.

378
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:10,625
What is wrong with us? When people
hear about our situation, they ask:

379
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:13,837
"You live together, but you're not
a couple, yet you have a baby?

380
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:18,175
Isn't that weird?" And I say,
"No. It's not, because it works for us."

381
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,302
But you know what?
This doesn't work.

382
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:24,598
- In fact, this is the opposite of working.
- Clearly.

383
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,060
And you know...

384
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:31,939
...we said that we would live together
as long as this makes sense...

385
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:36,484
...and maybe this
just doesn't make sense anymore.

386
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,531
Yeah, maybe not.

387
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,243
So, what do you wanna do?

388
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,249
Hi.

389
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,877
Can Emma and I live here for a while?

390
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,463
God.

391
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:01,051
- Of course.
- Thank you.

392
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:08,058
Your eyebrows look weird.

393
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,253
So you'll just touch yourself
for anything, then?

394
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,468
