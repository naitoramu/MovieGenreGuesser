1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,427
Hello!

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,970
What's this?

3
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:16,767
Oh, right!
It's that girl's phone number.

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,062
There it is.
Just a phone number...

5
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:25,692
...a really hot girl gave me.

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:31,532
No big deal. I mean,
it is her home phone number but...

7
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,334
Almost lost this baby!

8
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:48,632
The lovely Amanda gives me her number,
and I go and drop it.

9
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,892
Thank you.

10
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:02,021
The One with
Joey's New Girlfriend

11
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,361
- When's your birthday?
- May 5th. Why?

12
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,864
I'm making a list of birthdays.

13
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,285
- Mine's December...
- Yeah, whatever.

14
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,623
She's pretty!

15
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:07,419
Pretty, pretty girl. The pretty...
She's pretty.

16
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,713
Go ask her out.

17
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,675
- What's the worst that could happen?
- I could die.

18
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,262
Yeah, it's tough being single.

19
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:20,766
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.

20
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,268
Ross, you guys went out once.

21
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,358
You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese,
and you didn't even kiss her.

22
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,779
I tell people secrets.

23
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,074
It makes them like me.

24
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,913
Phoebe.

25
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,333
You're sick.
You shouldn't play. Go home.

26
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,210
But I'm unemployed.

27
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,004
My music is all I really have now.

28
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:56,677
Well, music and making my own shoes.
Pretty, huh?

29
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,848
All right, I'll do it.

30
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,310
I'll go get shot down.

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,728
Any advice?

32
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,354
Just be yourself...

33
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,066
...but not too much.

34
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,902
Wish me luck.

35
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,112
Good luck!

36
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,076
Wish it!

37
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,205
I was just sitting over there and...

38
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,624
My name's Chandler.
Did I say that?

39
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,002
No, you didn't.
Hi, I'm Kathy.

40
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:34,631
- Kathy with a "K" or a "C"?
- With a "K".

41
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,344
Wow, you are really good at this!

42
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,304
I'm out on a limb here!

43
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,431
I'm sorry.
You're right.

44
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,309
But I should tell you
I'm waiting for a date.

45
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:49,438
And there he is now!

46
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,318
I see you guys already met.

47
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,528
I was trying to demonstrate...

48
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,197
...how I could get my
very large feet...

49
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,409
...into my even bigger mouth.

50
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,619
Didn't I tell you?

51
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,415
Always showing off.

52
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,710
Before I start, I want to say
that I have a cold.

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,047
So if I sneeze during a song,
it's not on purpose.

54
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,928
Except the last verse of
"Pepper People".

55
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:26,808
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

56
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:30,688
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

57
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,983
This chick sounds good.

58
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,736
<i>Smelly cat</i>

59
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:41,990
Gunther, be a good little boy
and bring me a whiskey.

60
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,752
At 2:30 a.m., I didn't expect
to fight over the remote.

61
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,672
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs
thing I wanted to watch.

62
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,550
That's why I got up too.

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,095
You're kidding?
I love him!

64
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:08,142
Sorry about this afternoon.
If I'd known, I wouldn't have...

65
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,978
Oh, please.

66
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,731
Joey tells me you two met
in acting class.

67
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,902
We were partners.
Joey picked three scenes for us.

68
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,862
All of them had us making out.

69
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:26,535
That's good, because he used to
make me rehearse with him.

70
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,578
Is it on?

71
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:33,083
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!

72
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,880
Oh, my God!

73
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,549
It's on!

74
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,516
Here we go, little fella.

75
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,934
What about the duck?

76
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,563
The duck can swim.

77
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,859
<i>My sticky shoes</i>

78
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,863
<i>My sticky, sticky shoes</i>

79
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,574
<i>Why you stick on me?</i>

80
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,244
<i>Baby</i>

81
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,623
Thanks for the lights, honey.

82
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,794
Way to go!

83
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,963
Your cold makes you sound great.

84
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:24,385
It's fun.
God, I love how sexy I am!

85
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,432
Kath, we should get going.
We're going to buy hamsters.

86
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,808
I love them.

87
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:37,940
No, it's not like that.
I work for a medical researcher.

88
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,359
Have fun.

89
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,279
It's nice that
the medical community...

90
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,116
...is trying to help sick hamsters.

91
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,410
You know what?
I like Kathy.

92
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,622
Me too!
She's so cool and pretty.

93
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,873
She is.

94
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,292
She's smart and funny.

95
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:01,797
We were up all last night talking.
She said the funniest thing about...

96
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,132
What?

97
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,303
You love her.

98
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:08,554
No, I don't.

99
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,766
Yes, you do.
Chandler loves Kathy.

100
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,687
- Come on, just lay off him.
- Thank you.

101
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:21,024
He's a little sensitive right now
because he's so in love!

102
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,028
All right.

103
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,241
Kathy, I love you!

104
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,338
I need to write some depressing stuff
for my new bluesy voice.

105
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,007
But nothing sad has
ever happened to me.

106
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,301
How about your mom dying?

107
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:51,847
Or living on the streets
when you were 14?

108
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:58,479
I could write about when
my hair did that woo-hoo thing.

109
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,610
I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.

110
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,030
Rachel's not here.

111
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,116
How's it going with her?

112
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,203
Great, actually. I'm thinking
tonight may be the night.

113
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:19,249
The kids will play together,
and when they're asleep...

114
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,377
...Amanda and I break
open a bottle of wine...

115
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:27,174
...do a little playing ourselves.

116
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,719
Hi, guys! This is Josh.

117
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,512
Josh, these are my friends.

118
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,975
And that's Ross.

119
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,186
Dudes.

120
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,729
You played in college?

121
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,609
I still do.
Next year, I hope to make varsity.

122
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,737
Didn't you play soccer
in high school?

123
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:53,783
No, wait. You organized their
game schedules on your Commodore 64.

124
00:08:54,034 --> 00:09:00,165
It's getting late. I got to get
to the game, so I'll... head.

125
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,462
I'll miss you.

126
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,506
Dope!

127
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,137
Wow! Cute one.

128
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,639
- Very cute.
- I know. Isn't he great?

129
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,310
So nice to finally be in a
fun relationship, you know?

130
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,772
There's nothing boring about him.

131
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,232
I bet he's never set foot
in a museum.

132
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,234
Maybe he'll get to go soon.

133
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,530
Like on a class trip or something.

134
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,283
You know what else is
great about him?

135
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,410
What's the word for an adult...

136
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,831
...who has no dinosaur toys
in their bedroom?

137
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,003
What was that?

138
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,380
Monica knows.

139
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,175
It's this dumb thing Ross made up
to fool our parents.

140
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:57,514
It's a way of giving the finger
without actually giving it.

141
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,475
I cried the night you made that up.

142
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:05,606
It was the first time I realized
I was cooler than my big brother.

143
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:10,652
I'm going to go get ready...

144
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,366
...for my date tonight...

145
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,912
...so I'll just "head".

146
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:26,084
I should go too.
I'm playing in one hour.

147
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,296
You guys should come hear me.

148
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,423
Hear me.

149
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,510
<i>My sticky shoes</i>

150
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:41,183
I lost my sexy phlegm!

151
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,314
Hi, Ben.

152
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,485
- You look great!
- Thanks.

153
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,237
Hey, Tommy!

154
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,739
I'm so glad you could come tonight.

155
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,659
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.

156
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,995
My cell phone number
is on the counter.

157
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,498
Help yourself to the fridge.

158
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,793
I appreciate this.
I've been trying to date...

159
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,129
...this guy for a month.

160
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,132
I'd appreciate it
if you'd drink your wine...

161
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:18,220
...after the kids are asleep.

162
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:27,646
Thanks for this. I hope I can do
the same for you sometime.

163
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:37,614
Who wants to make
some long-distance calls?

164
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:31,335
Chandler, what are you doing here?

165
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,838
I just wanted to say, "hey!"

166
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,809
You're making it sound
worse than it was.

167
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,854
Her date tipped me $10!

168
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,359
What are you doing?

169
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,029
I want to be sexy again,
so I'm trying to catch a cold.

170
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,406
Should be easy.
They're pretty common.

171
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:05,411
You'll catch pneumonia!

172
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,332
You were right.
I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.

173
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,042
- What?
- Are you serious?

174
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,503
How's that possible?
You barely know her.

175
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,505
I don't know. I just...

176
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,007
I can't get her out of my head.

177
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:22,386
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.

178
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:26,140
I'm a horrible person.

179
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:30,603
"No, you're not.
We still love you, Chandler!"

180
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,607
Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.

181
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:39,612
You mean you stole it!

182
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:44,574
Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!

183
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,454
We were just talking about you.

184
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,415
Really?

185
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,168
The time you got drunk
and fell asleep...

186
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,755
...with your head in the toilet.

187
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,632
Right in there!

188
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,721
Ninety-nine...

189
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:10,684
...a hundred.
Ready or not, here I come!

190
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:16,148
Let's go over the concept
one more time.

191
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:21,695
You want to get some dinner
with me and Kathy tonight?

192
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,240
You know what?
I already ate.

193
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,866
It's 4:30.

194
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,328
I had a big meal on Monday.

195
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,456
So that'll get me
straight through the week.

196
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:37,127
I see what's going on here.

197
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,005
You do?

198
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,715
You don't like Kathy.

199
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,009
You got me.

200
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,970
You've been avoiding her
since we started dating.

201
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,390
I made an effort to like Janice.

202
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,103
Now you make an effort to like Kathy
by going out with us. Right?

203
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,229
Yeah, right.

204
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,357
Good. And hey, my treat.

205
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,400
Because you're not eating, right?

206
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,028
Right.

207
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,743
Ross isn't here.

208
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,621
Stop it!

209
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,166
I'll see you at the party?

210
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:21,379
Beer's fear, man! 24/7!

211
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,762
I am so going to marry that guy.

212
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:31,515
What?

213
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,850
I think he's stealing from me.

214
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:34,935
Why?

215
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,605
Because he's stealing from me!

216
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,274
Hi, it's me.

217
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:41,650
And soup.

218
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,905
I saw Josh. He looked yummy
in your leather jacket.

219
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,745
I don't eat chicken,
so it's just noodle soup.

220
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:59,960
There's no chicken in the broth,
so it's really noodle water.

221
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:04,131
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

222
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,008
What are you doing?

223
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:10,637
I need your germs.
I want my cold back.

224
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,765
I miss my sexy voice.

225
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,934
Sorry, Phoebe.

226
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,811
It's okay.

227
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,188
How's the soup?

228
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,582
Check it out!
You can see that girl's underwear.

229
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,792
Is she great, or what?

230
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,338
What do you think?

231
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,215
She's not really my type.

232
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:49,551
Not your type?
She's gorgeous.

233
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,804
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.

234
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:56,308
Whenever I see a girl in those,
it reminds me of...

235
00:16:56,558 --> 00:17:00,103
...my father in fishnet stockings.

236
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:03,690
Understanding a little more of
why you're single.

237
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:07,570
I have a friend you'd like.
We could double date.

238
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,863
No, thanks.

239
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:15,327
I've got some ugly friends
who are available too.

240
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,538
I'm going to grab a beer.

241
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,291
I'll be right back.

242
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,507
What was that?

243
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,802
Kathy's being really nice
and you walked away.

244
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,845
What do you want from me?

245
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,723
I want you to like her.

246
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:40,144
If that's too damn difficult,
then at least you could pretend.

247
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,395
I am pretending.

248
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,355
Then do it better.

249
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:47,317
What do you say, I go tell her
how much I like her?

250
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,987
I could tell her
I've been thinking of her.

251
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,573
I haven't stopped thinking
of her since we met.

252
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,743
I'm so over-the-top,
want-to-slit-my-own-throat...

253
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,954
...in love with her,
that every minute...

254
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:03,458
...I can't believe my own damn bad luck
that you met her first!

255
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,545
That's pretty good.

256
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:12,593
But you might want
to tone it down a little.

257
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,475
Amanda just dropped me off.

258
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,312
That's one of the things
I love about her.

259
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:27,107
She's old enough to drive.

260
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,694
You're not going
to Mom and Dad's tonight?

261
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,154
No. Sorry.

262
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,947
Where's Amanda?

263
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,700
Get me some cough drops.

264
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,201
I'm thinking you could bring her...

265
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:42,790
...and go to your old room
and not make out.

266
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,416
Cough drop, please?

267
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,960
At least she's not
going out with me...

268
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:50,756
...to get into R-rated movies.

269
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,966
Why don't you marry her?

270
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:58,431
Wait, you can't! I forgot.
She's not a lesbian.

271
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:00,933
Amanda and I...

272
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,935
You have nothing!

273
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,814
You're not even going out!
You're her babysitter.

274
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:11,610
You have a 12-year-old girl's job!

275
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:20,995
Oh, that is so sad.

276
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,915
What are you laughing at,
Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...

277
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,293
...- is-stealing-from me?

278
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,964
So he stole a few bucks.
Big deal!

279
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,007
He got me something with it.

280
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:37,470
That's mine!

281
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:42,558
Would you both please
start acting like adults?

282
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:46,854
And give me my cough drops!

283
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,981
- Fine.
- Sorry.

284
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,107
Here.

285
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,110
Thank you.

286
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:58,531
At least I made $10 in my relationship.

287
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,868
You know...

288
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,835
<i>Parading goats are parading</i>

289
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:12,671
<i>Parading down the street</i>

290
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,590
<i>Parading goats are parading</i>

291
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:19,428
<i>Leaving little treats</i>

292
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,431
Does it even work
without my sexy voice?

293
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,642
I like it.

294
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,186
Gunther, kiss me.

295
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,813
What?

296
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,989
<i>Do it, Deputy!</i>
<i>Do something!</i>

297
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:55,255
We aren't exactly sleeping in here,
but do you mind?

298
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:05,683
Can I sleep on your couch?

299
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,403
<i>And I'm still waiting</i>

300
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,620
Thank you, my babies.

301
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:38,131
Did you hear what happened
between me and Phoebe?

302
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:43,554
We kissed. I didn't initiate it,
but I also didn't stop it.

303
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,890
I've been feeling guilty.

304
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,354
So...

305
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,148
...are we cool?

306
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:03,448
I knew you would understand.
