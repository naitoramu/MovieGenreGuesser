1
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,632
Have you seen our bank statement?
Can this be right?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,594
I know. God, I haven't seen
my savings take a hit like this...

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:15,348
...since I was a kid and they came up
with Double Stuf Oreos.

4
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:19,353
- What happened to all of our money?
- I'm not sure exactly what they did...

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,189
...but I'm inclined to blame Enron.

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,778
With you doing the internship, we're
spending more than we're bringing in.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,490
Yeah, maybe I should quit
and get a job that pays.

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,285
But you're finally doing something
that you love.

9
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,871
I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,210
Although it would be nice if the thing
that you loved was finding gold.

11
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,171
You know, I think we're making
too big a deal out of this.

12
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:50,259
We'll pay our bills late this month. Next
month we'll cut back on a few things.

13
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:54,679
And maybe we start eating
out of Joey's refrigerator for a change.

14
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:58,976
You're a chef. What can you make
out of baking soda and beer?

15
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,145
Worst-case scenario is, we borrow
some money from my parents.

16
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,105
No, we're not borrowing money.

17
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:07,234
- Why not?
- We don't do that. We are Bings.

18
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,905
If there's one thing my father
taught me, it was...

19
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:16,910
...well, to always knock
before going into the pool house.

20
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,832
- The other thing is, never borrow money.
- I had no idea you had this much pride.

21
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,836
That's right, I do. I am your man.
I'm gonna get us through this situation...

22
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,507
...even if it means you working
twice as hard.

23
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,927

26
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,340
- I'm gonna go.
- Why?

27
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,510
I haven't been home in days,
and I need to get more clothes.

28
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,512
You don't have to go.
I have something that'll fit you.

29
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,767
I put that tube top on as a joke.

30
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,604
- I want you to stay.
- I want to stay too.

31
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,315
But I've got as much use
out of these boxers as I can.

32
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,734
- Why don't you turn them inside...
- Done it.

33
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,530
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- All right. I'll miss you.

34
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,950
Me too.

35
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:45,541
You know what? I just realized
something. I don't want to go home.

36
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:50,045
- Great! Okay, I'll go get the tube top.
- No, no, what I mean is...

37
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,048
...I hate going back
to my apartment now.

38
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:57,428
Partly because I live above
a known crack den...

39
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,806
...but, you know, mostly because
when I'm there, I really miss you.

40
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,769
So...

41
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,188
...do you want to move in together?

42
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,358
Wow, Mike Hanigan...

43
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,737
...you sure know how to
make a girl say "Hell, yeah."

44
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,949
- So we're doing it?
- Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.

45
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,662
- We're really gonna move in together?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,167
I've always wanted to live with a guy.

47
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,086
Pick up your socks.
Put down the toilet seat.

48
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,840
No, we are not having sex anymore.

49
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,717
It's gonna be fun.

50
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,347
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

51
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,226
Listen, I need to know
that what I'm about to ask you...

52
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,022
...will never get back to Chandler.

53
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:56,904
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
thought about it myself.

54
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,659
But Chandler is my best friend.
It would be wrong.

55
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,912
Good, but wrong.

56
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,668
Okay, first of all, it would be great.

57
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,171
But that's not what I'm here to talk
to you about. I need to borrow money.

58
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,633
Oh, I don't know, Monica.
You know...

59
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,759
...lending friends money
is always a mistake.

60
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,264
- But Chandler lent you money.
- And he would tell you it was a mistake.

61
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,018
Come on, I just... I need it
for some rent and some other bills.

62
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,313
Well, how much?

63
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,358
- Two thousand dollars?
- Two thousand dollars?

64
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:38,112
What do you think I am,
a soap opera star?

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,031
- Yeah.
- That's right, I am.

66
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,994
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

67
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,540
- What's in the bag?
- You know how Emma started crawling?

68
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,627
I realized that this place
is very unsafe for a baby...

69
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:57,757
...so I went to the store and I got some
stuff to baby-proof the apartment.

70
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,925
Oh, God, baby-proofing.

71
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,595
Why is it such a big deal now?
You know, when I was a kid, it was like:

72
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,057
"Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs."

73
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:11,395
Or, "Whoops, Joey electrocuted
himself again."

74
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,149
Anyway, are you going to get
a handyman to install this stuff?

75
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,862
No, I was just gonna do it myself.

76
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,991
- You're gonna do it?
- Yeah. Why?

77
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,954
- You don't think a woman can do this?
- Women can. You can't.

78
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,251
Monica, will you please tell Joey
that he is a pig.

79
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,173
- You're a pig. And you can't do this.
- What?

80
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,843
What? Come on, I found
the hardware store all by myself.

81
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,886
The store's right down the street.

82
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:48,641
There is a hardware store
right down the street?

83
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,396
Hey, you guys?
Okay, we've got great news.

84
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:58,025
- Phoebe and I are moving in together.
- Congratulations.

85
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,696
I know, it's so exciting. You know,
I've never lived with a guy before.

86
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,866
Well, it's just like living with a girl,
only they don't steal your makeup.

87
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,411
Unless they're playing "This Is What
My Sister Would Look Like."

88
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,873
Yeah, she's not so cute.

89
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,793
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Well, you put down the toilet seat.

90
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,962
Yes, dear.

91
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,383
- Is that a bit you guys do?
- Uh-huh. We're playing you two.

92
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,931
We don't do that.
Tell her we don't do that.

93
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,351
Yes, dear.

94
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,812
I can't believe you're moving in
together. I'm happy for you guys.

95
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,107
- I hear wedding bells.
- Monica, slow down, okay?

96
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,943
I'm just excited to be living with him.

97
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,070
You know, I mean, I don't know...

98
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,699
...can I see someday being
married to Mike? Sure. Yeah.

99
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,286
I could picture myself walking down
the aisle in a wedding dress...

100
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,999
...that highlights my breasts
in an obvious yet classy way.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,961
But do I want that house in Connecticut
near the good schools...

102
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:04,758
...where Mike and I could send
little Sophie and Mike Jr.?

103
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,677
Oh, my God, I do.

104
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:11,807
- I had no idea you were so conventional.
- I know. I guess I am.

105
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,685
Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,
I want to be a soccer mom.

106
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,440
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, you bet, roomie.

107
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,902
Don't you mean "groomie"?

108
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,573
- What are you talking about?
- Please.

109
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:32,577
We haven't even moved in yet, and
they have us picking out china patterns.

110
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,546
China patterns!

111
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,301
This is easy. "Can't do this..."

112
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,685
Wow, seriously. Can't do this.

113
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,108
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey.

114
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,570
Listen, I need to ask you a favor, and
we can't tell Monica anything about it.

115
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:12,242
- I thought you guys didn't have secrets.
- That will remain the official party line.

116
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,498
Look, Monica and I are having
a little financial trouble.

117
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,376
- Yeah, I know.
- What? What do you mean, you "know"?

118
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,839
I just figured it out, you know?

119
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:30,594
I mean, you're not working,
and the economy is bad.

120
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,220
Oh, right.

121
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,682
That is the fastest I have ever thought.

122
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,561
Anyway...

123
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,648
...I need to borrow some money.

124
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,609
Oh, sure. Yeah, how much?
Two thousand dollars?

125
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,864
Yes, $2000 exactly.
How did you know that?

126
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:58,747
I know how much you used to make,
and I know how much your rent is.

127
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,625
Oh, okay.

128
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,128
I am on fire.

129
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:08,424
Listen, this is really nice.

130
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,886
Did you write a check to Monica
for $2000?

131
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,680
Did Monica borrow money from you?

132
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,309
- Kind of.
- I can't believe her.

133
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,603
Did she tell you we were having
money problems?

134
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,732
No, no, no. It wasn't because
of your money problems.

135
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,943
It was for something for her.

136
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,778
What?

137
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,071
Something personal.

138
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,324
What would she get for $2000
that she wouldn't tell me about?

139
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,742
Excuse me.

140
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,622
Boob job.

141
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,917
I don't want her to get a boob job.
That's crazy.

142
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,004
Well, it's not that crazy, okay?

143
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:50,675
Making them smaller,
that would be crazy.

144
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:56,722
Oh, hey, I wanted to ask you
about Monica's little "groomie" joke.

145
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,767
Well, I think the reason people laughed
is that it's a play on the word "roomie."

146
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:08,317
I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.

147
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,153
No, the thing I want to say is...

148
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,031
Maybe we should've
talked about this before.

149
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,494
Us living together,
you're not expecting a proposal, right?

150
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,497
- Oh, no, no. Not at all.
- Okay.

151
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:26,126
We're just moving in right now.
We'll see where it goes.

152
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,714
Yeah, well, that's the thing.
For me, it's as far as it can ever go.

153
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,969
- What do you mean?
- Look, Phoebe, I...

154
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:39,598
I love you very much.
But I never want to get married again.

155
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,230
- Wow.
- It's just, my first marriage was...

156
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:50,692
...you know, such a disaster that
I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.

157
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,195
- Was it that bad?
- At one point, near the end...

158
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:57,700
...she deliberately defecated on my...
- Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.

159
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:03,288
But don't you think it might be
different with someone else? Perhaps...

160
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,166
...a blond who always
uses the toilet?

161
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,880
Except for once in the ocean.

162
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,716
Look, it's not about who I would marry.

163
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,387
I was certain the first time I got married
it'd last forever. I was wrong.

164
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,306
- But, it just...
- Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.

165
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,767
I just never want to get married again.

166
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,481
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:33,569
Are you okay with that? If not, maybe
us moving in together isn't the best idea.

168
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,238
No. Oh, I definitely don't
want to get married.

169
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:41,243
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't want to, too.

170
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,414
Because if we move in
and you start changing your mind...

171
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,458
...there is gonna be
hell to pay, mister.

172
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,128
- Trust me. I will never...
- Yeah, I get that. Yeah.

173
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,972
Hi. So you gave in
and decided to call someone?

174
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:06,477
Yeah. I don't know who I was kidding.
I can barely use chopsticks.

175
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,688
- You're all set.
- Oh, thank you so much.

176
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,191
Wait. You forgot your...

177
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,734
...game.

178
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,528
Thank you.

179
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,785
Hey, Rach. There she is,
my perfectly proportioned wife.

180
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,665
Don't look at me.
I never get his jokes.

181
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,961
- Thank you?
- No, no. Don't thank me.

182
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,048
Thank you. Do you know there is not
one thing I would change about you?

183
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,551
Not one single thing.
And definitely not...

184
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,095
...two single things.

185
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:47,434
Okay, you're being weird. Do you want
sex, or did you do something bad?

186
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:51,313
No. No. No. I just love
the way you look. I am warm...

187
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,274
...for your form.

188
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,154
Okay, you know the old classics like,
you know, "You look nice"?

189
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,405
They're still okay.

190
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,034
But "you look nice" could mean
that I'm saying, "Your face looks nice."

191
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,745
I want to compliment your body.

192
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,332
I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.

193
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:14,253
And more specifically, I wouldn't
want anything to get any bigger.

194
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,963
- Okay.
- I mean...

195
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,258
...you wouldn't want any part of me
to get any bigger, would you?

196
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,597
Don't answer that.

197
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,895
Just when you thought that dude
couldn't get any weirder.

198
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,816
Why do you think he was so worried
about me getting bigger?

199
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,194
I don't know.
I mean, what brought that on?

200
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,281
Oh, my God. You know what,
we're trying to get pregnant...

201
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,784
...so he's probably starting to freak out
that my body's gonna change.

202
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,412
- You think that's what it is?
- You heard him.

203
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,540
"No bigger. You're perfect.
Just don't get any bigger."

204
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:56,128
My God, he sounded just like
my high-school wrestling coach.

205
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,633
- I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.
- Yeah. If you don't, I will.

206
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,596
Of course your body's gonna change.
Your breasts are gonna get bigger...

207
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,056
...your ass is gonna get bigger...

208
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,185
...you're gonna lose bladder control.

209
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,149
God, it's just such a magical time.

210
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,034
Hi. Listen, I wanted to ask you
something about marriage.

211
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,119
Now you're seeking me out
to make jokes?

212
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:33,207
I mean, I can see if we're all hanging
out, but to come to my home...

213
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,834
No, I really want to know
how you feel about it.

214
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:39,713
- Why?
- Mike doesn't ever want to get married.

215
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,424
- Never?
- Never.

216
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:45,844
Wow. Are you still gonna
move in with him?

217
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:50,807
I want to, but I wanted you to tell me
that marriage really isn't that big a deal.

218
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:55,353
You know, that I won't be missing out
on anything. That marriage stinks.

219
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,149
Yeah, marriage stinks.

220
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:04,404
I mean, if you want to see a man gain
weight and a woman stop shaving...

221
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,282
...get them married.

222
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,535
- That's not how you really feel, is it?
- No, I'm sorry.

223
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:16,291
I know it's not what you want to hear,
but I can't help it. I love marriage.

224
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,753
Seriously, you?
"Divorce-o"?

225
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:24,758
If you have to call me a name, I'd prefer
"Ross, the Divorcer." It's just cooler.

226
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:30,014
Look, I know my marriages
didn't exactly work out...

227
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:33,392
...but, you know, I loved being
that committed to another person.

228
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,437
And Carol and I had some good times
before she became a lesbian.

229
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,357
And once afterward.

230
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,818
Anyway, I'm sorry.

231
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,403
It's okay. That's how you feel.

232
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,616
But, come on, I mean,
living together will be great.

233
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,619
I mean, you guys have so much fun.
And you love Mike.

234
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,456
- I do love Mike.
- Yeah, see?

235
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,959
And you were so excited about
moving in together before...

236
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,629
...and you know what, you should be.
It's a big deal.

237
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,424
Yeah, I guess you're right.

238
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,718
Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.

239
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,512
The Divorcer to the rescue.

240
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,266
- It's not cooler.
- Yeah, I just heard it.

241
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,114
Rach?

242
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,125
Rachel?!

243
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:55,850
So I can't do anything I like?!

244
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,852
Hey, Rach.

245
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,773
Perfection.
Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.

246
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,941
- Honey?
- Yeah?

247
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,443
About that.

248
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,823
- I'm going to change.
- Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.

249
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,076
I'm gonna get bigger.

250
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,702
Honey, I...

251
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,872
I love your breasts the way they are.

252
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,750
Fascist.

253
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,337
My breasts are gonna get bigger
whether you like it or not.

254
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:29,007
And it's not just my breasts.
My ass is gonna get bigger too.

255
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,802
Your ass?!

256
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,806
And don't be surprised if her hands
and her feet get bigger too.

257
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,435
- They do that?
- It's kind of a package deal.

258
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,148
God, why? Why would you want to
do that to yourself?

259
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,110
I thought it was something
that we both wanted.

260
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,280
If it means that much to you, I may be
able to get onboard with the boobs...

261
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:56,117
...but the giant ass
and the big clown feet?

262
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,870
Oh, my God, Chandler.

263
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,123
If you can't handle this,
what will you be like in the hospital...

264
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:06,504
...with the blood and screaming and the
little person that's shooting out of her?

265
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,757
What?

266
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:21,601
Joey, why did you tell Chandler
that Monica was getting a boob job?

267
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,480
Because she is.

268
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:28,525
- Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
- For your boob job.

269
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,527
- Joe...
- It's over.

270
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:35,866
Okay, so I'm out $4000 and
nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?

271
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:44,792
Hey. Hey, what do you guys think
about this: Ross, the Divorce Force.

272
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,836
- Better.
- Yeah?

273
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,089
Very cool.

274
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:55,552
Hey, Pheebs? You know, I'm really glad
you came to talk to me the other day...

275
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,764
...and I hope I was a little helpful.
- Yeah, you were helpful.

276
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,724
- Yeah. No, thank you.
- Good. Good.

277
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:04,270
Because the more I thought about it,
the more I realized...

278
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:08,106
...I don't think marriage is necessarily
the right path for you.

279
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,482
What do you mean?

280
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,735
I know the other day
in the coffeehouse...

281
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:15,030
...you were all caught up
in the whole soccer-mom thing...

282
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:19,452
...but is that really you? I mean, can you
honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?

283
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,371
They are awfully boxy.

284
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:29,378
I mean, I don't know, you'd be so bored
with marriage. I mean, it's so normal.

285
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,714
Yeah.

286
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,466
Hey, can I help?

287
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:38,220
Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,
maneuvered a narrow hallway...

288
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:42,725
...dodged a rabid pit bull. But these last
three feet are where it gets really tricky.

289
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,981
You know, sometimes your words,
they hurt.

290
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,735
Hey, where do you guys want this?

291
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,571
Yeah, seriously,
because this is really heavy.

292
00:19:55,737 --> 00:20:00,158
I mean, not for me, because I'm only
pretending to hold it, but for these guys.

293
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:07,832
Just one last time on the marriage thing.
There's no wiggle room? None at all?

294
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,127
No, but you don't want to
get married either, right?

295
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,546
Right.

296
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,131
Except that I do want to get married.

297
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,426
Couldn't have had this conversation
down at the truck, huh?

298
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,346
What? You want to get married?

299
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,181
Someday.

300
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,643
And... hernia.

301
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:34,110
I haven't had a normal life. And I never
felt like I was missing out on anything.

302
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:38,697
But it feels like now it's my turn
to have some of the regular stuff.

303
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,284
Why didn't you say something before?

304
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:47,038
I didn't know how much I wanted it. And
I love you, and I wanted to live with you.

305
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,708
I want to live with you too.
I mean, let's do that.

306
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,961
But I don't think I can.

307
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:56,090
It was okay to move in when
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

308
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,760
But I can't move in knowing nothing
is ever gonna happen.

309
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,556
Can we at least try living together? You
might change your mind about marriage.

310
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:07,726
Are you gonna change yours?

311
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,354
No.

312
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,106
Me neither.

313
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:21,907
I think I need to be with someone
who wants what I want.

314
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,120
But I don't want this to end.

315
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,247
No, I don't want it to end either.

316
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,420
I can't believe this is gonna end.

317
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,300
I guess I'll have my stuff picked up.

318
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,220
Yeah. Okay.

319
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,684
Okay, so...

320
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,950
Goodbye.

321
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,913
- Take it easy, Mike.
- Bye, Mike.

322
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,460
I'm so sorry, Pheebs.

323
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:18,338
We're all sorry.

324
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:26,346
Look on the bright side. At least you
won't have to live with this ugly chair.

325
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,891
That was here already, huh?

326
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,519
I love you.

327
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,158
I did it! I did it!

328
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,328
All right.

329
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:56,752
I'd better take all I can carry.

330
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,340
Who knows when I'll be able
to get in here again, huh?

331
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:08,805
