00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:43,804
- It's a new corporate policy.

165
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:46,645
- Dunh-duh-na-dah!

166
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:49,407
- Is this job really about
the money for you, Jim?

167
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:52,249
I mean, isn't this
where you fell in love?

168
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:54,289
- A commission cap takes away
my incentive to sell.

169
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,812
So you realize I now have
no reason to work, right?

170
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:59,733
- When you're dealing
with a large organization,

171
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,013
sometimes you have to put up
with policies you don't like.

172
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:05,976
I wish my gym didn't allow full
nudity in the locker room.

173
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,256
Okay, seeing these old guys
walking around naked

174
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:10,539
feels almost passive-aggressive.

175
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,019
But I deal with it.

176
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,621
'cause it's policy.
See what I mean?

177
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:14,620
- Nope.

178
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,141
- Nudity makes me uncomfortable.
- Okay.

179
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:18,221
- My gym allows it.

180
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:19,822
I wish they didn't,
but it's policy.

181
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:22,105
So I respect it,
and I just--

182
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:24,866
keep a low--you know,
I look away.

183
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,945
Think about your commission cap

184
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:32,069
as a naked old man
in a gym locker room.

185
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:33,270
- Excuse me, everyone.

186
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,589
Sex!

187
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:36,752
Now that I have
your attention...

188
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:38,272
- you don't have our attention.

189
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,274
- Money!

190
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,753
- I'm listening.

191
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:41,875
- You had me at "sex."

192
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:42,875
- Pervert.

193
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,875
- You have all of our attention

194
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,156
just by screaming anything.

195
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,277
- That's good to know.

196
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:47,878
[screams]

197
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:48,878
- What do you want
to say, Michael?

198
00:06:48,878 --> 00:06:51,279
- Wuphf!

199
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,519
All right,
I've warmed them up for you.

200
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,601
You have the floor, Ryan.

201
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,402
- How's everybody doing?
- Whoo!

202
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:57,842
- Good!

203
00:06:57,842 --> 00:06:58,923
Now, a lot of you have already
staked out

204
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:00,643
your corner of the wuphf empire.

205
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:05,047
Raise your hand
if I'm describing you.

206
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:06,326
Great.

207
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,767
- Yes, I have a dream.

208
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:11,529
And It's not some m.L.K. Dream
for equality.

209
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:16,053
I want to own
a decommissioned lighthouse.

210
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:18,092
And I want to live
at the top.

211
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:20,774
And nobody knows I live there.

212
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,055
And there's a button
that I can press,

213
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:28,299
and it'll launch that lighthouse
into space.

214
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:29,459
- For my current Investors,

215
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,900
things are going great.

216
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,979
- We already have a buyer.

217
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:32,980
- Really? Who?

218
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,381
- Washington university.

219
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:36,262
I don't even want
to think about selling

220
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:37,302
until our numbers
get into the billions.

221
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:38,903
- At least.

222
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:41,906
- So I've decided to open up
a second round of investment

223
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:44,066
to friends and family.

224
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,507
- Oh, god. Hold on to
your wallets, ladies.

225
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,508
- Did you ever think of wuphf

226
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,789
as an EMERGENCY notification
system,

227
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:51,789
like, for college campuses
with shooters or gas leaks?

228
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:53,751
- No, no--Oscar, it's not--

229
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:55,032
it's not a digital rape whistle.

230
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:56,753
Wuphf is about fun.
- That's right.

231
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:58,753
- Fun, communication,
connection.

232
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:00,554
- What's your money situation?

233
00:08:00,554 --> 00:08:02,675
- Well, it's tight,
as with any start-up.

234
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:04,797
- Sure, how long can you sustain
this without a cash infusion?

235
00:08:04,797 --> 00:08:06,317
- We have nine solid days.

236
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:08,240
I love these questions.
Keep 'em coming.

237
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,200
- I'm sorry,
nine days until what?

238
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,560
- Bankruptcy?

239
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,281
- Wait, Ryan, so this could be
over by the weekend?

240
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:16,283
- How long do you think
a week is?

241
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:18,043
- No, not this weekend;
next weekend.

242
00:08:18,043 --> 00:08:20,885
We were gonna go
on the investors ski trip.

243
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:23,492
I bought poles.

244
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,071
- Well, since I have
no incentive to sell,

245
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:30,352
I've cleaned my car,
organized my desk,

246
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:31,712
and taken a multivitamin.

247
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,355
So...

248
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:35,314
what now?

249
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,756
Pam.

250
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:40,157
[sighs]

251
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:41,998
Okay, now I've tried everything.

252
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:43,198
- Did you prank Dwight?

253
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:45,240
- No.
- Well, you like that.

254
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,522
- Yeah, it's not as fun
if I'm not blowing off work.

255
00:08:47,522 --> 00:08:49,322
- I love you,
but I'm kinda busy,

256
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:57,205
so I need you to figure this one
out on your own.

257
00:08:57,205 --> 00:09:00,528
- [blows raspberry]

258
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:01,928
- [chuckling]

259
00:09:01,928 --> 00:09:03,208
- Oscar said Wuphf only has

260
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,569
enough money for nine days.

261
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:07,531
- Check this out.

262
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,252
- All that color.
- Look at that.

263
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,613
Triple your investment
by January.

264
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:14,014
- Anyone can just throw numbers
up on a chart.

265
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:15,336
What are you doing
to make it happen?

266
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:17,176
- Well, earlier today,
I was emailing

267
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,416
someone by the name of
John legend.

268
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,377
- There you go.
- You have his email?

269
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:21,899
- A lot of these guys
are just Mac.Com,

270
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,539
@ their website whatever.

271
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,580
We get that guy wuphfing,

272
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,581
it's all over.

273
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:28,342
- I want my money back.

274
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:29,742
- Do not talk like that,
Stanley.

275
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:31,943
- Ryan, just tell us your plan.

276
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:33,385
- Okay, all right.

277
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:34,585
I know what you wanna see.

278
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:35,629
I'll be right back.

279
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:42,749
[smacking door]

280
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,309
Hey, kids, was that fun?

281
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:45,309
- [all] Yeah!

282
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:46,311
- All right.

283
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:47,393
- I wanna go on it again.

284
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:48,912
- Oh, I bet you do.

285
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:49,913
You know what?

286
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:51,033
When I was a little kid,

287
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:52,354
they couldn't get me
off the hayride.

288
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:54,795
But it's gonna cost you
three more bucks.

289
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,076
Wow!
This brings back memories.

290
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:58,277
[inhales deeply]

291
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:00,678
Hay stacking, hay throwing...

292
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:01,919
and at the end of it all,

293
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,401
one lucky boy would be crowned
hay king.

294
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:07,562
I always wanted
to be hay king.

295
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:09,906
The world shines on Mose.

296
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:18,247
- Where have you been?
I've been waiting.

297
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,848
- Uh, can we move this
to the end of the day?

298
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,969
- No, I--I think you should
make time for it.

299
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,330
- I found the needle
in the haystack!

300
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,290
- Hey, congratulations.
Do you know what your prize is?

301
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,612
- I don't know.

302
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:30,253
- Nothing. Life lesson?
Some tasks are not worth doing.

303
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:32,415
- Dwight?

304
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:33,935
- Wuphf T-shirts.

305
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:35,376
Who wants one?

306
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:37,696
Just imagine that you're
at spring break daytona beach.

307
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:38,699
- Here we go.
- Okay?

308
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:40,219
Everyone's like, "hey dude,

309
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:42,660
what's up with all the hotties
in the wuphf shirts?"

310
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,382
Or, Uh, "hey, what's up
with that helicopter?"

311
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:47,183
"It's Ryan from wuphf!"

312
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:49,263
- "It's Ryan the wuphf guy!"
- "Yo, Ryan from wuphf!"

313
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:50,903
- "He's up there."
- "What's he dropping?"

314
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:52,826
"Wow, what's falling on
us, man?"

315
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,266
Wuphf condoms!

316
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:57,067
50,000 condoms
out of the sky.

317
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:58,388
- Look at that!
He threw 'em on the ground!

318
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:00,069
- Look, this is
a marketing campaign.

319
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,109
You got nine days.

320
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:02,150
Let's say you do get the money.

321
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,269
What are you going
to do with it?

322
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:05,392
- The first lesson of silicon
valley, actually,

323

484
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:41,228
[applause]

485
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:42,750
And Let's hear it for...

486
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,750
purebred.

487
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,790
[applause]

488
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,350
Mm.

489
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,000
It would appear we have
a three-way tie.

490
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:50,393
I have no choice but to pick
the hay king myself.

491
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:55,196
I pick...

492
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:56,556
me!

493
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:58,357
I am your hay king!

494
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:01,079
All Hail your hay king!

495
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,520
Did I truck 300 Bales of hay

496
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,083
to a parking lot to rectify
some childhood disappointment?

497
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:13,004
Yes.

498
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:14,485
- So if I were
to call dunder Mifflin

499
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:16,507
and ask for miss Angela Martin,

500
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:19,287
would I get through to you?

501
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:22,169
- You would.

502
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:24,611
And if I were to call your House
and ask for your wife,

503
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,200
would I get through to you?

504
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,892
- My wife passed away
a few years ago.

505
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:30,814
- How tragic.

506
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:32,255
Very sorry to hear that.

507
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:34,296
- Thank you.

508
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:37,056
- Help!

509
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,097
Hello?

510
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:41,861
Oh!
Help!

511
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,063
- Consider it a wuphf
in person.

512
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:50,144
- You're doing the wrong thing.

513
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:51,264
You're gonna lose
Michael's investment,

514
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:52,625
you're gonna lose ours.

515
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,266
- You got this crazy opportunity
to get our money back.

516
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:56,708
Tell Mike to sell.

517
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,668
- If you tell Michael to sell,
he'll sell.

518
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:00,990
- I'm betting on myself.

519
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,509
- It's a bad bet.

520
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:03,510
- Hello.

521
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,711
- Hey.
It's an ambush here.

522
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,113
Nobody here believes
in this company.

523
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:08,313
Will you tell them
they're wrong?

524
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:09,954
- It's not that we don't believe
in the company.

525
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,034
We don't believe in you.

526
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,795
- All those in favor of selling,
say aye.

527
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:13,796
- Aye.
- Aye.

528
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:16,077
- Aye.
- Aye.

529
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:19,038
- Aye.

530
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:22,801
Do not agree to sell,
which is to say nay.

531
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,401
- What is wrong with you?

532
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:26,281
What happened to you
in high school?

533
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:27,603
- Michael, are you that blind?

534
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:28,722
- I'm not blind!

535
00:18:28,722 --> 00:18:30,684
I know exactly who he is.

536
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:33,926
He is selfish and lazy
and image-obsessed,

537
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:37,047
and he is a bad friend.

538
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:39,049
And he's also clever.

539
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,450
And he shoots incredibly high.

540
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,370
And he may just make it.

541
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,091
But you know what,
even If he doesn't,

542
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,374
I would rather go broke
betting on my people

543
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,414
than get rich all by myself

544
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:52,455
on some island
like a castaway.

545
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:54,297
And there is no middle ground.

546
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:56,378
- You're gonna lose
all of our money.

547
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:57,818
- Only If he fails.

548
00:18:57,818 --> 00:18:59,419
And you know what?

549
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:00,821
Ryan, I believe in you.

550
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:04,782
Just like I believe
in all of you.

551
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:07,903
You have nine days to save
Everybody's money.

552
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,384
- Oh...

553
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:10,624
that's a lot of pressure.

554
00:19:10,624 --> 00:19:12,626
I--I'm gonna need
some more time.

555
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:13,467
- You can't have it.

556
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:18,308
- Okay.

557
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:19,674
I won't let you down.

558
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:30,355
- Angela?

559
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:31,201
Angela!

560
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:44,402
- The world sends people
your way...

561
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:46,484
Ryan came to me
through a temp agency.

562
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:49,684
Andy was transferred here.

563
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:51,485
No idea where Creed came from.

564
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:53,087
The point is

565
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:56,448
you just have to play with
the cards that you're dealt.

566
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:58,930
Jim, that guy is an ace.

567
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,611
Dwight is my king Up my sleeve.

568
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:02,051
Phyllis is my old maid.

569
00:20:02,051 --> 00:20:03,452
Oscar is my queen.

570
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,412
That's easy.

571
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,734
Gimme a hard one.

572
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:07,814
That's what Oscar said.

573
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:10,535
Toby is the instruction card
you throw away.

574
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:12,338
Pam's a solid seven.

575
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:13,337
And Yeah, you know what?

576
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,217
Ryan is probably, like, a two.

577
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:17,299
But sometimes twos
can be wild.

578
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,381
So watch out.

579
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:21,261
And I am obviously the joker.

580
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,622
So...
[phone rings]

581
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,303
[phone rings]
that's, uh--

582
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:27,305
[melodic tone]

583
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:28,664
[robotic voice]
- wuphf from Ryan Howard.

584
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:30,345
Decided to sell company.

585
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,947
Thanks, bro.
Hell of a ride.

586
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:35,182
- Thank god.

587
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,511
[phone rings]

588
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:44,911
- Gabe Lewis.

589
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,193
- Now, listen here, gabe,
you're too fat.

590
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:49,953
No one's gonna like you
if you're too fat.

591
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:51,915
I made some changes
to my book.

592
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:53,635
See if you like them.
- Well, jo--

593
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:56,798
- now, I love reading,
and I hate being interrupted.

594
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,319
Shut up and listen,
you gay bastard.

595
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,479
Chapter one.

596
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:04,080
I was born, not into luxury
Nor poverty,

597
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,562
but into adversity, and for
that, I thank the lord.

598
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:08,923
My father was a man.
That's all we can know.

599
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:09,884
After I learned to ride a bike,

600
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,285
there was no stopping me.

601
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:14,766
I would ride up Magnolia Street
and down Azalea Lane.

602
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:15,766
Which would later become my--

603
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:16,807
- All right, good night, gabe.

604
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:18,088
Just wanted to say thanks again,

605
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:21,809
'cause I really think I made
good use of my day, oh!

606
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:23,931
Sorry.

607
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:26,372
- And fate has obliged me
with plenty of battles,

608
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:27,892
the first being a hard--
