No.
Okay.

164
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:52,604
Stanley? How about that hot
picture you have by your desk?

165
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,697
Centerfold in the
Catholic schoolgirl's outfit?

166
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,971
I mean, it is hot, it is sexy,
and it turns him on.

167
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,037
And I will admit, best part
of my morning is staring at it.

168
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,672
But what? Are we gonna
just take it away?

169
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,718
That is my daughter, she goes
to Catholic girls' school.

Come in!

Hey!
Oh, my God!

172
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,016
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

173
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,354
You said, come in! No, I didn't!

174
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,190
Just, please, get out. Oh, my God!

175
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,022

with my outfit?

Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,

178
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,400
(ALL GASPING) But I'm not
allowed to wear open-toed shoes?

179
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:27,939
Is that how it goes?

180
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,269
Meredith, your boob is out.

181
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,400
Fine.

182
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,307
(ALL GROANING) Too
far, Meredith! Too far!

183
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,312
Damn it, Meredith,
where are your panties?

184
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,677
It's casual day.

185
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,545
Come here, give me a kiss,
come on.

186
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,949
Michael, come on, you
don't have to worry. I'm not

187
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,954
gonna report you to HR.
I'm not... I'm not worried!

188
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,887
You know what? The only
thing I am worried about

189
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,354
is getting a boner.

190
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,586
I'm now going to read aloud your
submitted medical conditions.

191
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,723
When you hear yours read,
please raise your hand

192
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,164
to indicate
that it is real.

193
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,135
If you do not raise your
hand, it will not be covered.

194
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,297
Number one,
inverted penis.

195
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:07,643
Could you mean vagina? Because
if you do, I want that covered.

196
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,409
I thought your vagina was
removed during your hysterectomy.

197
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:15,580
A uterus is different from a
vagina. I still have a vagina.

198
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,853
Attention, everyone. Hello.

199
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,658
Yes, I just want you to know
that, this is not my decision.

200
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,392
You can consider this
my retirement from comedy.

201
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,264
Does that include
"that's what she said"?

202
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,628
Yes.

203
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,605
Wow, that is really hard.

204
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,975
You really think
you can go all day long?

205
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,611
Well, you always left me
satisfied and smiling, so...

206

Michael!

208
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,483
Why did you
get it so big?

209
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,114
That's what she said.

210
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,722
Does the skin look
red and swollen?

211
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,261
That's what she said.

212
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,627
That's my joke.
Damn it, Dwight.

213
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,258
How about
the Phyllis-Angela dispute?

214
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,494
You already did me.

215
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,001
(MOUTHING) MICHAEL:
That's what she said.

216
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,230
Is there any mustard?

217
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,432
No mustard! No mustard!
Just eat it!

218
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,065
Eat it, Phyllis.
Dip it in the water

219
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,666
so it'll slide down
your gullet more easily.

229

It's HR stuff.

Right up my alley. What is
that? What kind of stuff is that?

232
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,975
It's a company

Ah!

00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,151
Talking about what?

236
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,045
Waste is next.

Waste?

00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,321
What does that even mean?
Like garbage?

239

No, waste of time,

Oh! Time and resources.

No. No, no, no, no, no.
Respectfully, Toby, no.

00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,439
No. This company does not

You're so pathetic. Well,
I hope it was worth it,

you might want to have kids,

had the vasectomy reversed?

asked me out,
I said no,

because I was committed
to our relationship.
