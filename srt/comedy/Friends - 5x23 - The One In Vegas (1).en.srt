1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:06,840
Could you get that?

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,428
Why? Just because you're too lazy
to get up off your tushy?

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:18,268
All the people in the entire world that
I would wanna talk to are right here.

4
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,357
Sucker!

5
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,110
- Hey, Joey!
<i>- Hey, Pheebs.</i>

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,570
Can you do me a favor?

7
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,156
I forgot the PIN to my ATM card.
Can you get it for me?

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,616
<i>Sure. Where is it?</i>

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,370
I scratched it on the ATM machine
on the corner.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,622
So you're 5-6-3-9?

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,084
That's it! Thanks.

12
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,545
- Wanna talk to Chandler?
- Let me talk to him.

13
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,547
<i>He didn't believe in my movie...</i>

14
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:51,677
...which is a big mistake,
because it is real. Real.

15
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:56,390
Tribbiani, get back to work.
Break time's over.

16
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,183
Who was that?

17
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:03,188
My stunt double. He's getting
too familiar for my taste.

18
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,106
I've tried to apologize.

19
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,861
If I can't do it on the phone,
I'll go and do it in person.

20
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,656
I heard that. Can you put him on?

21
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,411
Don't come out here.

22
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:21,373
I support you 100% and I wanna prove
that to you in person.

23
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,835
I got that. I forgive you.
Don't come out here.

24
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,212
You haven't taken
my calls for a week.

25
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:32,425
I'm totally over it. Friends forever.
Don't come out here.

26
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,762
Would you mind doing
a picture with us?

27
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:36,805
What was that?

28
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,392
<i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

29
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:45,523
Good talking to you
and don't come out here.

30
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,819
The One in Vegas

31
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:42,037
I'm sorry I'm late.

32
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,087
I'm so sorry.
Have you been here long?

33
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,799
That's okay.

34
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,344
What the hell took you so long?

35
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,598
You can't tell Chandler.
I ran into Richard.

36
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,266
- Which Richard?
- The Richard.

37
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,728
Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!

38
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:10,232
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.

39
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,776
Okay, that actually
makes more sense.

40
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,818
How was it?

41
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,823
It was really nice. We talked
and I had lunch with him.

42
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,159
That's weird. I dreamed
you had lunch with Richard.

43
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,038
- Really?
- Again, Richard Simmons.

44
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,122
Go on.

45
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,791
The strange part was
he was really nice...

46
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,919
...and he looks great,
but I didn't feel anything.

47
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,963
So why can't we tell Chandler?

48
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,759
It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our
anniversary. I don't wanna spoil it.

49
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,055
I can't believe you guys
have lasted a whole year!

50
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:45,142
Wow, I owe Rachel twenty bucks.

51
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,230
On a totally different bet.

52
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,192
- It's almost our anniversary!
- I know.

53
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:58,280
One year ago today, I was just
your annoying friend Chandler.

54
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,743
Now you're just
my annoying friend Chandler.

55
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:03,827
I got you a gift.

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:09,416
- It's not till tomorrow.
- I know, but you have to open it today.

57
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,721
Okay! There you go!

58
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,557
It's two tickets to Vegas!

59
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,727
Yeah! For this weekend!
It'll be perfect.

60
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:33,106
You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start
our celebration on the plane.

61
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:37,444
We can call it our "Plane-a-versary".

62
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,071
We have to?

63
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,909
This is great, but Joey didn't want
any of us there.

64
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,872
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.
He'll be excited when we surprise him.

65
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:54,502
Plus, we get to have
our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!

66
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,173
"Anna-vada-versary!"

67
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,009
I think we should see other people.

68
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,636
We can go, right?

69
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,054
Great idea.

70
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,140
I'm gonna go too!

71
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,852
Pheebs, it's kind of
our anniversary.

72
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,814
You won't ditch me
like you did with London.

73
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,816
Ditch you?
You were pregnant...

74
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,194
Great story. I'm going.

75
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:28,495
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go
to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!

76
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,914
Including me!

77
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,123
Do you wanna go?

78
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,251
I can take a couple days off work.

79
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:40,048
Of course you can take a couple days
off, because this trip includes me!

80
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,511
I've got a presentation tomorrow.
I can't miss that.

81
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,348
I've got tickets to the Van Gogh
exhibit. I waited a year for this.

82
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,310
Art lover.

83
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,523
What?

84
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,067
I said, "Art lover."

85
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,486
Is that an insult?

86
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,447
I don't know. I'm very tired.

87
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,866
Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday?

88
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:06,950
Sounds great.

89
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,328
I'll call the airlines.

90
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,915
That'll be nice to have
the apartment to myself.

91
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,210
To walk around naked.

92
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,964
No, so I can be by myself.
Have a little alone time.

93
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,134
Naked alone time.

94
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,970
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean
I wanna walk around naked.

95
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,557
You live alone,
you don't walk around naked.

96
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:34,269
Why does it takes me so long
to answer the door?

97
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:45,780
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas
better or worse than the trip to London?

98
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,159
So far, it's pretty much
the same, Pheebs.

99
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,705
What about after I give you
these candies?

100
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,834
I guess it's a little better now.

101
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,130
Las Vegas, 1.
London, 0.

102
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,757
I'll be back.

103
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,137
Happy Plane-a-versary.

104
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,806
I love you.

105
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:15,435
- Can I give you your present now?
- Okay!

106
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,482
Oh, don't tell me I did this.

107
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,569
I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!

108
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,866
How about "I did forget the present,
forgive me" not fake-out?

109
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,535
You can give it to me
when we get back.

110
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,121
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

111
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:38,834
You decided to tell him
about the Richard thing.

112
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,796
What "Richard thing"?

113
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,466
Oh, no.

114
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,718
What "Richard thing"?

115
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,305
Simmons. Go with Simmons.

116
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,854
I ran into Richard yesterday.

117
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,774
He asked me if I wanted to go
for a bite and I did.

118
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,569
I didn't tell you
because you'd get mad...

119
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,655
...and I didn't wanna spoil
our anniversary.

120
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,951
I'm not mad.

121
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,578
Really?

122
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:19,458
So you bumped into Richard.
You grabbed a "bite".

123
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,629
No big deal.

124
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,133
Great.

125
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:34,265
Okay, London, 1.

126
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,840
Oh, look what happened.

127
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,509
<i>Check me out.</i>

128
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,095
<i>I'm in my kitchen...</i>

129
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,430
<i>... naked.</i>

130
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,517
<i>I'm picking up an orange.</i>

131
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,270
<i>I'm naked.</i>

132
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,024
<i>I'm lighting the candles.</i>

133
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:29,612
<i>Naked. And carefully.</i>

134
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!</i>

135
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,712
<i>I can't look at that.</i>
<i>I am looking at this.</i>

136
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:51,800
<i>Okay, vivid colors,</i>
<i>expressive brush strokes.</i>

137
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,388
<i>Unless she wants me</i>
<i>to be looking at that.</i>

138
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,348
<i>She knows I'm home.</i>

139
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,477
<i>She knows I can see her.</i>

140
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:05,314
<i>What kind of game is she playing?</i>

141
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:10,360
<i>I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.</i>

142
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,987
<i>Dr. Geller.</i>

143
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,867
<i>Stop it. You're being silly.</i>

144
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,412
<i>Or am I?</i>

145
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:25,542
<i>Love to love you baby</i>

146
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,588
<i>Love to love you baby</i>

147
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,431
<i>Love to love you baby</i>

148
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,517
Darn it!

149
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,202
May I come in?

150
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,412
Yeah, if you want to.

151
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:06,125
Do you want me to?

152
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,459
Yeah, sure?

153
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,087
So do I.

154
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,678
Okay, Rach, before anything happens...

155
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,597
...I wanna lay down a couple
of ground rules.

156
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,559
This is just about tonight.

157
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:29,481
I won't go through with this
if it'll raise the question of "us".

158
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,026
I just want this to be...

159
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,156
...about what it is.

160
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,994
And...

161
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,996
...what is that, Ross?

162
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:48,417
The physical act of love.

163
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,793
What, are you crazy?

164
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:56,424
So you weren't trying to entice me
just now with your nakedness?

165
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,805
Oh, God. You saw me?

166
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:09,396
You weren't trying to entice me
with your nakedness?

167
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:15,318
You actually thought
I wanted to have sex with you?

168
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:34,380
I'm sorry, but, Ross,
you kicked off your shoes!

169
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,258
Can we just forget this ever happened?

170
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,427
Of course, you're right.
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,261
Thank you.

172
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:42,847
I guess I'll go pack.

173
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,681
Wait, one more thing.

174
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:49,645
Do we still need to settle
the question of "us"?

175
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,169
Hey, you guys, wait!

176
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,337
You guys.

177
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,839
This place is much better than London.

178
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,718
A lady dressed like Cleopatra
gave me this.

179
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,471
Ninety-nine cent
steak and lobster dinner.

180
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,096
You don't eat animals.

181
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,809
For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.

182
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,186
I can totally settle down here.

183
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:36,483
It's got everything I could ever want.
Including Joey! Look!

184
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,068
Look! Hey!

185
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,946
Oh, my God.

186
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,705
Love your condoms, my man.

187
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,291
Why are you here?
I told you not to come.

188
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,085
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?

189
00:13:55,335 --> 00:14:00,924
Because I'm shooting a scene right now.
I play a gladiator.

190
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,510
Hold on a second. Can we cut?

191
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,429
My friends are here.
I'm gonna take a break.

192
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,433
Who are you talking to?

193
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,143
The director.

194
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,187
Her.

195
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,901
All right, it's not a gladiator movie.
I work here.

196
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,527
Why? What happened?

197
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,862
The movie shut down.
Ran out of money.

198
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:26,366
I'm working here till it starts up,
if it ever does.

199
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,327
- I'm so sorry.
- Such a drag.

200
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,746
Sorry I didn't tell you.
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,124
Apparently there's
a new policy of not sharing.

202
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,545
- I knew you weren't okay with that.
- So you're a gladiator!

203
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,213
What's going on?

204
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,257
Monica had lunch with Richard.

205
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,885
Dawson?

206
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,638
But that would've been so cool!

207
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,224
Her boyfriend Richard.

208
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:54,728
It meant nothing. After all this time,
how can you not trust me?

209
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:59,983
When you go lunching with hunky men
and don't tell me!

210
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,862
You're right. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

211
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,739
Thanks.

212
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:09,618
- There we go.
- Now I love Vegas.

213
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:14,498
I promise you next time
I absolutely will tell you.

214
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,626
"Next time"?

215
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,045
So close.

216
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,381
There won't be a next time.
You cannot see him again.

217
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:27,219
I cannot see him?
You can't tell me what to do.

218
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,263
That's funny, I think I just did.

219
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,183
If you act like this,
I won't be around you.

220
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,060
- Fine.
- Happy anniversary!

221
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,687
Guys, please! Come on, come on.

222
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,065
This is obviously
a misunderstanding.

223
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,316
No, it is not.

224
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,362
Don't look at me.
I just work here.

225
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:55,039
Okay, Ross? I'm a little warm,
so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.

226
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,875
Now, I'm just letting you know...

227
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:03,756
...this is not an invitation
to the physical act of love.

228
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,759
Yep, that's hilarious.

229
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,969
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.

230
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,305
You know, last night was
embarrassing for you too.

231
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:16,310
No, not really. You've seen me
naked hundreds of times.

232
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,980
But it was the first
for the rest of my building.

233
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,276
That's true. But you know,
I just don't embarrass that easily.

234
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,611
What? You totally get embarrassed.

235
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:31,408
No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just
a more secure person than you are.

236
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,870
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

237
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,330
Hey, lady!

238
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,957
I don't care how much
you want it, okay?

239
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,713
I am not gonna have sex
with you in the bathroom!

240
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:51,512
You know, in Roman times,
this was more than just a hat.

241
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:52,554
Really?

242
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,097
Yeah, sure, sure.

243
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,350
They would scrub the floors.

244
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,103
They'd use it to get the mud
off their shoe.

245
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:02,147
Sometimes underneath
the horse would get dirty.

246
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,816
So they would stick it right...

247
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,070
I can't believe this is how
I'm spending my anniversary.

248
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,908
I'll take you someplace nice.
A guy tipped me $100.

249
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,411
He was playing blackjack
for an hour and he won $5000.

250
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,289
Can you believe that?

251
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,708
If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.

252
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,376
Build up my upper body...

253
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,213
...and hit Richard from behind
with a stick.

254
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:29,216
Wait! Why don't I just
do what that guy did?

255
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,635
I'll take this $100,
turn it into $5000...

256
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,889
...and I'll turn that into enough
to get my movie going!

257
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,390
Good luck.

258
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:40,018
I don't need luck.
I've thought this through.

259
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,813
I see.

260
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,655
Thanks.

261
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,283
I can't believe this.
This is like the worst night ever.

262
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,954
You had a minor setback
in your relationship.

263
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,416
Big deal.
It's only Chandler.

264
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,962
I am so sorry.

265
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,424
This is crazy having
such a stupid argument.

266
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,342
I don't wanna see Richard.

267
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:14,553
So go fix it.

268
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,472
Find Chandler.
He's probably in your room.

269
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,892
Tell him sorry and you love him.

270
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,852
You're right, Phoebe.

271
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,563
- Thank you.
- Sure.

272
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:29,651
Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!

273
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,162
Anybody lose this?

274
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,204
Coming out.

275
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,457
Place your bet.

276
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,793
Dice her out.

277
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:51,132
Yellow 11. Pay the front line!

278
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:03,394
So I'm on my way back to the bathroom.

279
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:09,649
All right, all right.
Just keep walking, all right?

280
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,617
What are you...
I am sorry, sir.

281
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:24,414
I think he just really likes you.

282
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:33,673
You know that teacher who had a baby
with her student?

283
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,227
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

284
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:51,858
Do you have any extra pants? My friend
seems to have had a little accident.

285
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:59,492
- Can I change $100?
- Changing $100.

286
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:03,536
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks.

287
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,749
That's right.

288
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:13,464
- Thirteen.
- Hit me!

289
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:17,259
Oh, man!

290
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,221
Wait!

291
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,933
You are not gonna believe this!

292
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:28,479
I have found my identical hand twin.

293
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,858
What?

294
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,194
My identical hand twin!

295
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:38,072
What's an identical hand twin?

296
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,740
What does it sound like?

297
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,285
It's a guy with my identical hands.

298
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:47,205
It was incredible. The dealer's hands
were exactly like mine.

299
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:51,418
It was like looking
at my hands in a mirror!

300
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,172
You sure you weren't
looking at your hands in a mirror?

301
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:59,259
Don't you see what this means?
I can forget about that stupid movie.

302
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,638
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

303
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,348
How?

304
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,934
I don't have it all worked out yet.

305
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:12,356
But it's gotta mean big money.
Come on, identical hands!

306
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,441
Again, I must go back to...

307
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,194
...how?

308
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:22,741
This is Vegas, man.
People will pay to see freaky stuff!

309
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,702
How much would you pay
to see this hand...

310
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:29,206
...twice?

311
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,586
I can't really put a price on that.

312
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:38,424
Are you un-supporting me again?

313
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:42,303
I support you 100%.
I just didn't get it right away.

314
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,971
Now I'm caught up.

315
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:46,056
Identical hand twins.

316
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:49,267
It's a million-dollar idea!

317
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,566
I found my identical hand twin!

318
00:21:56,817 --> 00:22:00,571
Oh, you're so lucky!

319
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:07,619
So where's Monica?
Did you guys make up?

320
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,705
But she just came up here.

321
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,915
That was Joey.

322
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,250
I wonder where she is?
It's so weird.

323
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,378
She's probably talking to Richard.

324
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,672
Would you stop that?

325
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,175
You know what she said
after her lunch with Richard?

326
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:26,388
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you.

327
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,265
- Really?
- Yes.

328
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:34,438
She feels terrible. She really wants
to make up. You've gotta find her.

329
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,151
Good.

330
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:48,535
I should really start wearing hats.

331
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:36,041
Welcome to Las Vegas.

332
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,418
- Did you enjoy your flight?
- I did.

333
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,173
Thank you very much.
It was excellent.

334
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:47,969
- I hope you had a nice flight.
- Oh, it was the best.

335
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,271
I think the check-in is that way.

336
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,447
Kids love me.

337
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,283
Hi, you guys are here!

338
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:12,953
What'd you do?
Did you go to a costume party?

339
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,413
Let me guess.

340
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,166
Pancho Villa.

341
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:21,128
And you're Bob Saget.

342
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,548
Pancho Villa?

343
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:29,470
What are you talking about, Pheebs?
I don't...

344
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,724
Oh, my God! You drew on me?

345
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,727
Hey, you wet my pants!

346
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:39,521
What kind of party was this?

347
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:43,984
I've been walking around like this?
You have so crossed a line.

348
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:48,488
Rach, wait.
The men's room is that way.

349
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:57,789
It's the third time she's won
on a machine I was playing.

350
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,001
I bet she's one of those people.

351
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,295
Mole people?

352
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,505
What? No, a lurker.

353
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:06,632
What's that?

354
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:09,676
When you're playing a machine
and it hasn't paid out...

355
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:12,221
...a lurker waits for you
to give up and then...

356
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:15,057
Kills you?

357
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,895
They swoop in and steal your jackpot.

358
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:24,024
- How do you know about this?
- My nana used to do it.

359
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:27,569
That's how she paid for my dance...
Karate lessons.

360
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,154
Dance karate?

361
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,907
Yes, it's a deadly...

362
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:35,577
...but beautiful sport.

363
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,082
- It won't come off.
- What?

364
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:41,416
It won't come off.

365
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,836
Oh, my God. Rach, are you sure?

366
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:48,048
I took it off
and then I drew it back on.

367
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,302
You made it!

368
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:55,764
Who's your friend?
He's hot.

369
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:56,973
Thanks, man.

370
00:25:57,224 --> 00:26:01,270
Listen, I talked to Chandler.
And I'm sorry about the movie.

371
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,479
Don't be sorry.

372
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,733
I don't need it anymore.
I found my identical hand twin.

373
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:07,776
Your what?

374
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:11,488
My identical hand twin.
The person whose hands are like mine.

375
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,031
This is a gold mine.

376
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:16,035
What?

377
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,162
That won't make you any money.

378
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:19,747
Well, fine.

379
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:24,919
None of you will live with me
in my hand-shaped mansion.

380
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:29,215
Except you.
You can live in the thumb.

381
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:33,969
All right, baby, come on!

382
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,304
I am on fire!

383
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,847
See you later.

384
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,515
What are you doing?

385
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,392
What's it look like?
Going home.

386
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,353
Why?

387
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,814
Wait.

388
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,650
Sorry, I was just playing
for one second.

389
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:52,196
If you don't want me to see
Richard again, I won't.

390
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:54,073
He means nothing to me.

391
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:58,160
Oh, come on. I was there.

392
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,205
I know he's the love of your life.

393
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,917
Not anymore.

394
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,794
Really?

395
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:10,256
Really.

396
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,258
All right?

397
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:18,848
Let's forget about going home
and celebrate our anniversary.

398
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:21,224
Okay, this is empty.

399
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:26,271
I wanted to make a dramatic scene,
but I hate packing.

400
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,154
Where's the other guy?

401
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:34,654
Which guy?

402
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:38,117
Tall, dark hair, hand looks
exactly like this?

403
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:43,414
I don't know about the hands,
but he went to the restroom.

404
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:51,130
How you doing?

405
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,172
Very busy.

406
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:55,508
Right. Okay.

407
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:01,515
Yes, hello. I have a question.

408
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:06,520
I used your pen to draw
on my friend's face.

409
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,399
A beard and a mustache.

410
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,070
Thank you.

411
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:17,030
No, she didn't think so.

412
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:20,826
I know. It's like...
Anyway...

413
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:25,080
Makeup didn't cover it, we've tried
everything and nothing's worked.

414
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,708
What do we do?

415
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,632
Thank you.

416
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:38,427
Yeah, it's not coming off.

417
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:40,470
What? What else did he say?

418
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:45,517
He said he thought I was funny.

419
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:48,979
Okay, look.
Let's just go downstairs...

420
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:52,566
...we'll have some fun
and you will forget all about it.

421
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,861
There's no way I am leaving
looking like this!

422
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,196
Come on, Rach. It's not that bad.

423
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:01,659
Ross, I am a human doodle!

424
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:06,163
Just because some idiot drew on your
face doesn't mean you can't have fun.

425
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:08,582
Besides, no one will
even look at you.

426
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:13,920
This is Vegas. Hello?
There are tons of other freaks here.

427
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:19,259
There are tons of freaks here.
No other. No.

428
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,764
Come on. No one will notice. I swear.

429
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:33,648
There was some staring and pointing.

430
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,775
I need a drink.

431
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:40,239
They really overcharge you
for that stuff.

432
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:45,035
But who cares,
because it's all on me.

433
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:51,416
That is one big drink.

434
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,794
Macadamia nut?

435
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:58,090
Wow! That's some pricey nut.

436
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:01,427
Really like those macadamia nuts?

437
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,221
Nope.

438
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,111
Get out of here, you lurker!

439
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:22,197
Go on, get!

440
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,951
You made up.

441
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,245
I couldn't be mad at him
for too long.

442
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:31,957
She couldn't live
without the "Chand love".

443
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,753
Get a room.

444
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:37,796
We have one.

445
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,507
Use it.

446
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:48,848
That's right.
Take good care of those babies.

447
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:50,017
Excuse me?

448
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,268
It's me. Joey.

449
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,770
Do I know you?

450
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,941
Joey?

451
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,194
Yeah, the hand guy.

452
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:05,783
So what are we gonna do
about this hand twin thing?

453
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,952
Nothing.

454
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:11,247
Look, you and I have been given a gift.

455
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:15,375
We have to do something with it.
Like hand modeling. Or magic.

456
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:19,922
And you know NASA's
gonna want to talk to us.

457
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,132
I have to get back to work.

458
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,925
We can have our own show.

459
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:28,931
We can clap our hands together.
People will love it!

460
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,391
And I wrote a song for us.

461
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:35,062
<i>This hand is your hand</i>

462
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:37,981
<i>This hand is my hand</i>

463
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:42,069
<i>Oh, wait, that's your hand</i>

464
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:46,448
<i>No, wait, it's my hand</i>

465
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,367
That's okay.

466
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:52,621
But you haven't even heard the chorus!

467
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:54,957
Oh, my God.

468
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:58,210
I look like my great-aunt Muriel.

469
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,878
All right, you know what?

470
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,213
We don't have to go downstairs.

471
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:05,092
We can bring Vegas up to us.

472
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:06,552
All right, come on.

473
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:09,888
We'll play some blackjack.
Here we go.

474
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:11,765
- Thirteen.
- Hit me.

475
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:15,101
Twenty-three.

476
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:20,566
Which is what we play to
at this casino!

477
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:22,234
You win ten dollars!

478
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:26,196
- I bet twenty.
- Right.

479
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:34,330
A new pair of shoes
for the Chan-Chan man!

480
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:37,333
I've never seen a roll like this!

481
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,793
That's right, baby!

482
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:41,920
What do I want now?

483
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:43,589
Eight?

484
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,673
Six.

485
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,801
Pick a number!
That is your only job.

486
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,219
- Eight.
- Thank you.

487
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:53,848
If you get this,
we buy everybody a steak dinner.

488
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:58,062
Eight it is.

489
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,272
We're not buying steak dinners, are we?

490
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,275
- No.
- Okay, good.

491
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,694
- What do I want now?
- Try a hard eight.

492
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:08,572
- What?
- Two fours.

493
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,907
Eight!

494
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:14,119
Don't you let her go.
You're a lucky guy.

495
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:17,163
Thank you, Mr. Drunken Gambler.

496
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:22,336
You get this and we get
the biggest suite in the place.

497
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,966
We get the biggest suite in the place.

498
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:28,926
The biggest suite in the place!

499
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:31,887
Come on!

500
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,556
I love you!
I can't remember why we fought.

501
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,725
Because I had lunch with Rich...

502
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,727
Me neither!

503
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,979
- What now?
- Another hard eight.

504
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,482
Hard eight?
Let's call it easy eight!

505
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:47,486
I'll tell you what.
You roll another hard eight...

506
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:51,907
...and we get married here tonight.

507
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:58,372
Shut up!

508
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:03,251
It just got interesting!

509
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,549
What did you say?

510
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,429
You roll another eight,
we get married tonight.

511
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,889
You serious?

512
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,598
Yes. I love you.

513
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:20,227
I've never loved anybody
as much as I love you.

514
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:23,146
I've never loved anybody
as much as I love you.

515
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:27,192
So if an eight comes up,
we take it as a sign and we do it.

516
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,861
What do you say?

517
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,078
That's a four.

518
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,121
And where's the other one?

519
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:41,665
Under the table.

520
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:46,670
Nobody move!
You look that way, I look this way.

521
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,801
Here it is, here it is.

522
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,013
That could be 4 or 5.

523
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:00,517
It's your call.

524
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,730
It's a four.

525
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:10,694
I think so too.

526
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:40,140
Oh, well, lost again.

527
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,270
That's it. You and me. Outside!

528
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:50,609
I wouldn't want you to lose a chunk
of that pretty blonde hair!

529
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:57,032
Be cool.

530
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:01,369
Okay, your lurking days are over.

531
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,579
What?

532
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:05,290
Everyone you lurk,
I'll lurk first.

533
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:08,252
You move on,
I'll be one step ahead of you...

534
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:09,712
...every single time.

535
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:13,591
And then I'll be on your ass
every hour of every day...

536
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:15,468
...till Monday...

537
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:18,470
...because that's when I go home.

538
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,721
When do you leave?

539
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,390
Also Monday.

540
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,519
What time? Maybe we can share a cab.

541
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:28,063
Hit me.

542
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:31,233
Hit me.

543
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:42,703
We need more cards.

544
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:47,749
Yeah. And we also need more drinks.
Hold on a second.

545
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,921
Hello, Vegas?

546
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,757
We would like more alcohol.

547
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:59,470
You know what else?
We would like some more beers.

548
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:04,599
Oh, I forgot to dial.

549
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:11,356
That must be our alcohol and beers.

550
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:16,820
It's Joey! I love Joey!

551
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,655
Oh, I love Joey!

552
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,742
Joey lives with a duck.

553
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,787
Look, I need some help, okay?

554
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:28,123
Someone has to convince
my hand twin to cooperate.

555
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,165
I'll do it.

556
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:34,838
Whatever you need me to do,
I'm your man.

557
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:41,679
Are you okay?

558
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:46,267
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.

559
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:49,311
Hey, Rach?

560
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,814
How you doing?

561
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:58,195
I'm doing good, baby.
How you doing?

562
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:01,865
Don't let her drink anymore.

563
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:09,540
Here's that macadamia nut.

564
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:13,460
No, something else.

565
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:19,633
So what do you wanna do now?

566
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:23,637
I wanna get out of the room.

567
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:27,516
I really miss downstairs.

568
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:33,855
Okay, you know what? There is only
one way I am leaving this hotel room.

569
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:36,817
Well, hello!

570
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,027
I'm Ross.

571
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:44,200
- Good luck to you.
- Sir, you've got a little something...

572
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:52,207
Hello.

573
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:19,652
I won!

574
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:21,612
I won! I finally won!

575
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:23,572
I won! That was my quarter!

576
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,450
Take a hike, toots.

577
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:28,827
Excuse me, sir.

578
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:31,705
This lady played my quarter.
This is my money.

579
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:34,499
Is that true, miss?

580
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,836
Sells drugs to kids.

581
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:41,632
She sells drugs to kids.

582
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,801
It was my quarter.

583
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:45,761
Was it her quarter?

584
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,680
How about we talk
about this over dinner?

585
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:52,643
- Okay, lady, you're out of here.
- No, you can't arrest me!

586
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:56,522
I won't go back to that hellhole!

587
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,776
I'm just taking you outside.

588
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:10,785
I need something old, something new,
something borrowed and something blue.

589
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:13,288
Here's something blue and new.

590
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:16,167
You are so efficient.
I love you.

591
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,667
- Let's go.
- No, wait!

592
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,378
We need something old.

593
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:25,008
I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was twelve.

594
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:26,969
That'll work.

595
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:30,431
I don't think so.

596
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,099
Now something borrowed.

597
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,978
Here, just take this.

598
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:37,354
That's stealing.

599
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:41,358
We'll bring it back.
Put it under your dress.

600
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:54,997
Okay. One thing at a time.

601
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:08,635
Are you gonna play?

602
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:12,306
No, I don't really have any money.

603
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:16,477
Not yet, anyway.

604
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:19,980
Can't sit here if you don't play.

605
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:38,123
My name is Regina Falangie.

606
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:41,043
I'm a businesswoman
in town on business.

607
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:43,045
Would you like to see my card?

608
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,047
What did I do with my Filofax?

609
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:48,383
I must've left it
in Conference Room B.

610
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,845
- Fourteen.
- Hit me.

611
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,053
Oh, my God.

612
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:58,227
May I just say that you two gentlemen
have the exact same hands?

613
00:41:58,227 --> 00:41:59,520
They're identical.

614
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:04,024
I've never seen that
in the business world.

615
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:06,526
Stop it.

616
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:11,573
Miss Falangie, may I ask you a question
as an impartial person at this table?

617
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:14,909
Please stop it.

618
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:18,205
Wouldn't you pay good money
to see identical hands...

619
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:22,793
...showcased in some type
of an entertainment venue?

620
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:28,465
If you leave now, I will chop off
my hand and give it to you!

621
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:31,927
Didn't I just throw you out?

622
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:34,012
No, you threw out Phoebe.

623
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,391
I'm Regina Falangie. Falangie.

624
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:39,393
Come on, lady.

625
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:40,936
Please take him too.

626
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:43,814
Me? Oh, come on, man.

627
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,941
Come on, buddy.

628
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,443
Don't let him do this. Come on!

629
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:52,865
I'm your hand twin!

630
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:57,787
Hello. One marriage, please.

631
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,412
We want to get married.

632
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:02,583
There's a service in progress.
Have a seat.

633
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:05,711
All right.

634
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:14,094
What are you doing?

635
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:17,013
The "Wedding March".
Does that freak you out?

636
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:20,684
No, it's the graduation song.

637
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,314
This is it.

638
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:28,275
We're gonna get married.

639
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:31,653
You sure you wanna do this?

640
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:38,034
Hello, Mrs. Ross!

641
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:42,915
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!

642
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,877
Wait. Okay.
