1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,590
- Morning, roomie.
- Hey!

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:10,636
You remembered
to put clothes on this morning.

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,305
Fifth day's a charm.

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:18,853
It's so great to be back here. You're
making it so easy on me and Emma.

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,981
It's great having you back.
Stay as long as you want.

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,984
And when does she stop
crying all night?

7
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,698
Hey! You're not naked.

8
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,368
Rach, when will we expect
to see you tonight?

9
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:38,414
Probably around 6. But she's
in the bedroom, all ready to go.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,373
But she fell back to sleep, so...

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,628
She's probably exhausted from all that
adorable screaming she did last night.

12
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,296
- Bye.
- Bye.

13
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,716
Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it
too hard on you.

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,052
No, hey, it's been great.

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,097
I just want you to know that
with Rachel staying here...

16
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,476
...all my feelings from before
are totally over.

17
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,977
And even if they weren't...

18
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,604
...when you walk in
on a woman using a breast pump...

19
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,316
- Yeah, that'll do it.
- Wow!

20
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,818
So how are you?

21
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,029
- I'm okay.
- Really?

22
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,366
Sure. I mean, do I wish me and Rachel
living together would have worked out?

23
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:18,370
Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,
but it's not like it's a divorce.

24
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,083
- Well, actually it...
- It's not a divorce. It is not a divorce!

25
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,255
Anyway, I think Rachel and I
need to get on with our lives.

26
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,841
Maybe start seeing other people.

27
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,551
Wow. Really?

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,222
Sure, why not? In fact, if you know
anyone that'd be good for me...?

29
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,475
- Sure. I know lots of girls.
- Any names come to mind?

30
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,936
Names?

31
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:50,277
The One With the Blind Date

34
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,858
- I was about to eat. Want something?
- What you got?

35
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:33,654
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,
strained carrots...

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,489
...strained plums.
We haven't tried that yet!

37
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,949
Goody!

38
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,994
Thanks.

39
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,248
So how is it living with Rachel again?

40
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,042
I mean, apart from the great food?

41
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,086
I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just...

42
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,756
It's just weird what's happening
with her and Ross.

43
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,425
Yesterday he asked me to fix him up
with somebody.

44
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,136
Rachel asked me
if I knew anyone for her too.

45
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,388
- Why are they doing this?
- I don't know.

46
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,932
They're so perfect for each other.
It's crazy.

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,267
You know what's crazy? These jars.

48
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,188
What is there, like, two bites in here?

49
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,901
I just wish they'd realize
they should be together.

50
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,572
When they moved in together, I
figured that's where things were headed.

51
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,992
They should be a family. They should
marry and have more children.

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,538
Yes. And they should name
one of their kids Joey.

53
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,166
I may not have kids. Someone's
got to carry on the family name.

54
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,964
You know what? Maybe once they
start dating and see what's out there...

55
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,842
...they'll realize how good
they are for each other.

56
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,844
Yeah, because it is slim pickings.

57
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,098
I had this date last night. Yuck!

58
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,852
But we should probably keep it down,
she's still in the bedroom.

59
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,023
So, what are we gonna do? Are we
just gonna set them up with people?

60
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,902
I know, that just pushes them
further and further apart.

61
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,698
I know what we can do. We could set
Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...

62
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,409
...so they'll realize
how good they are together.

63
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,703
- That's a great plan.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:09,208
You know what the best part of it is?
I get to do my plan laugh.

65
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,717
Okay, shh! Not so loud.
We don't want to wake up...

66
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,983
Hi. You guys aren't
doing anything tonight, are you?

67
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,696
See, now, why would you assume that?
Just because we're married?

68
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:43,617
I mean, I will have you know
that we are very hip, happening people.

69
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,955
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to
get back to reading the obituaries.

70
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,750
I was just asking because I need
someone to watch Emma tonight.

71
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,711
Sure we'll do it.
What are you up to?

72
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,922
- Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
- Oh, my God.

73
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:01,176
- Why? What's the big deal?
- I figured because you and Ross are...

74
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:05,430
What? Slept together a year
and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.

75
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,102
I think it's great you're going on a date.
It sounds healthy.

76
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:13,981
I mean, you have needs.
Embrace your womanhood.

77
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,193
You want a job? Turn off "Oprah"
and send out a resume.

78
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,157
- I'll bring her by around 7, okay?
- That's perfect.

79
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,785
You guys are gonna have so much fun.
She's at such a cute age.

80
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,622
A couple things. Now that she eats
solid food, she poops around the clock.

81
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,583
And watch out for your hair
because she likes to grab it.

82
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,213
She's also in this phase where if you
leave the room, she screams, but...

83
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,340
Thanks, you guys. Have fun.

84
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:47,139
Suddenly I wish I was reading
my own name.

85
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,269
Joey, hey. I'm so excited.

86
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:56,190
- I set Rachel up with the worst guy.
- All right. Who is he?

87
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,692
It's a guy I used to massage.
By "massage"...

88
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,905
...I mean hold down so he wouldn't
turn over and flash me.

89
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,783
- Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
- Oh, yeah.

90
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:12,205
Okay. She's this really boring woman.
She's a teacher.

91
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,253
- A teacher?
- She's into history and foreign movies.

92
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,421
And she loves puzzles.

93
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,675
Come on, who loves puzzles?

94
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,593
Well, Ross does.

95
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,180
You're ruining the plan!

96
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:31,517
Joey, you fixed him up
with his perfect woman.

97
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,560
- Oh, my God, you're right!
- Yeah.

98
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,563
She even reads for pleasure!

99
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:42,110
- How do you know a woman like that?
- I'm not allowed to know smart women?

100
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:46,073
- Joey?
- We met at the library. I went in to pee.

101
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,036
- So now what do we do?
- Well, okay.

102
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:55,124
I'll call her and tell her the date's
canceled and find him somebody else.

103
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,546
What if we don't find him somebody
else? We'll just tell her the date's off...

104
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:05,091
...but we don't tell Ross. He'll go
to the restaurant and get stood up.

105
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,345
I hear that's bad.

106
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,807
So this is great. Rachel's
gonna have a terrible date...

107
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:15,978
...Ross gets stood up, and then they'll
realize how good they have it together.

108
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,896
Yes, the plan.

109
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,734
It's not Santa's plan.

110
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,573
No, it's...

111
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,915
- Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
- No, I think we killed it.

112
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,420
Emma? Emma, look at me!

113
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:46,383
Well, I think I'll go downstairs
for a while.

114
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,475
No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay!
I didn't go!

115
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,894
Don't cry, it's just a bit!

116
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,773
I'm your uncle Chandler.
Funny is all I have!

117
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:06,444
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be
ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.

118
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,823
So don't touch yourself
for the next 48 hours.

119
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,993
I don't do that.

120
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,913
I'll try to stop.

121
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,332
- Did you say until the 6th?
- Yeah.

122
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,166
Today is the 6th.

123
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,461
No, it's not.

124
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,340
Yes, it's also 2003.

125
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,092
Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?

126
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,094
I may be done ovulating!

127
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,640
I may have also served some very
questionable meat at the restaurant.

128
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,852
- Go take the test, see if we're okay.
- Okay.

129
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,237
Tough crib.

130
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:52,532
Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks?
There's only one here.

131
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:59,122
I might have checked to see
if I was ovulating a couple times.

132
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,545
I'm not working! There's not much
to do around here!

133
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,518
Excuse me.

134
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:23,022
Is there a woman waiting at the bar?

135
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,901
Someone average height, dark hair?
Or perhaps doing a puzzle?

136
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,071
There's a drunk Chinese guy.

137
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,701
Well, if I'm still here in an hour,
buy him a drink on me.

138
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,161
Can I get you another glass of wine?

139
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,790
I don't know if I should.
I don't want to be drunk when I...

140
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,209
...go home alone tonight.

141
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:49,465
- Got stood up, huh?
- It's no big deal. It's just a blind date.

142
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,302
Are you worried your date came,
saw you and left?

143
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,763
No!

144
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,977
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.

145
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:06,732
Oh, good, because as of 4:00
this afternoon, I am not.

146
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,611
So let's do this.

147
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,238
- I don't think I can.
- Oh, come on.

148
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:17,159
I know you're not 18 anymore,
but give it a minute.

149
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,497
- Because of Emma.
- Oh, my God, Emma.

150
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,499
Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.

151
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,627
You're right, we can't do this.
We can't leave her alone.

152
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,629
Sorry.

153
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,757
Unless...

154
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:34,260
...maybe we do it here.

155
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,429
I mean, how much can she even
be aware of at this age?

156
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:41,684
She's aware when we leave a room.
She may notice if we start...

157
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,810
...canoodling in it.

158
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,898
- Canoodling?
- Well, I can't say hump or screw...

159
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,150
...in front of the B-A-B-Y.

160
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,780
I don't know,
I guess having sex in front of a baby...

161
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:58,117
...isn't so...
- Horrifying? Scarring?

162
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,911
Something people go to jail for?

163
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,665
- I guess you're right.
- You guess?

164
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,125
At that bed-and-breakfast,
we didn't have sex...

165
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,337
...because you thought a deer
was staring through the window.

166
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:14,341
Well, what kind of a sick bastard
wants to do it in front of a deer?

167
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,226
Wow, everything looks so good.

168
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,354
I think I'm gonna have the chicken.

169
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,651
I just have to say this.

170
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:38,115
- You're really beautiful.
- Wow, that's very sweet. Thank you.

171
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,452
I'm kind of funny-looking.

172
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,289
- What?
- Look, I mean, come on...

173
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:49,376
...you're way out of my league.
Everybody in here knows it.

174
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,837
I bet that guy over there
is probably saying:

175
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,798
"Why's she out with him?
He must be rich."

176
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,802
Well, I'm not.

177
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,515
What do you think you want to order?
I'm real excited about that chicken.

178
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,852
I'm not funny, either.

179
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,272
So if you were thinking,
"Well, he's not that good-looking...

180
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:14,652
...but maybe we'll have some laughs,"
that ain't gonna happen.

181
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:20,532
Well, come on, Steve,
let's not rule out nervous laughter.

182
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,371
Hey, now, wait a minute,
Phoebe told me...

183
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,665
...that you owned your own restaurant.
That's impressive.

184
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:33,086
I lost it to drugs.

185
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,718
I silk-screen T-shirts now.

186
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:43,472
Really?
What's that like?

187
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,517
It's really fulfilling doing something
you hate for no money.

188
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,564
That's right. I have no money,
I'm not funny...

189
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:58,237
...I live in a studio apartment
with two other guys.

190
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:03,158
And I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.

191
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,956
Now, come on. Come on, Steve.

192
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,542
There must be something
that you like about yourself.

193
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,380
I do like my hair.

194
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,009
Really?

195
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,023
- Hello?
- Phoebe, it's me!

196
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:38,486
I'm going to hunt you down
and kill you.

197
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,823
Hey, Rach!

198
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,202
This is the worst date ever! How could
you set me up with this creep?

199
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,539
You know, you are talking about
one of my dear, dear friends.

200
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,583
I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.

201
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,461
All right, so he gets a little crazy
when he's stoned.

202
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,758
- He's not stoned.
- Did he go out for a cigarette?

203
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,262
- Yeah. Four times.
- My dear, sweet Rach.

204
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:12,019
Well, our plan is working.
Rachel's having a miserable time...

205
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,230
...and Ross is stood up somewhere
at a restaurant all alone.

206
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,441
Pretty soon they'll be back together.

207
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,612
By the time anyone's figured out what
we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.

208
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:27,451
Oh, wait, that's the end
of a different plan.

209
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,621
She's asleep. Chandler?

210
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,086
- What are you doing?
- Emma was doing it.

211
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,088
She's asleep.

212
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,969
- She's asleep. That means we can...
- Yes. But we have to be fast.

213
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,846
Oh, okay, I'll try.

214
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,267
- And you can't make any noise.
- Okay, I'll try.

215
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,650
Hello?

216
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,654
Emma?

217
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,577
Hey! Hi!

218
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,664
How are you? How are you?

219
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,916
Where are your babysitters, huh?

220
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,421
Why is the bedroom door closed?

221
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:31,474
You can't have S-E-X
when you're taking care of a B-A-B-l-E.

222
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:40,941
I've got bad news.
The Chinese guy left.

223
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:45,488
If it was meant to be, it's meant to be.

224
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,531
Look, you got stood up. Who cares?

225
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,618
We're gonna show you a good time.
Sit and relax.

226
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:54,496
In fact, let me bring you
a crab-cake appetizer on the house.

227
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,458
Wow, free crab cakes?
Well, that's nice.

228
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:02,880
Although I was hoping
to have sex tonight.

229
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,012
Just the crab cakes.

230
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,684
What are you doing? Are you trying
to get him to stay? You can't do that.

231
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,687
- Just get out of here, okay?
- I'm sorry, what's going on?

232
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:22,358
Okay, the waiters have
a little pool going.

233
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:27,112
We have a bet on how long it'll take
before you give up and go home.

234
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:31,033
What?!

235
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,328
You're making money off my misery?

236
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:37,205
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.

237
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:41,960
This is unbelievable. I have never
been so insulted in my life.

238
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:45,964
Now, if you'll wrap up my free
crab cakes, I'll be on my way.

239
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:53,138
Well, that was weird.
You were loud and I was fast.

240
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,849
I think we may have
really done it this time.

241
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,061
I wish I didn't have to wait
to take a pregnancy test.

242
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,522
You may want to get
some more of those too.

243
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,567
Where's Emma?

244
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,362
Oh, my God, where's Emma?
Where's Emma?

245
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,990
Don't ask me.
I was in there canoodling you.

246
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,370
Okay. Okay. I'm sure that Rachel
came home early and picked up Emma.

247
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,582
You go look across the hall,
and I'll call her cell.

248
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,250
You better hope we're pregnant...

249
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:25,378
...because one way or another,
we're giving a baby back to Rachel!

250
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,801
I can't believe I'm crying
in front of you.

251
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,137
You must think I'm so pathetic.

252
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,640
No, no, no, I admire a man
who can cry.

253
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:40,227
- Really?
- Don't touch my coat.

254
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,147
Sorry, that's my phone.

255
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,733
- Hello?
- Hey, Rach, how's it going?

256
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:49,862
Oh, my God,
this is the worst date ever.

257
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,240
Oh, come on.

258
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,536
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did
you really think that this was going well?

259
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,833
- What's up?
- Hey, did you stop by here?

260
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,545
<i>- No.</i>
- Oh, my God! Then...

261
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,007
Thank God! Emma, there you are!

262
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,470
What? What do you mean,
"there you are"? Where was she?

263
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:21,309
We were playing peekaboo.
She loves it when I'm dramatic.

264
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:28,818
- Why the hell did you take her?
- Because you two were having sex!

265
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:34,198
- No, we weren't.
- Don't you lie to me.

266
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:38,577
I can tell by Chandler's hair. You are
so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?

267
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,667
All right. All right, we were.

268
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,503
We're trying to make a baby.
Monica's ovulating.

269
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,715
It's unacceptable that you'd
have sex with Emma in the next room.

270
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:55,511
- I'll have to tell Rachel about this.
- Please don't. She will kill us.

271
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,471
Hey, I gotta. Unless...

272
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,182
Unless what?

273
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,185
Unless you name
your first-born child Joey.

274
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,023
- What? Why?
- Hey, I may never have kids...

275
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,693
...and somebody's gotta
carry on my family name.

276
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:15,239
Your family name is Tribbiani.

277
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,290
You almost had me.

278
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,465
Look...

279
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,885
...I think I know the answer
to this question, but...

280
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,764
...would you like to make love to me?

281
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,356
Really, really not.

282
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,401
It's just as well.

283
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,029
It doesn't work anyway.

284
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,957
All right, well, that's good to know.
Good night, Steve.

285
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,678
- Hey, what's wrong?
- I just had a rough night.

286
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,014
Crab cake?

287
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,517
Well, what happened?

288
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:28,479
This is kind of weird
to talk to you about this, but...

289
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,730
Monica told me you had a blind date.

290
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,776
- Yeah.
- I did too.

291
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:38,155
But is it technically a date
if the other person doesn't show up?

292
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:43,493
Oh, no. Do you think she walked in,
saw you and left?

293
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,458
Why does everyone keep saying that?

294
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,712
If it makes you feel any better,
I wish my date hadn't shown up.

295
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,841
- That bad?
- Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...

296
00:20:57,007 --> 00:21:00,594
...and he thought it would be
appropriate to give me...

297
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,847
...this.

298
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,476
"Female Body Inspector"?

299
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,147
What size is that?

300
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:16,026
Now wait a minute. So they're gonna
name their first child Joey?

301
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,904
How do I get them to name
the next one after me?

302
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:22,074
It's easy. You just
walk in on them having sex.

303
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:26,245
Oh, so they owe me,
like, three Phoebes.

304
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,915
Oh, my God!
Look, it's Ross and Rachel!

305
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,791
The plan is working!

306
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,713
Don't do the plan laugh.

307
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:40,842
The first dates we've had in months,
and they were both such disasters.

308
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,930
You know, it is weird...

309
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:49,560
...that Phoebe would set me up
on a date that was awful...

310
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:54,314
...on the same night Joey set you up
on a date that didn't even show.

311
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,567
Wait a minute.

312
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,695
You don't think it was intentional?

313
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,407
I mean, that's just stupid.

314
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:05,742
We're geniuses.

315
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:11,832
- Look at them! They're really bonding.
- They're falling in love all over again.

316
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,211
Oh, they see us. Oh, they look mad.

317
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,382
They figured it out.
They're coming. Run!

318
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,676
- Where?
- Mexico!

319
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,143
Can you believe they're still not here?

320
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,688
I know. A double blind date
and we both get stood up.

321
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,066
What are the chances?

322
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:40,319
I know, I'm so bummed.

323
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,862
Could we have
our free crab cakes now?

00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,409
- What?
- We've been stood up.

325
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:50,579
And we want our free crab cakes.

326
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,373
Guys, give it a rest.
Nobody's betting on you tonight.

327
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,919
Although we do have a pool going
to see how long it takes that guy to cry.

328
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,258
I have such fat hands!
