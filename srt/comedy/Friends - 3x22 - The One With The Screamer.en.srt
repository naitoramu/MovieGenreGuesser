1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,490
Are you still on hold?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,000
I was supposed to call my dad back
two hours ago.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,690
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,810
Call him as soon as you get a chance.
He's at Flimbees.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,210
What's Flimbees?

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,290
That's the word I use when
I can't remember the real thing.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,090
Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,330
No. That's what they want me to do.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,090
My warranty expires tomorrow.
If I don't get through. . .

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,890
. . .they won't fix my crappy,
broken phone for free!

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,130
We cannot let them win!
It's us versus them!

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,690
Yes!

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,290
I gotta double-check for tickets
tonight. Who got what?

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,490
I have one.

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,040
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,570
My boyfriend.

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,570
I have a boyfriend now.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,490
Two it is. How about you?

19
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,610
Yeah, I also need two.

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,130
Really? Who's number two?

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,690
Whose Number Two? One of the more
difficult games sewer workers play.

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,610
No, it's just this person.

23
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,570
Like a date-type person?

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,490
Yeah, kind of.
It's this woman from work.

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,490
I hope that won't be too weird.
Will it, Rach?

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,730
Not at all. I was actually
gonna bring someone myself.

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,130
But you said one ticket.

28
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,610
I meant me plus one.

29
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,650
Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

30
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,530
All right. I'll see you tonight.

31
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,690
Okay. Bye-bye.

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,850
Bye-bye.

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,850
Okay, I need a date!

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,090
Oh, hey! You guys are finally
gonna get to meet Kate!

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,760
And I borrowed your cologne.
I hope she likes it.

36
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,540
What are you doing?
She's seeing somebody.

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,970
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,210
-Bottle next to the shaving cream.
-Worm medicine for the duck.

39
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,330
The One With the Screamer

41
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,890
-Here you go. You can wear this.
-Thanks.

42
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,170
I'm setting the phone down.

43
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,650
But I'm still here.

44
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,890
Just don't go anywhere.
I'm still here.

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,250
Don't switch or anything, because
I'm right here. Just one sec.

46
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,650
One sec. One second!

47
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,250
Wait! One second! Just. . . .

48
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,850
What? Monica, I'm scared!

49
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,970
Honey, that's a sleeve.

50
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,600
And we also have a speakerphone.

51
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,930
Please stay on the line.
Your call is important to us.

52
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,090
You gotta hang up.
We'll be late.

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,890
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

54
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,440
Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!

55
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,290
You were gonna have me hang up.

56
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,930
Can you take a duck and a chick
to the theater?

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,610
Of course not.

58
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,610
I just wanted them to hear it
from somebody else.

59
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,490
Oh, hi, how are you?

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,770
Good.

61
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,330
-Looks like we're the first ones here.
-Looks that way.

62
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,690
First ones here!

63
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,690
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,090
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin.
Cailin--

65
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,250
Sorry.

66
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,890
And break!

67
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,360
I think I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room.

68
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,690
-I'll join you.
-I'll get our seats.

69
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,370
Well, this is. . .

70
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,680
. . .awkward.

71
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,890
Well, because Rachel and I
used to go out.

72
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,730
Oh, I didn't know that.

73
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,530
Well, then this is awkward.

74
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,640
-So what do you. . .?
-I think we're here.

75
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,690
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

76
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,010
I think you may be in our seats.

77
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,250
No, I don't think so.

78
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,890
-Could we take a look at your ticket?
-Sure.

79
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,410
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-1 3" . . . .

80
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,090
Oh, well, I thought that--

81
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,810
You thought? Well, that didn't
really work out for you. Idiot!

82
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,850
What are you, a moron?
It says, "D-1 3" ! Okay?

83
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,090
You're surrounded by even numbers!
Does that give you a clue?

84
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,210
-The usher told me--
-The usher must be right!

85
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,090
With all his training!

86
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,600
Get out!

87
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,450
Here!

88
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,490
-Hey, man, you want the aisle?
-No, I'm good.

89
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,130
-There he is!
-There's our star!

90
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,890
You were great!

91
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,290
So? What'd you think?

92
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,280
Almost as good as the play with
the two naked girls on the seesaw.

93
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,090
-I wasn't in that.
-I know.

94
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,130
I want you to meet everybody.
Everybody, this is Kate.

95
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,680
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sweetheart!

96
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,490
Come!

97
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,290
So that's the girl you like.

98
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,940
I tell you, this guy
Rachel is with is crazy.

99
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,770
He viciously screamed at total
strangers. I think he's bad news.

100
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,650
Wait a minute. You don't like
the guy Rachel's dating?

101
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,120
Well, that's odd.

102
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,530
Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is
Kate's understudy, Lauren.

103
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,690
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

104
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,530
I ran into you in the hallway
in your building.

105
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,480
It was right after I slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.

106
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,050
So how'd you guys meet?

107
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,130
The short version is, I pursued
her for a couple of months.

108
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,330
Then I gave her a check for $20,000
and she was mine.

109
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,290
In the long version, I dump him
for telling people the short version.

110
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,410
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

111
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,930
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

112
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,290
How do you do?

113
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,450
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

114
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,970
Do they have representation?

115
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,570
They weren't in the play.

116
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,120
We're not actors.

117
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,330
What a shame!

118
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,730
With her face and her chest,
I could really put something together.

119
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,210
Could I borrow it?

120
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,330
Hi. Remember me?

121
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,620
Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line
for the bathroom. . .

122
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,770
. . .and someone just cut.
I think he's gonna snap.

123
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,490
I'm gonna go.

124
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,080
Go? Why?

125
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,970
I don't know. Could be
because I don't feel like. . .

126
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,210
. . .waiting all night for a guy
who may or may not scream.

127
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,730
He definitely will scream.

128
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,090
Goodbye.

129
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,690
Here we go, people!

130
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,370
"Boxing Day.

131
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,170
The Lucille Lortel Theatre. . . .

132
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,650
Joey Tribbiani gives
an uneven performance.

133
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,210
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst
thing in this production. "

134
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,410
Yes!

135
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,210
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered
portrayal is laughable. "

136
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,610
Here it is! "The direction. . .

137
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,970
. . .by Marshall Townend is. . . . "

138
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,530
Thank you, boys and girls.

139
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,290
You've ruined my life.

140
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,890
Please stuff your talentless faces. . .

141
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,450
. . .with my mother's crab cakes!

142
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,480
Excuse me!

143
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,930
Does anyone mind if I save this?

144
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,050
-Is the play over?
-Where were you?

145
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,090
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

146
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,890
You were "the next caller" hours ago.
You must be going crazy.

147
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,210
I've kept myself busy.

148
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,290
Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in
her room and her stuff in your room.

149
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,130
You okay?

150
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,370
Fabulous.

151
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,330
Drama critics, they're nothing but
people who couldn't make it as actors.

152
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,810
-You know what to do?
-Become a drama critic.

153
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,890
I am hurt!

154
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,090
A plague. . .

155
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,570
. . .on both your houses!

156
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,490
By the way, he dumped me tonight
after he read my review.

157
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,410
Oh, classy.

158
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,330
I sure know how to pick them.

159
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,890
You know I gave up a part
on a soap for this?

160
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,570
I gave up a job too.

161
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,810
-Really? What?
-Declawing cats.

162
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,340
Hey, tell you what,
let me walk you home.

163
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,570
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn
every copy of The Times and The Post.

164
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,010
-Why The Post?
-You didn't see The Post?

165
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,930
-No. You?
-No. Why?

166
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,890
You really think these newspapers
are just jealous of me?

167
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,250
Absolutely. You're talented
and you're good-looking.

168
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,120
You're sweet and cute.

169
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,680
I know. That's why they trashed me.

170
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,650
-Wait. Wait a minute.
-What?

171
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,290
I don't get you.

172
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,370
I mean, first you hate me.

173
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,170
Then you sleep with me.

174
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,330
Then you want nothing to do with me.
Now you want me again?

175
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,040
You never went out
with an actress before?

176
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,090
Kate, do you even like me?

177
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,290
-Of course I do.
-So how come you blew me off?

178
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,810
-How come you were with him?
-I don't know.

179
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,130
I just do this.

180
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,530
I always have to pick, like,
the smartest guy. . .

181
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,290
. . .or the most talented guy.

182
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,880
Why can't I just
pick someone like you?

183
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,040
Thanks.

184
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,810
You know what I mean.

185
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,970
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

186
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,010
You're just so. . . .

187
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,410
You're so. . .

188
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,610
: : :so: : : :

189
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,540
Here we go.
Let's get your feet up there.

190
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,410
Good night.

191
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,850
Sweet dreams.

192
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,690
I'm gonna put this can right here
in case you have to hurl.

193
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,690
Please stay on the line.
Your call is very important to us.

194
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,930
You've been up for 24 hours.
Go to sleep.

195
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,290
This isn't healthy.

196
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,090
No, no, I'm fine.

197
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,610
And you know why?
Because of all the riboflavin.

198
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,730
Didn't you have that on last night?

199
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,450
I stayed at Kate's
but nothing happened.

200
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,010
Hey, where were you?

201
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,880
I'm so, so sorry.
I am definitely gonna see your play.

202
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,330
I swear, your play is very important
to us. Thank you for your patience.

203
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,370
Your play is the next play
I'm gonna see.

204
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,490
How'd it go with Kate?

205
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,490
It was great!

206
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,210
I walked her home, and it was
amazing how much we connected.

207
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,810
Then she passed out.

208
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,730
But then she woke up.

209
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,280
And we stayed up all night talking.

210
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,570
And now we're crazy about each other!

211
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,530
You had "the night" !

212
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,490
When two people realize
their feelings for each other. . .

213
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,090
. . .and they talk for hours and learn
all about the other person.

214
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,280
You think?

215
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,290
-Did you learn about her family?
-Two brothers. One died!

216
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,370
Yes!

217
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,290
This is from the woman at the bar.

218
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,490
Sorry. She thought
you were somebody else.

219
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,330
-What time is it?
-One.

220
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,970
7: 1 5.

221
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,330
Watch doesn't work.

222
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,690
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.

223
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,760
Look, I wasn't gonna
say anything to you, but. . . .

224
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,490
All right, I don't think
you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

225
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,760
You don't?

226
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,130
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.
I think you should stay away from him.

227
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,490
Or maybe I should stay away
from all men.

228
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,090
It's not just because I'm jealous.

229
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,050
I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.

230
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,970
Look, the guy actually screamed
at this couple sitting in our seats.

231
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,490
Yeah, and at the end of the play. . .

232
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,490
. . .he got up, and he just started,
like, banging his hands together.

233
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,290
You don't want to believe me,
that's fine.

234
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,650
We're kidding.

235
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,330
No one believe me.
I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

236
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,450
-Sorry, Tommy.
-What's in the cup?

237
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,090
What is in the cup?

238
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,360
Okay, it's coffee.

239
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,770
Iced coffee?
Tell me it's iced coffee.

240
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,810
-It's hot--
-Hot coffee!

241
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,730
You idiot! You gonna spill
hot coffee all over me, huh?

242
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,250
What are you? Just a big, stupid
doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

243
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,880
What's your favorite thing
about summertime?

244
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,970
Going to the beach
when it stays light real late.

245
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,810
What's your favorite thing
about summer?

246
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,810
I don't know. Probably the smell
of freshly cut grass.

247
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,770
That's a good one.

248
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,330
Sorry! Sorry I'm late! My duck and
my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

249
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,090
We held the curtain for you.
Let's go!

250
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,210
vic! Where have you been, baby?

251
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,250
Where's Kate?

252
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,810
She got a job in L.A.

253
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,210
I've been waiting up all night
for you. Where have you been?

254
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,370
Where have you been, vic?

255
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,080
Go to the window. I wanna run down
to the truck and show you something.

256
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,650
What do you got down there, vic?

257
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,280
What do you got under that tarp?

258
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,330
When is she leaving?

259
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,170
Tonight. What are you doing?

260
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,930
I'm coming up!

261
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,290
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

262
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,940
Use ours across the hall
because she. . .

263
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,490
. . .has problems.

264
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,690
Thanks.

265
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,530
Sorry, Tommy.

266
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,450
I almost spilled this
hot coffee on you.

267
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,090
Yeah, but you didn't.

268
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,480
No, but. . .

269
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,200
. . .it's hot.

270
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,290
Would you stop it?
It's getting really old.

271
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,410
I can't believe no one believes me.

272
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,170
I do. I believe you.

273
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,570
You do?

274
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,010
Yeah. But I also believed her
when she said I was next.

275
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,210
Hey there, little fella.

276
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,690
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

277
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,810
Gross!

278
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,290
Idiot!

279
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,130
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

280
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,130
"Oh, look at me! I'm so cute!
I'm a little chick who's disgusting! "

281
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,760
You're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?

282
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,450
What are you quacking about?

283
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,410
Dumb Donald Dodo!

284
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,650
Step away from the duck.

285
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,890
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

286
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,050
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

287
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,010
I guess we're not going out anymore.

288
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,240
Man!

289
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,130
Joey, I'm so glad I caught you.
I couldn't find you before.

290
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,370
What's all this about L.A.?

291
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,530
They still want me
for General Hospital.

292
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,570
But. . .

293
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,410
. . .what about us?

294
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,690
Last night was wonderful.

295
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,690
But I can't stay here just for you.

296
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,650
So stay for the museums.

297
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,650
-I'm sorry.
-Joey, on-stage!

298
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,330
At least stay till the end
of the play.

299
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,290
I'll go to the airport with you.
I want to say goodbye.

300
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,890
Where are you, vic?

301
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,570
Flight's in an hour.
I gotta go.

302
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,090
vic?

303
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,250
vic?

304
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,490
-vic!
-In a minute!

305
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,250
So this is it, victor?

306
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,250
Yeah. I guess it is.

307
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,960
Listen. . .

308
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,370
. . .I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say
it quick because this is killing me.

309
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,370
One thing you gotta know
is that I will never forget you.

310
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,330
But you got things
you have to do now.

311
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,090
And so do l.

312
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,130
And so. . .

313
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,890
. . .I'm gonna get on
this spaceship. . .

314
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,090
. . .and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7
in search of alternative fuels.

315
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,170
But when I return
200 years from now. . .

316
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,810
. . .you'll be long gone. . .

317
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,330
. . .but I won't have aged at all.

318
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,090
So you tell your great,
great granddaughter. . .

319
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,690
. . .to look me up.

320
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,010
Because, Adrianne. . .

321
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,690
. . .baby. . .

322
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,890
. . .I'm gonna want to meet her.

323
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,050
So long, vic!

324
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,050
It's been two days.

325
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,770
Yeah, I know.

326
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,210
Good thing it's one of those
801 numbers, right?

327
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,130
Phoebe, 800 is toll free.
801 is Utah.

328
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,010
It has to be 800 because all those
big companies have 800 numbers.

329
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,170
Every. . . .

330
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,330
Yeah, every big Utah-based company
has one.

331
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,530
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will pay you back.

332
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,690
And yet she's still not
hanging up the phone.

333
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,490
-Hang up!
-Hang up the phone!

334
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,130
Fine! Fine!

335
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,050
Well, I think I broke it.

336
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,080
But that's all right.
Here's the number where you can call.
