1
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,882
Wow! You look nice.
What's the occasion?

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,801
Monica and I are celebrating
our 10-month anniversary.

3
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,054
Got reservations at Jean-George.

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,305
How'd you get in?

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,557
Made a few calls,
pulled some strings...

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:21,438
...and they'll seat us if we both
have chicken and don't get dessert.

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,900
- Hi, Chandler.
- Hey, Caitlin.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,276
Somebody got a haircut.

9
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,904
I hate it. I look like
an eight-year-old boy.

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:34,368
If that was true, gym class
would've been more interesting.

11
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,956
- It's $27 even.
- Okay. Here you go.

12
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,249
Where's the chicken?

13
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,419
It's in the back.
The duck pissed him off.

14
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,005
He said that eggs came first.

15
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,800
- Thanks. I'll see you later.
- Bye.

16
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,471
What the hell was that?

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,181
- What?
- The flirting.

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,602
Aren't you supposed to be going out
with, let's see, my sister?

19
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:01,896
I wasn't flirting.

20
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:08,151
It was totally flirting!
"Somebody got a haircut..."

21
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,281
First of all, the impression?
Uncanny.

22
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:16,744
Second, that wasn't flirting.
That was just casual conversation.

23
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,287
Yeah, right.

24
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,623
You wanna see flirting?
I'll show you.

25
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,835
I'm good.

26
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:28,339
The One Where Ross Can't Flirt

27
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,262
I am so proud of Joey.

28
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,598
- He's gonna be on "Law and Order"!
- I know.

29
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,060
Don't you think it should
be called "Order and Law"?

30
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,063
No, because they arrest the guy
and then try him.

31
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,525
Don't get me started on that.

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,487
- I was not flirting.
- And on your anniversary. For shame!

33
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,571
What's going on?

34
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,324
He was hitting on
the hot delivery girl.

35
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,827
I was not. And oh, God!

36
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,998
You were. If anyone
should be hitting on her...

37
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,083
...it's the guy who's single...

38
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,418
...the guy who can do
something about it.

39
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:53,299
Sounds like someone wants to be
Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.

40
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,261
Is that what this is about?
You like Caitlin?

41
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:03,392
Ross, we broke up two years ago.
You've been married since then.

42
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:07,563
I think it's okay
that we see other people.

43
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,733
I was watching her
at the pizza place.

44
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:15,613
And she was just so sexy and funny
and has the cutest little...

45
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,949
We don't need her measurements.

46
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,118
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.

47
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,581
She's pretty and you love her,
but is she stupid?

48
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,832
She forgot my vegetarian.

49
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:32,004
This is perfect. She'll have
to come back here with your pizza.

50
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:37,092
And when she does,
I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.

51
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,928
I am so glad you don't eat meat.

52
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,724
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.

53
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,728
Hey, everybody, look who's here!
You remember my grandmother.

54
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,980
- Big night!
- Yeah, it's so cool.

55
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,774
Joey on "Law and Order".
You must be proud.

56
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,319
She doesn't understand
a word of English.

57
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,531
I thought you were
Joey's other grandmother.

58
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,410
I've done it again.

59
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,871
Nonnie's my biggest fan.

60
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:10,709
She's the only one in the family
who's always believed in me.

61
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:18,133
My big fat Joey star.

62
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:25,224
Yeah, I weighed, like,
27 pounds when I was born.

63
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:32,230
- Happy anniversary!
- Happy anniversary, 10 months.

64
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,859
In the shower I was thinking
about our first night in London.

65
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,153
Joey's grandmother's right there.

66
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,947
- The one who speaks English?
- The one who doesn't.

67
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,243
That was some hot love you gave me.

68
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,870
- I'll get ready.
- Wear those earrings I got you.

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,334
That's a great idea. I was saving
them for something special.

70
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,380
- You've got to go home.
- But I like it here.

71
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,717
Get the earrings you borrowed.
He wants me to wear them.

72
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:06,515
I think they're in my purse.
Go get dressed and I'll look for them.

73
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:12,146
I need those earrings you borrowed.

74
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:18,194
Yeah, I'll be right back.

75
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,829
Pheebs, you speak Italian?

76
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,748
I guess so.

77
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,045
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Where's the other one?

78
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:40,132
Oh, what, you want both of them?

79
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,718
Rachel Karen Greene,
where's the other one?

80
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,971
Look, just don't freak out,
but I kind of lost it.

81
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:50,016
I know it's in the apartment,
but I definitely lost it.

82
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,228
What'll I tell Monica?
She wants to wear them tonight.

83
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,400
- Tell her to wear her own earrings.
- These are her earrings.

84
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:04,865
You lent me her earrings?
I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!

85
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,619
- Why not?
- Because I lose her stuff!

86
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:20,423
You see that blind guy?
I'm gonna bash his head in later.

87
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,051
My big scene's coming up.
The big scene coming up.

88
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:31,225
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up",
would she know the difference?

89
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,602
What are you doing?

90
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,814
Oh, I just can't watch.
It's too scary.

91
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,317
It's a diaper commercial.

92
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:46,198
Yeah, well, you know me.
Babies, responsibilities...

93
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:52,037
- Pizza delivery.
- I'll get it! I will get that!

94
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:59,503
One vegetarian pizza.
It's 12.50.

95
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,131
By the way, if it makes
you feel any better...

96
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:06,051
...I happen to like
eight-year-old boys.

97
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,390
What?

98
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,726
Your hair.
Before. Your hair.

99
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:18,981
You said you thought your hair
looked like an eight-year-old boy's...

100
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,567
...and I'm just saying I like it.

101
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,653
The hair.

102
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,323
Thanks.

103
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,413
You understand, I don't actually
like eight-year-old boys.

104
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,249
All I'm looking for is the money.

105
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,918
Here you go.
Stop bringing us pizzas, you.

106
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,172
I'm gonna try.

107
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,341
You're welcome.

108
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,887
You couldn't let me have her,
could you?

109
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:54,016
This is a girl I really like,
and you had to swoop in there!

110
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,142
What?

111
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,771
Chandler was flirting
with the hot delivery girl.

112
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,858
Thank you for that.

113
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,568
I was not flirting.

114
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,862
It's okay. I don't care.
That's fine.

115
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,364
Really?

116
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:13,994
It's no big deal.
I do it all the time.

117
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,123
You flirt with guys all the time?

118
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:22,502
It doesn't mean anything. Just like
it doesn't mean anything with you.

119
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,130
There's a difference.
You're a lot hotter.

120
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,174
True story.

121
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,718
This actually bothers you?

122
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,512
Yes, and I think
it'd bother a lot of people.

123
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,390
When you and Ross dated...

124
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,643
...did it bother you
when he flirted with other women?

125
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:42,773
No, it bothered me when
he slept with other women.

126
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,736
And thank you for that.

127
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,821
I never had to worry.

128
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,826
He was never good
at the flirting thing.

129
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,330
What are you talking about?
It worked with you.

130
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,706
No, you're right.

131
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:05,463
We met, you flirted and then bam!
Nine years later, you had me.

132
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,880
All right.

133
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,175
You know what I'll do?
I'll order another pizza.

134
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,552
And when Caitlin gets here...

135
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,639
...I will show you how well I flirt.

136
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,849
I will get her phone number.

137
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,187
And not the one on the menu.

138
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,066
- I found it.
- Thank God! Where was it?

139
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,192
On your dresser.

140
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,987
Okay, that is the one we already have.

141
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,782
Here's my big scene.
My big scene's here.

142
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:38,161
<i>- Wanna bet nobody heard anything?</i>
<i>- No bet.</i>

143
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,872
<i>Anybody home?</i>

144
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,915
- Oh, my God.
- What?

145
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:46,503
Everybody keep smiling. It'll kill
my grandmother if she finds out.

146
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,587
What is it?

147
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,507
They cut me out of the show.

148
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,967
What?

149
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,594
- Are you sure?
- Maybe your scene's coming up.

150
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:58,223
Not likely. Because you see
that body bag right there?

151
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,101
I'm in it.

152
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,607
This is terrible.
What'll you do?

153
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,070
I don't know. This little
old lady lives for my career.

154
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,698
When they dumped me off
"Days of Our Lives", she almost died.

155
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:15,782
That's not good.

156
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,912
You're not smiling. Not that face!
Everybody smile!

157
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,540
Just tell her what happened.
It's not your fault.

158
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:29,004
If we keep talking this way,
won't we freak her out soon?

159
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,966
Soon. I'm gonna be on soon.

160
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:36,220
There I am!

161
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,056
Sam Waterston!

162
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,391
No, no. That's me.
That's me!

163
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,769
No. Sam Waterston.

164
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,772
<i>Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.</i>

165
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:51,109
She doesn't know "hello",
but she knows "Capricorn One".

166
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,781
I need those earrings.
We're leaving when the show's over.

167
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,785
But I already gave them back to you.

168
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,412
No, you didn't.

169
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:06,584
I already didn't gave them back to you.
That's what I said.

170
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,377
Where's that other earring?

171
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,754
It's not here, Pheebs.
It's not here.

172
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,839
I went to Chandler's last night.

173
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,177
Make sure you check
Chandler's jewelry box.

174
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,056
Chandler has a jewelry box?

175
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:25,185
We have 10 minutes. Do you
want me to get into that now?

176
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,357
Hey, Pheebs.

177
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,067
How's that...

178
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:37,155
...vegetarian pizza
working out for you?

179
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,159
You and those vegetables
have a real...

180
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,996
...thing going on, huh?

181
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,167
Why are you being weird?

182
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,503
Do you like it?

183
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,298
No. That'd be,
"Why are you being cute?"

184
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,551
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.

185
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,596
I did not get that.

186
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,433
So, Monica, do you like
"Law and Order"?

187
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,809
Yeah, it's good.

188
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,145
I found out all this stuff about you.
You like "Law and Order"...

189
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:14,234
...and you've flirted with every guy
in the tri-state area.

190
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,028
Okay, let me get this straight.

191
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,157
It's okay for you to flirt,
but not for me?

192
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,743
I'm glad we cleared that up.

193
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,663
I'm sorry, but some things are
different for men and women.

194
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,624
Teach me about men and women.

195
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:32,753
I've already taught you
so much already, but whatever.

196
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,839
When you flirt with a guy,
you think, "No big deal."

197
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,759
But he thinks, "Finally!
Somebody who wants to sleep with me."

198
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,304
- No way!
- It's true.

199
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,807
- Well, that's pathetic.
- Again, true.

200
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:49,812
- This goes for all guys?
- All guys that are awake.

201
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,021
We go to sleep.

202
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:56,318
All guys from the other end of the
world wake up and act the same way.

203
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,404
It's another commercial
and I still haven't told her.

204
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,491
Joey, this is the last commercial.

205
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,618
- You got 10 minutes left.
- I know!

206
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,745
What am I gonna do?

207
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,832
You will not run out
and leave her here.

208
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:15,337
Yeah, all right.

209
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:24,805
Joey's gonna be right back.
Right back?

210
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:28,809
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.

211
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:33,272
So, you're old and small.

212
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,070
Did you find it?

213
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,531
The earring, no.
But I found my sunglasses.

214
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,701
I've been looking for these
since last summer.

215
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:50,164
Those are mine.
You borrowed them from me.

216
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:54,126
Okay. Calm down.
Here they are.

217
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:00,132
- What do we do?
- I don't know. I don't know!

218
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,135
We'll just have
to tell Monica, that's all.

219
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,972
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.

220
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,266
I could tell her it was all my fault.

221
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,561
Oh, that'd be great.

222
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,523
Mon, could I talk to you?

223
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,483
Yeah. What is it?

224
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,653
I lost one of your earrings.

225
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:25,408
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

226
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,829
All right, what can you do?
If you lost it, you lost it.

227
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,040
I'll replace it. I promise.
I feel so terrible.

228
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,127
That's fine.
You didn't do it on purpose.

229
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,839
Look at you. Come here.

230
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,553
- You feel better?
- Yeah. You're the best.

231
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,430
Okay, wait a minute.

232
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,473
I can't do this.

233
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,185
Listen, honey,
it's not Phoebe's fault.

234
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,937
She lent me the earrings.

235
00:14:55,187 --> 00:15:00,275
I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible too.

236
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:05,030
That is exactly why
I do not lend you stuff!

237
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,908
First, my jewelry.
If it's not that, it's my sweater.

238
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,410
And if it's not that,
it's my sunglasses.

239
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,580
Your sunglasses?

240
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,415
Oh, right.

241
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,628
- Pizza.
- Mine, mine, mine!

242
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,004
Okay, here goes.

243
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,425
Prepare yourselves
for some class-A flirting.

244
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,761
Okay, hold on.

245
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:36,353
If you really like this girl, I don't
think flirting is the right way...

246
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,857
You'll see.

247
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,360
What's her name?

248
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,988
Caitlin!

249
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:58,041
We can't keep eating like this.

250
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:03,004
It's $12.50.

251
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:13,390
Do you make the pizzas in one
of those wood-burning ovens?

252
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:16,268
No, actually, I think they're gas.

253
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,271
Gas?

254
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,484
Intense.

255
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:28,655
If this is how all the Gellers flirt,
we don't have a problem.

256
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:34,244
You know that smell gas has?

257
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,293
They put that in.

258
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,377
What?

259
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,672
The gas is odorless.

260
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:50,970
But they add the smell
so you know when there's a leak.

261
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,223
Well, okay.

262
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:59,270
A lot of other gas smells.

263
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,234
Oh, the humanity!

264
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:11,865
Methane smells...

265
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,410
You know what?
Actually, I really should go.

266
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,581
- But I haven't paid you yet.
- That's okay.

267
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:23,335
You guys have ordered so many
that this one's on me.

268
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:34,764
Was I talking to her about gas?

269
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,725
More so than anything else.

270
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,896
I found it interesting.

271
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,023
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,443
Don't worry about it.

273
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:53,324
In nine years, she and I
will be right there!

274
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:02,583
I'm gonna clear out
some of these boxes.

275
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:13,052
What else do they add smell to?

276
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,098
Caitlin! Caitlin!

277
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,600
Hi, I'm Rachel.

278
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,686
The people with all the pizza.

279
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,396
Was there a problem?

280
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,606
No, they're fine. Great pizza.

281
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:34,114
But, actually, my friend Ross
gets nervous when he's flirting.

282
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,532
Oh, my God!

283
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,493
That was flirting?

284
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,412
I know, I know.

285
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,874
I'm telling you,
once you get past that part...

286
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,543
...where it feels
like you wanna die...

287
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,712
...he's a really good person.

288
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,506
The guy with the gas?

289
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,969
I'm telling you, he's really
sweet and really funny...

290
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,263
...and he's just got a good heart.

291
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:01,517
- Besides, I think he really likes you.
- Really?

292
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:05,854
Well, we have seven people
and 10 pizzas. What do you think?

293
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:10,317
I thought Joey was there.

294
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,367
Hey, Ross?

295
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,245
I just ran into Caitlin
in the hallway.

296
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:25,207
You must be getting better at
this flirting stuff than I thought.

297
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,249
What?

298
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,547
I don't get it, but she wanted me
to give you her number.

299
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,262
And she just gave you this?

300
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,642
Rach, thanks. But I don't need
you doing me any favors.

301
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:47,562
I didn't.
She thought you were cute.

302
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:51,525
Well, that I can believe.

303
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,194
Hey, is the show still on?

304
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,695
Almost over, man.

305
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,698
Hey, Nonnie.

306
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:01,160
Is that the Pope?

307
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:04,455
Why am I looking?

308
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,333
Oh, here I am!
This is my big scene.

309
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,961
<i>All right, back off!</i>

310
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,380
<i>I got a gun!</i>

311
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,341
<i>I'm not afraid to use it.</i>

312
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:17,968
That's right, Nonnie.

313
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:22,222
You couldn't have at least
changed your shirt?

314
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:28,062
<i>Now, I want a suitcase</i>
<i>filled with $100,000...</i>

315
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,439
<i>Filled with $100,000</i>
<i>in small bills.</i>

316
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,276
<i>And if I don't get...</i>
<i>Shoo!</i>

317
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:37,863
<i>And if I don't get it...</i>

318
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,906
<i>... I'll shoot this duck!</i>

319
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:42,868
Oh, no!

320
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:46,413
<i>I'm coming out!</i>

321
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,964
And she's supposed to buy this?

322
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:03,305
<i>Ground control to Major Tom</i>

323
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,849
<i>Commencing countdown</i>

324
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,268
<i>Engines...</i>

325
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,896
<i>... on</i>

326
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:20,656
That's scenes from next week's show.
Next week.

327
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:24,743
I am definitely gonna watch that.

328
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,666
Do these look the same?

329
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:31,708
Definitely.

330
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:32,918
Not as each other.

331
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,505
Then, no.

332
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,633
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah.

333
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:42,928
You look amazing.
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

334
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,764
You're about to get
a little luckier.

335
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,683
- Let me see the earrings.
- Right, the earrings.

336
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,519
They look great.

337
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,690
Does your boyfriend have
the best taste or what?

338
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,820
My boyfriend really does
have great taste.

339
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:05,451
Thanks for picking out the earrings.
