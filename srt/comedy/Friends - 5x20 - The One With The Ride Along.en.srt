1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:04,838
Okay, guys, listen.

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,591
Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,635
So try to really keep
Ross' mind off of it.

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,179
Good idea.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,057
Hey, man. What's up?

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:19,561
Just thinking about Emily
getting married tomorrow.

7
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:24,065
Oh, Ross! Look, look!

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,484
What? Where?

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,488
Right over there! There!
Look, look, look!

10
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:33,492
- What am I looking at?
- Somebody help me out here.

11
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,286
Hey!

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,372
Monica, sorry I didn't come by.
I was out with Gary.

13
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,044
He let me ride around with him.
We saw and prevented crimes.

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,338
You got to go on a ride-along?

15
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,007
- I want to go on a ride-along!
- Me too!

16
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,968
- Okay.
- Yeah! Me too!

17
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,221
Really? You?

18
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,015
Yeah.

19
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,853
- Well, it's kind of dangerous.
- Well, I like danger.

20
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:04,690
- Okay, you guys free tonight?
- Yeah!

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,361
You didn't say
it was gonna be at nighttime.

22
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,948
The One with the Ride-Along

23
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,417
I'm glad you're home.
We can finally organize these photos.

24
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,627
Oh, thank God!

25
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,255
Finally!

26
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,925
I've broken them down
into categories.

27
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,011
We got holidays,
birthdays, candids...

28
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,555
And I've cross-referenced
them by subject.

29
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,849
So if you're looking up, say...

30
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,977
...birthdays and dogs,
you get photo 152.

31
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,689
See?

32
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,400
Oh, it's me and LePoo.

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,569
Wow, I miss that dog.

34
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,281
You can also find him
under "dog" and "dead".

35
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,492
Great. Thanks.

36
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:43,622
Hand me that other box of photos.
That's the last one.

37
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,628
Oops.

38
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,962
Sorry.

39
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,048
Good thing you numbered them.

40
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,216
I hadn't.

41
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,804
Photo 152 was a prototype.

42
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,889
Honey, it's okay. It's okay.

43
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,559
How about I fix you a drink?
Maybe a margarita?

44
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,520
Ross has the blender.

45
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,108
Everything's just falling apart.

46
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,694
It's okay. I'll go to Ross',
get the blender.

47
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,405
- You get the margarita stuff ready.
- All right.

48
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,449
His keys are in the drawer.
Also, I need some cash.

49
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,076
Want me to stop at the ATM?

50
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:26,164
No. While you're at Ross',
if you see any lying around.

51
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,417
What?

52
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:32,212
I don't do that.

53
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,349
That was so cool, man.
The way you leaned on that guy.

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,561
It is starting to get dark out there.

55
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,480
He told you everything.
You cracked him.

56
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,443
He was the victim.
They're usually pretty talkative.

57
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:59,031
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.

58
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,326
- Want me to grab the berry?
- It's called a cherry.

59
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,913
It's called...
Chandler!

60
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,210
Okay, I got it.

61
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,589
This place makes the
best sandwich in the world.

62
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,591
Does it have meatballs?

63
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,717
Oh, yeah.

64
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,677
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?

65
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,054
Yep.

66
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,641
You can't eat that in my car.

67
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,059
Yeah, okay.

68
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,189
Even though my tax dollars
paid for this car.

69
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,984
Your tax dollars?

70
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,780
Yeah, okay.

71
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,287
Wow, that sandwich smells good.

72
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,249
Did I say you could smell it?

73
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,917
I can't smell it?

74
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:56,838
Half the taste is in the smell.
You're sucking up all the taste units.

75
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,843
Okay, I'll give them back.

76
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,639
What is so great about that sandwich?

77
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,351
Imagine the best sex you ever had.

78
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,895
- Are you thinking about Monica?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,648
What's that like?

80
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,663
Please don't be from a real dinosaur.
Please, please.

81
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,166
Please, please.

82
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,546
"Made in Mexico."
Yes!

83
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,800
Who would buy this?

84
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,935
<i>Rach, it's me. Pick up!</i>

85
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,061
What's up?

86
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,272
<i>I need more margarita things.</i>

87
00:05:55,522 --> 00:06:01,528
I need some salt,
some margarita mix and tequila.

88
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,739
So all we had was ice?

89
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,909
See if he has ice.

90
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,464
<i>Hello, Ross?</i>

91
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,132
<i>It's Emily here.</i>

92
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,428
<i>I know this is out of the blue,</i>
<i>but I'm getting married tomorrow.</i>

93
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,597
<i>Well, maybe I am...</i>

94
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,266
<i>I keep thinking about you.</i>

95
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:35,187
<i>And I'm wondering if we made</i>
<i>a mistake giving up so fast.</i>

96
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,314
<i>Are you thinking about me?</i>

97
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,026
<i>No, of course you're not.</i>
<i>But if you are, call me tonight.</i>

98
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,488
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

99
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,121
Where we going?

100
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,709
This witness won't return my calls.
We'll surprise him coming home.

101
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,838
Surprise him? We're not gonna
make anybody mad, are we?

102
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,673
Come on, man.

103
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:07,177
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes
a bit before he lawyers up?

104
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,556
He's a witness, not a perp.
And no one talks like that.

105
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,059
Yeah. No one talks like that.

106
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:18,021
- Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
- I'm more cop than you two.

107
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,857
How do you figure that?

108
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,901
I'm in the front seat, okay?

109
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,445
I'm Gary's partner.

110
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,324
When you say "partner",
it doesn't sound cop.

111
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,827
It sounds gay.

112
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,955
Jealous.

113
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:39,376
- Hey, we're undercover here.
- Oh, yeah. No problem.

114
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,420
- Ross!
- Sorry.

115
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,340
There.

116
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,677
Hey, Gary. Who am I?

117
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,139
Phone home.

118
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:58,270
Look at Officer Ross riding
back here with the visitors.

119
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,482
What's up with that, Serpico?

120
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,654
<i>Are you thinking about me?</i>
<i>No, of course you're not.</i>

121
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,865
<i>But if you are, call me tonight.</i>

122
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,327
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

123
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:16,455
No.

124
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,249
I know!

125
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,669
Thank God, you were here.
We have to erase that.

126
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,672
What? We can't do that.

127
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,966
We have to.
What if Ross hears that...

128
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,343
...and calls her and
they get back together?

129
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,596
Is that what you want?
Ross back with that controlling...

130
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,433
...neurotic, crazy Emily
who wouldn't let him see you?

131
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,518
No! Oh, no, no.

132
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,397
God, no! He should not
get back with her.

133
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:45,109
I know that, you know that.
Even Ross knows that.

134
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,653
But we have no right
to erase his message.

135
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:52,491
Look, I'm his sister and I love him.
I don't want to see him get hurt.

136
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,411
Doesn't that give me
the right to control...

137
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,081
Help him?

138
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:03,210
He's not the one who needs help.

139
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,504
She's obviously unstable.

140
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:10,676
She's thinking about running
out on her wedding day.

141
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,890
Okay, fine. But look at the
position she's putting him in.

142
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,767
And what's he gonna do?

143
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,103
Break up their marriage
on their wedding day?

144
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,732
Who would do that?

145
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,073
Okay, fine. All right.
But that was different.

146
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,534
Although it did involve
a lot of the same people.

147
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,704
This is some twisted joke
she's playing on him.

148
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,040
You are crazy.
She sounded genuinely upset.

149
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,584
I mean, listen.

150
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,086
<i>Your messages have been erased.</i>

151
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,548
No!

152
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,387
Okay, but we're safe, right?
Nothing bad's gonna go down.

153
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,973
No. But that reminds me.
Sign this.

154
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,307
What is it?

155
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,227
It says you can't sue
if you scrape your knee...

156
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,605
...or get your head blown off.

157
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,401
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.

158
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,195
Here he comes.

159
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,490
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?

160
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,574
What is it?

161
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,326
- Is everything okay?
- What?

162
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:22,456
He sees us. Don't move.
And don't look at him!

163
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:40,057
Hey, it's okay.
It was just a car backfire.

164
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:44,019
Hey, look at that.
You tried to save your buddy.

165
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,437
You see that?

166
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,772
You see what he did?

167
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,984
You okay, man?

168
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,906
Thanks, Joey.

169
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,701
Hello?

170
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:09,670
We should go.

171
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,838
No, wait.

172
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,298
Oh, yeah. Right.

173
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,842
No. Monica.

174
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,927
Monica, we have to fix this.

175
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,304
What can we do?
You erased the message.

176
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:21,057
Unless we tell him.

177
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,684
If you want to be rational,
I can't argue with you.

178
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,395
All right?

179
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:31,567
Fine, tell him. I just don't
want to be a part of it.

180
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:36,196
Maybe that's Emily leaving
the exact same message.

181
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:41,201
<i>Hey, Ross, it's you. I just</i>
<i>want you to remember this feeling.</i>

182
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,037
<i>You are lucky to be alive.</i>

183
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,541
<i>So live every day to the fullest.</i>

184
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,003
<i>Love yourself, okay?</i>

185
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:54,798
<i>And also get stamps. Bye.</i>

186
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:58,469
Play that message for Emily,
and this problem goes away.

187
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,305
Right?

188
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,181
Anybody want to meet a hero?

189
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,976
John Glenn is here?

190
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,269
No. Joey.

191
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,730
We had the most incredible night.

192
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,775
- We're in the car...
- Wait. Hold on.

193
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,028
Hi.

194
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,655
Okay, go ahead.

195
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,868
So we're in the car, and bang!
A shot was fired.

196
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,413
And Joey, with no regard
for his own safety...

197
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,665
...throws himself on me.

198
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,000
My God!

199
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,711
It was a car backfire.

200
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,463
But he didn't know that.

201
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,883
Yeah, I didn't know that.

202
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:41,262
It could just as easily
have been a bullet.

203
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,557
Ever think about joining the force?
We could use a guy like you.

204
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,393
Who jumps at loud noises.

205
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,855
Wow. I could have died tonight.

206
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,942
If the car that backfired
had run over you!

207
00:12:56,193 --> 00:13:00,447
I'm going before he starts rambling
about his newfound respect for life.

208
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:05,327
I do have a newfound respect for life.

209
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,622
Oh, my God!

210
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,043
- You want to get some dinner?
- Yeah, sure.

211
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:18,131
You know what? If I heard a shot
right now, I'd throw my body on you.

212
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,968
Maybe we should walk
in a bad neighborhood.

213
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,762
Okay.

214
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,431
Bye.

215
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,062
Cut it out.

216
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:37,609
I'd hate to save your life
and kick your ass on the same day.

217
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:47,911
Why'd you take off?

218
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,705
Just going for a walk.

219
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,834
Around the living room, whatever.

220
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,504
- Is something wrong?
- No. No, I'm just tired.

221
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,591
You know, from the walk.

222
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,179
You dove in front of Ross!

223
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,389
Ross!

224
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,143
That's what this is about.

225
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,439
Oh, my God. You hate Ross!

226
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,773
I don't hate Ross.

227
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:20,819
Of course, you do. I saved him.
You're mad at me. It adds up.

228
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,197
You want Ross out of the picture.

229
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,282
What picture?

230
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,368
I don't know.
But I don't like what I'm hearing.

231
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:32,373
I'm glad you saved Ross.
But it could've been a bullet.

232
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:36,377
And you didn't try to save me.

233
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:40,047
You're upset because you think
I chose Ross over you.

234
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:44,718
No, I knew you could
take care of yourself.

235
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:49,097
You know? I mean, Ross needs help.
He's not "street" like us.

236
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,726
You'd risk your life for Ross
before you would for me.

237
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,770
That's the bottom line.

238
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,940
No, not exactly.

239
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,025
All right, look.

240
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,278
I wasn't trying to save Ross.

241
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,573
Okay?

242
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,993
My sandwich was next to Ross.

243
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,996
All right?

244
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:17,501
I was trying to save my sandwich.

245
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,379
From a bullet?

246
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,508
- I know it doesn't make much sense.
- "Much" sense?

247
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,302
Look, it was instinct!
I just went for it.

248
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,930
You risked your life for a sandwich?

249
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,224
I know it sounds crazy...

250
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:37,813
...but this is the greatest
sandwich in the world!

251
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,817
So you didn't choose Ross before me?

252
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,528
No. I would never do that.

253
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,281
You're like my brother.

254
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,658
- Really?
- Yeah.

255
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:55,455
In fact, to prove how much
you mean to me...

256
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,794
Here.

257
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:05,298
- Thanks.
- Easy, it's not a hot dog!

258
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:13,265
How good is that?

259
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,726
See?

260
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,812
What are you doing?

261
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,190
You're showing me how much
I mean to you.

262
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,484
With a bite.

263
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,612
Jeez!

264
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,088
What are you doing here?

265
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,590
Hey, you know what?

266
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,134
You are in our apartment
all the time!

267
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:53,430
This is just a drop
in the bucket, mister!

268
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:57,935
It doesn't matter. The important
thing is that you're here.

269
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:02,690
You're my friend and you're here.

270
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,780
Okay, just a little scared.
What's going on?

271
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,491
The most amazing thing
happened tonight.

272
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,077
I thought my number was up.

273
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,205
I had an actual near-death experience.

274
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,665
What happened?

275
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:25,879
We were on the ride-along with Gary
and somebody took a shot at me!

276
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,216
Really?

277
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,636
No. A car backfired.

278
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,474
But I thought somebody was taking
a shot at me. And, Rach...

279
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,810
...I survived!

280
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:45,107
And I was filled with
this great respect for life.

281
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,609
I want to experience every moment.

282
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,072
I want to seize every opportunity.

283
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,991
I am seeing everything so clearly now.

284
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,828
Because a car backfired?

285
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,623
Okay. Why are you here?

286
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,961
I don't know how this fits
into your whole seizing thing...

287
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,880
...but Emily called you today.

288
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,300
- You talked to her?
- She left a message.

289
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,469
But it kind of got erased.

290
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,181
I mean, there's something
wrong with your machine.

291
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,266
What did she say?

292
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:23,395
Something about having second
thoughts about the wedding.

293
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:27,023
And did you guys make
a mistake breaking up?

294
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,027
And she wants you to call her.

295
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,487
Wow.

296
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:35,241
That was a good thing
that I told you, right?

297
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,325
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

298
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:40,579
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Because...

299
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,206
I'm gonna tell Monica I was right.

300
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,125
Because she didn't want...

301
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,880
Not important. Point is,
I was right. Your decision.

302
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,006
Okay?

303
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,549
I was right.

304
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,551
Your decision.

305
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,219
Right.

306
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,722
I guess I should call Emily.

307
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,224
No, that's not the right decision.

308
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,977
That's not right.

309
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:04,478
Ross, come on!

310
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,313
I mean...

311
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,067
...that woman made you miserable!

312
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:14,571
Do you really want
to get back into that?

313
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,448
Okay, look. Yesterday...

314
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,784
...I wouldn't have even
considered calling her back.

315
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,496
But my ex-wife calls
on the same day...

316
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,207
...I have a near-death experience?

317
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,417
That's gotta mean something.

318
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:32,715
That was not a near-death experience.
That was barely an experience.

319
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:36,260
You weren't there!

320
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:41,182
Maybe this is something that
I'm supposed to seize, you know?

321
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,683
Okay. You know what?

322
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:47,729
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.

323
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,859
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.

324
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,569
Okay? Look at today.

325
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,863
I mean, you escaped...

326
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:58,574
...death.

327
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:02,494
And maybe this is a chance
for you to escape...

328
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,830
...getting back together with Emily.

329
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:09,167
That does make sense.

330
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:13,171
Because I do want to seize
some opportunity...

331
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:18,552
...but I really don't want
to see or talk to her.

332
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,805
Well, there you go!

333
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,391
Yeah, maybe today's just...

334
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,353
...close-call day.

335
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,981
Hey, thanks, Rach.

336
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,734
Oh, honey. No problem.

337
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,695
Wait, wait.
The message is blinking.

338
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,780
Maybe you didn't erase it.

339
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,825
<i>Hey, Ross, it's you...</i>

340
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:47,622
That's an old message.
Nobody needs to hear that.

341
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,251
Hey, was Monica here?

342
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,004
I want my money back.

343
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:58,216
You probably need that
for stamps, right?

344
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,309
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?

345
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,644
Yes, once.

346
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:10,896
A little.

347
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,815
He kind of did it to himself.

348
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:16,694
It's not really a good story.

349
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:20,406
I wonder how I'd react under fire.
And not backfire...

350
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,199
...but heavy fire.

351
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,409
Like, if I was in a war.

352
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,579
Man, I would be great in a war!

353
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,789
I think I'd make
a fantastic military leader.

354
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,877
I mean, I know I'd make general
before any of you guys.

355
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,672
Before or after you were shot
by your own troops?

356
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:41,677
I know Joey would be in the foxhole
protecting all of us.

357
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:45,722
If the foxhole was
lined with sandwiches.

358
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:49,727
Yeah, hero sandwiches.

359
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:55,149
You all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm
not interested in war in any way.

360
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,653
But when the revolution comes,
I'll have to destroy you all.

361
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,739
Not you, Joey.
