1
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,763
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

2
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,157
I'll have to verify
your appointment

3
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,766
before I can pass you through.

4
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,270
You'll have to pull over.

5
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,777
- Hi, Mac.
- Morning, Mary.

6
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,154
Did you save me a parking space?

7
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:55,072
Right at the head
of the line.

8
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,574
Thanks.

9
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:08,210
- Good morning, officer.
- Just a moment.

10
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,795
Where do you think you're going?

11
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,505
To work. Here's my pass.

12
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,883
Employees use the West
Executive Avenue entrance.

13
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,426
Oh, but I always
come in this way.

14
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:18,054
Yes, but beginning today,
you're an employee

15
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,431
and employees use
the employees' entrance.

16
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,075
You know, officer,
I have a lot of influence.

17
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,726
My father's quite a big shot
around here.

18
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,519
Young lady, rules are rules.

19
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,438
- And no exceptions.
- And no exceptions.

20
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,523
- Good morning, Mary.
- Oh, good morning, Harkey.

21
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,817
- Having trouble, Tim?
- A little.

22
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,754
I wish you'd give the new girls
in your department

23
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,030
a rundown on the rules
around here.

24
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:38,508
With you for a father, I'm sure
this one knows them backwards.

25
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:41,202
Dad, you're in a rut. What
you need is a change of climate.

26
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:42,971
Now why don't you try a few
weeks at the south entrance?

27
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,097
- Young lady, I...
- Bye, Tim.

28
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,165
See you for dinner, dad.

29
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:49,126
Mary, my new girls usually get
an indoctrination speech

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,003
almost as long as
a congressional record.

31
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,755
- Must we, Harkey?
- Glory be, no.

32
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,566
After a couple of years
at the Supreme Court,

33
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,510
I'm sure you know the duties
and responsibilities of the job.

34
00:02:57,593 --> 00:02:59,071
There's one thing
I must stress though.

35
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,430
That's the need
for absolute secrecy.

36
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,141
Anything you might overhear
is a solemn trust.

37
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,686
- I understand.
- I'll wire them for you...

38
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,330
- I'm sorry, sir, he hasn't...
- I haven't...

39
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,563
Well, here she is, girls.

40
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,273
The ex-voice
of the Supreme Court.

41
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,525
- Hi.
- Welcome to the family.

42
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:13,859
Hello, Mary.

43
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,170
Pull up a switchboard
and sit down.

44
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,029
- Thanks.
- White House, please.

45
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,824
I don't think
I'll have much trouble, Harkey.

46
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:21,987
The boards are the same
general type I've been using.

47
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,869
Except that here,
more is expected of you

48
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,788
than merely handling
the switchboards.

49
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,748
Besides memorizing
hundreds of numbers,

50
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,251
you've got to be a combination
of diplomat and detective.

51
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:32,294
Ready to decide instantly
which calls

52
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,088
are legitimate
and which of 'em cranks.

53
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:36,006
Senator Downs
is in Istanbul.

54
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,800
Shall I try to get him
for you, sir?

55
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:40,136
You have to locate people
in all parts of the world.

56
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,738
Some who haven't been
heard from in years

57
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,223
and often under
almost impossible conditions.

58
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:46,142
White House.

59
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,185
One moment, sir.

60
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,688
- It's him again.
- Old faithful, on the dot.

61
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,314
What'll I tell him this time?

62
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,900
I've run out of polite phrases
for go jump in the lake.

63
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,485
Tell him... no.

64
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,571
Mary, you might as well
start now as later.

65
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:00,156
There's a Mr. Paxton
on the line.

66
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,574
He's been pestering us for days

67
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,177
trying to get through
to the president.

68
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,702
We've instructions
to kill his call

69
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:06,471
at the board, but he takes
a lot of killing.

70
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:07,931
- Well, I... I'd...
- Now go ahead now.

71
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,915
Let's see what sort
of a diplomat you are.

72
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,376
- It's all yours.
- White House. Thank you.

73
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,300
May I help you, please?

74
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,571
Well, isn't there someone
besides the president

75
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,929
who can take care of it?

76
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,768
Uh, may I enquire
the nature of your business?

77
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:32,021
Fish?

78
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:34,023
Oh, but I'm sure
that they have a fish market

79
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,649
where they trade, Mr. Paxton.

80
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,736
My dear lady, I don't sell fish.
I study them.

81
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,112
I'm an ichthyologist.

82
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,906
Oh, an ichthyologist.

83
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:43,467
Uh, may I suggest
that you communicate

84
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,909
with the Fish and Wildlife
section

85
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:46,312
of the Department
of the Interior.

86
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,080
Now why would a man
get so upset about fish?

87
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,290
Maybe they're spoiling.

88
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,379
White House.

89
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,507
No, Mr. Paxton,
I did not cut you off.

90
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,761
Look, miss, every year,
like a clock, I pay my taxes.

91
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:05,596
I'm a citizen in good standing.

92
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:08,516
And the president is supposed
to be a servant of the people.

93
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,935
Oh, I know that the president
is the servant of the people.

94
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:12,812
And if he's a servant
of the people,

95
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,481
he's supposed to be available
when the people need him.

96
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:18,692
Well, I'm one of the people.

97
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,986
Now will you, please,
put my call through?

98
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,073
Well, um, why don't you try
writing to your congressman?

99
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,494
Well, t... there must be someone

100
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:30,538
who can help you
without bothering the president.

101
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,164
Well?

102
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,059
He says he has more nickels
than a slot machine

103
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,185
and he's going to get through
to the president

104
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,794
if he goes broke trying.

105
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:38,814
I think he should be reported
to the Secret Service.

106
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,631
There's no law
against phoning the president.

107
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:44,844
I'll get rid of that
guppy grower once and for all.

108
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,096
- Mary, no. Not that one.
- Why not?

109
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,056
Listen.

110
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,600
Good morning, Mr. President.

111
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,521
Yes, Mr. President.
London will call back at 10:15.

112
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,565
You're welcome, Mr. President.

113
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,859
This is the president's
private extension.

114
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,112
Of course, he may call
on anyone of the other 185.

115
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:04,989
But when that little light
goes on,

116
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:06,532
it's always the president.

117
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:07,616
I see.

118
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,326
Call for you, Mary, on trunk 5.

119
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,745
Justice Hastings
at the Supreme Court.

120
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,081
Uh-oh, here comes
a dissenting opinion.

121
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,418
Hello, Justice Hastings.

122
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,670
Mary, what's my daughter's
phone number in Texas?

123
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:21,171
What time do I take my pills?

124
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,173
And what the devil
are you doing over there?

125
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,342
Thackerville 318, ring 2.

126
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,553
The white pills at 11:00,
the brown pills at 4:00.

127
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:29,138
And I'm working
on the switchboard.

128
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,682
That's what I heard,
and it doesn't make much sense.

129
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:34,018
You walked out on the
switchboard to marry Phillip.

130
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,704
Now I learn you've walked out
on marrying Phillip

131
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,229
to go back to a switchboard.

132
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,899
That's idiotic
even for young people.

133
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,985
Uh, w... well, uh,
can't we talk about it later?

134
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,194
I can meet you at Gustav's.

135
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,488
Dad and I
are having dinner there.

136
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,824
Goodbye, Justice Hastings.

137
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,242
Uh, wasn't that sweet of him?

138
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,036
He just wanted to call
and wish me luck.

139
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:55,122
Mary, you did give them notice
when you left the Supreme Court.

140
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:57,249
I wouldn't want them to think
I lured you away.

141
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,834
Oh, it's nothing like that.

142
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,837
Mary, for you.
Justice Peabody on 5.

143
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,048
- White House. Yes, please.
- One moment, please.

144
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:05,971
Yes, I'll take care
of it right away.

145
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,886
Hello, Justice Peabody.

146
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:11,555
Mary, your decision
not to marry Phillip.

147
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,140
Is your own business

148
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:15,017
and I'd be the last one
to interfere.

149
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,477
Thank you, Justice Peabody.

150
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,360
It was very nice of you
to call to tell me so.

151
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:20,522
But clarification
with a misunderstanding

152
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,107
is not interference.

153
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,777
And I happen to know
that Phillip's explanation

154
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,738
of what happened the other
evening is the absolute truth.

155
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:29,633
It's no use, Your Honor,
I've been through all that...

156
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,034
Now just let me handle this,
Phillip.

157
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:35,454
That Wentworth girl is a witness
in an important government case

158
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:38,499
and Phillip was out with her
strictly in his capacity

159
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:40,626
as an attorney
for the Justice Department.

160
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:42,878
Justice Peabody,
the fact that Phillip was out

161
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,964
with Miss Wentworth
is immaterial, irrelevant

162
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,967
and has no bearing on the case.
I'm still not getting married.

163
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,637
I... I know, but...

164
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,430
Y... yes, but...

165
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,684
Mr. Justice, can't we discuss it
some other time?

166
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,353
Tonight at Gustav's. Goodbye.

167
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:03,691
Mary, I'm afraid
there's one point I overlooked.

168
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,443
White House operators
are always on call.

169
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,112
Therefore
as a matter of practice,

170
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:10,531
we never hire
young married women.

171
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:11,949
So if there's any possibility

172
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:13,385
of your getting married
in the near future...

173
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,785
Oh, but there isn't.

174
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,628
I'm sure everyone's convinced
of that by now.

175
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,372
Well, it didn't sound that way.

176
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:21,375
Believe me, Harkey, that's
the last we'll hear of it.

177
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,794
Mary, for you.
Justice Van Sloan.

178
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,842
Rules are rules, and we're not

179
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,319
supposed to receive
any personal calls.

180
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,095
That's all I received all day.

181
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:35,365
It's a wonder my first day at
the White House wasn't my last.

182
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,433
Oh, fine.

183
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,101
Now we're back
to the hiccups again.

184
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,811
I thought
you were all calmed down.

185
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:42,229
I'm perfectly calm.

186
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:43,748
And when we get inside,
I'll be even calmer.

187
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:45,190
Sure, you will.

188
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,525
- Oh, hold it, dad.
- Hm?

189
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:48,277
See if Phillip's in there,
will you?

190
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,993
He's there. Now what?

191
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:57,786
Mm, let's just wait
a few seconds

192
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,872
to be sure
there are no more stray hiccups.

193
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:02,166
Phillip knows I only get them
when I'm emotionally upset

194
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,543
and I don't want him to think
I'm upset on account of him.

195
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:10,549
Stop worrying, Gustav.

196
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,551
The examination is quite simple.

197
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:14,136
Thousands of people
have passed it.

198
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,055
And you've still got four days.

199
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,140
I know, Your Honorship,
but just to answer

200
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,975
the questions,
that's not enough for me.

201
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,518
I... I would like to know
everything

202
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,896
about becoming a citizen.
It's my ambition.

203
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:27,232
- Uh, where are we?
- Uh, Section 7, Article 2.

204
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,777
Oh, when the bill
shall have passed the Senate

205
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,403
and the House
of Representatives,

206
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,781
it shall,
before it becomes a law,

207
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,991
be presented to...

208
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,451
The president
of the United States,

209
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:39,036
Justice Peabody.

210
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,205
And if he approves it,
he shall, uh...

211
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:42,539
Sign it, Justice Williams.

212
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,999
But if not,
he shall...

213
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,168
- Return it, Justice Hastings.
- With what?

214
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:48,045
With his objections,
Justice Van Sloan.

215
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:49,838
Where to?

216
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,965
To the house where
it originated, Justice Mannings,

217
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,885
I mean, Justice Phillip,
I mean, Phillip.

218
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:57,387
A perfect score, Gustav.

219
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,056
Would you like
to track the devil?

220
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,100
- Mary.
- Oh, please, don't get up.

221
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,519
Well, how's my favorite
future citizen this evening?

222
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,813
And my favorite four knights
of the Supreme Court?

223
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,898
- Splendid, Mary.
- Don't I rate a hello?

224
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:09,733
Of course, Phillip.
How are you?

225
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,319
Mary,
after you've had your dinner,

226
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:14,655
we'd like to have
that little talk with you.

227
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:17,491
Oh, Mr. Justice,
I know what you want to say

228
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:19,409
and I know it's because
you want to help me.

229
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,245
You've always helped me.

230
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:22,788
All of you.

231
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:24,957
But this time
I have to make my own decision

232
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,542
and I'm not going
to marry Phillip.

233
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,127
- But, Mary...
- Mary...

234
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,938
Mm, something smells good.
What is it, Gustav?

235
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,964
Hasenpfeffer a la Gustav.
My specialty.

236
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:34,287
I think I'll go and see if
it looks as good as it smells.

237
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,762
Well, Phillip, you might as well
tear up the license.

238
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,514
Oh, no, I'm going in there

239
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:42,182
and get this straightened out
right now.

240
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,560
Wait, Phillip. First,
she must be in the right mood.

241
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:48,397
Let me handle it.
I know Mary.

242
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,941
Well, looks like
Mary, Gustav, and I

243
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:53,277
will make a very happy couple.

244
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,405
Igor, give me some music,
something romantic.

245
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:58,508
- How 'bout "The Charter?"
- Oh, that's happy romantic.

246
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,950
Something sad romantic.

247
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:03,203
I want the violin to cry and...

248
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:07,708
- What's that?
- Gansebraten with spaetzle.

249
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,835
Extra good today, Miss Mary.

250
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:13,213
- I put a lotta love into it.
- That's for dad and me.

251
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,507
You're not going to have
the hasenpfeffer a la Gustav?

252
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,509
I made it especially
for the judges and you.

253
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,136
Oh, well, I was...

254
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:20,989
You better stick
to my gansebraten, Miss Mary.

255
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,390
He put too much pfeffer
in the hasenpfeffer.

256
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:25,392
Too much pfeffer?
Just enough pfeffer.

257
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:27,352
- Too much!
- I say, just enough!

258
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,689
Now, listen, Bertha,
who is Viennese here? You or I?

259
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,900
Gustav, we'll have
a little of each, huh?

260
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,653
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Yeah.

261
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,531
That's for Justice Peabody's
birthday party tomorrow night.

262
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,991
But never mind the party.

263
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:44,620
Mary, I can't stand
to see you so unhappy.

264
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,331
What are you talking about? I've
never been happier in my life.

265
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:50,250
A lover's quarrel.
Ah, such a sad thing.

266
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,769
Especially when the lovers
are in love.

267
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:53,146
But there wasn't
any lover's quarrel.

268
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,088
From Gustav you can't hide.

269
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,216
Usually, my Mary's so happy,
so gay.

270
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,467
Believe me...

271
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,976
Ah, so that's the reason
for the weeping fiddles.

272
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,354
Gustav, if it'll convince
anyone how happy I am,

273
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:12,564
I'll dance, sing
or even stand on my head.

274
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,068
Alright, now, Igor,
we've all had a good cry.

275
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:17,778
Play something cheerful.

276
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,087
Phillip, now is the time.

277
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,506
Tactful but firm, my boy.

278
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:07,137
Hasenpfeffer a la Gustav,
gansebraten a la Bertha.

279
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,764
And we better like both of them.

280
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,682
- Mind if I join you?
- Of course not.

281
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,893
Oh, excuse me.

282
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:16,146
I... I just remembered something
I've got to tell Gustav.

283
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:17,939
The subtle touch.

284
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,233
In case you don't get it,
he wants us to be alone.

285
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,836
Mary, I'm sorry
about all those phone calls...

286
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,528
Let's forget it, Phillip.

287
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,698
There is too much pepper.

288
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,925
I merely mentioned the situation

289
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:29,284
to the justices this morning.

290
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,161
I didn't want them
to call you, but...

291
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:33,497
Well, your attitude
is so ridiculous.

292
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,873
It's not ridiculous.

293
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:37,584
Jealousy is always ridiculous.

294
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,419
For three days,
I've been trying to tell you

295
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,646
the reason
we're not getting married

296
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,172
is because I wasn't jealous.

297
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,216
- That's even more ridiculous.
- No, it isn't.

298
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:47,135
Look, Phillip, when
people have known each other

299
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,471
for a long time and have had
a lot of dates together,

300
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:52,182
they're apt to become
a habit with each other.

301
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:54,035
I didn't realize
that's what had happened to us

302
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,977
until I saw you
with Miss Wentworth

303
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,271
and discovered I wasn't
the least bit annoyed.

304
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,731
What's that supposed to prove?

305
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,942
Just this.
A woman shouldn't marry a man.

306
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:03,902
If she isn't at least
a little bit upset

307
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,546
when he breaks a date with her
and goes out

308
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,280
with another woman,
a beautiful woman.

309
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,684
And at the time, I didn't even
know it was a business date.

310
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,618
Mary,
that's a defense mechanism.

311
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,501
An unconscious manifestation
of your jealousy.

312
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,831
Please, Phillip.
I've had a rough day.

313
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:18,500
The justices,
Gustav, you, Paxton...

314
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,919
Paxton? I didn't talk to anyone
named Paxton.

315
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:23,130
Well, I did, 23 times.

316
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,340
He insisted upon speaking
to the president.

317
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,134
All day long it was,
"Yes, Mr. Paxton.

318
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,694
No, Mr. Paxton.
I'm sorry, Mr. Paxton.

319
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:30,387
No, you may not speak to him,
Mr. Paxton."

320
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,973
I was dying to say you are
a pain in the neck, Mr. Paxton.

321
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:35,308
If it were up to me, I...

322
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:39,563
Young lady, do you know the
meaning of the word bumbledom?

323
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:43,150
Bumbledom, young lady, is the
pomposity of petty officials.

324
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,818
Little people in little jobs

325
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,901
who think the world will stop
turning without them.

326
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,113
I... I beg your pardon?

327
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:49,531
You at your switchboard

328
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:51,092
thinking that you have the right
to decide

329
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,285
who may or may not speak
to the president.

330
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:54,453
The fish peddler?

331
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,912
For the tenth time, miss,

332
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,372
I am not a fish peddler.

333
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,332
And for the tenth time,
Mr. Paxton,

334
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,560
the president
of the United States

335
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,002
is not interested in fish.

336
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:04,087
- Paxton?
- How do you do?

337
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,107
The president is interested
in his navy, isn't he?

338
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,483
Well, what's the navy
got to do with it?

339
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,134
- Now look here...
- Quiet, please.

340
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:10,760
It's his navy
that won't let me get

341
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,388
near Cocopango Atoll
to study my fish.

342
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,849
Is what you just said
intelligible to you, Mr. Paxton?

343
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,225
Of course, it is.

344
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,369
Well, then there's someone
who can help you

345
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:19,579
a lot more than the president.

346
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,396
- Who?
- A psychiatrist.

347
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,776
Uh, miss, as an ardent admirer

348
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,404
of the female sex,
may I say, without a doubt,

349
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,490
that you are
the most insufferable specimen

350
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,700
it has ever been my misfortune
to encounter?

351
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:36,495
- You've said just about enough.
- That's all I intend to say.

352
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,289
Except for one more thing,
Miss Number Please.

353
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:40,652
I'll get through
to the president

354
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,709
in spite of you
and your bumbledom.

355
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:46,254
Mary, who was that?

356
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,714
That's a man who's gonna spend

357
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:49,799
the rest of his life
in a telephone booth.

358
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,433
- Hi, Mac.
- Morning, Mary.

359
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,644
- How's the parking situation?
- Pretty good.

360
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,563
You won't have any trouble
this early.

361
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,398
Hello.

362
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,400
If you're selling mackerel,
I don't want any.

363
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,836
I've been waiting around
to tell you

364
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,779
how sorry I am about last night.

365
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:12,864
Alright, you're sorry.
Now, if you'll pardon me...

366
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,407
My behavior was inexcusable.

367
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,660
I couldn't sleep all night
thinking about it.

368
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,930
Perhaps you better go home now
and try to get some sleep.

369
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,997
This is to tell you
how sorry I am

370
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,792
and, uh, this is to ask you
to forgive me.

371
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,919
Oh, Mr. Paxton,
you didn't have to do this.

372
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:27,629
Oh, I insist.
I'll feel much better

373
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:31,424
if you accept these slight
tokens of my genuine repentance.

374
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,594
Well, alright
and thank you.

375
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,638
- Uh, forgiven?
- Forgiven.

376
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,057
I feel
much better already.

377
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,518
Now, miss, uh, if you could...

378
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,312
- Friends?
- Friends.

379
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,689
Then couldn't you, just once,

380
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:47,691
put my call through
to the president?

381
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,029
Mr. Paxton, I have never been
an admirer of the male sex,

382
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,424
but may I say, without a doubt,
you are the most underhanded,

383
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:56,842
presumptuous specimen
it has ever been

384
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:58,577
my misfortune to encounter.

385
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:09,546
- Good morning, Mary.
- Hello, Hilda.

386
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:11,381
- I know that isn't a hangover.
- No.

387
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,276
I'm just a little upset about
something. I'll be alright.

388
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,111
Do you think you could handle
the board for a few minutes?

389
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,803
Oh, I think so.

390
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:18,281
There won't be
any action.

391
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,432
It's much too early.
I'll be right back.

392
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,483
White House.

393
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,737
Well, I'm sorry, madam,

394
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,531
but the egg rolling
is only on Easter Sunday.

395
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,907
You're welcome.

396
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,045
Good morning, Mr. President.

397
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,881
Oh, oh, I... I'm terribly sorry,
sir.

398
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:56,509
They started
about ten minutes ago.

399
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:00,597
Thank you, Mr. President,
I'll try that.

400
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,933
Right now?

401
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,101
Alright, sir.

402
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,688
Gesundheit, Mr. President.

403
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,572
Now don't you worry about me.
I'll be alright.

404
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,109
Gesundheit again, Mr. President.

405
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,113
Dr. Andrews?
Yes, right away, sir.

406
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,576
Will you, please, tell
Dr. Andrews

407
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,453
the president wants to see him
immediately?

408
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:26,414
Dr. Andrews?
Is the president sick?

409
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,750
- Oh, it's nothing serious.
- Just a cold.

410
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,835
Did you ever try
standing on your head?

411
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,253
Only in slacks.

412
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,802
Hilda, did you just take

413
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,285
the president's call
to Dr. Andrews?

414
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,555
No, sir. It was our new girl,
Miss Peppertree.

415
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,063
- Tim's daughter?
- Yes, Sir.

416
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:52,524
Fine. I'm Harvey Elwood,
secretary to the president.

417
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,318
Yes, I know, Mr. Elwood.

418
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,778
I've seen you many times.

419
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:59,280
With the president's
compliments.

420
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,324
It's for your hiccups.

421
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,094
You just breathe into the bag
a couple of times.

422
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,637
The president says
when everything else fails,

423
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,204
this is absolutely surefire.

424
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:07,664
Oh, thank you, Mr. Elwood.

425
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:09,457
Please
thank the president.

426
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,584
Tell him I think
it's awfully sweet of him.

427
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,836
Sweet?

428
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,546
Oh, yes, of course.

429
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:16,881
And I'll give him
your exact words.

430
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,466
Awfully sweet.

431
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,812
Morning, Marge. Morning, Hilda.

432
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,608
Mary, what in the world
are you doing?

433
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,111
Oh, it's a hiccup cure.

434
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:39,404
It worked.

435
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,573
For you, Mary.
It's the president.

436
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,455
Yes, Mr. President.

437
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,123
Oh, they're all gone now.
Thank you.

438
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:52,250
How's your cold?

439
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,877
Oh, that's a shame.

440
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,297
If I were you, I'd take
some Irish moss and aspirin.

441
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,631
That's right, Mr. President.

442
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,109
My grandmother
always made us take it

443
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,135
and it worked like a charm.

444
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:04,429
Don't mention it, Mr. President.

445
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:06,848
Senator Ellis? Yes, right away.

446
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:13,062
- Gee, the president's nice.
- Irish moss?

447
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,273
Mary, I've been working
that board for 15 years

448
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:17,859
and I never got that chummy
with the vice president.

449
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:20,320
You can stay on the board.
Your probation's over.

450
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:22,405
Oh, thanks, Harkey.
That's wonderful.

451
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:27,452
White House.

452
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,454
Phillip, you promised
not to call me here.

453
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:31,122
I know, Mary,
but I have to find out

454
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,541
what time to pick you up
for Justice Peabody's party.

455
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,753
I don't want you to call for me.

456
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:39,190
I know you take me every year,
but if I go with you tonight,

457
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,591
we'll be right back
where we started.

458
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:43,754
Hold the line a minute, Phillip.

459
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:46,262
White House.

460
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,641
I beg your pardon, sir?

461
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:51,643
This is
Monsieur LaHave

462
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:53,394
of the French Embassy.

463
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,022
You will permit me, please,
to speak with the president?

464
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:58,817
- No?
- No, Mr. Paxton, I will not.

465
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:01,736
Phillip?

466
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,530
Oh, I thought
I disconnected you.

467
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,466
Now, look, Phillip,
if we show up together tonight,

468
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,802
everybody is gonna start playing
the "Wedding March" again.

469
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,661
I... Hold it, Phillip.

470
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:13,081
White House.

471
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,292
General who of what army?

472
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,380
Mr. Paxton, I said no.

473
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,718
Phillip? Now you know I wanna go
to Justice Peabody's party.

474
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,720
I've been to every one
since I was a baby.

475
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,764
But under the circumstances,
I can't go with you

476
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,641
and I'd rather not go alone,
so I'm afraid

477
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:33,601
I'll just have to stay home.

478
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,229
I haven't time to argue
with you now. Goodbye.

479
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:39,357
Mary, have you been talking
to the president again?

480
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,733
No. Why?

481
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,069
Well, you're still cut in
on his line.

482
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,616
Listen, young fella,
if you as much as make

483
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,326
one move
towards the president's car,

484
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,054
you'll be up to your ears
in Secret Service men.

485
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:54,080
Look, I only wanna talk to him.

486
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:55,498
Ever try using a telephone?

487
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,792
Oh, that's all
I've been doing for days.

488
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:04,966
Miss, will you, please,
tell this man

489
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:07,302
how many times I've tried
to call the president?

490
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,053
You know this man,
Miss Peppertree?

491
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,115
I guess so, in a way.
I mean, I've met him, but I...

492
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,867
Well, if he's a friend of yours,
you better get him outta here.

493
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,477
- Come on now, take it easy...
- I'm about to get home...

494
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,563
Now get him away
before he winds up in trouble.

495
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,866
You can get out here,
Mr. Paxton.

496
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:33,202
You think I'm a little crack,
don't you?

497
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,972
If I could talk to you
for just five minutes,

498
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,432
I'd convince you
I have a legitimate reason

499
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,749
for seeing the president.

500
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:39,459
Look, Mr. Paxton,
what I think of you

501
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:42,170
or your complaint
is of absolutely no importance.

502
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:43,893
If you're on
that White House switchboard,

503
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,632
you must know your way around.

504
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,176
Maybe you can tell me how I go
about getting to the president.

505
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,386
I...

506
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,764
Maybe I can.

507
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,700
How would you like to talk
to the president's secretary?

508
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,268
No soap.
I've already talked to three.

509
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,686
Oh, this is Mr. Elwood.

510
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,647
His executive
administrative assistant.

511
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,207
Why, he can arrange for you
to speak to the president...

512
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:03,942
like that.

513
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,693
Well, that's great.

514
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,488
How soon can you arrange for him
to do... like that?

515
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,698
Like that. But first,
you have to do me a favor.

516
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,034
I might have known.

517
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:15,745
- What kind of a favor?
- Oh, it's nothing much.

518
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:17,956
All you have to do is
take me to a party tonight.

519
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,125
- What kind of a party?
- It's a very nice party.

520
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,962
You don't have to act as if
you're getting a tooth pulled.

521
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,296
- Well...
- Well, don't rush me.

522
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,881
I've gotta figure out
all the angles.

523
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,591
There are no angles.

524
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,093
Okay.

525
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:31,928
What time do I pick you up
and where?

526
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:34,055
8:30.327 Walnut.

527
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:35,738
Now where do you live?
I'll drop you off.

528
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,393
Hotel Puriton,
but don't bother. I'll walk.

529
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,686
According to our agreement,

530
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,938
our date doesn't begin
until 8:30.

531
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,825
Come in, dad.

532
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:55,493
There is a young man downstairs.

533
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,537
He says he's taking you
to the party.

534
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,498
- That's good. I'm all ready.
- But it's not Phillip.

535
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:04,419
Since when is Phillip the only
living member of the male sex?

536
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,671
Goodnight, dad.
Don't wait up for me.

537
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,808
- Miss Peppertree?
- Yes.

538
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:20,435
I'm Lieutenant
Thomas Farrington.

539
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,979
I'm escorting you
to Justice Peabody's party.

540
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:24,564
Oh, but there must be
some mistake.

541
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:25,857
No, Miss Peppertree.

542
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,650
I'm a naval aide
at the White House

543
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,694
and I'm here
at the president's request.

544
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:31,821
I don't understand.

545
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,323
Oh, yes, I do.

546
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,118
Oh, I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding, lieutenant.

547
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:39,203
You see, I got on the
president's phone by mistake

548
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,414
and he thinks I'm staying home
alone tonight.

549
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:43,583
But I've already made
other arrangements.

550
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:46,044
Well, Miss Peppertree,
in my position,

551
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,837
A presidential request
is an order

552
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,423
and I've been ordered
to take you to the party.

553
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:53,092
Am I to inform the president
that you refused?

554
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,136
Oh, no, no,
that would be terrible.

555
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,722
I mean, I'm not refusing it...

556
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,724
Well, to tell you
the truth, lieutenant,

557
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:02,101
I was going to the party tonight
to prove something.

558
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,728
This just spoils everything.

559
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:06,314
Well, as long as I'm on orders,
miss, you just order

560
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:09,192
and I'll help you
prove anything you want.

561
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:11,861
Oh, dad, I'd like to have you
meet Lieutenant Farrington.

562
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:14,822
I thought you looked familiar,
lieutenant.

563
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,365
Farrington, Thomas J.

564
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,368
Pass number H-347942.

565
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,888
Assigned to the White House
three weeks ago.

566
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,164
Dad, there will be a Mr. Paxton
calling for me.

567
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:24,707
Just tell him I'm awfully sorry,

568
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,043
but that I had to leave
for the party without him.

569
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:28,795
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight.

570
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:32,840
Age, 30. Born in Virginia.

571
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,177
Height, 5'11".

572
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,304
Not bad, Timothy. Not bad.

573
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,600
Next question.

574
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:45,103
In how many ways
do bills become laws?

575
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,814
In three ways.
Salami, baloney, chopped liver.

576
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,607
By majority vote of both houses

577
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,359
and the signature
of the president.

578
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,903
Turkey, mustard.
By a two-third majority vote

579
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:55,863
over the president's veto.

580
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,406
Chicken, marinated herring.

581
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,218
By the president
keeping the bill for ten days.

582
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,701
- And liverwurst.
- Good.

583
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,079
Now who is... Gustav.

584
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:05,373
Gustav, that's me.

585
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,917
Good evening.

586
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,461
- Who's that with Mary?
- I don't know.

587
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,048
I know every one of her friends,
but this friend is a stranger.

588
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,675
Many happy returns, Mr. Justice.

589
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:17,319
- Thank you, Mary.
- Good evening, Mrs. Peabody.

590
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:18,654
Uh, Justice Peabody,
Mrs. Peabody,

591
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,138
may I present
Lieutenant Farrington.

592
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,181
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Justice?

593
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,201
I'm sure you'll excuse us,
but there are so many people

594
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,393
I want Tom to meet.

595
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:26,727
Certainly.

596
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:30,815
Well, I never saw him before.

597
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:32,817
Justice Hastings,
Justice Van Sloan,

598
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,319
may I present a very dear
friend, Lieutenant Farrington.

599
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,321
- How do you do, Mr. Justice?
- How do you do?

600
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,757
- Mr. Justice.
- Lieutenant Farrington.

601
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:40,449
Isn't it
a simply wonderful party?

602
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,243
- Delightful.
- Why, yes.

603
00:27:45,037 --> 00:27:47,182
I've got a hunch there's going
to be an emergency session

604
00:27:47,206 --> 00:27:49,458
of the Supreme Court
at any minute.

605
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,127
How am I doing,
Miss Peppertree?

606
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,296
Fine, but you better start
calling me Mary.

607
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:55,131
Okay, Mary.

608
00:27:55,214 --> 00:27:57,884
Say, uh, which one is Phillip?

609
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,095
Over there
in front of the buffet table.

610
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,015
Mm. Little on the heavy side,
isn't he?

611
00:28:04,098 --> 00:28:06,642
Don't be funny. That's Gustav.

612
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,187
Never mind Mary.
What's the next question?

613
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,564
Never mind the next question.

614
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:14,609
On your toes, Tom. Here comes
the fact-finding committee.

615
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,235
Hello, Phillip.

616
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,130
I'm glad you changed your mind
about coming, Mary.

617
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,739
So am I.
It's a very nice party.

618
00:28:19,822 --> 00:28:21,490
Yes, it is.

619
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,993
Everyone seems to be
having so much fun.

620
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:25,953
Yes, they do.

621
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,997
Uh, it's even nicer
than last year.

622
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,832
Yes, it is.

623
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,335
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
You haven't met Tom, have you?

624
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:34,545
Lieutenant Farrington,
this is Mr. Manning.

625
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,422
- How are you?
- How do you do, lieutenant?

626
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:47,975
- Nice party, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

627
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,938
Everyone seems to be
having so much fun.

628
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,440
Yes, they do.

629
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:56,234
It's even nicer than last year.

630
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,693
Yes, it is.

631
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:01,030
Warm, isn't it?

632
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:03,699
Oh, may I get you a cold drink?

633
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,326
Would you get me one, too,
Manning?

634
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:07,245
My, uh, trick knee
is bothering me.

635
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:10,831
What is this about a trick knee?

636
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,100
Oh, just a little something
I whipped up

637
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:13,960
in the spur of the moment.

638
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,545
How 'bout changing
to a more comfortable seat?

639
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,174
Thank you.

640
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,643
Excellent maneuvering,
lieutenant.

641
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:32,162
One of the first things
I learned in the navy.

642
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:34,021
- Elementary navigation.
- Here we are, Mary.

643
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,482
Very considerate of you,
Manning.

644
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:38,693
Very clever of you, lieutenant.

645
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,363
Nice fella, that Manning.

646
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,617
Nice fellow, that lieutenant.

647
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,078
- Real smart.
- Not so smart.

648
00:29:49,161 --> 00:29:50,871
- Mr. Justice?
- Yes?

649
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,582
Isn't it about time our music
depreciation group got rolling?

650
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,519
Son, we were just beginning
to get a mite worried

651
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,877
that nobody would ask us.

652
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,313
I hope you brought
your guitar, colonel.

653
00:29:58,337 --> 00:29:59,880
You know I did, sir.

654
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,550
That guitar has been
my campaign weapon for years.

655
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,135
I'd feel mighty naked
without it.

656
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:05,511
And by an odd coincident,

657
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:08,180
I had my accordion tuned
this afternoon.

658
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,558
- Mrs. Peabody.
- Sure.

659
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:11,952
Mary, this is the nicest chore
I've had

660
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,644
since I've been in the navy.

661
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,230
First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna
thank the president personally.

662
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,025
- Well, you tell him from me...
- Justice Williams?

663
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,110
Justice Van Sloan?

664
00:30:21,193 --> 00:30:23,487
Bet I get an invitation
to sing in ten seconds.

665
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,698
- Oh, Mary?
- Two seconds flat.

666
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:27,450
Lieutenant, I'm on.

667
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,621
Sorry to drag you away
from the navy,

668
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,749
but I reckon we need a soprano
more than he does.

669
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:36,552
Are you sure you did
the reckoning, colonel?

670
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,586
Now, Olivia, no hot licks.

671
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:42,173
This accordion isn't as young
as it used to be.

672
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:45,343
What'll it be, the same thing
we always start with?

673
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,137
Alright. One, two...

674
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,532
Uh, wait a minute, Mary.
Let's do, uh, "Kathleen."

675
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,156
That was great.

676
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,759
And, Manning, you've got
an excellent voice.

677
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:39,326
Oh, thank you, lieutenant.

678
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,037
Say, how about, uh,
"Let Me Call You Sweetheart?"

679
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,706
And Mr. Manning
can take the lead.

680
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:45,082
- No, I'd rather not.
- Oh, sure.

681
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:46,726
- Why not?
- After all, this is a quartet...

682
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,420
Oh, come on, son.
We're just getting started.

683
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,953
There's a lot more
I'd like to find out about you.

684
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,396
Let's get back to our loveseat.

685
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,607
- Mr. Litchfield.
- Good evening, Thomas.

686
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,109
I didn't know
you were going to be here, sir.

687
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:13,902
That's quite obvious.

688
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,654
Oh, uh, Miss Peppertree,

689
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,573
may I present
Mr. Samuel Litchfield.

690
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:18,907
It's a great pleasure, sir.

691
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,135
I read your newspaper
every morning.

692
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,827
I'm delighted to hear it.

693
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,430
Doris is quite disturbed
that you couldn't keep

694
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,830
your date this evening.

695
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:26,516
An errand for the president,
I understand?

696
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,627
Well, that's quite true,
Mr. Litchfield. You see, I...

697
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,047
Mary, will you excuse us
for a moment?

698
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,050
I had every intention
of keeping the date, sir.

699
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:53,859
Mary, everyone here
is talking about you

700
00:35:53,942 --> 00:35:55,444
and that, that sailor.

701
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:57,172
- Are they really, Phillip?
- You know they are.

702
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,447
Who is he, anyway?

703
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,990
Oh, well,
he's at the White House.

704
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,134
And you know how we are
at the White House.

705
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,743
Just one big happy family.

706
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:04,119
Well, I don't like him.

707
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,388
Then I'll tell you
what to do, Phillip.

708
00:36:05,412 --> 00:36:06,789
Don't go out with him.

709
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:09,625
Mary, would you mind terribly
if we left?

710
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:10,751
But it's so early, Tom.

711
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:12,670
I know,
but it's very important.

712
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,422
Oh, well, in that case, I'm sure
the Peabodys will forgive...

713
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,549
And I'm sure
Mr. Manning will too.

714
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,853
Wasn't this a stroke
of genius, Mary?

715
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,147
I wonder if Mr. Litchfield
would think so.

716
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,193
Ah, moonlight
and cherry blossoms.

717
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:39,780
- Tom, who's Doris?
- Doris?

718
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:42,700
Oh, an old coal miner
I met in a mineshaft.

719
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,077
- There we were...
- Blond or brunette?

720
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,745
It varies.

721
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,165
Tom, did you have a date
with her this evening?

722
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,251
Ah, moonlight
and cherry blossoms.

723
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:54,128
You did have a date with her.

724
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,338
Oh, now, Mary, you know
how it is in a town like this.

725
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,173
You go out with a girl
a few times,

726
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,009
everybody starts building it
into a big romance.

727
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,487
Is that how it is
with you and Doris?

728
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,887
That's how it is.

729
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,764
Only I didn't catch on
until Mr. Five Star

730
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,683
finally asked me
how I'd like to quit the navy

731
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,560
and go
into the newspaper business.

732
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,019
And the lieutenant no like, huh?

733
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,147
No like. I'm allergic
to permanent shore duty.

734
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,940
I wanna get back to sea.

735
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:17,985
I don't care whether it's on
a battle wagon or a war canoe.

736
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:20,404
Then how did you happen
to wind up at the White House?

737
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:23,407
Mr. Litchfield. He wanted
to make sure I'd be around.

738
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,034
The worst part of it is
it's a full year's assignment

739
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,287
and I've still got
11 months to go.

740
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,248
Oh, that is a long time.

741
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:33,709
Depends on whose company
I spend it in.

742
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:38,130
Must be getting close
to 19 bells, admiral,

743
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:39,882
or whatever you call it
in the navy,

744
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:42,217
when it's time for a working
girl to be going home.

745
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:48,515
It's been
a wonderful evening, Tom.

746
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,142
Thanks for everything.

747
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,246
What are you grinning about?

748
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,310
I was thinking how I tried

749
00:37:54,354 --> 00:37:55,564
to get out of this assignment

750
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:57,566
and how swell
it turned out to be.

751
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:06,033
Tom, do me a favor, will you?

752
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:07,367
Name it.

753
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,535
Kiss me goodnight.

754
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,788
Okay, I'm still on orders.

755
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,460
Kissing her
right under our noses.

756
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:18,545
I've got to find out
more about that young man.

757
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,255
Wait till I get me shoes.

758
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,636
- Why, thank you.
- And I thank you.

759
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:28,680
I thank the president.
And I thank you.

760
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,766
Very smart, Mary,
that ought to prove to them

761
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:33,060
that Phillip's a dead duck.

762
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:36,438
- Thanks again, Tom. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

763
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,858
Mary, you proved
something to me too.

764
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,152
I'll be around tomorrow
to pick up where we left off.

765
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,321
Strictly on a personal basis.

766
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:51,537
Hi.

767
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:57,584
What are you doing here?

768
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,087
I thought you two
would never break it up.

769
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,965
Well, I hope you got an earful,
you, you peeping Tom.

770
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:04,800
Oh, look, Miss Peppertree,

771
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:06,677
I didn't come here
for the floor show.

772
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,929
We had a date tonight, remember?

773
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:11,807
Oh, well, I'm sorry about that,
but it couldn't be helped.

774
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,392
I know, the navy came along.

775
00:39:13,475 --> 00:39:15,018
Well, that's not so,
Mr. Paxton.

776
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,329
You see, originally,
I was supposed

777
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:17,455
to go out with somebody else.

778
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:18,814
That's right, me.

779
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:20,691
No, not you, somebody else.

780
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:23,068
Well, good going.

781
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:25,046
You stood up somebody else
to make a date with me,

782
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,548
then stood me up
to go out with a sailor.

783
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,781
A double double-cross.

784
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,133
If you'll stop jumping
at conclusions,

785
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:30,701
I'll try to tell you
what happened.

786
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:32,720
Don't bother. The date
doesn't interest me at all.

787
00:39:32,744 --> 00:39:34,222
I merely waited to show you
that I was living up

788
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,414
to my part of the bargain.

789
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:37,165
And I'm willing
to live up to mine.

790
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,601
We can get together
sometime tomorrow.

791
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,669
Skip it.
Judging from past performances,

792
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:42,629
I don't think
you're the dependable type.

793
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,922
Between now and tomorrow,

794
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,382
you're liable to run
into a marine.

795
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:47,193
I insist that you let me
tell you what happened.

796
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:48,510
It's perfectly obvious.

797
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,346
You just figured
that you could do better.

798
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,892
And, uh,
while we're on the subject,

799
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,102
you could have done
just as well with me.

800
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:05,402
It's a different one.

801
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,739
Goodnight, Miss Peppertree.

802
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,915
The general is in Alaska,

803
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,583
but I can put you through
to his aide.

804
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,752
Your appointment has been
changed to 3 o'clock, sir.

805
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:24,463
Call for you, Mary.
The president on 1.

806
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,885
Good morning, Mr. President.

807
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:32,679
Oh, yes, I had a lovely time.
Thank you.

808
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,390
Oh, he was very nice
and considerate.

809
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,352
It was most thoughtful of you,
Mr. President.

810
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,436
Thank you very much.

811
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,979
I'll give him your message.

812
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,423
Listen, girls,
if Mr. Paxton calls,

813
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,607
let me take it, will you?

814
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,275
I was wondering
what was missing.

815
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,736
Eleven o'clock and
Brother Paxton hasn't called.

816
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:49,738
Eleven o'clock.
Time for coffee relief.

817
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:51,239
Right away, sir.

818
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,908
Oh, if Mr. Paxton calls
while I'm out,

819
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:54,326
ask him to call back.

820
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,246
Ask him to call back.
Is she kidding?

821
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,419
Oh, Miss Peppertree, I was just
on my way over to see you.

822
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,773
The president has an idea
something went wrong last night.

823
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,174
You didn't sound very convincing
over the phone.

824
00:41:09,257 --> 00:41:11,385
Well, to tell you the truth,
Mr. Elwood,

825
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:14,054
I had another date
and I had to stand him up.

826
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:15,639
Oh, that is serious.

827
00:41:15,722 --> 00:41:17,158
Yes, it wasn't
a very nice thing to do.

828
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:18,742
And he thinks
I'm a pretty awful person.

829
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,477
He does, eh?

830
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,789
Well, Mary, if the president
got you into this situation,

831
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,253
it's up to him to get you out.
That's what presidents are for.

832
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:26,542
Oh, no, Mr. Elwood,
I wouldn't think

833
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:28,193
of bothering the president.

834
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:31,154
But if you have a spare moment,
his name is David Paxton

835
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,073
and he lives
at the Puriton Hotel.

836
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,337
Oh, that's probably
for you, miss.

837
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,464
Nobody in this town
would be calling me.

838
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,053
Hello?

839
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,765
Yes, sir.

840
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,601
It is for you, sir.
It's the president.

841
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,854
I don't know any president.

842
00:42:03,937 --> 00:42:06,231
The president? Oh, no.

843
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:08,150
No, no, no, no. Just a minute.

844
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,319
Hello.

845
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,030
Mr. President?

846
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,823
Yes, this is David Paxton.

847
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,452
Who?

848
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:19,911
Oh, her?

849
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,289
Why, I didn't give it a thought,
Mr. President.

850
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:24,708
Oh, believe me, sir,
it's very unimportant.

851
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,294
What I wanna discuss is my fish.

852
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:29,546
No. F-I-S-H.

853
00:42:29,629 --> 00:42:33,091
Yes, that's right,
Mr. President, fish. Now...

854
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:37,429
Well, yes, she's probably
a very nice girl, but I, I...

855
00:42:37,512 --> 00:42:40,682
Oh, yes, I... I'm sure she is,
Mr. President, but...

856
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,434
But what about my fish?

857
00:42:42,517 --> 00:42:45,062
I can't get near them
on account of the navy.

858
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,606
Mr. President, don't hang up.

859
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:48,982
Mr. President!

860
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,071
He hung up.

861
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:58,700
Oh, Mary.

862
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,065
I didn't want to discuss this
in front of the other girls.

863
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,746
That's why I asked you
to come here.

864
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:04,623
Yes, Mr. Elwood.

865
00:43:04,706 --> 00:43:07,918
I don't know the exact situation
between you and Mr. Paxton,

866
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:10,295
but if you're entertaining
any serious thoughts about him,

867
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:11,922
I'm afraid
he doesn't return them.

868
00:43:12,005 --> 00:43:14,257
Oh, but I'm not, Mr. Elwood.
Why, I hardly know him.

869
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,009
The president will be glad
to hear it.

870
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,428
Frankly, he wasn't
very impressed with Mr. Paxton.

871
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:22,974
The young man doesn't seem
to be entirely, uh, rational.

872
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,394
Oh, no, he didn't talk
to the president about fish?

873
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,064
Every time
your name was mentioned.

874
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:31,274
Oh, please, thank the president
for me, Mr. Elwood,

875
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,735
and tell him I don't ever expect
to see Mr. Paxton again.

876
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,862
I'm sure the president
will be pleased.

877
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,949
Uh, you see, Mary,
just between you and me,

878
00:43:39,032 --> 00:43:40,659
it's the president's
unofficial opinion

879
00:43:40,742 --> 00:43:44,287
that Mr. Paxton
is more or less of a square.

880
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:54,714
Well, keep the country running
until I get back.

881
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,341
I'll try, Mary.

882
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,387
Hi.

883
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:04,808
Thanks for the assist with
the president, Miss Peppertree.

884
00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:06,911
It was a good try even though
I didn't get any place.

885
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,563
Did you ever try talking about
anything besides fish?

886
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:11,314
Oh, but that's why
I came to Washington.

887
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,649
You see, years ago, my...

888
00:44:12,732 --> 00:44:14,317
I don't wanna seem rude,
Mr. Paxton,

889
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,944
and I'm sure
it's a fascinating story,

890
00:44:16,027 --> 00:44:17,571
but I only get one hour
for lunch.

891
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:19,030
If I skim over the details

892
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,949
of my early childhood,
I can just make it.

893
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:22,284
- No, thank you.
- Oh, please.

894
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:23,869
Let me take you to lunch.

895
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,832
I promise I won't tell you
the story of my life.

896
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,372
You promise not to mention fish?

897
00:44:27,455 --> 00:44:29,624
Fish? Never heard of it.

898
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,376
Which way
are we headed?

899
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:33,670
Well, I have a very special
place for nice spring days.

900
00:44:33,753 --> 00:44:35,297
No minimum, no cover.

901
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:51,313
Are they all ham?

902
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:53,398
They only had ham
and one other kind.

903
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:54,816
What other kind?

904
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,943
It's unmentionable.

905
00:44:58,486 --> 00:45:01,072
Sardines?

906
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,868
Now you brought the subject up.
Don't blame me.

907
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:06,991
Well, as long as we have opened
the can of sardines,

908
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,915
what is all this
about fish and the navy?

909
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,292
Well, to begin at the beginning,

910
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,336
have you ever heard
of "Paxton's Encyclopedia.

911
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:16,338
Of Marine Life In The Pacific?"

912
00:45:16,421 --> 00:45:18,632
- You?
- My father.

913
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:21,801
He was considered just about the
world's foremost ichthyologist.

914
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,513
About 40 years ago,
he came across Cocopango Atoll.

915
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,433
Had a crystal clear lagoon
teeming with fish.

916
00:45:28,516 --> 00:45:30,268
Perfect spot
for a marine laboratory.

917
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,592
- So he bought it.
- The lagoon?

918
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,230
No, no, the whole island.

919
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,523
Oh, it's just a tiny place
with a handful of natives.

920
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,901
Anyway, when he died,
I took over.

921
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:40,946
I was doing a passable job, too,
when the war broke out.

922
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,215
When I got back
four years later,

923
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,531
I found the navy had moved in.

924
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,009
They wouldn't even let me
near the place.

925
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,593
Didn't you tell them
it was your island?

926
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,828
Oh, I got writer's cramps
sending letters

927
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,789
to every department
in Washington.

928
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:52,767
And every department
in Washington kept referring me

929
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,501
to every other department
in Washington.

930
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:56,086
So I finally decided
to come here

931
00:45:56,169 --> 00:45:57,813
and take it up
with the headman personally.

932
00:45:57,837 --> 00:46:00,173
Now is there anything
unreasonable in that?

933
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,425
Not at all.
Why didn't you get a lawyer?

934
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,969
Oh, I did, in Honolulu.

935
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,470
He wrote as many letters
as I did,

936
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,931
but it didn't do
any good either.

937
00:46:08,014 --> 00:46:09,700
I know just the man
who can tell you what to do.

938
00:46:09,724 --> 00:46:11,160
Phillip Manning,
the fellow I was with

939
00:46:11,184 --> 00:46:12,703
at the restaurant
a couple of nights ago.

940
00:46:12,727 --> 00:46:13,996
He's one
of the smartest assistants

941
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,480
in the Attorney General's
office.

942
00:46:15,563 --> 00:46:16,999
I'll make an appointment
with him for tonight.

943
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:18,376
You pick me up at home
at 8 o'clock.

944
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,819
Well, that's swell.

945
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:23,321
I guess I better be
getting back to work.

946
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,823
You know, Miss Peppertree,

947
00:46:24,906 --> 00:46:27,200
if I ever get back to my work
in Cocopango,

948
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,452
I'm gonna name a fish after you.

949
00:46:32,038 --> 00:46:34,624
Come in, dad.

950
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,418
- Your date's here.
- Good. I'm all ready.

951
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:38,837
- But it isn't...
- I know it isn't Phillip again.

952
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,548
Now don't you read too late.
You're on early duty tomorrow.

953
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:42,841
Goodnight.

954
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,435
Tom, what is this?

955
00:46:53,518 --> 00:46:55,979
We're going to the movies.

956
00:46:56,062 --> 00:46:58,606
- Oh, no, we're not.
- Oh, yes, we are.

957
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,567
It's a special movie.
It's at the White House.

958
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,777
The president suggested
that I ask you.

959
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,130
But you knew
I had a date tonight.

960
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,363
I told you on the phone.

961
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,324
Yes, but you didn't tell
the president.

962
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,076
- You could've told him.
- Oh, no, I'm no stool pigeon.

963
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,204
And, besides, the president
doesn't like Paxton.

964
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,582
- What do you know about Paxton?
- Not much.

965
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:16,851
Except that I heard
the president

966
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,668
and Mr. Elwood discussing him.

967
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,670
Frankly, Mary,
from what they think of him,

968
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,840
you'd be in much better company
with me.

969
00:47:23,923 --> 00:47:26,134
I'm not so sure.

970
00:47:26,217 --> 00:47:28,595
Mary, who do you think's
a better judge of character,

971
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:31,264
you or the president?

972
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,141
Alright.
Now you wait here.

973
00:47:33,224 --> 00:47:35,643
I have to leave a message
for Mr. Paxton.

974
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,729
Dad?

975
00:47:37,812 --> 00:47:39,230
Dad?

976
00:47:40,273 --> 00:47:41,816
Oh, here we are.

977
00:47:50,658 --> 00:47:52,035
The president is tied up.

978
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:54,204
He suggests
that we go ahead without him.

979
00:48:05,423 --> 00:48:07,592
Good evening, Manning.
Remember me?

980
00:48:07,675 --> 00:48:08,968
- Yes. Hello, Paxton.
- Hello.

981
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,512
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

982
00:48:10,595 --> 00:48:12,972
Miss Peppertree left word for me
to meet you here.

983
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,558
- Where is Mary?
- She'll join us later.

984
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,228
- Now, here's the situation...
- Why later?

985
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:19,938
Another date.

986
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:22,107
I have here a treaty
between my father

987
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,150
and the native king
of Cocopango Atoll...

988
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,485
With whom?

989
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:27,237
The native king
of Cocopango Atoll.

990
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,530
No. I mean, her date.

991
00:48:28,613 --> 00:48:30,573
Oh, the same fellow
as last night.

992
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,991
Now you'll notice that in this...

993
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,077
- Farrington?
- Yeah.

994
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,496
It's not like Mary to make
an appointment and not keep it.

995
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:38,039
Well, it's not her fault,
Manning.

996
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,125
Orders from the president.

997
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,977
On the strength of this treaty,
my father went...

998
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:44,045
What's the president
got to do with it?

999
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,589
Don't ask me. I only know
what her father told me.

1000
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,924
She went out with Farrington

1001
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:49,843
because the president
wanted her to.

1002
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,612
Now you'll notice that
in the terms of this treaty...

1003
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:53,388
So that's it.

1004
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:56,057
Now, wait a minute, Manning.

1005
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,101
Congress cannot tax exports,

1006
00:48:58,184 --> 00:48:59,853
suspend the right
of habeas corpus

1007
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:02,397
except in wartime
or pass an ex post facto law

1008
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,107
or a bill of attainder.

1009
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:06,151
Now you ask me a hard one.

1010
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,611
Gentlemen, I've just found out
what's going on

1011
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,363
between Mary
and that naval officer.

1012
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,341
She was ordered to go out
with him by the president.

1013
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:14,284
- Oh, nonsense, Phillip.
- It's true, sir.

1014
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:16,035
She's out with him again
right now.

1015
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,180
Not because she wants to
but on account of the president.

1016
00:49:18,204 --> 00:49:20,957
Oh, I'm sure there's
a logical explanation, Phillip.

1017
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,084
I'm having dinner
at the White House on Sunday

1018
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,794
and I'll mention it
to the president.

1019
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:28,006
Sunday? Anything can happen
between now and Sunday.

1020
00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:30,175
I'm seeing the president
on Thursday.

1021
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,178
What can happen before Sunday
can happen before Thursday.

1022
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,555
Well, Phillip,
if it'll make you any happier,

1023
00:49:35,638 --> 00:49:38,266
I'll phone Elwood right now
and find out what's going on.

1024
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:39,893
Thank you, sir.

1025
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,276
Projection room.

1026
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:49,819
One moment, please.

1027
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,792
Elwood speaking.

1028
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,961
Oh, good evening,
Justice Peabody.

1029
00:50:08,254 --> 00:50:09,464
Why, yes.

1030
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,050
Really, I had no idea.

1031
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:13,927
I'm sure
the president didn't either.

1032
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,229
Well, I'm afraid I can't discuss
it over the phone, Mr. Justice.

1033
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,397
Where are you?

1034
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,941
I'll come right over.

1035
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,281
More coffee, sir?

1036
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,867
No, thanks.
Seven cups are enough.

1037
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,665
I have read all the books about
the rights of the president.

1038
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:46,459
Bills he can sign,
bills he can veto,

1039
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,878
the first baseball
he can throw out every season.

1040
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,505
But not in one book it says

1041
00:50:50,588 --> 00:50:52,465
that he can break up
Phillip and Mary.

1042
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,029
I... I don't like
to intrude, Manning,

1043
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,552
but, uh, will you
be much longer?

1044
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,470
Oh, I'm sorry, we've been
waiting for someone,

1045
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,156
but we can get your business
straightened out

1046
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,598
in the meantime.

1047
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,642
Now as I said before
about this treaty,

1048
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:04,405
I'm sure you'll find
it clearly establishes

1049
00:51:04,435 --> 00:51:06,813
my legal title
to Cocopango Atoll.

1050
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:08,332
The marine laboratory
that my father...

1051
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,983
Sorry, Paxton.
There's our man.

1052
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,212
I'm telling you,
this fellow with Phillip,

1053
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,862
I've seen some place.

1054
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,657
But, Gustav, you must see
hundreds of people in here.

1055
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,410
Yes, but this was
some place not here.

1056
00:51:20,493 --> 00:51:22,996
- Oh, here's Elwood.
- Oh, hello, Harvey.

1057
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,956
- Mr. Justice.
- Sit down.

1058
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:27,584
Nice of you to come
and solve this riddle for us.

1059
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,003
What is this interest of the
president in Miss Peppertree?

1060
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,838
Well, I'm sure
the president didn't think

1061
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:33,691
it was going to become a matter
for the Supreme Court.

1062
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,174
He merely became
acquainted with her

1063
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,898
over the telephone
and wanted to help her.

1064
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:40,013
Neither of us had any idea
that Mr. Manning was concerned.

1065
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,431
We thought
we were protecting her

1066
00:51:41,514 --> 00:51:44,142
from a very disagreeable
young man named Paxton.

1067
00:51:44,225 --> 00:51:46,311
- David Paxton?
- Well, yes. Do you know him?

1068
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,271
He's sitting right over there.
Excuse me.

1069
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,483
Mr. Paxton,
I wanna speak to you.

1070
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:55,069
Well, it's about time. Now if
you'll just look at this tre...

1071
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,463
I'm not interested
in your treaty.

1072
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:57,847
I'm concerned
with Mary Peppertree.

1073
00:51:57,905 --> 00:51:59,407
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Manning,

1074
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,576
can't you talk about anybody
but Mary Peppertree?

1075
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:03,828
I wanna know what's been
going on with you and Mary.

1076
00:52:05,955 --> 00:52:08,041
Look, Manning,
I've been accused

1077
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,918
of having a one-track mind.
Fish.

1078
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,879
But everybody I run across
in Washington

1079
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:14,881
is in much worse shape
than I am.

1080
00:52:14,964 --> 00:52:18,926
You people are all suffering
from a Mary Peppertree fixation.

1081
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,170
I'm getting out of this town.

1082
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:21,512
Maybe in six months or so,

1083
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,781
you'll have something
on your minds

1084
00:52:22,805 --> 00:52:24,474
besides Mary Peppertree.

1085
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,317
Good work, Manning.
That was a fast exit.

1086
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,027
And a permanent one.
He's leaving town.

1087
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:37,779
Oh, well, I guess
that solves our problem.

1088
00:52:37,862 --> 00:52:39,262
Good luck
with, uh, Miss Peppertree.

1089
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,573
Thanks.

1090
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:43,743
Well, good evening, Sam.

1091
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:45,262
Rather late to be having dinner,
isn't it?

1092
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:46,513
Your office told me
I'd find you here

1093
00:52:46,537 --> 00:52:47,664
and I didn't come to eat.

1094
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,582
- Something wrong?
- Plenty.

1095
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,810
After the way my papers have
been supporting the president,

1096
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:54,379
he's certainly picking a fine
way to show his gratitude.

1097
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,172
Well, I don't follow you, Sam.

1098
00:52:56,255 --> 00:52:58,383
It's Farrington
and that Peppertree girl.

1099
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:01,094
Oh, not you too.

1100
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,471
Now, let's sit down
and talk this over calmly.

1101
00:53:03,554 --> 00:53:06,224
I am afraid I'm getting
a little old, Sam.

1102
00:53:06,307 --> 00:53:08,393
Just where do you fit
into the picture?

1103
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,770
Farrington and my daughter
are practically engaged.

1104
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:12,647
Now all of a sudden,
two nights in a row,

1105
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,274
he breaks dates to go out
with that telephone operator.

1106
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,652
And I understand it was
the president who arranged it.

1107
00:53:17,735 --> 00:53:19,463
Believe me, Sam,
there's no cause for concern.

1108
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,967
Miss Peppertree
is practically married

1109
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,907
to that young man
talking to Justice Peabody.

1110
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,593
Then why isn't she with him
instead of Farrington?

1111
00:53:24,617 --> 00:53:26,345
Stop worrying, Sam,
it's bad for the liver.

1112
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,662
There's absolutely nothing

1113
00:53:27,745 --> 00:53:29,539
between Farrington
and Miss Peppertree.

1114
00:53:29,622 --> 00:53:31,502
It doesn't look that way
from where I'm sitting.

1115
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:35,211
Oh, Mr. Elwood.

1116
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:37,296
We wondered
what happened to you.

1117
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,066
- Good evening, Mr. Litchfield.
- Good evening.

1118
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,926
Thomas, I'd like a word
with you privately.

1119
00:53:42,009 --> 00:53:43,678
I can take a hint.

1120
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:45,930
Remember, admiral,
don't give up the ship.

1121
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,516
Thomas?

1122
00:53:53,312 --> 00:53:55,857
I did alright with Paxton.
Let me handle Mary too.

1123
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,067
- Hello, everyone.
- Good evening, Mary.

1124
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,403
- Where's Mr. Paxton?
- He left.

1125
00:54:00,486 --> 00:54:02,238
Well, that's funny.
He was supposed to wait.

1126
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:04,782
He couldn't very well.
I practically threw him out.

1127
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,660
Why? Phillip, you knew this was
terribly important to him.

1128
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,371
What I'd like to know is
why it's so important to you.

1129
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,957
Well, for only one reason.
I thought I could help him.

1130
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,810
If you didn't wanna, you should
have said so in the first place.

1131
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,419
Mary, in our opinion,
you're making

1132
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:18,004
a fool of yourself
over this Paxton.

1133
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:19,767
If anybody's making
a fool of me, it's you.

1134
00:54:19,797 --> 00:54:21,650
Now you've put me
in such a ridiculous position,

1135
00:54:21,674 --> 00:54:23,509
I can't even try
to explain to him.

1136
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,431
Goodnight, gentlemen.
Goodbye, Phillip.

1137
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,309
This time she's really mad,

1138
00:54:31,392 --> 00:54:32,977
but I shall talk to her.

1139
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,479
Tom, will you, please,
take me home?

1140
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,772
- Certainly.
- Mary, please.

1141
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,191
Oh, excuse me.
Mary, you can't go now.

1142
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,485
I'm sorry, Gustav, but there's
no reason for me to stay.

1143
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,487
Just a moment, Thomas,
Doris wanted me

1144
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,280
to remind you
that we're expecting you

1145
00:54:44,363 --> 00:54:46,003
to go to the opera with us
tomorrow night.

1146
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,534
I'm sorry, sir, but I've already
invited Miss Peppertree.

1147
00:54:49,702 --> 00:54:51,120
Harvey?

1148
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,581
Now, Sam, I'm sure
we'll straighten this out.

1149
00:54:53,664 --> 00:54:55,750
You'd better.
And I wouldn't count too much

1150
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:57,835
on that young man
with Justice Peabody.

1151
00:54:59,962 --> 00:55:02,965
Gustav, if this thing is serious
between Mary and the lieutenant,

1152
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,634
I'm in a spot.

1153
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:07,094
Last night,
I saw him kissing her.

1154
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,805
Last night.

1155
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,181
But when we came downstairs,

1156
00:55:10,264 --> 00:55:12,099
it wasn't the lieutenant
she was kissing.

1157
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,101
It was a different one.

1158
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,145
- That's where I saw him.
- Who?

1159
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,147
Paxton.
He's the different one.

1160
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,233
He is, huh?

1161
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,692
But, Gustav, Mary strikes me

1162
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,170
as a girl
with pretty good judgment.

1163
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:26,572
There must be something
to Paxton we don't see.

1164
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,618
At any rate, I'd rather
he didn't leave town just now.

1165
00:55:30,701 --> 00:55:32,495
It's not enough
I have my examination,

1166
00:55:32,578 --> 00:55:35,122
now I have this to worry about.

1167
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,084
- Well?
- Phillip, I have news for you.

1168
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:40,211
This fellow you threw out,

1169
00:55:40,294 --> 00:55:42,505
Mr. Elwood
is going to throw back.

1170
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,686
- Well, hello, Manning.
- Mr. Paxton.

1171
00:55:56,769 --> 00:55:58,354
This is a surprise.

1172
00:55:58,437 --> 00:56:00,147
Well, I feel
I owe you an apology

1173
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,834
and I'd like to make amends
for last night.

1174
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,317
- Ah, forget it.
- No.

1175
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,819
What was it you wanted me to do?

1176
00:56:04,902 --> 00:56:06,422
Well, that's very nice
of you, Manning,

1177
00:56:06,487 --> 00:56:08,990
but, uh, the situation's
well under control.

1178
00:56:09,073 --> 00:56:10,843
Mr. Elwood and his assistant,
Mr. Crombie, were here

1179
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,201
just a little while ago.

1180
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,828
They're taking care
of everything.

1181
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:15,746
Oh, they are.

1182
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,540
Oh, I see you're leaving town.

1183
00:56:17,623 --> 00:56:20,251
- No, no, I'm unpacking.
- Unpacking?

1184
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:22,753
Yeah, according to Mr. Elwood,
it'll be about three weeks

1185
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,380
before I can expect any action.

1186
00:56:24,463 --> 00:56:26,716
Nonsense. I can get
the Attorney General's office

1187
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,277
working on it
and have the entire matter

1188
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,802
determined in 24 hours.

1189
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:33,598
Well, that's great.
Gee, I sure appreciate that.

1190
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,766
I have all the papers
you'll need right here

1191
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,394
including a photostatted copy
of the original treaty.

1192
00:56:40,479 --> 00:56:42,690
Now don't you go building up
any romances, dad.

1193
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:44,066
I'm only going to the opera

1194
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,651
with the lieutenant
to do him a favor.

1195
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,504
He helped me with
the Phillip Manning situation

1196
00:56:47,528 --> 00:56:49,548
and I'm going to help him with
the Doris Litchfield situation.

1197
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,033
- That's all there is to it.
- Well, he's a fine young man.

1198
00:56:52,116 --> 00:56:53,576
And if he's okay
with the president,

1199
00:56:53,659 --> 00:56:54,869
he's alright with me.

1200
00:56:54,952 --> 00:56:56,203
There you go.

1201
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,496
Here's your toast.

1202
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,915
There he is.

1203
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,708
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1204
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,851
Why, Mr. Paxton,
what are you doing here?

1205
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,811
I'm taking you to the opera.

1206
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,147
- Oh, aren't you expecting me?
- Oh, no.

1207
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,857
I'm going to the opera
but not with you.

1208
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,233
That's funny.

1209
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,735
Mr. Elwood sent
this pair of tickets

1210
00:57:27,818 --> 00:57:29,320
to my hotel this afternoon.

1211
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:31,948
Uh, along with this suit,
a government car,

1212
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,950
uh, this corsage,

1213
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,952
and a note saying
you were expecting me.

1214
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,536
I don't understand.

1215
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,306
He knew I was going
with Lieutenant Farrington.

1216
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,749
Oh, Farrington?
Oh, well, he can't make it.

1217
00:57:41,832 --> 00:57:45,336
He's tied up on special duty
aboard the president's yacht.

1218
00:57:45,419 --> 00:57:47,171
And Mr. Elwood sent you instead?

1219
00:57:47,254 --> 00:57:49,924
He didn't want you
to be disappointed.

1220
00:57:50,007 --> 00:57:52,885
Mr. Paxton, from previous
conversations with Mr. Elwood,

1221
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,971
I have reason
to be a little skeptical.

1222
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,932
Oh, it's all here in the note.
Read it for yourself.

1223
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,351
Official White House stationery.

1224
00:58:00,434 --> 00:58:02,061
Mr. Elwood's really
going to bat for me.

1225
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:03,437
I'm finally getting some action.

1226
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,022
He tells me
I have you to thank.

1227
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,816
- Me?
- Yes.

1228
00:58:06,899 --> 00:58:08,484
Oh, good evening,
Mr. Peppertree.

1229
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:09,944
Evening. Mm?

1230
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,656
Well, let's go, Mr. Paxton.

1231
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:15,449
Uh, but, Mary,
what'll I tell you-know-who?

1232
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,742
You-know-who isn't coming.

1233
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,244
But suppose
he calls or something?

1234
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:20,079
Just refer him
to the White House, dad.

1235
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:24,792
I wish the president
would make up his mind.

1236
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,008
You don't seem very happy,
Mr. Paxton.

1237
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,510
Miss Peppertree,
I... I have a confession to make.

1238
00:58:34,593 --> 00:58:38,431
- I hate opera.
- Oh, now, really, Mr. Paxton?

1239
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:41,142
Why, here it is,
a beautiful spring evening,

1240
00:58:41,225 --> 00:58:42,810
the breaks are finally
coming my way,

1241
00:58:42,893 --> 00:58:45,479
I'm at peace with the world,
I love everybody,

1242
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,314
and we're gonna go and sit
in a stuffy hall,

1243
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,358
listen to a lot of wailing
and bellowing

1244
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:51,152
about who killed whom and why.

1245
00:58:51,235 --> 00:58:53,571
Oh, but nobody gets killed
in "The Barber Of Seville."

1246
00:58:53,654 --> 00:58:56,699
If nobody gets killed,
it can't be much of an opera.

1247
00:58:56,782 --> 00:58:58,492
Oh, why waste our time?

1248
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,369
Here it is,
a beautiful spring evening...

1249
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,622
I catch, Mr. Paxton.
Where to instead?

1250
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,958
I'm in your hands.
After all, this is your town.

1251
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,002
Mm-hmm,
and I know it like a book.

1252
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:10,546
Page 1, Lincoln Memorial.

1253
00:59:10,629 --> 00:59:13,132
Page 2, Jefferson Memorial.

1254
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:15,843
Page 3, Arlington.

1255
00:59:15,926 --> 00:59:19,680
Page 11.
I think I like this the best.

1256
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,515
That's why I saved it
until last.

1257
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,934
Change these cherry blossoms
to gardenias,

1258
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,520
toss in a few thousand
wild orchids,

1259
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,689
we'd be on the beach
of Cocopango.

1260
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,983
You're back there again,
are you?

1261
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,777
It's the only way
I can get there.

1262
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,546
Oh, I think your worries
are just about over

1263
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,989
now that Mr. Elwood's in there
pitching for you.

1264
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,657
Elwood.

1265
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,844
Mary, what do I tell him
if he asks me about the opera?

1266
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,912
I don't know anything about it.

1267
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:49,251
W... well, it's, uh, it's about
a barber named Figaro.

1268
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,629
He's the Mr. Fix-it of Seville.

1269
00:59:51,712 --> 00:59:52,963
He spends half his time

1270
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,507
kibitzing everything
that's going on

1271
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,342
and the other half
bragging about it.

1272
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:59,637
All in a deep,
rich baritone voice.

1273
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,306
The curtain goes up on the first
act, scene one, and the stage...

1274
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:05,267
Mary, I don't have to know
all about it.

1275
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:07,436
Isn't there a, uh, hit tune?

1276
01:00:10,147 --> 01:00:12,066
Yes. Yes, there is.

1277
01:00:12,149 --> 01:00:14,151
- How's your memory?
- Dynamite.

1278
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,653
- It is, huh?
- Sure.

1279
01:00:15,736 --> 01:00:17,071
Then start concentrating.

1280
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,244
Moonlight and cherry blossom.

1281
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:37,873
They sure is intoxicating
to you young folks.

1282
01:04:37,956 --> 01:04:40,334
But you're lucky
the police didn't catch you.

1283
01:04:40,417 --> 01:04:43,045
There's a law against swimmin'
in that lagoon.

1284
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:45,422
Bertha, you're just as bad
as my father.

1285
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:47,067
Now I came here
so I wouldn't have to go home

1286
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,384
and explain all this to him.

1287
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,219
I told you what happened.

1288
01:04:50,302 --> 01:04:52,805
Please, hurry up. Mr. Paxton's
gonna get tired of waiting.

1289
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:56,475
Alright, but there's one thing
you still didn't tell me.

1290
01:04:56,558 --> 01:04:59,937
What was Mr. Paxton doing
when that Barber Figaro

1291
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,355
pushed you in?

1292
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:09,071
- It's been a wonderful evening.
- Yes, it has.

1293
01:05:09,154 --> 01:05:11,865
I'm certainly glad
you-know-who couldn't make it.

1294
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,460
It's funny the way
things work out, isn't it?

1295
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:18,080
- How is that?
- Well, I...

1296
01:05:18,163 --> 01:05:19,832
Nothing.

1297
01:05:19,915 --> 01:05:21,792
I think
maybe I'd better go in now.

1298
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:23,919
- Goodnight, David.
- Goodnight, Mary.

1299
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:28,215
David...

1300
01:05:28,298 --> 01:05:30,759
there's something
I've got to find out.

1301
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:40,436
I found out.

1302
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,729
It happened again.

1303
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:44,523
The same thing happened
the other night.

1304
01:05:44,606 --> 01:05:46,775
- Don't you feel well?
- Oh, I feel wonderful.

1305
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:50,028
You see, David, every time...

1306
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,531
- Phillip.
- I beg your pardon?

1307
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:53,740
What are you doing here?

1308
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,117
I've been waiting
for Mr. Paxton.

1309
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,827
- For me?
- Yes.

1310
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:59,663
I've checked your documents.
You've got a valid claim.

1311
01:05:59,746 --> 01:06:02,249
I've filed the necessary papers
in the proper court.

1312
01:06:02,332 --> 01:06:03,810
The case doesn't come up
for over a year,

1313
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,544
but you'll be notified in time.

1314
01:06:05,627 --> 01:06:07,296
I thought
I should tell you tonight

1315
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:09,465
knowing how anxious you are
to get out of Washington.

1316
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:13,051
Well, I, uh, I appreciate your
speed and efficiency, Manning,

1317
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,053
but, uh, I've changed my plans.

1318
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,055
I'm, uh, staying around a while.

1319
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,099
I assure you I can handle
everything for you.

1320
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,392
Not everything.

1321
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,478
Tom.

1322
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:23,937
Is this a private sewing circle

1323
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,814
or are you taking
in new members?

1324
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,650
I suppose you came to discuss
business with Mr. Paxton too.

1325
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,194
Unh-unh. I was here earlier

1326
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,117
and I had a little chat
with your dad and left.

1327
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,531
Mr. Elwood's note said
that you were tied up.

1328
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,742
At 6 o'clock this evening,
Miss Peppertree,

1329
01:06:36,825 --> 01:06:38,385
Lieutenant Farrington
was ordered aboard

1330
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:41,038
the presidential yacht
to check supplies for a trip

1331
01:06:41,121 --> 01:06:43,457
that won't be made
for another three months.

1332
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,167
- That's funny.
- Not very.

1333
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,686
It was done deliberately,
so I wouldn't be

1334
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:48,253
able to keep our date.

1335
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,273
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Who'd do a thing like that?

1336
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:53,217
My friend Mr. Litchfield
and your friend Mr. Elwood.

1337
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,843
It's a conspiracy
to keep us apart

1338
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,807
and this guy's the patsy
they're using to do it.

1339
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,388
What are you so smug about?

1340
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,366
You're the patsy they picked
to split up Mary and me.

1341
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,059
- Now, Phillip, Tom...
- I don't get it.

1342
01:07:02,142 --> 01:07:04,102
Who's splitting up who?
What is all this?

1343
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,729
It's all very simple,
Mr. Paxton.

1344
01:07:05,812 --> 01:07:07,773
Farrington was brought in
to split up Mary and me.

1345
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:09,983
Now they're using you
to split up Mary and Farrington.

1346
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,336
Vicious little circle, isn't it?

1347
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,694
That's an understatement.

1348
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:14,047
Oh, it really isn't as bad
as it sounds...

1349
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,548
I think
you can save your explanations

1350
01:07:15,572 --> 01:07:17,574
for the switchboard,
Miss Peppertree.

1351
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:20,494
You know, just knowing you is
like living on a merry-go-round.

1352
01:07:20,577 --> 01:07:22,913
Only I'm not waiting around
to try for the brass ring.

1353
01:07:22,996 --> 01:07:24,933
- Won't you, please...
- No, I'm not gonna be a patsy.

1354
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,542
For you or for anyone else.

1355
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,228
Manning, you and the sailor
can fight it out.

1356
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:30,087
The field's wide open.

1357
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,421
- Mary...
- Mary...

1358
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:33,340
Well, I hope
you both are satisfied.

1359
01:07:33,423 --> 01:07:35,551
I've never felt so thoroughly
cheap and ashamed.

1360
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,660
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

1361
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:45,852
To get my hat. Do you mind?

1362
01:07:47,479 --> 01:07:49,648
- Mary...
- He just wants to get his hat.

1363
01:07:59,157 --> 01:08:01,076
Mary, I'm sorry
about what happened.

1364
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:05,330
You know I wouldn't do anything
to hurt you.

1365
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:08,125
Oh, I know that, Phillip.
It really wasn't your fault.

1366
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,502
Can't understand Paxton
taking that attitude.

1367
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,546
Understanding his attitude
is a full-time job

1368
01:08:12,629 --> 01:08:14,881
and I've given it up.

1369
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,985
You know, Phillip, you were
right in the first place.

1370
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:19,886
I never should have gone to work
on the White House switchboard.

1371
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,347
I was right about other things.

1372
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:25,309
We're not just a habit
with each other, Mary.

1373
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:27,519
We belong together.

1374
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:31,231
Oh, I don't know.
Right now, I'm all mixed up.

1375
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:33,609
You're really an awfully
nice person, Phillip, and...

1376
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:36,486
and, well, maybe you don't
give me the hiccups,

1377
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,281
but you don't give me
any headaches either.

1378
01:08:39,364 --> 01:08:41,950
I don't want to give you
anything but happiness.

1379
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,493
You get yourself
a good night's sleep

1380
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:45,704
and I'll call you
the first thing in the morning.

1381
01:08:52,836 --> 01:08:54,296
Goodnight, old man.

1382
01:09:07,976 --> 01:09:10,103
- I thought you'd gone.
- I couldn't.

1383
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,648
Not while
I'm still in the doghouse.

1384
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:15,692
Mary, I'm in love with you.

1385
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:16,943
But you couldn't be.

1386
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:20,072
I couldn't, I can't,
but there it is.

1387
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:22,157
I want you to marry me.

1388
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,202
Oh, Tom, we've only known
each other three days.

1389
01:09:25,285 --> 01:09:27,430
Well, what's the difference?
We've hit it off perfectly

1390
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:29,331
from the first minute.
That's what's important.

1391
01:09:29,414 --> 01:09:31,833
But only yesterday it was
a battleship that was important.

1392
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,795
Well, that was yesterday.
Today everything's different.

1393
01:09:34,878 --> 01:09:37,339
I don't know what to say, Tom.
I'm all mixed up.

1394
01:09:37,422 --> 01:09:39,383
We don't have to get married
right away.

1395
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,134
I'm patient.
I'm willing to wait.

1396
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,512
- Even a month, if necessary.
- Mary?

1397
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:49,434
I'll phone you
in the morning... honey.

1398
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,437
What in the world
is going on down there?

1399
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,939
I wish I knew.

1400
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,694
We have no record
of any such person. Sorry.

1401
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,571
The governor is not expected
until tomorrow, sir.

1402
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:03,758
You may get that information
from the State Department.

1403
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,492
White House.

1404
01:10:05,575 --> 01:10:07,744
Oh, good morning, Gustav.

1405
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:09,955
- Now, look...
- Phillip told me the good news.

1406
01:10:10,038 --> 01:10:12,749
Congratulations
to your re-engagement.

1407
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,852
Gustav, you're the fifth person
to congratulate me this morning,

1408
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:16,503
but there's nothing definite.

1409
01:10:16,586 --> 01:10:20,215
Oh, I'm sure Phillip and you
will be very, very happy.

1410
01:10:20,298 --> 01:10:22,300
And now
you can wish me luck too.

1411
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:25,095
My examination,
I'm taking on 4 o'clock.

1412
01:10:25,178 --> 01:10:28,265
And imagine, Justice Peabody is
going to swear me in right away.

1413
01:10:28,348 --> 01:10:29,850
I have not to wait.

1414
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:31,935
So tonight
I'll close up my place

1415
01:10:32,018 --> 01:10:33,395
and we'll have a party.

1416
01:10:33,478 --> 01:10:35,689
We'll celebrate
you and Phillip making up

1417
01:10:35,772 --> 01:10:38,984
and my citizenship
at the same time.

1418
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:41,319
That's fine, Gustav,
but about Phillip and me...

1419
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:42,964
I'm getting busy, Gustav.

1420
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,448
Goodbye and good luck.

1421
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:49,286
White House.

1422
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:50,787
Oh, good morning,
Justice Peabody.

1423
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:54,374
Oh, but it isn't all settled,
Mr. Justice.

1424
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:57,502
Mary, a call for you on 4.

1425
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,797
Well, I have another call,
Justice Peabody.

1426
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:02,299
Well, thank you very much.

1427
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:06,344
Miss Peppertree speaking.

1428
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,781
Oh, Justice Van Sloan, now, I
know what you're going to say...

1429
01:11:08,805 --> 01:11:10,223
Mary, on 3.

1430
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:12,392
- Tell him to wait.
- It's the president.

1431
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:16,188
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Justice, but
I can't talk to you right now.

1432
01:11:16,271 --> 01:11:18,190
Yes, it's a very happy moment.
Thank you.

1433
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:21,943
Good morning, Mr. President.

1434
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:26,782
Oh, thank you, sir, but there
seems to be a little misunder...

1435
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:32,746
Lieutenant Farrington.
Oh, but, Mr. President...

1436
01:11:32,829 --> 01:11:34,372
Next month?

1437
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,416
Oh, b... but that isn't definite,
Mr. President.

1438
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,418
I... I mean, there's nothing...

1439
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:42,172
Thank you, sir.

1440
01:11:42,255 --> 01:11:44,716
- Thank you very much.
- Mary.

1441
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,426
It's no use, Harkey.

1442
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:48,637
You better start looking
for another girl.

1443
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,807
Looks like I'll just
have to marry somebody.

1444
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,017
I'm sorry, Mr. Litchfield,
but I have no idea

1445
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,812
where to locate Mr. Elwood.

1446
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:59,207
Yes, Mr. Litchfield, he knows
about Farrington's engagement

1447
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:02,859
and I assure you he is just as
disturbed about it as you are.

1448
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:06,404
Yes, Mr. Litchfield,
I'll tell him when he comes in.

1449
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,782
- Angry, huh?
- Steaming.

1450
01:12:08,865 --> 01:12:10,534
Crombie, I don't get it.

1451
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,369
I'm certain that girl
is no more in love

1452
01:12:12,452 --> 01:12:14,579
with Farrington than I am.

1453
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,956
Get David Paxton on the phone.

1454
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:17,791
I'm sorry, sir,
but he's left Washington.

1455
01:12:17,874 --> 01:12:19,227
As a matter of fact,
his plane took off

1456
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:20,627
just about ten minutes ago.

1457
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:22,254
Oh, fine.

1458
01:12:22,337 --> 01:12:23,797
He's my one hope of breaking up

1459
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,423
this Farrington thing,
now he's gone.

1460
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:27,384
Probably on his way
out of the country.

1461
01:12:27,467 --> 01:12:28,611
Well, it's just as well, sir.
He shouldn't have been here

1462
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,595
in the first place.

1463
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:31,906
That's one
of the odd complications

1464
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,223
I found in this case, sir.

1465
01:12:33,306 --> 01:12:34,641
Mr. Paxton is not a citizen.

1466
01:12:34,724 --> 01:12:36,518
Technically, he's guilty
of illegal entry.

1467
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:38,144
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive, sir.

1468
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:39,771
I checked
with the State Department.

1469
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,815
- According to his father's...
- Skip the details.

1470
01:12:41,898 --> 01:12:44,359
And get me the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.

1471
01:12:44,442 --> 01:12:47,195
And then ask Miss Peppertree
to come here.

1472
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:48,840
Get me the Immigration
Department, please.

1473
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,383
You know, Crombie,
there's nothing like trouble

1474
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:52,117
to bring young folks together.

1475
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,840
That's why Cupid shoots them
with an arrow

1476
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,412
instead of a feather.

1477
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:06,172
You can't do this to me.
It's unconstitutional!

1478
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:08,758
I've got my rights.
I'm an American citizen!

1479
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:11,136
You're not an American citizen
and never were.

1480
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:13,847
Well, we'll see about that.
I'll ca...

1481
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:17,601
So you're behind this.

1482
01:13:17,684 --> 01:13:19,161
- I might have known.
- Look, Mr. Paxton...

1483
01:13:19,185 --> 01:13:20,979
Just tell me one thing,
young lady,

1484
01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:22,290
why do you plague me like this?

1485
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,940
What did I ever do to you?

1486
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:26,902
Life was so simple and easy
before you came along.

1487
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,505
Mr. Elwood told me
you were in trouble.

1488
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,490
I only came down here to see
if I could help you.

1489
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:33,199
- What's this all about, anyway?
- Don't ask me, ask them.

1490
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:35,535
You'll find out
from the deputy commissioner.

1491
01:13:38,204 --> 01:13:39,998
Here he is, sir, David Paxton.

1492
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:42,083
Mr. Commissioner,
by what legal right

1493
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,960
am I being deprived
of my citizenship?

1494
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:47,464
You're not being deprived
of anything, Mr. Paxton.

1495
01:13:47,547 --> 01:13:49,215
By virtue of this treaty,

1496
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:52,218
when your father accepted
ownership of Cocopango Atoll,

1497
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,304
he became a blood brother
of the native king

1498
01:13:54,387 --> 01:13:56,431
and also renounced
his American citizenship.

1499
01:13:56,514 --> 01:13:58,600
Oh, that's ridiculous.
I've always considered

1500
01:13:58,683 --> 01:14:00,393
myself an American
and so did my father.

1501
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:02,187
Legally, you're not.
And I'm afraid we have

1502
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,105
no other course
but to have you deported.

1503
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,942
- Deported? Where to?
- The place of your birth.

1504
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:08,360
Cocopango Atoll.

1505
01:14:08,443 --> 01:14:11,905
Go right ahead.
Try and do it.

1506
01:14:11,988 --> 01:14:15,033
- The navy won't let me in.
- They'll have to let you in.

1507
01:14:15,116 --> 01:14:18,578
Well, I, I don't wanna go.
I refuse to go.

1508
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:20,348
I'll fight this in every court
in the country.

1509
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:22,499
You'll have
the opportunity, Mr. Paxton.

1510
01:14:22,582 --> 01:14:24,417
We'll set a hearing
in the near future.

1511
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,187
And what am I supposed to do
in the meantime?

1512
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:28,380
You'll have to remain
in custody.

1513
01:14:28,463 --> 01:14:30,966
Unless you can get somebody
to post bond for you.

1514
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,526
I'll be glad to do it,
Mr. Commissioner.

1515
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,678
Oh? Are you a property owner?

1516
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:37,180
No, but my father...

1517
01:14:37,263 --> 01:14:38,890
Oh, he isn't either.

1518
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,559
There's Gustav, Gustav Heindel.
He owns a big restaurant.

1519
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,895
- Is he a citizen?
- No, but he will be by tonight.

1520
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:46,272
Well, in that case,
he'll probably be acceptable.

1521
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:49,859
But in the meantime, Mr. Paxton
will have to remain in custody.

1522
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:52,821
David, I'll arrange everything

1523
01:14:52,904 --> 01:14:54,548
and have you out of here
as soon as possible.

1524
01:14:54,572 --> 01:14:56,825
Right now,
I better get back to work.

1525
01:14:56,908 --> 01:14:59,452
Goodbye, Mr. Commissioner.
And don't worry, David.

1526
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:04,624
For your sake, Mr. Paxton,
I hope the young lady

1527
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,835
can fix things up
as easily as she thinks.

1528
01:15:06,918 --> 01:15:09,504
Fix 'em up
or mix 'em up.

1529
01:15:09,587 --> 01:15:12,674
She's just the girl
who can do it.

1530
01:15:12,757 --> 01:15:14,551
I know it's irregular,
commissioner,

1531
01:15:14,634 --> 01:15:16,970
but if you're parole him
to Miss Peppertree for 24 hours,

1532
01:15:17,053 --> 01:15:19,556
I'll assume full responsibility.

1533
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:21,808
He'll have a regular bond
posted by then.

1534
01:15:21,891 --> 01:15:23,768
- Don't forget my message.
- Oh, yes.

1535
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:26,271
Tell Mr. Paxton Miss Peppertree
will meet him at Gustav's

1536
01:15:26,354 --> 01:15:28,231
as soon as she's off duty.

1537
01:15:28,314 --> 01:15:31,901
Ah, very grateful to you,
commissioner. Good day.

1538
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:33,695
Well, it's all arranged.

1539
01:15:33,778 --> 01:15:36,239
Mr. Elwood, you're just about
the nicest person I've ever met.

1540
01:15:36,322 --> 01:15:38,867
If Gustav can't arrange
for a bond until tomorrow

1541
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:41,070
we still wouldn't want
a fine young fellow like Paxton

1542
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:43,204
staying overnight in jail,
would we?

1543
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:46,124
No, we wouldn't. Well, I have
to run now, Mr. Elwood.

1544
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,460
Harkey gave me an hour off
and I've already taken three.

1545
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:54,132
Well, Crombie, the committee
reports progress.

1546
01:15:54,215 --> 01:15:56,593
I'm glad to hear it, sir.
Everything all cleared up?

1547
01:15:56,676 --> 01:15:58,136
Mm. Clearing.

1548
01:15:58,219 --> 01:15:59,572
Then maybe we can go
into some of these matters

1549
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:00,889
for the president.

1550
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:05,143
I'm sorry to barge in
like this, Harvey,

1551
01:16:05,226 --> 01:16:06,954
but I just received a call
from the State Department

1552
01:16:06,978 --> 01:16:09,272
about the deportation
of a David Paxton.

1553
01:16:09,355 --> 01:16:10,666
They told me
you knew something about it.

1554
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:11,691
Why, yes, admiral.

1555
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,443
Do you, by any chance, also know

1556
01:16:13,526 --> 01:16:16,362
that Cocopango Atoll
is now called Carlson Island?

1557
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:19,074
Carlson Island? Well,
we've got a naval base there.

1558
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:21,785
Yes, precisely.
300 million dollars' worth.

1559
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:23,387
And I hope you realize
the significance

1560
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:25,371
of the deportation proceedings
against Paxton.

1561
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:27,040
If we establish him
as a foreigner,

1562
01:16:27,123 --> 01:16:29,375
we establish the island
as foreign soil

1563
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:31,336
and not part
of the United States,

1564
01:16:31,419 --> 01:16:33,463
which means that
the navy is trespassing.

1565
01:16:33,546 --> 01:16:35,048
Great Scott, admiral.

1566
01:16:35,131 --> 01:16:37,967
Paxton never spoke about
anything but studying fish.

1567
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:39,531
He made it sound
small and unimportant

1568
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:41,513
and he certainly
never mentioned Carlson Island.

1569
01:16:41,596 --> 01:16:43,348
That could have been deliberate.

1570
01:16:43,431 --> 01:16:46,142
Harvey, I'm afraid you've been
taken in by a smart operator.

1571
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:48,520
This Paxton has maneuvered
the government into a position

1572
01:16:48,603 --> 01:16:51,856
where we either have to make
terms with him or move.

1573
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,109
We better take this up
with the president.

1574
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:06,788
- White House. Yes, sir.
- Yes, please. Right away.

1575
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:09,374
Yes, please.
Pentagon building right away.

1576
01:17:09,457 --> 01:17:11,292
Secretary of the navy.
Right away, sir.

1577
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:13,086
Justice Peabody? Yes, sir.

1578
01:17:13,169 --> 01:17:14,449
White House. One moment, please.

1579
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:17,257
Attorney general. Yes, sir.

1580
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,341
Right away, sir.

1581
01:17:18,424 --> 01:17:19,801
I have Senator Benning for you.

1582
01:17:19,884 --> 01:17:21,594
I am ringing
the immigration service, sir.

1583
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:23,888
Secretary of defense?
One moment, please.

1584
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:26,432
Secretary of state
is on his way over, sir.

1585
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:28,726
Keep alert, girls,
something big is happening.

1586
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,563
We haven't had this
much activity since VJ Day.

1587
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:44,367
David, I'm sorry I'm late,
but we had a murderous day

1588
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:45,994
on the switchboard.

1589
01:17:46,077 --> 01:17:48,746
David, don't tell me
something went wrong.

1590
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,415
Oh, Gustav,
you didn't refuse him.

1591
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:52,125
He's got to have a citizen.

1592
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:53,501
Who is a citizen?

1593
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,504
Oh, no.

1594
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:59,174
With the whole Supreme Court
coaching me, I didn't pass.

1595
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:01,009
But you knew
everything perfectly.

1596
01:18:01,092 --> 01:18:02,719
Even better than perfectly.

1597
01:18:02,802 --> 01:18:05,471
I remembered every word
what Justice Peabody told me,

1598
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:08,016
what Justice Williams told me,
what Justice Hastings told me,

1599
01:18:08,099 --> 01:18:10,768
what Justice Van Sloan told me.
It was so easy.

1600
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:13,688
And the first question alone,
I talked for 45 minutes.

1601
01:18:13,771 --> 01:18:15,773
So this man said,
"Come to the point."

1602
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:18,151
So I came to the point
another 20 minutes.

1603
01:18:18,234 --> 01:18:19,587
Again he asked me
to come to the point,

1604
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:21,821
so I kept coming to the point.

1605
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:23,948
And the second question,
I didn't even finish

1606
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,366
what Justice Peabody told me.

1607
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:28,203
All of sudden,
the examination was over.

1608
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,163
The man said I should come back
in three months

1609
01:18:30,246 --> 01:18:32,415
with shorter answers.

1610
01:18:32,498 --> 01:18:34,709
And that, Mary, is that.

1611
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:36,461
Oh, we're not licked yet.

1612
01:18:36,544 --> 01:18:39,380
Wait till the justices arrive.
I'll get them to help us.

1613
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:41,424
Mary, they are not coming.

1614
01:18:41,507 --> 01:18:44,052
Right after my examination,
I called off the party

1615
01:18:44,135 --> 01:18:45,553
and reopened for business.

1616
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,237
Justice Peabody promised me
he'd be here.

1617
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:49,307
Him and Justice Van Sloan,
I couldn't reach.

1618
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:51,243
They have an important meeting
with the president.

1619
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:53,937
Yes, I know. I hope he doesn't
keep them there all night.

1620
01:18:55,605 --> 01:18:58,233
Well, Paxton's
in the driver's seat alright.

1621
01:18:58,316 --> 01:18:59,710
We'll have to make
the best deal we can.

1622
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:01,736
I guess this is a matter
for our office, Manning.

1623
01:19:01,819 --> 01:19:03,505
Find Paxton and tell him
we want to see him.

1624
01:19:03,529 --> 01:19:05,865
Hey, just a moment. This is
primarily a naval affair.

1625
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:07,760
Lieutenant, locate this Paxton
and bring him here.

1626
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:09,911
- At once, sir.
- No, you'd both better go.

1627
01:19:09,994 --> 01:19:12,747
You'll find him in Gustav's
with Miss Peppertree.

1628
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:15,458
Now, gentlemen, let's decide

1629
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:18,253
just how we'll handle Mr. Paxton
when he gets here.

1630
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:24,217
Say, Phillip,
what's the big powwow about?

1631
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,843
Mary, in a way.

1632
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:27,821
That Paxton's got her mixed up
in a bad situation.

1633
01:19:27,845 --> 01:19:29,430
We're on our way
to Gustav's now.

1634
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,557
Moran, take over for a while.

1635
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:33,184
Wait, fellas,
I'm going with you.

1636
01:19:35,436 --> 01:19:37,897
The meeting's
gotta break up sometime.

1637
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:39,941
Well, it's a funny thing
about being an American.

1638
01:19:40,024 --> 01:19:41,484
You just take it for granted

1639
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,903
until somebody tries
to take it away from you.

1640
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:45,905
I know, Mr. Paxton.

1641
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:47,448
Well, for two years,
I've been trying

1642
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,993
to get back to Cocopango Atoll.

1643
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:51,303
Now they're trying
to push me there

1644
01:19:51,327 --> 01:19:52,912
and I'm fighting not to go.

1645
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:56,416
David, what happens if you marry
an American citizen?

1646
01:19:56,499 --> 01:19:59,252
Nothing. Not since
the Cable Act of 1922.

1647
01:19:59,335 --> 01:20:00,878
Hm, I suppose that's right.

1648
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:05,883
Wait a second.
Was that a proposal?

1649
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,343
Oh, no. I was just...

1650
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,429
Paxton, you're wanted
at the White House.

1651
01:20:09,512 --> 01:20:10,722
Me? What for?

1652
01:20:10,805 --> 01:20:12,515
Mr. Paxton,
why didn't you tell me

1653
01:20:12,598 --> 01:20:15,476
that Cocopango Atoll and Carlson
Island are the same place?

1654
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,160
- Well, you didn't ask me.
- How could I?

1655
01:20:17,228 --> 01:20:18,706
I didn't know
I was getting involved in a plot

1656
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:20,148
against the United States.

1657
01:20:20,231 --> 01:20:21,375
Phillip, what on earth
are you talking about?

1658
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:23,359
- Ask him.
- Look, Adam.

1659
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:25,611
He doesn't know
what we're talking about.

1660
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:27,506
Your friend here has maneuvered
the government into a spot

1661
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,383
where it has to come to terms
with him in order to keep

1662
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:30,992
one of our most strategic
naval bases.

1663
01:20:31,075 --> 01:20:32,368
David.

1664
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:33,846
Let me get this straight,
lieutenant.

1665
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,597
Is that, is that
what all this fuss is about?

1666
01:20:35,621 --> 01:20:37,957
The government thinks
I'm playing landlord?

1667
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,835
- Well, aren't you?
- Well...

1668
01:20:40,918 --> 01:20:44,255
If you must know, yes.

1669
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:46,799
Yes, Cocopango is my island

1670
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:48,523
and since I'm not a citizen,
that makes it

1671
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:50,136
a foreign sovereign state.

1672
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:52,597
And your navy doesn't belong
there unless I say so.

1673
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,158
- What did I tell you?
- David, you're not serious.

1674
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:55,391
Why not?

1675
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,018
Honey, you and I
could be mighty happy

1676
01:20:57,101 --> 01:20:59,645
with the kinda money
this will bring in.

1677
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:03,399
Why, you... you stinker!

1678
01:21:03,483 --> 01:21:06,986
Oh, now that's no way to feel,
Mary. Business is business.

1679
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:10,490
Paxton, if you as much as talk
to my daughter again, I...

1680
01:21:10,573 --> 01:21:11,967
Get him out of here
before I forget myself.

1681
01:21:11,991 --> 01:21:13,409
Let's go, Paxton.

1682
01:21:13,493 --> 01:21:15,161
Well, I'd like
to oblige you, lieutenant,

1683
01:21:15,244 --> 01:21:17,705
but, uh, I'm in
Miss Peppertree's custody.

1684
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:20,208
I can't go any place
unless she accompanies me.

1685
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:22,211
Tell Benedict Arnold
I wouldn't be seen with him.

1686
01:21:22,251 --> 01:21:25,129
Sorry, boys, I don't budge
without my custodian.

1687
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,673
It, uh, looks like the meeting
will have to come here.

1688
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:29,717
- Of all the presumptuous...
- Forget it, Manning.

1689
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:32,345
I'll phone the White House
and deliver his message.

1690
01:21:32,428 --> 01:21:34,764
- Uh, won't you join me?
- Hmph.

1691
01:21:37,683 --> 01:21:38,976
Sit down, Gustav.

1692
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,479
I don't sit
with Benjamin Arnold.

1693
01:21:41,562 --> 01:21:42,980
Sit down.

1694
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:47,110
You know, Gustav,
I have a hunch

1695
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:50,154
that this next chapter
is going to be very interesting.

1696
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:55,576
In four more years,
I'd eligible for a pension,

1697
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,245
but this is liable
to cost me my job.

1698
01:21:57,328 --> 01:21:58,871
What about me?

1699
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:00,849
I had to be the one
who filed his papers for him,

1700
01:22:00,873 --> 01:22:02,625
in a hurry too.

1701
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:04,502
I'll probably have to resign.

1702
01:22:04,585 --> 01:22:05,920
I'm terribly sorry, Phillip.

1703
01:22:06,003 --> 01:22:08,005
Well, the mountain
is coming to Muhammad.

1704
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:10,049
- They're on their way over.
- It's a fine thing.

1705
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:13,052
A man like that dictating
to half the president's cabinet.

1706
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:15,239
What gets me is I was stupid
enough to tell the admiral

1707
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:16,681
I knew Paxton.

1708
01:22:16,764 --> 01:22:18,850
Oh, Tom, it isn't gonna hurt
your career too?

1709
01:22:18,933 --> 01:22:20,768
Well, there'll probably
be a board of enquiry.

1710
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:23,771
Just knowing the guy will call
for some fancy explaining.

1711
01:22:23,855 --> 01:22:25,481
I was dreamin" of battle wagons.

1712
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:27,859
I'll be lucky if I get a sign
of a garbage scout.

1713
01:22:27,942 --> 01:22:30,903
Well, I can take a bow
for this mess, every bit of it.

1714
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:42,790
Look at him sitting there
so smug and self-satisfied.

1715
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:45,001
Come on, Manning,
here's the brass.

1716
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,340
That's Paxton
over at that table.

1717
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:53,426
Well, we may be unduly alarmed.

1718
01:22:53,509 --> 01:22:55,154
He couldn't be that relaxed
if he really knew

1719
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:56,596
what a spot he's got us in.

1720
01:22:56,679 --> 01:22:58,365
I'm afraid he's gonna
be difficult to handle.

1721
01:22:58,389 --> 01:23:00,349
He says the navy either pays up
or gets out.

1722
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:03,519
Hm, you three feel him out.
We'll wait over there.

1723
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:06,189
Alright. We may as well find out
where we stand.

1724
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:12,320
Paxton, we're here to negotiate
that Carlson Island situation.

1725
01:23:12,403 --> 01:23:13,779
Oh, good.

1726
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:15,907
Just what is it you're after,
Mr. Paxton?

1727
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:18,534
Well, to begin with,
I understand

1728
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:21,496
your navy has several hundred
millions tied up there.

1729
01:23:22,955 --> 01:23:25,041
Oh, there's no cause for alarm,
gentlemen.

1730
01:23:25,124 --> 01:23:27,084
I don't intend
to be unreasonable.

1731
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,295
I realize
there's been a certain amount

1732
01:23:29,378 --> 01:23:31,297
of depreciation
in material equipment

1733
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,090
and I'm quite willing
to allow for it.

1734
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:35,301
I'm open to offers.

1735
01:23:35,384 --> 01:23:37,970
Offers? We're not here
to make offers.

1736
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:40,723
Well, I'm sorry, I understood
you wished to negotiate

1737
01:23:40,806 --> 01:23:42,600
this matter,
not merely discuss it.

1738
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:44,519
Well, why should we buy
what we already own?

1739
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:47,438
- It's our naval base.
- Yes, but it's on my island.

1740
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,607
Please, Mr. Paxton,
this could be war.

1741
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:51,168
Now, gentlemen,
we are approaching

1742
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:52,568
the problem the wrong way.

1743
01:23:52,652 --> 01:23:54,195
Before we can negotiate,
Mr. Paxton,

1744
01:23:54,278 --> 01:23:56,948
we've got to discuss this calmly
and from every angle.

1745
01:23:57,031 --> 01:23:59,116
I'm perfectly willing
to discuss it, Mr. Elwood,

1746
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,286
but, uh, first, I'd like to go
over a few of the angles

1747
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,955
with, uh, Miss Peppertree.

1748
01:24:04,038 --> 01:24:05,390
- Miss Peppertree?
- Now see here, Paxton...

1749
01:24:05,414 --> 01:24:07,917
I don't see any harm
in that, admiral.

1750
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,836
- I'll tell Miss Peppertree.
- Thank you.

1751
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,672
Elwood, what in blazes
has Miss Peppertree

1752
01:24:12,755 --> 01:24:13,756
got to do with this?

1753
01:24:13,839 --> 01:24:15,383
That's a long story.

1754
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:19,345
Paxton's becoming extremely
difficult, gentlemen.

1755
01:24:19,428 --> 01:24:22,390
He insists on discussing
the matter with Miss Peppertree.

1756
01:24:22,473 --> 01:24:24,809
Me? Well,
I don't wanna talk to him.

1757
01:24:24,892 --> 01:24:27,270
- And I don't blame her.
- I know how you feel, Mary.

1758
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:28,993
But at a time like this,
you mustn't allow

1759
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:31,899
your personal feelings to
overshadow your patriotic duty.

1760
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:33,859
But I have nothing
to discuss with him.

1761
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:35,903
He insists he has something
to discuss with you.

1762
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:37,905
Please, Mary,
as a favor to me.

1763
01:24:43,911 --> 01:24:45,329
I don't understand it.

1764
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:47,790
Well, the three of us
couldn't get anywhere.

1765
01:24:47,873 --> 01:24:50,585
Perhaps the situation
requires the feminine touch.

1766
01:24:52,628 --> 01:24:55,131
- You wanna talk to me?
- Oh, yes.

1767
01:24:55,214 --> 01:24:58,968
Yes, I, uh... but this place
is a little too public.

1768
01:24:59,051 --> 01:25:01,053
Uh, where's the kitchen, Gustav?

1769
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:04,849
- The kitchen?
- Oh. This way, please.

1770
01:25:09,061 --> 01:25:12,064
Harvey, this is getting
more and more absurd.

1771
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:14,984
Why does he have to talk to Mary
and why in the kitchen?

1772
01:25:15,067 --> 01:25:16,694
It's obvious
the man is slightly mad.

1773
01:25:16,777 --> 01:25:18,362
Maybe I'd better go in there...

1774
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:20,489
Now, now, gentlemen.
There's no cause for alarm,

1775
01:25:20,573 --> 01:25:22,241
I'm sure.

1776
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:25,911
Mr. Gustav,
Mr. Paxton wants to see you.

1777
01:25:25,995 --> 01:25:29,415
Me? Oh, no, I'm staying here.

1778
01:25:29,498 --> 01:25:31,667
I think you better go, Gustav.

1779
01:25:34,128 --> 01:25:37,506
Well, Harvey, explain that.

1780
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:40,635
No, I'm not even
going to try, senator.

1781
01:25:40,718 --> 01:25:43,346
What do we do, just stand here?
Let's do something about this.

1782
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:44,889
Alright. What do we do?

1783
01:25:44,972 --> 01:25:48,517
Well, uh... I don't know.

1784
01:25:50,811 --> 01:25:53,773
- What's he after, Mary?
- Have you got any...

1785
01:25:53,856 --> 01:25:56,067
Please, everybody,
Mr. Paxton wants to speak

1786
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:57,710
to Justice Peabody
or Justice Van Sloan.

1787
01:25:57,777 --> 01:25:58,903
I'll go.

1788
01:25:58,986 --> 01:26:00,255
Well, I'm anxious
to speak to him.

1789
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:01,757
Why does he want
a Supreme Court justice?

1790
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:03,532
He needs a little legal help.

1791
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:05,510
We wanna be absolutely sure
we've got the correct phrasing

1792
01:26:05,534 --> 01:26:06,970
for the proposition
we're going to submit.

1793
01:26:06,994 --> 01:26:08,621
- We?
- Yes, dad.

1794
01:26:08,704 --> 01:26:10,807
David and I talked it over
and we're in this together.

1795
01:26:10,831 --> 01:26:13,584
- Together? I won't have it.
- He's hypnotized her.

1796
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,461
- That's no excuse.
- Mary, this is shocking!

1797
01:26:16,837 --> 01:26:18,923
Just a minute, gentlemen,
please.

1798
01:26:19,006 --> 01:26:21,217
Mary, you say that you
and Paxton are in this together?

1799
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,540
Yes, and the government will
just have to meet our terms.

1800
01:26:23,594 --> 01:26:25,429
- Mary.
- Well, just what are the terms?

1801
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:28,599
Well, they're working out
the details in the kitchen.

1802
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,851
Oh, you gentlemen
seem a little upset.

1803
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:32,120
Now there's a great deal
involved.

1804
01:26:32,144 --> 01:26:33,205
It's gonna take a little time.

1805
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:36,315
So why don't you just relax?

1806
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:38,109
How 'bout a little
relaxing music, Igor?

1807
01:26:38,192 --> 01:26:40,569
Mary, you're a lifesaver.
This guy's been murdering me.

1808
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:43,906
Seven blitzes in a row.
Let's see, seven blitz, uh...

1809
01:26:43,989 --> 01:26:45,700
I owe you 14 cents. Come on.

1810
01:26:47,993 --> 01:26:50,287
Mary, I don't want to relax.
I want an explanation.

1811
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:51,932
Now look at you, dad.
You're all excited.

1812
01:26:51,956 --> 01:26:53,350
Why don't you go back
to your gloomy, old table

1813
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:55,751
and spread a little sunshine?
Go on.

1814
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:57,962
It's hard enough
to figure out any female mind,

1815
01:26:58,045 --> 01:27:00,923
but when the female is your
own daughter, it's impossible.

1816
01:27:09,098 --> 01:27:11,350
Harvey, if the press
ever finds out about this,

1817
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:12,727
they'll boil us alive.

1818
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:13,936
That's nothing to what those

1819
01:27:14,019 --> 01:27:15,730
Sunday radio commentators
will do.

1820
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:25,281
Gentlemen, I have drafted
for submission to the Senate

1821
01:27:25,364 --> 01:27:28,617
a treaty of annexation between
the United States of America

1822
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:32,705
and Mr. David Paxton, sovereign
ruler of Cocopango Atoll.

1823
01:27:32,788 --> 01:27:35,207
Cession to the United States
will be made

1824
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:37,793
for and in consideration of $1.

1825
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:39,378
One dollar?

1826
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:41,022
Well, as a member
of the Naval Affairs Committee,

1827
01:27:41,046 --> 01:27:43,340
I can promise immediate
ratification by the Senate.

1828
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:47,219
However, gentlemen, however,

1829
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:50,139
there are three conditions
demanded by Mr. Paxton.

1830
01:27:50,222 --> 01:27:54,101
"One: Mr. David Paxton is to be
appointed director of research

1831
01:27:54,185 --> 01:27:56,228
of the Fish and Wildlife
Service.

1832
01:27:56,312 --> 01:27:59,148
Two: Mr. Phillip Manning,
in consideration

1833
01:27:59,231 --> 01:28:00,816
of exceptional legal ability,

1834
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,194
is to be given
a circuit court judgeship

1835
01:28:03,277 --> 01:28:07,156
in a district not less than
1500 miles from Washington, DC.

1836
01:28:08,949 --> 01:28:11,368
Three:
Lieutenant Thomas Farrington

1837
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,662
is to be assigned
to immediate active sea duty

1838
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:18,042
and is to be given his choice
as to the type of naval craft."

1839
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:20,002
Well, gentlemen,
I think you have the authority

1840
01:28:20,085 --> 01:28:21,965
to act on the conditions.
What is your pleasure?

1841
01:28:23,422 --> 01:28:26,425
I, uh, slipped the last
two conditions in on my own.

1842
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,195
If we're gonna live
in this town, I'm putting

1843
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:31,347
plenty of space
between me and competition.

1844
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:34,350
Mr. Paxton, we are certain
that your conditions can be met.

1845
01:28:34,433 --> 01:28:36,153
Lieutenant, you can start
packing your gear.

1846
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,895
Thank you, sir,
and thank you, Paxton.

1847
01:28:37,978 --> 01:28:39,522
Nice maneuvering, Paxton.

1848
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:42,149
- Well, shall we adjourn?
- Wait a minute.

1849
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:43,818
Your Honorship,
tell them about me.

1850
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:46,904
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
One other thing, gentlemen.

1851
01:28:46,987 --> 01:28:48,447
"By the terms of the treaty,

1852
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:50,950
all residents
of Cocopango Atoll

1853
01:28:51,033 --> 01:28:54,119
shall automatically become
citizens of the United States.

1854
01:28:54,203 --> 01:28:58,207
As of ten minutes ago by edict
of the ruler David Paxton,

1855
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:00,668
Mr. Gustav Heindel
was proclaimed

1856
01:29:00,751 --> 01:29:02,461
a resident of Cocopango.

1857
01:29:02,545 --> 01:29:05,214
Therefore, upon annexation,
Mr. Heindel

1858
01:29:05,297 --> 01:29:08,259
as well as Mr. Paxton
becomes an American citizen."

1859
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:17,309
Mary? You should call
the president.

1860
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:18,753
Let him know
everything is alright.

1861
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:20,771
Alright?
Everything is wonderful.

1862
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:22,731
Bertha! Bertha!

1863
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:24,191
Fix hasenpfeffer a la Gustav.

1864
01:29:24,275 --> 01:29:25,943
We're going to have a party
after all.

1865
01:29:26,026 --> 01:29:28,654
Jawohl boss.

1866
01:29:28,737 --> 01:29:31,699
- I'm so happy for you, Gustav.
- From now on, call me Gus.

1867
01:29:31,782 --> 01:29:36,328
Mary, find out if the president
is doing anything tonight.

1868
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:37,663
Hello, Harkey? This is Mary.

1869
01:29:37,746 --> 01:29:39,957
I'd like to speak
to the president.

1870
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,792
Oh, but that's ridiculous.

1871
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,520
I am a citizen,
he's a servant of the people.

1872
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:45,671
I have every right to...

1873
01:29:45,754 --> 01:29:48,549
Oh, hello, Mr. President.
This is Mary Peppertree.

1874
01:29:48,632 --> 01:29:51,343
I wanted you to know
that everything is perfect.

1875
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,430
Just perfect.
