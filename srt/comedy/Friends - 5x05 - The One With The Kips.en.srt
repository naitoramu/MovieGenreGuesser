1
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,485
What time is it?

2
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,446
Nine.

3
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,115
But it's dark out.

4
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,120
That's because you always
sleep till noon, silly.

5
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,748
This is what nine looks like.

6
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,542
I guess I'll get washed up then.

7
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,921
Watch that sunrise.

8
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,300
I'm getting tired of always
sneaking around.

9
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,847
Me too. What if we went away
for the weekend? No interruptions.

10
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,433
We could be naked
the entire time.

11
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:01,103
All weekend?
That's a whole lot of naked.

12
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:05,190
I'll say I have a conference
and you can have a chef thing.

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,401
I wanted to go to this
culinary fair in Jersey!

14
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,822
Okay.
You know you're not, though.

15
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,740
- Let's go.
- Okay. Wait.

16
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,911
What about Joey?

17
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,628
The One with the Kips

18
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,635
I'm going to a culinary fair
in Jersey this weekend.

19
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:20,099
How weird! Chandler just said
he's got a conference there.

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,227
That's funny. Seems like
Chandler's conference could've been...

21
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,731
...in Connecticut or Vermont.

22
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,902
I'm not in charge of where
the conference is held.

23
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:37,658
Do you want people to think it's fake?
It's a real conference.

24
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,411
- Is Rachel here?
- No, she's out shopping.

25
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,623
- Damn!
- What's going on?

26
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,333
I told Emily to come.

27
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:51,922
And I just need to, you know,
talk to Rachel about it.

28
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,632
Wait a minute.

29
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,094
When Emily comes,
you won't see Rachel anymore?

30
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,472
I'm focusing on the
"I get to see my wife" part...

31
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:05,143
...and not on the part
that makes me do this.

32
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,190
So you'll never be
in a room together?

33
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,107
How will that even work?

34
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,151
I have no idea.
I mean...

35
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:18,032
But I assure you,
I will figure it out.

36
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,661
It doesn't seem like it'll work.

37
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,040
Hi, guys.

38
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,041
What's going on?

39
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:32,171
We're flipping Monica's mattress.

40
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:38,802
So I'm thinking, basically,
we pick it up, and then we flip it.

41
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,472
That's better than my way.

42
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,267
Hey guys, would you flip mine too?

43
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,603
Oh, man.

44
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,442
Oh, look! A letter from my mom.

45
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,237
So, Rach?

46
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,656
You know how Emily's coming?

47
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,617
Oh, yeah. I know.

48
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,369
Can you hear anything?

49
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:08,124
Yeah, somebody just said,
"Can you hear anything?"

50
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:15,256
Hey, Joey's ass.

51
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,216
What are you doing?

52
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,760
Remember when they fought
and broke up...

53
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,096
...and we were stuck here
all night with no food?

54
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:27,893
When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,
I figured it'd happen again.

55
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,187
So I hid this in here.

56
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,648
Candy bars, crossword puzzles...

57
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,276
"Mad Libs"! Mine!

58
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,613
Condoms?

59
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,742
You don't know how long
we'll be in here.

60
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,621
We may have to
re-populate the Earth.

61
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,751
And condoms are the way to do that?

62
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,838
Anyway, it all boils down to this.

63
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:02,845
- The last time I talked to Emily...
- Oh, my God! Our dog died!

64
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:07,433
- What?
- Oh, my God! LaPooh, our dog!

65
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:11,353
LaPooh's still alive?

66
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:16,358
It says he was hit by
an ice-cream truck and dragged for...

67
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,278
...nineteen blocks!

68
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,865
- Oh, my God.
- Sweetie, we heard you crying.

69
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,869
- Please don't cry.
- It's LaPooh!

70
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:31,957
I know, it's LaPooh right now
but it'll get better.

71
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,590
I can't believe it! We're here!

72
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,469
Chocolates on the pillows!
I love that!

73
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:48,098
You should live with Joey.
Rolos everywhere.

74
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,477
I'll be right back.

75
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,150
Oh, yes!

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,486
Get in here.
It's a high-speed car chase on!

77
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,447
We're switching rooms.

78
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,617
Oh, dear God!
They gave us glasses!

79
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,244
The glasses have lipstick on them.

80
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,581
Who knows what else
they didn't change?

81
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,625
Sweetie...

82
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,252
...I just want this weekend
to be perfect.

83
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,006
We can change rooms, can't we?

84
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:25,761
Okay, but let's do it now.
Chopper Five just lost its feed!

85
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:33,977
You know how there was something
I wanted to talk to you about?

86
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,939
Oh, yeah.

87
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,986
I'm trying to work
things out with Emily.

88
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,362
Well, there's this...

89
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,075
...one thing.

90
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,704
Here goes.

91
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,374
I made a promise that...

92
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,460
- What?
- Your nose is bleeding.

93
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,669
Oh, God!

94
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,213
You're bleeding.

95
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,589
Not again.

96
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,343
This happened when
my grandfather died.

97
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,135
Sorry.

98
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,512
Gross.

99
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:13,725
Okay. So I'm sorry.
What did you want to tell me?

100
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,277
Sorry. Sorry.

101
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,657
I can't see you anymore.

102
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:33,745
I know, it's ridiculous.
I can't see you, either.

103
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:39,918
- I think you'll like this room more.
- Okay, great.

104
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,174
They say he's only got
half a tank left.

105
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:49,386
Half a tank? Still lots
of high-speed chasing to do!

106
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,764
- We're switching rooms again.
- What? Why?

107
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,310
This has a garden view.
We paid for an ocean view.

108
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,524
Our last ocean-view room
was unacceptable to you.

109
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:07,946
Excuse me. Can I talk to you
over here for just a second?

110
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,371
These clowns want to take us
for a ride. I won't let them.

111
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,583
We're not a couple of suckers.

112
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,502
I hear you, Mugsy.

113
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,463
All these rooms are fine.

114
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,257
Just pick one so I can watch the...

115
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:32,763
Have a perfect, magical
weekend together with you?

116
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,184
- This one I like.
- Nothing.

117
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,144
Nothing. It's over. Damn it!

118
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:43,148
This is regularly scheduled
programming!

119
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,774
Can we turn the TV off?

120
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,028
Do we really want to spend
the weekend like this?

121
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:52,157
Am I getting in the way
of the room-switching fun?

122
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,200
Don't blame me for tonight.

123
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,579
Who should I blame?
The nice bellman?

124
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,206
Or the idiot who thought
he could drive...

125
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,169
...from Albany to Canada
on half a tank of gas?

126
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,214
Do not speak ill of the dead.

127
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:12,427
We're supposed to be spending
a romantic weekend together.

128
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:13,888
What's the matter?

129
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,681
I just want to watch
a little television.

130
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,269
Jeez, relax, Mom.

131
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,313
What did you say?

132
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:28,277
I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."

133
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:44,417
I've been wanting to tell you something
and I just have to get it out.

134
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,754
Okay. What's up?

135
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:55,012
You know how you said to do
whatever it takes to fix my marriage?

136
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:59,266
Yeah, I told you to give Emily
whatever she wants.

137
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:06,064
And while that was good advice,
you should know that what she wants...

138
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,906
...is for me not to see you anymore.

139
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:20,996
That's crazy! You can't do that.
What are you going to tell her?

140
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,711
Oh, my God!

141
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,714
You've already agreed to this.

142
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,467
It's awful, I know.

143
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:37,387
But I have to do this
if I want my marriage to work.

144
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:43,644
And I do. I have to make
this marriage work. I have to.

145
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:52,694
But the good thing is, we can still
see each other until she gets here.

146
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:58,283
Lucky me! Oh, my God!
That is good news, Ross!

147
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:03,414
That's the best news I've heard
since LaPooh died!

148
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,712
You have no idea what a nightmare
this has been. This is so hard.

149
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,214
Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?

150
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,176
- Let me make this easier for you.
- What are you doing?

151
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,637
- Storming out.
- It's your apartment.

152
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,933
Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!

153
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,617
Damn Rolos!

154
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,494
You're back!
How was your conference?

155
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,957
It was terrible. I fought with
my colleagues for the entire time.

156
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,001
Are you kidding with this?

157
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,087
So your weekend was a bust?

158
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:57,133
No, I got to see Donald Trump
waiting for an elevator.

159
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,720
You're back too.

160
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,306
Could I talk to you for a second?

161
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,559
- How was your chef thing?
- It was awful.

162
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,395
Some people don't
appreciate good food.

163
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,356
Maybe the food tasted good at first...

164
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:16,153
...but then made everybody vomit
and have diarrhea.

165
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,162
How much was the room?
I'll pay my half.

166
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,455
Fine. $300.

167
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:27,664
$300?

168
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:31,544
Just think of it as $25 per room.

169
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,632
What are you guys woofing about?

170
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:40,844
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!

171
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,682
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

172
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,019
...I constantly find myself
without 20s, and you...

173
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,606
...always have lots.

174
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,821
You should've seen
the look on her face.

175
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:02,533
I don't want Rachel to hate me.
I don't know what to do.

176
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,035
- You want my advice?
- Yes. Please.

177
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,371
- You won't like it.
- That's okay.

178
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,417
You got married too fast.

179
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:16,422
- That's not advice.
- I told you.

180
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,594
I'm going to the bathroom.

181
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:26,098
If anyone asked me to give up
any of you, I couldn't do it.

182
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,599
Me neither.

183
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,728
Maybe I could do it.

184
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,651
I know you guys heard about
me and Ross.

185
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:42,364
But I've been obsessing about it
and would love not to talk about it.

186
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,659
I don't know if this falls
under that category...

187
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,453
...but Ross is right back there.

188
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,873
- That's not Ross.
- Not that guy.

189
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:54,209
He does look like him, though.

190
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,252
Ross is in the bathroom.

191
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,966
Oh, my God! It's happening.
It's already started. I'm Kip.

192
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,843
Yeah, you're not Kip.

193
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,054
Do you even know who Kip is?

194
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:10,267
Who cares? You're Rachel.

195
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,561
Who's Kip?

196
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,355
My old roommate.
We all hung out together.

197
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,484
Oh, that poor bastard.

198
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,862
You told me the story.
He and Monica dated.

199
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:26,283
When they broke up, you all
promised you'd stay his friend.

200
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,119
And what happened?
He got phased out.

201
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,038
- You won't be phased out.
- Of course, I am.

202
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:36,668
It won't happen to Ross. He's your
brother, your college roommate.

203
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,046
It was just a matter of time.

204
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:43,759
I just assumed Phoebe
would be the one to go.

205
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,761
You live far away,
you're not related.

206
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:50,015
You lift right out.

207
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,524
Hey, Mr. Bing.

208
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:02,486
That hotel you stayed at called.

209
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:07,157
Someone left an eyelash curler
in your room.

210
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,495
Yes, that was mine.

211
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,873
I figured you met
a girl and she left it.

212
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,335
That would have made more sense.

213
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:22,214
I don't even feel like
I know you anymore.

214
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:25,926
All right, I'm just going
to ask you this one time.

215
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,721
Whatever you say,
I'll believe you.

216
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,725
Were you or were you not...

217
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,978
...on a gay cruise?

218
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sorry about the whole
"lifting out" thing.

219
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,419
You got to come with me.

220
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,171
- Where?
- Wherever I go.

221
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:07,343
You and me, we'll start a new group.
We're the best ones.

222
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:14,266
Okay, but try to get Joey too.

223
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:19,063
Pheebs, do you mind if I
speak to Rachel alone?

224
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,024
Sure.

225
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,819
Bye, Ross.

226
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,029
Forever.

227
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:37,540
Why are you here?
Isn't this against the rules?

228
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,376
I talked to Monica.

229
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:45,047
Look, I'm the one
who made the choice.

230
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,008
I'm the one who's making
things change.

231
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:51,678
So I should be the one to,
you know, step back.

232
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,932
No, no, it's okay. Really.

233
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:58,977
Plenty of people just see their
sisters at Thanksgiving...

234
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,939
...their college roommates
at reunions...

235
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:06,610
...and Joey at Burger King.

236
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,783
Is that better?

237
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,996
No, it's not better.

238
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,959
I still don't get to see you.

239
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,215
What would you do?
If you were me, what would you do?

240
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:39,977
First, I'd have said
the right name at my wedding.

241
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:49,069
I can't believe this.

242
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,032
I know.

243
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,828
I am so sorry.

244
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,206
I know that too.

245
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:08,755
Hey, Rach?

246
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:14,970
Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said
you want to talk to me about a trip?

247
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,855
I just came over to drop off...

248
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,941
...nothing.

249
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,988
So that weekend kind of sucked.

250
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,990
Yeah, it did.

251
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,785
So I guess this is over?

252
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:43,957
You know, you and me.
I mean, it had to end sometime.

253
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,668
Why exactly?

254
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,754
Because of the weekend.
We had a fight.

255
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,840
Chandler, that's crazy.

256
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,342
If you always gave up
after a fight...

257
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:58,806
...you'd never be with anyone
longer than...

258
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,397
This isn't over?

259
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:11,151
You are so cute!

260
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,988
No, no. It was a fight.

261
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:20,035
You deal with it and you move on.
It's nothing to freak out about.

262
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,455
Really? Okay, great!

263
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:28,627
Welcome to an adult relationship.

264
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,840
We're in a relationship?

265
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,886
I'm afraid so.

266
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,397
I heard you saw Donald Trump
at your convention.

267
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:52,276
Saw him waiting for an elevator.

268
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,697
Can I use your eyelash curler?
I lost mine.

269
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,908
It's in the bathroom.

270
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,293
Can I talk to you for a second?

271
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,598
Yes.

272
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,100
Yes.

273
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,351
You?

274
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,979
And you?

275
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,648
But you cannot tell anyone.
No one knows.

276
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,984
But how? When?

277
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,113
- It happened in London.
- In London!

278
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:43,035
We didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

279
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:48,499
But it is a big deal!
I have to tell someone!

280
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,582
You can't.

281
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,836
We just don't want to deal with
telling everyone.

282
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:57,090
Please just promise you won't tell.

283
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,886
All right.

284
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,681
Man, this is unbelievable!

285
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,767
I mean, it's great!

286
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,602
But...

287
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,646
I know. It's great!

288
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,400
I don't want to see that!

289
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,446
We're so stupid.

290
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:25,410
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey!

291
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:34,211
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis
is called the overhand Phoebe."

292
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:39,549
"If you win, slap your opponent
on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe'!"

293
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,678
That's cute.
We really all enjoyed it.

294
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,139
- But it doesn't count.
- For what?

295
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:49,894
Just count in our heads
as good Mad Libs.

296
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,562
- I got to go.
- Fun's over.

297
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,940
Wait, if we follow the rules...

298
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,484
...it's still fun
and it means something.

299
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,069
I'm going to take off.

300
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,363
Guys, rules are good!

301
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:05,283
Rules help control the fun.
