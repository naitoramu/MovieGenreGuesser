1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:07,048
- Thanks for the tasty dinner.
- You're welcome for a tasty dinner.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,176
What are you guys looking at?

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,970
Ross and the most beautiful girl
in the world.

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,599
Yeah, come to Papa!

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,440
I know!

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,941
Probably the only time
I'll say this...

7
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,528
...but did you see the ass on her?

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,030
What did you...?
When did you...?

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,159
How did you...?
How did you get a girl like that?

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,663
So what is she, like a spokesmodel?
An aerobics instructor?

11
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,209
Actually, she's a paleontology
doctoral candidate...

12
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,003
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.

13
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:49,049
But that's, like, the easiest era.

14
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:53,553
I've seen her at work,
but I always figured...

15
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,765
But I made her dinner.

16
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:01,978
We had a great time.
And we're going out again tomorrow.

17
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,775
Maybe her friends are betting to see
who gets the biggest geek.

18
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,946
Fine by me.
Hope she wins.

19
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,658
The One with the Dirty Girl

20
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,538
You have any wrapping paper?

21
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,040
Is it for my birthday present?

22
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,585
It was your birthday months ago.

23
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:13,091
You said you ordered something special
and it just hadn't come yet.

24
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,012
I have a call in about that.

25
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,684
It's for Kathy. It's an early copy
of her favorite book.

26
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,478
"The Velveteen Rabbit"!

27
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,397
When the boy's love
makes the rabbit real...

28
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,986
Don't touch it because
your fingers have destructive oils.

29
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:36,699
Then you'd better keep it away
from Ross' hair.

30
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,534
This is pretty rare.
How did you get that?

31
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,371
No big deal.
I just went to some bookstores...

32
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:47,042
...talked to some dealers, called
some of the author's grandchildren.

33
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,877
Honey, that's so sweet.

34
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:54,716
What a great way to say, "I secretly
love you, roommate's girlfriend."

35
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,052
It doesn't say that.

36
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,512
Does it?

37
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:03,016
How will it look when you get her
something incredibly meaningful...

38
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:07,563
...and expensive, and her boyfriend,
Joey, gives her an orange?

39
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,108
I'll make sure Joey gets her
something really great.

40
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,694
It's got to be better than that book.

41
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,072
Like a crossbow!

42
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,700
Once again, I am sorry.

43
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,578
Thank you. Bye.

44
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,623
I had to turn down a job
catering a funeral for 60 people.

45
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,960
Oh, my God!
What happened?

46
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,338
Sixty guests.

47
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,425
Why'd you have to turn it down?

48
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,970
I don't have
the money or equipment...

49
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,640
...to handle something that big
on such short notice.

50
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,477
Wow, what is with all the negativity?

51
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:51,190
You sound like "Moni-can't",
not "Moni-can"!

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,485
Moni-ca.

53
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,904
You've been playing around
with this catering for years.

54
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,741
- Do you want to be a caterer?
- I don't know.

55
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,495
There you go!
That's the spirit!

56
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:08,457
If you need money, I will lend
you money. Just get moving!

57
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:12,169
Really? I'd need $500
for all the food and supplies.

58
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,965
It's worth it if it'll get you moving.
You haven't worked in months!

59
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,217
Neither have you.

60
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,220
Yes, but I'm doing this.

61
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,140
That would be great! Thank you.

62
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,145
Can I borrow your apartment keys?

63
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,898
Why?

64
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,778
You can pee here.

65
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,366
Yes, I can, of course.

66
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:48,247
It's okay.
The duck's using our bathroom anyway.

67
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,209
What are you getting
for her birthday?

68
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,338
We've been dating a couple weeks.
I got to get her something?

69
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:00,175
You have to get her
something really nice.

70
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,594
- I know!
- And not one of your coupons...

71
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:06,182
...for an hour of "Joey Love".

72
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,522
A crossword!
Can I help?

73
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,941
Last week I got all
but three answers...

74
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,860
...and I want to finish one
without any help.

75
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,112
Fine.

76
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:25,617
But you can't help me develop
my new universal language.

77
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,202
How'd it go?

78
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,122
Oh, my God!
It was the best funeral ever!

79
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,250
Everyone loved the food.

80
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,877
I even got another funeral
for tomorrow.

81
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,589
The dead guy from today's best friend.

82
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,468
It's like I am the official caterer
for that accident.

83
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,637
Mon, I'm so happy for you!

84
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,932
Thanks. Check out
my new catering stuff.

85
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,267
Look!
I'm an omelet station!

86
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,145
Omelet? Made to order?

87
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:57,399
I'll have one, please.
Plus my money.

88
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,945
I didn't realize
you needed it right away.

89
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:06,242
You told me to go and be a caterer.
So I went. I be'd.

90
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,368
I used it to buy all this stuff.

91
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:12,873
I got another job tomorrow,
so I'll pay you back then.

92
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:17,002
Okay. Sorry I acted like a bank.

93
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,473
Would you like to come in?

94
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:35,103
Did Homo erectus hunt
with wooden tools?

95
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,481
According to recent findings.

96
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,162
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!

97
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,956
Mitzi is...?

98
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,583
My hamster.

99
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,795
I hope she's okay.
I haven't seen her in a while.

100
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,213
Have a seat.

101
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,341
<i>Where?</i>

102
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,928
Do you...

103
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,434
Do you have any
Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

104
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,521
Well, I do.

105
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,857
Let's go back to my place,
light a couple candles...

106
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:26,405
...break open a box
of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties...

107
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,405
I'd rather not.

108
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,784
Oh, yeah? Why not?

109
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,370
Don't take this the wrong way...

110
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,583
...but your place kind of
has a weird smell.

111
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:48,051
- Is everything in the car?
- Did you settle the bill?

112
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,096
I hate this part.

113
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,306
Look what we almost left!

114
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,476
That's not mine.

115
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,647
Look what we almost took!

116
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,362
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart?

117
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,282
Well, we're all cleaned up.

118
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,411
Good. Thank you.

119
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:21,042
And, well, there's
this small matter of the...

120
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,171
- Dear?
- The matter of...

121
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,423
...payment.

122
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:31,970
Jack used to handle the finances.

123
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,608
You know what we should all do?

124
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,528
Go see a musical.

125
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,991
Sure.

126
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,702
You know which one?

127
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:59,415
The 1996 Tony Award winner.

128
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,875
Do you know the name of that one?

129
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,004
I don't know. "Grease"?

130
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,926
"Rent"?

131
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,679
Yes! "Rent"!

132
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,389
So when do you want to go?

133
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,643
What? I'm sorry.
I can't, I'm busy.

134
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:27,860
Man, it is so hard
to shop for girls.

135
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,902
Yes, it is...

136
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,739
...at Office Max!

137
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,867
What did you get her?

138
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,579
A pen.

139
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:44,251
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock.

140
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,212
- You can't give her that.
- Why not?

141
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,215
She's not 11!

142
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:54,595
And it's not the seventh night
of Chanukah.

143
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,558
What he means by that is,
while this is a very nice gift...

144
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,311
...maybe it's not something
a boyfriend gives.

145
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,854
Sure it is.

146
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,397
She needs a pen for work.

147
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:11,695
She's writing. She turns it over.
"It's time for my date with Joey!"

148
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,992
All right. What did you get
for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?

149
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,035
She didn't have one.

150
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,748
For three years?

151
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,502
Look, it's too late,
and I got an audition.

152
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,339
I can't shop anymore.

153
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,134
I will go out
and try to find something for her.

154
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,594
Thanks, man.

155
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,389
While you're at it,
could you get her a card?

156
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,768
Would you like me to write her
a little poem as well?

157
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:47,981
Or just get a card
that has a poem already in it.

158
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,527
- You have to get our money.
- She couldn't stop crying.

159
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,490
With those thick glasses,
her tears look giant.

160
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,991
I know, it's tough.

161
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,996
You know what the first thing I did
after my mom's funeral was?

162
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,290
Pay the caterer!

163
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,916
I've had a lot of jobs.

164
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,087
And there are some people
who always try to get out of paying.

165
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,965
It's either "That massage
wasn't long enough"...

166
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,384
...or "I don't know
any of those songs"...

167
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:21,223
...or "These sombreros aren't
big enough. Bad little white girl!"

168
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,975
So you think she's faking?

169
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,771
There weren't any tears
till you showed her the bill.

170
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,483
She sounded pretty upset to me.

171
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:41,368
She seems fine now.

172
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,168
So you just left?
Her place was really that bad?

173
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:54,131
You throw your jacket on a chair
at the end of the day.

174
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:59,720
Like that, only instead of a chair,
it's a pile of garbage.

175
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,849
And instead of a jacket,
it's a pile of garbage.

176
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,561
And instead of the end of the day,
it's the end of time...

177
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,648
...and garbage is all
that has survived.

178
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,319
- Here.
- Wow. Thanks.

179
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,029
So what happened?

180
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,531
Nothing.
I had to get out of there.

181
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,158
Next time, you take her
to your place.

182
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,079
I tried that.
She says it has a weird smell.

183
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,125
- What kind of smell?
- I don't know. Soap?

184
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,128
Listen, you like this girl, right?

185
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,754
You want to see her again?

186
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:38,592
So you're going to have
to do it in the mess!

187
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,470
Yeah, okay. You're right.

188
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,725
I mean, who cares about
a little sloppiness?

189
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,728
- It's endearing, really.
- All right!

190
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:54,483
Now you go get that beautiful pig!

191
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,286
I just spent the entire
afternoon looking for a present...

192
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:09,331
...for Kathy that would be
better than the rabbit.

193
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,457
Any luck?

194
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:15,128
Yeah, I found this great place
called "Invisible Things for Kathy".

195
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,299
Can you give me a hand
with all this stuff?

196
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,053
Just return the book,
let Joey give her the clock pen...

197
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,055
...and you get her
something worse than that...

198
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,682
...like a regular pen.

199
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,019
She's really going
to love this, you know?

200
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,856
The bottom line is,
I want her to have it...

201
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,484
...even if I don't get to be
the one who gives it to her.

202
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,695
Honey, that's so sweet.

203
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,198
You don't think it's just pathetic?

204
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,701
Oh, "pathetic"!

205
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,415
I've been looking all over for you.

206
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,499
Where?

207
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,419
Our place. The hall.

208
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,342
I got something.

209
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,266
It's a book.

210
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,185
A book?

211
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,190
Is it a book that's also a safe?

212
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,859
It's a book that's just a book.

213
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,946
It's the "Velveteen Rabbit".
It was her favorite as a kid.

214
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,658
So just let me know
if she likes it, okay?

215
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:26,909
You got it.

216
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,996
Thanks for doing this.
I owe you one.

217
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,919
There wasn't any change
from that twenty, was there?

218
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:41,423
No, it came out to an even twenty.

219
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:46,219
Wow. That's almost
as much as a new book.

220
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:58,983
You didn't get the money?

221
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,111
Maybe I can try at intermission?

222
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,947
You know what?
Let's just go.

223
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,449
We're not leaving till we get paid!

224
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,826
I don't know
who she thinks she is.

225
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,580
Enough is enough!

226
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,415
Hey, widow?

227
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,834
Widow?

228
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:20,170
Excuse me? Excuse me!

229
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:25,176
Thanks. Clearly this is
a very, very hard time for you.

230
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,637
But we provided a service,
and we deserve to be paid...

231
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,764
...because you ate that service.

232
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,268
We are not leaving here until
we are paid every penny, because...

233
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,858
...we're part-time caterers
and we have no place else to go.

234
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,736
All right. I'll get my bag.

235
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,489
Good.

236
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,832
I'm going to leave some cards here.

237
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:02,087
Please think of us
for your next event.

238
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:09,178
You want to come inside?

239
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,181
Yes.

240
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:16,226
Yes, I do.

241
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:28,697
I'll be right back.
Make yourself comfortable.

242
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,431
Guess who?

243
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,185
Department of Sanitation?

244
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,063
It's me.

245
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,327
What?

246
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,705
Oh, Cheryl!

247
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,229
It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!

248
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,355
Oh, my God!

249
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:46,149
I'm so sorry.
I must have freaked out.

250
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,819
Thank God it's not Mitzi!

251
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,364
It's just a rat.

252
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,285
I did it!

253
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,580
I finished it!
I did it all by myself!

254
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,750
And there's nobody to hug.

255
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,503
Move!

256
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,092
Hey, you guys!

257
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:16,012
I finished it all by myself!
Hug me.

258
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,058
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

259
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,434
How did it go?

260
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:24,688
The widow wouldn't pay,
so Phoebe yelled at her till she did.

261
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,650
I'm a hard-ass.

262
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,362
And I'm a wuss.
We should be partners.

263
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:36,909
Hard-ass and wuss.
We could fight crime.

264
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,369
Wait a minute, Phoebe.

265
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,455
We should be partners.

266
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,582
We should be catering partners.

267
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:48,587
You're not working now,
and we have a great time together.

268
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,048
I cook and you take care
of the money.

269
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:55,552
It'll be like
I have a wife in the '50s!

270
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,517
How did she like the gift?

271
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,645
She loved it.
She's showing the girls right now.

272
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,105
Yeah? That's great.

273
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,606
I got to tell you...

274
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,734
...I feel bad taking credit
for this, because...

275
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:15,572
...am I going to get
a lot of credit for this!

276
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:21,953
Happy birthday.

277
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,497
Thank you.

278
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,376
You know, Chandler got you
a gift too.

279
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,504
No, he didn't.

280
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:35,759
Yeah, he did. Look,
it's right there on the counter.

281
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,350
Happy birthday.

282
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,436
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,691
You really didn't have to.

284
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:58,240
You think it's just a pen, but you
turn it over and it's also a clock.

285
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,159
No, this is great!

286
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,370
Thank you, Chandler.

287
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,875
Want to go to bed?

288
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,837
I'll be in, in a minute.

289
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,552
Don't forget your coupon.

290
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,851
Good night.

291
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,855
Thank you for the gift.

292
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,484
I just knew that
sometimes when you're writing...

293
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,279
...you don't always
know the exact time.

294
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:42,409
No, I didn't mean the pen.
Thank you for the book.

295
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,743
The book?

296
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,537
"The Velveteen Rabbit"?

297
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,665
I have a feeling you had
something to do with it.

298
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,376
What do you mean?

299
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,670
When Joey gave it to me he said:

300
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:59,009
"This is because I know you like
rabbits, and I know you like cheese."

301
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,054
Thanks. I love it.

302
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:06,266
I know how hard
it must have been for you to find.

303
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:11,063
In case you missed that,
that sound was, "Oh, well."

304
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:14,608
You must really like Joey
to go to all that trouble.

305
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,861
Oh, yeah. He's my...

306
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:25,077
He's my best friend.

307
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,289
Good night.

308
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:41,843
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

309
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:54,648
You don't know me.
I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.

310
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:58,110
You know, it's too bad
that didn't work out.

311
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,696
Anyway, he told me
about your apartment.

312
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:05,409
Well, I couldn't sleep
thinking about it.

313
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:10,664
So would it be okay
if I cleaned it?
