1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,053
Monica, that was the best
Thanksgiving dinner ever.

2
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:15,432
It was so good.
I think you killed us.

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,059
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,563
I need something sweet.

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,941
Does anyone want to watch TV?

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,404
Monica, your remote doesn't work.

7
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,784
You have to lift it and point.

8
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,330
Oh, forget it.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:44,252
Let's play that game where everyone
says one thing they're thankful for.

10
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:48,257
I am thankful for this
beautiful fall we've been having.

11
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,259
Very nice.

12
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,469
The other day,
I was at the bus stop...

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,808
...and this lovely fall breeze came
and blew this chick's skirt up.

14
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:04,606
Which reminds me,
I'm also thankful for thongs.

15
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:08,027
The One with the
Thanksgiving Flashbacks

16
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,785
It's not so much an underpant
as a feat of engineering.

17
00:01:59,036 --> 00:01:59,912
It's amazing...

18
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,332
...how much they can do
with so little material.

19
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:08,587
And they play with your mind.
Is it there? Is it not there?

20
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,215
Are you aware that
you're still talking?

21
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,428
Is anyone thankful for anything else
besides a thong?

22
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,849
I don't know. Am I more thankful
for my divorce, or my eviction?

23
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,854
And I didn't think you'd be able
to come up with anything.

24
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,733
I'm sorry. This is
the worst Thanksgiving ever.

25
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,110
I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.

26
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:36,699
You can't swoop in with your bad
marriage and take that away from me.

27
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:42,246
You're not going to tell about your
parents' divorce again, are you?

28
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,167
Come on! I want to hear it.

29
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:50,963
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without Chandler bumming us out.

30
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,090
It's a tradition, like the parade.

31
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,304
If the parade decided it was gay
and abandoned its family.

32
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,141
Now, Chandler, dear...

33
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,518
Just because
we're getting a divorce...

34
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,895
...doesn't mean we don't love you.

35
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,188
It just means...

36
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:13,485
...he would rather sleep
with the houseboy than with me.

37
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,491
More turkey, Mr. Chandler?

38
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:25,330
You're right, yours is worse.
You're the king of bad Thanksgivings.

39
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,708
I've got one that's worse.

40
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,880
Really? Worse than,
"More turkey, Mr. Chandler?"

41
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,925
The little rich boy
had a problem with the butler?

42
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,553
Yes, mine's worse!

43
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,017
More bandages!

44
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,186
More bandages!

45
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,105
Please, can I get
some more bandages in here?

46
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,733
This man is...

47
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,327
In this life, Phoebe.

48
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,913
This life?

49
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,999
Chandler's is worse.

50
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,794
It must be cool
remembering stuff like that.

51
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,880
I don't have any past life memories.

52
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,801
Of course, you don't, sweetie.
You're brand-new.

53
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,679
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.

54
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,516
Let's not tell this story.

55
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,767
I know!

56
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:32,397
It's the one where Joey got
Monica's turkey stuck on his head.

57
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,984
Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?

58
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,528
It's not like it sounds.

59
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,365
It's exactly like it sounds.

60
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,467
What's going on?

61
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,345
Oh, my God!

62
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,013
I know!

63
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,392
It's stuck!

64
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,393
Step.

65
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,145
How did it get on?

66
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,106
I put it on to scare Chandler.

67
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,734
Oh, my God! Monica's going to
totally freak out!

68
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,361
Help me get it off!

69
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,739
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

70
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,704
Of course it smells bad.
You have your head up a dead animal.

71
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,089
Did you get the turkey...?

72
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,132
Oh, my God!

73
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,634
Who is that?

74
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:45,471
It's Joey.

75
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,932
Is this supposed to be funny?

76
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:52,395
It's not supposed to be funny.
It's supposed to be scary.

77
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,728
Get that off now!

78
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,939
I can't. It's stuck!

79
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,278
It has to feed 20 people. They're
not going to eat it off your head!

80
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,320
Hold on.

81
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,200
Let's just all think.

82
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,372
I got it!

83
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:13,415
You pull.

84
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:18,253
I'll spread the legs
as wide as I can.

85
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,591
Now is not the time.

86
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,593
Count to three. One...

87
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,719
...two...

88
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,680
...three!

89
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:35,145
It worked!
I scared you! I knew it!

90
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,272
I'm here, big guy.

91
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,608
There you are!

92
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,903
I scared you!

93
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:48,159
You did look like an idiot.

94
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,494
I wasn't the only one
who looked like an idiot.

95
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,539
Remember when Ross tried to say
"butternut squash"...

96
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,503
...and it came out,
"squatternut bosh"?

97
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,716
Yeah, that's the same.

98
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,136
That's it.
That's my worst Thanksgiving.

99
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,430
That can't be the one Rachel meant.

100
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,016
She didn't even know that happened.

101
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,059
So what's yours?

102
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,770
I really don't want
to tell this story.

103
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:23,318
Reliving pain and getting depressed
is what Thanksgiving's all about.

104
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,528
For me, anyway.

105
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,614
And, of course, the Indians.

106
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,659
Of all people, you do not want me
to tell this story.

107
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,161
What is that supposed to mean?

108
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,748
Monica, I think Rachel's here!

109
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,959
I'll get it!

110
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,591
Happy Thanksgiving!

111
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,343
Not for me.

112
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,179
Chip and I broke up.

113
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,513
Why?

114
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:52,973
What happened?

115
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,727
My parents are out of town,
and Chip was going to come over.

116
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,104
And you were going to give him...

117
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,565
...your "flower".

118
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,692
Monica, can you just call it sex?

119
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,987
It really creeps me out
when you call it that.

120
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,405
And by the way...

121
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:14,077
...while we're at it, a guy's thing
is not called his "tenderness".

122
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,791
Believe me.

123
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,296
Happy Thanksgiving.

124
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,303
Everyone...

125
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,555
...this is Chandler.

126
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,806
My roommate...

127
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:39,228
...and lead singer of our band.

128
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,440
This is Monica.

129
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,985
I'm Ross' little sister.

130
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,907
I'm so glad you could come.

131
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,409
We've got plenty of food,
so I hope you're hungry.

132
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,790
Chandler hates Thanksgiving
and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.

133
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,044
I'm so glad you brought him here.

134
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,131
I can make you some
macaroni and cheese for dinner.

135
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,802
As long as the Pilgrims
didn't eat it.

136
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,390
Damn it!

137
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,069
Does it feel weird around here now?

138
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,406
You know, since
I've been away at college?

139
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,701
Not really.

140
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,079
That's cool.

141
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,548
I cannot believe Chip dumped me
for that slut, Nancy Branson!

142
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:54,011
I am never going out with him again.
I don't care how much he begs.

143
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:58,849
His begging days are over, now
that he's with Nancy Branson.

144
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,102
I've just had it
with high school boys.

145
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,770
They're just silly.

146
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,233
They're just silly, stupid boys.

147
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,402
I'll start dating men.

148
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,321
I'm sorry, Judy.

149
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:17,743
I couldn't find that bowl
you and Jack were looking for.

150
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:22,623
Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.

151
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,637
Did you like
the macaroni and cheese?

152
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:40,432
It was great.
You should be a chef.

153
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,355
Guess what?

154
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,733
All this stuff about Nancy
being a slut was all a rumor.

155
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,278
Chip dumped her, and he wants
to come over to my house!

156
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,740
- That is so great!
- I know.

157
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,493
Oh, gosh. Listen,
if you and Chip do it tonight...

158
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,787
...promise me
you'll tell me everything?

159
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,832
Totally. It's not that big a deal.
We already kind of did it once.

160
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,336
But now you'll definitely know
whether or not you did it.

161
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,004
I know.

162
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:17,553
And Chip promised that this time
it'd last at least for an entire song.

163
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,805
I'm thinking of asking
Rachel out tonight.

164
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,684
Maybe playing her that song
we wrote last week.

165
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,729
"Emotional Knapsack"?
Right on!

166
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:32,151
But don't take long.
We're testing our fake I.D. S tonight.

167
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,779
Right, Clifford Alvarez?

168
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:39,491
Listen, Roland Cheng...

169
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:43,203
...if things go well,
I may be out with her all night.

170
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,163
Dude, don't do that to me.

171
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,833
It's cool, you can stay here.
My parents won't mind.

172
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:53,589
It's not that. I just don't want
to be stuck here with your fat sister.

173
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,093
Why don't you finish off these pies?

174
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:02,138
I don't have any more room
in the fridge.

175
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,643
No, thank you.

176
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,145
Judy, you did it.

177
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,815
She's finally full!

178
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,694
I called you fat?

179
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,488
- I don't even remember that.
- Well, I do.

180
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,532
I'm so sorry. I really am.

181
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,117
I was an idiot back then.

182
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,705
I rushed the stage at a Wham concert,
for crying out loud!

183
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,291
I can't believe you called her fat.

184
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:34,046
I can't believe you let
George Michael slap you.

185
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,505
I am really sorry.

186
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,926
That is terrible. I'm so sorry.

187
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,887
That's not the Thanksgiving
I was talking about.

188
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,013
Yes, it was.

189
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,806
No, it was actually...

190
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:49,770
Thanksgiving's over.
Let's get ready for Christmas.

191
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,773
I have the cutest Christmas story.

192
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,816
We want to hear Monica's story.

193
00:12:55,067 --> 00:13:00,739
Mine had a dwarf that got broke in half.
But, whatever.

194
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,534
You changed your major again?

195
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:05,577
I had to.

196
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:10,540
There was never any parking
by the psychology building.

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,753
Love your new nose!

198
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,130
Dr. Wolfson's an artist.

199
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,757
He removed my mole cluster.

200
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,801
Want to see?

201
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,930
No! Please, let me.

202
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,190
Happy Thanksgiving.

203
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,233
Your hair sure is different.

204
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,194
We were just talking about that.

205
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,490
We can't believe
how stupid we used to look.

206
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:46,952
Where's Monica?

207
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,787
She's upstairs.

208
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,747
Come down, everyone's here!

209
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:51,999
Ross, Rachel...

210
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:56,420
...and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.

211
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,300
Oh, my God!

212
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,094
What's the matter?

213
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:08,306
Is there something on my dress?

214
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,434
You look so different.

215
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,518
Terrific.

216
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,353
That dress, that body...

217
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,398
- Dude!
- Sorry.

218
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,776
Yes, she's thin. It's wonderful.

219
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,569
But we really want to hear...

220
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,573
...about Ross' new girlfriend.

221
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,117
Her name is Carol.

222
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,327
She's really pretty and smart.

223
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,581
She's on the lacrosse team
and the golf team.

224
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,333
Can you believe it?

225
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,253
She plays for both teams.

226
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,550
So I guess I'll see you at dinner.

227
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,511
- Dude!
- Sorry.

228
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,097
Oh, my God!

229
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,932
That was so awesome.

230
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:52,184
You got him back
for calling you fat.

231
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,144
He was drooling all over you.

232
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:58,523
- That must have felt so great.
- It didn't.

233
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,984
Yeah, I mean, I look great.

234
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:06,240
I feel great, and my heart's
not in trouble anymore.

235
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,034
I just don't feel
like I got him back.

236
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,244
I just want to humiliate him.

237
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:17,209
I want him to be naked, and
I want to point at him and laugh.

238
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:21,172
That, we may be able to do.

239
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,380
How?

240
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:26,426
Guys tend to get naked
before they're going to have sex.

241
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:27,469
What?

242
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,180
I didn't work this hard
and lose weight...

243
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,059
...just so I could give my flower
to someone like him.

244
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,854
If you keep calling it that,
no one will take it.

245
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:38,939
And then...

246
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,650
...you're not going
to have sex with him.

247
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,737
You'll just make him
think that you are.

248
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,409
I'll throw him out
in the yard, lock the door...

249
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,745
...and all our neighbors
will just humiliate him!

250
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,956
You'll definitely get him back.

251
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,542
How do I make him think
I want to have sex?

252
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,460
Here's what you do.

253
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:06,300
Just act like everything around you
turns you on.

254
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:08,969
What do you mean?

255
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,180
Anything can be sexy.

256
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,893
Like this dish towel.

257
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,315
This feels so good against my cheek.

258
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:26,028
And if I get a little hot,
I can just dab myself with it.

259
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,740
Or I can bring it down to my side
and run it through my fingers...

260
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,742
...while I talk to him.

261
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:32,951
I can do that.

262
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:34,453
Good, good, good.

263
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,164
Get busy. He's coming.

264
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,334
Hey, what's up?

265
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:46,423
Could you make me some of that
righteous mac and cheese like last year?

266
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,050
I'd love to.

267
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,893
I love macaroni and cheese.

268
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,400
I love the way this box feels
against my cheek.

269
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:13,784
And I love carrots.

270
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,583
Sometimes I like to put them
between my fingers.

271
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,501
Like this.

272
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:26,838
And hold them down here
while I talk to you.

273
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,637
And, you know, if I get really hot...

274
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:38,350
...I like to pick up this knife.

275
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:42,229
And I put the cool steel...

276
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,690
...against...

277
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,110
...my body.

278
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,279
Are you all right?

279
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,698
I'm fine.

280
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,048
Twenty-year-old male.

281
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:13,302
He's got a severed toe
on his right foot.

282
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,471
Could you please not
do that feet first?

283
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:21,644
You know where his injury is.
Severed toe, you just said it!

284
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,063
It says the knife went
through your shoe.

285
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:27,191
They're made of wicker!

286
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:28,901
Did you bring the toe?

287
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,904
I have it right here on ice.

288
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,574
Don't worry, son.
We'll just reattach it and then...

289
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,867
What is it?

290
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,078
You brought a carrot.

291
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:45,750
This isn't your toe. This is a small,
very cold piece of carrot.

292
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,003
You brought a carrot?

293
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,880
Oh, my God!

294
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,759
There's a toe in my kitchen.

295
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,928
I'm sorry! I'll go get it!

296
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,097
All we can do now
is sew up the wound.

297
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,599
Without my toe? I need my toe!

298
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:04,144
I can go really fast!
Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.

299
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:08,189
I'm not falling for that one.

300
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:12,736
That's why I lost my toe?
Because I called you fat?

301
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,906
I didn't mean to cut it off.
It was an accident.

302
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:20,661
That's why for an entire year
people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?

303
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,288
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:24,915
It wasn't your whole toe.

305
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,167
Yeah, well, I miss the tip.

306
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,170
It's the best part.

307
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,964
It has the nail.

308
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,137
Sir Limps-a-lot.

309
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:41,765
I came up with that.

310
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,936
You're a dork.

311
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:49,106
- I can't believe this.
- I said I was sorry.

312
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:54,027
"Sorry" doesn't bring back the piggy
that cried all the way home.

313
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,906
I hate this stupid day
and everything about it!

314
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:58,990
I'll see you later.

315
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,159
Wait.

316
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,744
Come here.

317
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:05,247
Is there anything I can do?
Anything?

318
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:10,002
Just leave me alone for a little while.

319
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,508
I'm a duck.
I go quack-quack.

320
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:20,345
I'm happy all the time.

321
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,147
Nice try.

322
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,526
Wait, wait, wait.

323
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,947
Look, Monica...

324
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,327
This is not going to work.

325
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,830
I bet this will work.

326
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:54,588
You're so great.

327
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,883
I love you.

328
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:13,065
Nothing. I said you're so great,
and then I just stopped talking.

329
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,443
You said you loved me.
I can't believe this!

330
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,320
No, I didn't!

331
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:19,613
Yes, you did!

332
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,698
No, I didn't!

333
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,451
You love me!

334
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,701
No, I don't!

335
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:28,205
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

336
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,884
Gauze!

337
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:41,926
Gauze!

338
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,346
I need to get some gauze in here!

339
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:49,601
Can I please get some more gauze?

340
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,572
This is getting ridiculous.
