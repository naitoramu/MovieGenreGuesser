1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,810
'Cause every time I see your face

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,820
I can 't help but fall from grace

3
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,500
This girl's good.

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,330
Yeah, a song with rhyming words!
I never thought of that before.

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,540
I like her.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,820
Why? Because she can both sing
and play guitar at the same time?

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,460
That's all I'm looking for
from these people.

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,140
Look at you, all jealous.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,460
Come on, Pheebs. You two have
completely different styles.

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,220
She's more. . . .
You know?

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,300
And you're more. . . .

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,100
Say you'll stay beside me

13
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,940
See? Everybody else is
happy she's done.

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,260
Okay, my next song's called:

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,420
"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?
I Loved When We Were. . .

16
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,820
. . .Singing Partners and I Shouldn't
Have Left You That Way. "

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,580
One of those "Iook for
the hidden meaning" songs.

18
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,300
The One With Phoebe's Ex-Partner

19
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,490
Czech Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

20
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,020
Hey, Phoebe.

21
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,260
Hey, Leslie.

22
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,100
How'd you know I'd be here?

23
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,060
I saw vlad at the place
where they sell the big fish.

24
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,940
He said you played here a lot, so. . . .

25
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,740
I have to go to the bathroom.

26
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,860
If "big-fish place"
comes up again. . .

27
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,020
. . .I'd like to know if that's several
big fish or just one big fish.

28
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,060
So Phoebe says you write jingles.

29
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,980
Actually, I said she abandoned me
to write jingles.

30
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,540
Anything we might've heard of?

31
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,820
Home is never far away

32
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,020
Home is Homestar Stew.

33
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,060
But I don't do that anymore.
I got kind of sick of it.

34
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,620
And then I couldn't come up with
anything good, so they fired me.

35
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,850
Bummer.

36
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,860
Well, you know, I was just. . . .

37
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,340
I was just thinking
and just hoping that. . .

38
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,500
. . .maybe you'd want
to get back together?

39
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,460
No, but, thanks.

40
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,940
Come on, Phoebe.
Would you just think about it?

41
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,020
No, but, thanks.

42
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,220
See you, Pheebs.

43
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,420
That was kind of brutal.

44
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,220
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

45
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,660
Once you betray me,
I become like the lce Woman.

46
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,620
I'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.

47
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,140
You know, nothing can
penetrate this icy exterior.

48
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,620
Can I have a tissue?

49
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,820
Is someone in there?

50
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,060
I'm playing a daredevil game. . .

51
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,580
. . .called "Wait Until the Last Moment
Before I Burst and Die. "

52
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,460
Jeez, man! Did you fall--?

53
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,620
Hi!

54
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,540
So did you?
Did you fall high?

55
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,620
Someone was in the ladies' room.
I couldn't wait.

56
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,900
I left the lid up for you, though.

57
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,060
You know what, Gunther?
Go ahead.

58
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,220
I'm talking to. . . .

59
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,820
This is where you say your name.

60
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,860
Ginger.

61
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,370
Ginger.
I'm talking to Ginger, so. . .

62
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,820
Don't you have to use the bathroom?

63
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,780
No, I just--
I'd rather talk to you.

64
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,660
Yes, I do.

65
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,980
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.

66
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,620
There's someone in here.

67
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,180
-Where's Chandler?
-He can't make it.

68
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,950
He said he had to go back
to his job and--

69
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,620
Joey?

70
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,810
Joey Tribbiani?

71
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,420
I can see you, okay?

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,620
You're hiding behind the coats.

73
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,420
Close one.

74
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,820
Hi.

75
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,420
Hi, sweetie.

76
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,420
Hello.

77
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,220
Hey, Ross.

78
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,380
-I've got some bad news.
-What?

79
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,820
I can eat,
but I have to come back here.

80
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,020
Come on. You've worked late
every night for two weeks.

81
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,860
-What is it now?
-It's my fault. I quit today.

82
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,940
But work comes first!

83
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,340
But that's sad about you, though.
What happened?

84
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,940
What happened? Burn out?
Burn all out, did you?

85
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,860
He's leaving for a better job.

86
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,020
That's great.
So I guess this is goodbye then.

87
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,250
Goodbye.

88
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,650
Okay, then.

89
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,620
Well, we're gonna
miss you around here.

90
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,020
Yeah, me too.

91
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,620
-So see you on Saturday.
-Yeah, you bet!

92
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,740
Now, you know those
are a delicacy in lndia.

93
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,620
That was Leslie calling
to see if we can get back together.

94
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,820
It's like the 20th time today.
Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

95
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,540
She must've hurt you bad.

96
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,460
Well, yeah.
You know, we were best friends. . .

97
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,220
. . .ever since we were little.
Our moms worked on the barge together.

98
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,980
You two must've been so cute,
running around on a barge.

99
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,220
You never run on a barge!

100
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,060
Is Chandler around?

101
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,540
He met some girl at the coffeehouse.

102
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,250
Ginger something.

103
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,260
Sure it wasn't something that sounded
liked Ginger? Like "Gingeer"?

104
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,010
No, it was Ginger.

105
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,260
I remember because
when he told me, I said:

106
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,620
The movie star

107
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,500
Oh, man!

108
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,740
That's the girl I was hiding from.

109
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,500
When she sees he's my roommate,
she'll tell him what I did.

110
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,620
What did you do?

111
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,940
Oh, no! I can't. . . .

112
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,220
I can't tell you. It's the
most awful thing I've ever done.

113
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,540
Don't tell us.

114
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,220
We'll wait till Chandler gets home.
It'll be more fun that way.

115
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,670
It was, like, four years ago.

116
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,780
Ginger and I had gone out a few times.
Then one weekend. . .

117
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,420
. . .we went to her Dad's cabin. . .

118
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,420
. . .just me, her and her
annoying little dog, Pepper.

119
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,540
That night I cooked
this really romantic dinner--

120
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,620
You gave her food poisoning!

121
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,020
I wish.

122
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,930
After dinner, me, her and Pepper
fell asleep in front of the fire.

123
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,460
I woke up in the middle of the night
and saw the fire was dying out. . .

124
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,140
. . .so I picked up a log
and threw it on.

125
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,820
Or what I thought was a log.

126
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,500
Oh, my God!
You threw Pepper on the fire!

127
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,410
I wish.

128
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,180
Another thing I probably
should've told you about Ginger. . .

129
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,580
. . .is that she kind of has a. . .

130
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,340
. . .artificial leg.

131
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,620
Oh, my God!

132
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,420
What did you do after
you threw her leg on the fire?

133
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,260
I ran!

134
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,220
That's the best kiss I've had. . .

135
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,810
. . .with anybody I met
in a men's room.

136
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,940
Actually, me too.

137
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,940
Foot all in the puddle!

138
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,940
Damn! I hate that!

139
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,060
-You'll have to get out of those shoes.
-Don't worry.

140
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,100
No, really.
You're gonna freeze.

141
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,580
No, I'm not.

142
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,620
You're not?
Have you got a bionic foot?

143
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,460
Someday. Maybe.

144
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,060
Funny book?

145
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,220
I'm just thinking about
something funny I heard today.

146
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,420
Mark saying,
"I'll see you Saturday. "

147
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,730
Yeah, at the lecture.

148
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,740
I told you last week.
You said you didn't mind.

149
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,700
It's not the lecture I mind.

150
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,820
Please tell me it's not because
I'm going with Mark.

151
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,220
-Well--
-Oh, my God!

152
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,340
I'm sorry, but if you're not
working with him anymore. . .

153
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,420
. . .why do you still hang out?

154
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,260
Because he's my friend.

155
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,860
But do you really need
another "friend"?

156
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,820
If I stop playing with Joey
and Chandler, can I play with Mark?

157
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,900
Is that funny?
Am I suppose to be laughing?

158
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,620
I don't know. You thought
"See you Saturday" was funny.

159
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,450
Mark is in fashion.

160
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,620
I like having a friend
I can share this stuff with.

161
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,820
You guys would never
go to a lecture with me.

162
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,540
I'd love to go with you.

163
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,540
Really?

164
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,620
I have clothes.

165
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,260
I even pick them out.

166
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,820
For all you know,
I could be a fashion. . .

167
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,540
: : :monger:

168
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,220
I would love for you to go with me.

169
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,660
What?

170
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,810
What should I wear?
Now I'm all nervous.

171
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,660
You know, they say
"A watched pot never beeps. "

172
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,420
It's been a couple hours. . .

173
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,820
. . .and she hasn't called.

174
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,620
Not that I even care. I don't.

175
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,260
Why don't you just call her?

176
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,420
You obviously want to.

177
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,620
You think you know me so well.

178
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,460
Well, don't you wanna?

179
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,340
So I do know you.

180
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,020
That's what I said.

181
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,020
Well, so?

182
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,620
I can't.

183
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,220
I can't. She dumped me.

184
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,820
I totally trusted her,
then one day it was like:

185
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,980
"Okay, bye, Pheebs. "
Gone!

186
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,660
You know what the saddest part is?

187
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,210
When we were playing together,
that was. . .

188
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,420
. . .the most fun I've ever had
in all my lives.

189
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:59,020
My favorite shoes, so good to me
I wear them every day

190
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:04,020
Down at the heel, holes in the toes
Don 't care what people say

191
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,940
My feet's best friend
Pals to the end

192
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,650
With them, I'm one hot chickie

193
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,180
Though late one night
Not much light

194
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,820
I stepped in something icky

195
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,140
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes

196
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,820
Always make me smile

197
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:29,860
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes
Next time I'll...

198
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,540
...avoid the...

199
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,420
...pile!

200
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,260
We're beginning to see a lot of
layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

201
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,620
For instance, a sheer navy blouse
over a pink. . . .

202
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,210
I'm really glad we came.

203
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,980
You're so pretty.

204
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,620
I love you.

205
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,860
Smelly cat, smelly cat

206
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,740
What are they feeding you?

207
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,100
Smelly cat, smelly cat

208
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,910
It's not your fault

209
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,260
That's great!

210
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,220
You know, you could totally sell this.

211
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,210
It'd be perfect for, like,
a kitty-litter campaign.

212
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,820
A jingle?

213
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,940
Why not?
You'd make a ton of money.

214
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,460
If I was in this for the money,
I'd be a millionaire by now.

215
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,420
You gotta get out of
that jingle-head.

216
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,060
You're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

217
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,060
That's okay.

218
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,420
I'm gonna play a song now
that's really, really sad.

219
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,420
It's called "Magician Box Mix-Up. "

220
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,060
Oversized bracelets,
oversized earrings. . .

221
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,180
. . .oversizing of accessories,
in general, is very popular now.

222
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,420
Can I borrow this?
My milk's gone bad.

223
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,620
I hate that.

224
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,980
I once had a thing of half-and-half.
Stole my car.

225
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,700
So how was your date with Ginger?

226
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,820
Great.

227
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,940
It was great. She's. . . .

228
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,980
She's great. Great looks
and personality. Greatness.

229
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,020
Sounds like she's got the. . .

230
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,860
. . .whole package.

231
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,420
Joey told you about the leg, huh?

232
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,020
Oh, God!
It freaked me out.

233
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,820
It shouldn't, but it did.

234
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,460
I wanna keep seeing her,
but it's like:

235
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,010
"Hey, you know what?
Where's your leg?"

236
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,010
I'm the smallest person in the world,
aren't l?

237
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,100
Morning.

238
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,420
Actually, he's the smallest person
in the world.

239
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,060
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

240
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,730
It came up.

241
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,220
Listen, I know it's a long shot, but. . .

242
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,420
. . .by any chance,
did she find that funny?

243
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,460
So I nodded off a little!

244
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,540
"Nodded off"?
Ross, you were snoring!

245
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,820
My father's boat didn't make
that much noise when it hit rocks!

246
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,330
Come on! Forty-five minutes. . . .

247
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,540
Forty-five minutes, the man talked
about strappy-backed dresses.

248
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,060
Okay, how about four hours
in a freezing museum auditorium. . .

249
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,460
. . .Iistening to
Professor "Pitstains" say:

250
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,940
"Remember that thing that died
a gazillion years ago?

251
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,340
Well, here's a little bone
we didn't know it had! "

252
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,410
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

253
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,420
And second of all,
that little bone proved that. . .

254
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,860
. . .that particular dinosaur had wings
but didn't fly.

255
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,100
Okay, you know what I just heard?

256
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,860
A hundred million people
went to see a movie about what I do.

257
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,460
I wonder how many people would go see
a movie called Jurassic Parka.

258
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,620
Oh, that is so--

259
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,220
A bunch of out-of-control jackets
take over an island!

260
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,340
If what I do is so lame. . .

261
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,020
. . .then why did you insist on coming
with me this morning?

262
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,020
Was it so I just wouldn't
go with Mark?

263
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,420
I wanted to be with you.

264
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,220
I don't know, I feel like lately. . .

265
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,340
. . .you're slipping away from me. . .

266
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,850
. . .with this new job
and all these new people.

267
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,700
And you've got this
whole other life going on.

268
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,820
I know it's dumb. . .

269
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,980
. . .but I just hate
that I'm not a part of it.

270
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,620
It's not dumb.

271
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,220
But maybe it's okay
that you're not a part of it.

272
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,610
You know what I mean?

273
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,170
I mean, it's like. . .

274
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,420
. . .I like that you're not
involved in that part of my life.

275
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,820
That's a little clearer.

276
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,660
See, it doesn't mean
I don't love you. . .

277
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,980
. . .because I do.
I love you so much.

278
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,460
But my work--
It's for me, you know?

279
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,060
I'm out there on my own,
and I'm doing it.

280
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,220
And it's scary,
but I love it because it's mine.

281
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,020
But I mean, is that okay?

282
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,220
Sure.

283
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,180
You're thinking about my leg.

284
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,980
Actually, I forgot.
What's the deal with that again?

285
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,860
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

286
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,820
I only need to know
how much it bothers you. . .

287
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,220
. . .because I don't like
wasting my time.

288
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,380
Am I wasting my time?

289
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,620
No, I don't think so.

290
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,020
It's like anything else.
You just have to get used to it.

291
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,900
What's that?

292
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,020
That's my "nubbin. "

293
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,020
What's a nubbin?

294
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,010
It's kind of a third-nipple
kind of thing.

295
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,060
You have three nipples?

296
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,220
Well, you know, two regulars. . .

297
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,060
. . .and one that
barely qualifies as a--

298
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,580
What?

299
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,340
Nothing. You know, l. . . .

300
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,620
I just remembered.
I have to leave.

301
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,140
You have to leave? Now? How come?

302
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,060
Well, it's nubbin.
Nothing!

303
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,140
You know what?
I'll see you later.

304
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,660
I thought you weren't coming.

305
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,220
-Where were you?
-Come here, come here.

306
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,180
Don't get mad, okay?

307
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,020
Don't give me a reason to get mad,
okay?

308
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,450
I played Smelly Cat for
my old ad agency. They went nuts!

309
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,860
I told you I didn't want you
to try and sell it. . .

310
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,260
. . .and you just big, fat did it anyway!

311
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,570
I think, five years ago,
I probably would have done anything. . .

312
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,140
. . .to play with you.

313
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,620
But I can do it myself.
If I can't trust you, then forget it.

314
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,540
I don't wanna forget it.

315
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,420
You know what?
You have to choose.

316
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,620
If the most important thing
on the planet to you. . .

317
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,740
. . .is this cat-poopy thing,
then you can have Smelly Cat.

318
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,820
But we won't be partners.

319
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,860
So what's it gonna be?

320
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,220
-Smelly cat, smelly cat
-Problem odor in the litter box?

321
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,580
Don 't change your kitty,
change your kitty litter.

322
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,260
It's not your fault

323
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,580
Sorry, Pheebs.

324
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,620
You okay?

325
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,460
I actually am.

326
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,210
Because, you know, life's gonna
hand you all kinds of stuff.

327
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,340
You learn your little lessons
and hopefully you grow.

328
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,030
-You wanna hear a new song?
-We'd love to.

329
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,380
Jingle bitch screwed me over

330
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,020
Go to hell, jingle whore

331
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,100
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

332
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,660
That's all I have so far.

333
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,020
Well, hello!

334
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,820
-Where you been?
-The doctor.

335
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,380
Is everything okay?

336
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,020
Just had me
a little nubbin-ectomy.

337
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,180
Two nipples, no waiting.

338
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,620
Well! Just like Rachel
in high school.

339
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,850
What?

340
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,740
Come on, I was kidding!
It was such an obvious joke.

341
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,660
