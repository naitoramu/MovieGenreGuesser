1
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,631
God, you're beautiful.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,634
Why are we fighting this?

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,971
You know you want it to happen
as much as I do.

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,225
I want you. I need you.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,230
Let me make love to you.

6
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,233
I don't wanna stand in the way
of true love or anything...

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,737
...but I think a cantaloupe
might hurt less.

8
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,281
No, I'm rehearsing my lines.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,284
They're giving me a romantic story
on "Days of our Lives".

10
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:38,163
It's the first time my character's got
one. I'm nervous. I want it to be good.

11
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,835
I haven't seen you this worked-up since
you did that dog-food commercial...

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,256
...and you thought you were gonna be
with a real talking dog.

13
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,966
Yeah, that was a disappointment.

14
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,096
You wanna come down to the set
and tell me if I'm doing okay?

15
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,889
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

16
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,892
You just have to promise not
to get thrown out again.

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,812
- That was an honest mistake.
- Right.

18
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,358
"Oh, my God. Is this the men's room?
I feel so foolish.

19
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,404
Have you always known
you wanted to be an actor?"

20
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,616
Yeah, that was an awesome day.

21

24
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,036
You guys wanna come eat dinner
at the restaurant in the next few weeks?

25
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,997
- I'd love to.
- Well, you can't.

26
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,836
- We're booked solid for the next month.
- Well, I can't give you a massage...

27
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,464
...because my license
has been revoked again.

28
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,259
- Phoebe, what happened?
- Well, it was an accident, you know.

29
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,846
It's a lot of oil and sometimes
the hand just slips.

30
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,434
Have I got a surprise for you.
Pack your bags.

31
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:26,980
Oh, no. You guys aren't supposed
to get divorced for seven years.

32
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,860
What? No, I'm taking Monica
to a romantic inn in Vermont.

33
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:37,616
Oh, good. Okay, good for you.
Trying to recapture the magic.

34
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,286
- So can you get out of work?
- Honey, I can't.

35
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,249
- Things are crazy at the restaurant.
- You're really that busy?

36
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,126
Yeah. I'm sorry, I really am.

37
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,630
That's okay. I'll just try and reschedule.

38
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,384
Hi, this is Chandler Bing.
I made a reservation there...

39
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:58,179
...and I need to change it.

40
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:03,017
What do you mean it's nonrefundable?
Well, can I just come some other time?

41
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,685
Can't you make an exception?

42
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,689
Tell them I'm a chef
at a big New York restaurant.

43
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,318
Tell them that in two weeks, I will once
again be a masseuse in good standing.

44
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,406
Look, this is ridiculous.
I'm not paying for that room, okay?

45
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,452
Well, thank you very much.

46
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,622
Yeah, I'm going to Vermont.

47
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,709
- Don't worry, use your travel insurance.
- I don't have travel insurance.

48
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:33,296
Well, this is what happens
when people live on the edge.

49
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,758
Why don't you take Ross?

50
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:40,137
Don't you think that'll be a little weird?
I mean, two guys in a romantic inn?

51
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:44,183
- No, not if the room has two beds.
- I guess.

52
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,312
It still seems a little...
"Moonlight boat ride"?!

53
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,069
Joey, is this the bed
where Olivia lost her virginity?

54
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,989
I don't know,
but one of the extras sure did.

55
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,576
Listen, Rach. Thanks again
for coming down to watch my scenes.

56
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,330
Please, honey. Just the fact that you
want me here to support you, I'm...

57
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:11,292
Oh, my God. Is that Christian Saunders?
He is so gorgeous!

58
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,212
And also, so gay.

59
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,300
Well, in my head,
he's done some pretty not-gay stuff.

60
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,888
Well, at the Christmas party, him
and Santa did some definitely-gay stuff.

61
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,266
Joey? Joey, we're ready for you.

62
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,476
Okay. All right, wish me luck.

63
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:31,313
Okay. Not that you need it, but good...
God! Is that Chase Lassiter?

64
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,774
- He's straight, right?
- Rach, if you weren't here wondering...

65
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,446
...if these guys were gay,
I don't know if I could do this.

66
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,781
I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry. Good luck.

67
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,494
On a bell, please. Quietly.

68
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,454
And action!

69
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,749
Drake, what are you doing here?

70
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,835
Stopping you from marrying
the wrong man...

71
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,045
...and making the biggest
mistake of your life.

72
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,422
- Get out.
- You don't love him.

73
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,174
What do you know about love?

74
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,136
I know what I felt that night
when we kissed under the bridge.

75
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:06,014
- That kiss never happened.
- Well, what about this one?

76
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,894
Now, I told you to get out.

77
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,021
Fine, I'll go.

78
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,732
But let me ask you one question.

79
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:20,154
- You look real familiar. Have we...?
- Shh! He's asking her a question.

80
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:25,117
Can you live the rest of your life never
knowing what we could have been?

81
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,245
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.

82
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,999
Yes, you do. I'm the one who doesn't
have a choice because I...

83
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,294
Because I can't stop loving you.

84
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:40,298
- Don't say that.
- Tell me to stop.

85
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,676
Just...

86
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,304
...tell me to stop.

87
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,308
- Cut!
- No!

88
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,938
Or, cut. You know, that's your call.

89
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,774
- Everything was delicious.
- Thank you.

90
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,527
It was. The duck in particular
was superb.

91
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,988
Thank you.

92
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,035
You haven't said anything.

93
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,746
Actually, I do have one small complaint.

94
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:15,584
Well, please, I welcome criticism.

95
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,504
The musician right outside the restaurant
is kind of a mood killer.

96
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:20,839
What musician?

97
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,193
What are you doing here?

98
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:46,448
You said you had customers lined up
in the street, so I'm here to entertain.

99
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,409
- Great.
- Yeah, it really has been great too.

100
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,495
They must have seen me
play before...

101
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,164
...because they requested
a bunch of my songs.

102
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,708
Yeah, "You Suck"...

103
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,752
...and "Shut Up and Go Home."

104
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,092
Listen, Phoebe. You know how much
I love listening to your music...

105
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,136
...but...
- But what?

106
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,267
This is kind of a classy place.

107
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,935
Okay, say no more.

108
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,608
Everyone!

109
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,573
Classy, huh?

110
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,163
Hi, Chandler Bing. I have a reservation.

111
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,208
Welcome to the Chestnut Inn.
Where are you joining us from?

112
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,420
- New York.
- The Big Apple.

113
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:45,633
He's wound up. We had to stop at every
maple-candy stand on the way here.

114
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,052
I ate all my gifts for everybody.

115
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,807
I'm sorry, there's no record
of your reservation in the computer.

116
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:58,812
- That's impossible. Check again, please.
- Check again, please.

117
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,358
- I'm sorry, it's not here.
- It's not there.

118
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:07,071
Let me get this straight. I called
to try to cancel my reservation...

119
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,116
...was told it's not refundable. Then we
drove six hours all the way up here...

120
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,453
...and now we don't have a reservation?
- I don't know what to say.

121
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,872
She doesn't know what to say.

122
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,166
Just give us
the cheapest room you have.

123
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:23,378
The only thing we have available
is our deluxe suite. The rate is $600.

124
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,964
- That's insane.
- It's totally insane.

125
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:30,219
Let's drive home. We'll hit all the
maple-candy stores on the way back...

126
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:36,391
...and if they're closed, then maybe we'll
tap a tree and make some ourselves.

127
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,687
Does that room have a closet
I can lock him in?

128
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,399
- We'll take it.
- Great.

129
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,528
- They are totally ripping us off!
- Dude, don't worry about it.

130
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:51,782
I know how to make your money back.
This is a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities.

131
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,786
We just load up on those. Like those
apples. Instead of taking one...

132
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,165
...I take six.

133
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,460
Great. At $ 100 an apple, we're there.

134
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,965
Come on, you get the idea. You know,
we'll make our money back in no time.

135
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:12,969
- Dude, you're shaking.
- It's the sugar. Could you hold the apple?

136
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,226
- Hi.
- Hey.

137
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:24,189
Joey, I got to tell you, I have been
thinking all day about that scene you did.

138
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,400
You were amazing.

139
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,986
You know, the writing was good.
And the director's good.

140
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,280
And my costar's good.

141
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,491
But they're not as good as me!

142
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,120
You have to tell me
what happens tomorrow.

143
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,081
I'm going over the script now.
Wanna read lines with me?

144
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,710
Me? Oh, I'm not an actress.

145
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,797
- All right, I can ask Monica.
- Screw her! That part is mine!

146
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,758
Okay, so just from the top
of the page right here.

147
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,219
Okay.

148
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,934
Hello, Drake.
I'm surprised to see you here.

149
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:03,395
- I can't believe you married him.
- Well, what choice did I have?

150
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,857
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.

151
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,779
So, what about us?
Everything we feel for each other?

152
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,449
It's over. You have to accept that.

153
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:20,079
How can I, knowing I'll never
hold you in my arms again...

154
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,333
...or touch your skin or feel your lips...

155
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,003
...knowing I'll never make love to you?

156
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:31,215
How can I accept
that I can never kiss you again...

157
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,384
...when it's all I can do not
to kiss you right now?

158
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,889
Kiss me.

159
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,850
What?

160
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:43,978
Kiss me.

161
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:49,525
- Rach, it doesn't say that.
- No, I'm saying it.

162
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,569
- But...
- Just don't talk.

163
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,661
Well, that's new.

164
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,549
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.

165
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,510
I've forgotten a couple of things.

166
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:21,014
Could you have some complimentary
toiletries sent up to my room?

167
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,935
Thank you.
Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...

168
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:31,149
...razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss,
Band-Aids, shaving cream, after shave.

169
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,402
And I feel like I'm forgetting something.

170
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:38,199
Is there anything else you have
that I haven't asked for already?

171
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,702
Yeah, go ahead,
send up some tampons.

172
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,789
- What'd you get?
<i>- USA Today.</i>

173
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,916
Nice. Put it with the others.

174
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,129
And I also got two more apples.

175
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,256
We're four short of a bushel!

176
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:59,303
God, I feel so alive.
I love being in the country!

177
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,763
Also, got these great
salt and pepper shakers...

178
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,266
...from the restaurant.
- That's not cool.

179
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,186
Dude, none of this is cool.

180
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,357
Look, Chandler, you have to find
the line between stealing...

181
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,818
...and taking what the hotel owes you.

182
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,821
For example: A hair dryer, no, no, no.

183
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,116
But shampoos and conditioners,
yes, yes, yes.

184
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,829
Now, the salt shaker is off limits.

185
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:29,959
But, the salt...

186
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,878
I wish I'd thought this through.

187
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:37,091
I think I get what you mean, though.
Like, the lamp is the hotel's...

188
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,427
...but the bulbs...
Oh, you already got that.

189
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,556
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.

190
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,475
- Okay, how about this?
- No, no, no.

191
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:51,146
- You can't take the remote control.
- Yes, but the batteries.

192
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,862
Thank you. Thank you very much.

193
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,531
- Let's celebrate with some maple candy.
- No!

194
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,287
At least tell me where you hid it.

195
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:12,877
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

196
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,171
Have you ever had any...

197
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:20,884
...weird, romantic dreams?

198
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,720
Let me think.

199
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:29,143
When I was younger, I used to dream
that I got married to Mayor McCheese.

200
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,437
And on our wedding night,
I ate his head.

201
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,358
Okay.

202
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,028
Well, this is like that...

203
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,071
...in no way.

204
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,201
I had a dream last night
that I wanted to kiss Joey.

205
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,370
Wow! You mean like
"kiss him" kiss him?

206
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:51,874
Oh, yeah.
I mean, it was pretty intense.

207
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,209
- What brought that on?
- I don't know.

208
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,421
Maybe it had to do with the fact
I saw him do a love scene.

209
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,923
- A love scene? With who?
- Olivia.

210
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:03,385
Olivia?!
I thought she was marrying Connor?!

211
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,680
Oh, right. Real life more important.

212
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,350
- You think my dream means anything?
- I don't know.

213
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,938
I mean, you saw him do a love scene.
Maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.

214
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,150
Maybe you have a thing for Drake.

215
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,948
Well, it was Joey reading
Drake's lines in the dream.

216
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,953
Of course it was. Trust me,
when it comes to psychology...

217
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,372
...I know what I'm talking about.

218
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,710
- I took two psych classes in college.
- You took the same class twice.

219
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,463
- It was hard!
- I know.

220
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,424
- Hey.
- Hi.

221
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:47,596
Here, Monica, look what I got to wear
when I play at your restaurant.

222
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,145
Wait.

223
00:14:55,646 --> 00:15:00,442
Right? I think this might even class up
"The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man."

224
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,947
Phoebe...

225
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,074
...maybe I wasn't clear before.

226
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,746
I really love listening
to your music here.

227
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,748
But my restaurant,
it's sort of an upscale place.

228
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:19,711
Right, yeah, okay. I'll ask the butler
to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.

229
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,756
Phoebe, it's not what you wear.

230
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:26,135
It's sort of your songs.

231
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,304
I just don't think you should play
at the restaurant anymore.

232
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,060
Okay. Fine, I'll just...

233
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,980
I'll take the hat back.

234
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,984
There.

235
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,367
Hey, so you guys, the funniest
thing happened at work the...

236
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,661
My songs aren't good enough
for your restaurant?

237
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,455
Okay, we're still on that.

238
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:59,210
- I didn't say they weren't good enough.
- Then what's wrong with them?

239
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,462
What, they don't go with your
tiny portions of pretentious food?

240
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,008
- Tiny portions?
- Yeah, well, "Excuse me.

241
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:11,389
I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,
but I can't see it. I can't see it."

242
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:17,436
- Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
- Well, it's not about quality.

243
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,689
Oh, really?
You wanna talk about quality?

244
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:25,235
Have you ever heard of a "key"?
It's what some people sing in.

245
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:29,365
Well, at least all my songs
don't taste like garlic.

246
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:32,076
Yeah, there are other
ingredients, Monica.

247
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,703
So that's what we're doing.

248
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,915
When I'm in a coffeehouse bopping
along to one of your songs...

249
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,751
...I'm wearing earplugs.
- Earplugs or cloves of garlic?

250
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,881
You know what?
I take back what I said before.

251
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:50,010
Keep playing at the restaurant, because
with your music driving people inside...

252
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,887
...my bar sales
have gone up like crazy.

253
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:55,057
What are people having,
the garlic martini?

254
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,312
Here's your bill.
We hope you enjoyed your stay.

255
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,275
Oh, we did.
And you still have all your lamps.

256
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,072
- I didn't factor in the room tax.
- Dude, don't worry about it.

257
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:15,286
I found an unattended maid's cart.
We're way ahead of the game.

258
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,788
- Oh, my God.
- What?

259
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,583
There's something new in the bowl.

260
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:25,545
- Look, we have enough. Just walk away.
- No, but I want the pine cones.

261
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:30,175
- There's a forest right outside.
- It's not the same.

262
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,928
Okay, go quick.

263
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,646
Thank you for a delightful stay.

264
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,074
My maple candy!

265
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:09,590
It's just you. I thought someone was
swinging a bag of cats against the wall.

266
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:14,511
You'd better get back in that kitchen.
The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.

267
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:17,222
- Okay, you have to stop playing now.
- Why?

268
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,683
The only person my playing
is bothering is you.

269
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:25,064
- Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.
- Get your garlic peelers off me.

270
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,608
Excuse me? Excuse me?

271
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,320
Hi, I'm Monica Geller.
I'm the head chef here.

272
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,491
Okay, I was actually expecting
a little applause there, but whatever.

273
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:38,494
Quick question.
By a show of hands...

274
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,873
...how many of you were bothered
by this woman's singing outside?

275
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:47,336
Okay, okay. How many of you
enjoyed the music outside?

276
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,300
Let me ask you this question.
How many thought the music was fine...

277
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:57,471
...but not in keeping with the tone
of the restaurant?

278
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:02,852
Who identified this restaurant's tone
as "pretentious-comma-garlicky"?

279
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:09,107
Okay, who thinks the food is delicious
and a little pretension never hurt anyone?

280
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,404
Okay, well, all right, who thinks
the food is fine, the music was fine...

281
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,074
...but your evening was ruined
by this incessant poll-taking?

282
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,205
Excuse us.

283
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,918
All right, here's a question.

284
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:32,089
Who was so worried about
her restaurant being fancy...

285
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,467
...that she made a big deal about
her friend playing her music...

286
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,929
...and feels really bad about it now?

287
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,557
Well, who was so stupid
and stubborn...

288
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,143
...that she lashed out
against her friend's cooking...

289
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,647
...which she actually thinks
is pretty great?

290
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,817
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

291
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,029
Hey, you wanna stick around
and I'll whip you up some dinner?

292
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,992
Yeah, as long as it's free.
The food here is ridiculously overpr...

293
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:07,499
Who hopes the hand-raising thing is still
cute enough that you won't hate me?

294
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:17,885
Joey, do you have peanut butter
on the back of your head?

295
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,515
Oh, man. I thought I got it all.

296
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,393
How...?

297
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,395
How?

298
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,106
I was making a peanut butter
smoothie, right?

299
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:35,402
I couldn't find this little plastic thingy
that goes in the top of the blender.

300
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:39,740
And I thought, "Well, you know,
how important can that be?" Right?

301
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,075
Turns out, very.

302
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,788
Wow, definitely just Drake.

303
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,666
- What?
- How's it going with Drake?

304
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,168
- I don't think it's going very well.
- What?

305
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,170
That scene I saw was so good.

306
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:59,051
Well, I'm feeling really insecure
about the one we're shooting tomorrow.

307
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:03,472
Is this that thing you do when you say
you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?

308
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,765
A little.

309
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:12,314
No, I really am worried. I have to make it
convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.

310
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:15,526
- So?
- So I've never played that.

311
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:19,488
Oh, honey, it can't be that hard.
I mean, you've been in love before.

312
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:23,576
Well, just once...

313
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:26,036
...with you.

314
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:29,665
Okay. Well, this could be
a little awkward.

315
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:32,334
I'm just gonna blow past it.

316
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:35,546
Well, look, can't you just use
that method-actor thing...

317
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:40,676
...where you use your real-life memories
to help you in your performance?

318
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:43,220
What the hell are you talking about?

319
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:51,520
All right, look, just try to remember
how you felt when you were in love...

320
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,232
...and think about that
when you're playing the scene.

321
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,737
Okay. Yeah, I think I can do that.

322
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:04,032
Yeah. Okay, there's this
party scene coming up.

323
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,410
And Olivia and her husband are there...

324
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:11,832
...and all Drake wants to do is
grab her and kiss her, but he can't.

325
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:16,545
That makes me think about those times
I wanted to grab you and kiss you...

326
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:19,965
...but you didn't know, so I would
just pretend everything was cool...

327
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:22,218
...but really it was killing me.

328
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:28,223
Joey, you never
talked about that before.

329
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,353
Hey, you know what else I could use?

330
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,857
There's this scene where Drake
sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...

331
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:41,403
...and she doesn't know he's there,
which never happened with us.

332
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:47,742
I mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,
but he just wants to look at her.

333
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,621
You know?

334
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:55,750
And I remember all those mornings
before you even put on your makeup...

335
00:22:55,959 --> 00:23:01,339
...when I would think to myself,
"My God, she is beautiful."

336
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:08,097
And it hurt so much because I knew
I could never tell you.

337
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:15,770
But it was worth it just to be there
looking at you.

338
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,320
Thanks, dude. This is great!

339
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,333
I got you something from Vermont.

340
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,669
Besides tampons and salt?

341
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:42,005
Oh, my God.

342
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:45,801
Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.

343
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,804
That's weird, it's empty.

344
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:54,393
Hi, you guys. What's going on?
You guys wanna hang out or...?

345
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,567
Do you guys hear a buzzing?

346
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,534
