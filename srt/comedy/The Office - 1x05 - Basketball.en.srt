1
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:00,541
Hey you're ready ?

2
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,827
All right, all right, secret sign.

3
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:08,040
Hey, Ryan ? very good,

4
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:09,889
excellent, excellent.

5
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:11,088
Michael !

6
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:24,394
<i>Today at lunchtime we’re going to
be playing the warehouse staff in a</i>

7
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:26,549
friendly little game of basketball.

8
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:30,512
My idea. The last time I was down there
I noticed they put up a couple of hoops.

9
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:33,760
And I play basketball every week-end,

10
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,618
so I thought "This might be kind of fun".
And so I started messing around,

11
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:42,305
and, I'm sinking a few,
you know swish swish swish,

12
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:47,576
nothing but net !
And their jaws just drop to the floor.

13
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:49,851
African Americans !

14
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,322
You know it's really
just a good friendly game,

15
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:56,593
a reason for everybody to get together.

16
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:59,860
Pam Pam thank you Ma'am.
Messages please there you go.

17
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:01,423
Michael can I talk to you
for a second please ?

18
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,490
Privately, in your office ?

19
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:07,983
- I think I should be on the team.
- No.

20
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:10,301
And that's not me being mean Dwight,

21
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:13,051
- that is based on your past behavior.
- Oh please.

22
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,252
- When I let him come to my pick up game...
- I apologized for that.

23
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:20,610
I vouched for you, I vouched
for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.

24
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:33,521
Here's what I’m going to do.
The hand strikes and gives a flower.

25
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:36,102
You are not going to play basketball,

26
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:39,251
but I need somebody to come in,

27
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,543
and take over the holiday
and weekend work calendar.

28
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,362
- I can handle that.
- Good.

29
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:46,712
- Excellent, it'll be fun,
- Yeah.

30
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:50,543
because corporate wants somebody
to be here on Saturday,

31
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:53,161
so we're going to have to have a couple
of people coming in on the weekends,

32
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:57,783
and I know nobody's going to want to do it,
everybody’s going to complain and bitch and,

33
00:02:57,815 --> 00:02:59,123
I don't want to have to deal with that.

34
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,001
That's why you have an
assistant regional manager.

35
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:02,921
Yes it is.

36
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:05,390
- Assistant to the regional manager.
- Same thing.

37
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,612
- No it's not. It's lower so.
- It's close.

38
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:16,850
So we need someone to work this Saturday,
and I think that that should be...

39
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:18,980
Jim.

40
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:22,220
God this is so sad, this is
the smallest amount of power

41
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:25,123
I've ever seen go to someone's head.

42
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,853
- Phyllis, can you believe this ?
- Keep me out of it.

43
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:32,203
My fiancé has plans for us this Saturday

44
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:35,381
so I really hope
Dwight doesn't make me work.

45
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,402
Maybe I should sleep with him.

46
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:42,012
I'm kidding. Kidding. Totally kidding.

47
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:47,112
All right, managing by walking around !

48
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:53,662
This is our warehouse,
or as I like to call it, the whorehouse.

49
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:54,773
But don't you call it that,

50
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:57,251
- I've earned the right.
- Fine, don't worry about that.

51
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:01,700
And here we have
"Miter’ Roger’s neighborhood".

52
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:03,201
Come on over here, hey,

53
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,841
- This is Ryan he's temping upstairs.
- What's up ?

54
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:10,071
- And this is the foreman, "Miter’ Rogers".
- It's not my real name.

55
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,780
No, it's Darryl,
Darryl is "Miter’ Rogers".

56
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:16,003
- Darryl Rogers.
- Darryl Filben,

57
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:21,642
then Bridges, then Rige,
then Roger, then Miter’ Rogers.

58
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:26,321
That is Lonny and this is Roy,
Roy dates Pam,

59
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,733
- you know the best looking one upstairs.
- Yeah yeah.

60
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:31,141
You're still getting it regular man ?

61
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:33,942
I mean I can tell her
it's part of the job.

62
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:37,352
Repel her.

63
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:39,791
No no I know that
the warrantee is expired,

64
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:44,242
but isn't it supposed to last longer
than two years, if it isn't effective ?

65
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,670
Ok fine three years.

66
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:49,662
Pam gets a little down.
Her toaster having broke,

67
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:53,333
which she got at her engagement shower,

68
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:59,392
for a wedding that
still has yet to be set.

69
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:02,353
And that was three years ago.

70
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,501
So, one o clock sharp,
and we've got a game on.

71
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:07,553
Well none at one !

72
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,730
Oh I see, you're chickening out,
you're bailing on me.

73
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:14,502
No we got a truck going out
at one fifteen so, that's a busy time.

74
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:18,743
Well, I'm glad that sometime is a busy
time because whenever I'm down here,

75
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:21,600
It doesn't seem too busy to me.

76
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:31,103
You can dish it out
but you can't take it.

77
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:33,662
Ok, fine, have it your way.

78
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:42,991
All right fine, you know what ?

79
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:47,153
- One o clock.
- All right, see you at one.

80
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,011
Are we ready for the game ?

81
00:05:57,248 --> 00:05:58,430
I know, grumble grumble,

82
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:01,713
but you would follow me to the ends
of the earth grumbling all the way.

83
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:05,290
Like that dwarf,
from "Lord of the Rings".

84
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:07,171
- Gimli.
- Nerd.

85
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:10,373
- That is why you're not on the team.
- Just trying to be helpful.

86
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,843
Oh ul, I'll ul. Dragon Slayer.
Ten point power sword.

87
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,381
That's him.

88
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,800
Ok, so let's put together
the starting lineup shall we ?

89
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:22,032
- Stanley, of course.
- I'm sorry ?

90
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:24,901
- What do you play, center ?
- Why of course ?

91
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:27,010
What's that supposed to mean ?

92
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:30,432
I don't know,
I don't remember saying that.

93
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:34,291
- I heard it.
- People hear a lot of things, man.

94
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:39,943
Other starters... me of course.
I heard it that time.

95
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:44,711
I'd like to play, if it's just for fun.
I played basketball in school.

96
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:47,461
Uh, yeah, who else ?

97
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:52,270
We have Jim, we have Ryan,
the new guy, right untested,

98
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:55,840
willing to prove himself right now,
lot of passion, lot of heart...

99
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:58,863
But I'm getting paid
to skip lunch right ?

100
00:06:57,848 --> 00:06:58,812
Yes.

101
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:05,551
Yes,  this is business. The business
of team building and moral boosting.

102
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:09,553
- Uh, who else ?
- I can help out if you need me.

103
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:13,941
I will use your talents come baseball
season my friend, or if we box.

104
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:16,712
-  I have a hoop in my drive way.
- No.

105
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:19,420
I have sport's bra.
No, no ! Ridiculous.

106
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:21,153
Michael look !

107
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:32,181
Close  all right. Me, Stan the man,
Jim, Ryan and Dwight. Sorry fellows.

108
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:34,132
- Can I be team captain ?
- No I'm team captain.

109
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:36,013
- Can I be team manager ?
- No I am the team manager,

110
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:38,663
- you can be assistant to the team manager.
- Assistant team manager ?

111
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:38,662
No.

112
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:41,390
Ok we'll see who is working
this weekend then.

113
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:43,523
Jim, you're in charge of
the vacation's schedule now.

114
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:45,090
Oh my god...

115
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:47,691
Threat neutralized.

116
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:07,353
Off the backboard !

117
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:11,551
- Please don't throw a garbage at me.
- Oh Pam with this anger.

118
00:08:11,695 --> 00:08:16,400
Hey Pam, how would you like
to be our cheerleader today ?

119
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:18,733
You know, some pink tails,

120
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:21,510
little halter top you can tie that up,

121
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:25,743
and you know something a little...
just useful for a change, just this once.

122
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,310
I don't think so Michael.

123
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,750
Besides I can't cheer against my fiancé.

124
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:30,762
I'll do it.

125
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:33,660
Wear a little fancy skirt if you want.

126
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:37,701
Yeah I bet you would, just
try not to be too gay on the court.

127
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:42,371
And by gay I mean, you know,
not in a homosexual way at all,

128
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,023
I mean, you know,
like the bad at sports way.

129
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,840
I think that goes without saying.

130
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:49,262
- Maybe Angela would cheerlead ?
- Yeah right.

131
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:52,812
- I'll do it.
- That's worse than you playing.

132
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:59,090
Cause you know what ? We need you as
an alternate in case somebody gets hurt.

133
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:01,293
That's where we need you.

134
00:09:01,427 --> 00:09:04,180
Bless would be those who sit and wait.

135
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:09,561
You made it !
Suit up you're on the team !

136
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:15,522
All right. Cool ! Very good.

137
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:20,493
A spy from the warehouse, trying
to figure out our players eh man ?

138
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:22,760
Just getting a tea-bag.

139
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:26,731
He's running, but he can't hide,
because you know what ?

140
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:28,970
one o clock
you'd better bring your A game,

141
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:33,222
because me and my posse guys,
we're going to be in your face.

142
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,503
Right in your face.

143
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,808
Why don't we make it more interesting ?
Loser buys dinner at Farley's.

144
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:43,405
I like the way you think. You know
what I'll take that one step further :

145
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:46,956
Loser works on Saturday.

146
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:51,092
No, that's not of much fun.

147
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:56,441
- You know what ?
- Oh what ?

148
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,360
- You're on.
- Ok.

149
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:01,750
Cool. You're on.

150
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:06,020
Don't screw this up !

151
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:17,190
Classic beginners mistaken,
eating before game.

152
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:35,613
Has anyone seen the first aid kit ?

153
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:41,753
How many times have I told you ?
I'm the safety officer, not you.

154
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,690
Basketball, was kind of my thing,
in high school,

155
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:05,623
and yeah, I'm looking forward to play.

156
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:08,373
You know I think I'm going
to impress a few people in here.

157
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:12,022
- You're coming down ?
- Yeah I'm just forwarding the phones.

158
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,432
- Will you wish me luck ?
- Yeah you're going to need it.

159
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:18,081
Wow ! Is that trash talk from Pam ?

160
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,511
I'm just saying Roy is very competitive,

161
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:24,392
and he wants to take the wave runners
to the lake this Saturday, so...

162
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:28,301
Well I'm going to
the outlet mall on Saturday, so

163
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:33,011
if you want to save big on brand names,
and Roy has to work, which he will,

164
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:37,680
because I'm also competitive,
you should feel free to come along.

165
00:11:38,217 --> 00:11:42,183
I think I'm going to be up at the lake.

166
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:46,761
I think I'll see you at the mall...
yeah.

167
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:56,243
There he is. Secret weapon !

168
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:06,601
All right guys, come on !
Let's bring it in. Here we go.

169
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:13,143
OK. Listen, this is just going to be
a friendly game, right ?

170
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:17,803
We're all on the same team here,
the Dundler Mifflin team.

171
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:21,232
Of course if you beat us, you're fired.

172
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:23,343
That's a joke !

173
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,240
Ok. Let's do it !

174
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:31,862
- Have a good game man !
- Yeah, you too, should be fun.

175
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:35,710
All right everybody stretch out a little
bit. Stretch, stretch it, full stretch.

176
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:38,893
- Ryan you want to stretch ?
- I stretched before I came.

177
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:43,911
Ok Ryan you have Darryl. I have Roy.

178
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:45,761
Really ? I thought I'd take Roy.

179
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:48,880
No actually, I think Roy
is their best player, not lying.

180
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,550
So Dwight you have the east German girl.

181
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,351
- Ok we'll be skins !
- No.

182
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:06,740
Come on Dwight.

183
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:09,982
- What ? Shirts on or off ?
- On ! Put it on !

184
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:11,082
- You're sure ?
- Yes.

185
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,733
Pam, you kind of have
your foots on both camps here,

186
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:15,712
why don't you do the jump ball ?

187
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:17,522
Don't listen to him Pam, trust me.

188
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,583
Tip it my way or
you'll sleep in the car !

189
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:23,800
Stanley !

190
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:29,271
What ? You got to be kidding me !

191
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:35,920
Here we go, who's at him who's at him ?
Somebody get him !

192
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:45,023
Over here ! Three !

193
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:47,281
Let's go to zone,
let's go on a zone !

194
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:48,453
Defense !

195
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:49,491
Defense !

196
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:50,741
Defense !

197
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:52,282
Defense !

198
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:56,463
Who's got Roy ?

199
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:13,311
Oh come on, what is wrong
with me today ? Usually hit those.

200
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:23,531
Dwight I was open.
All right, let's go.

201
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:32,321
Aw ! Ok, foul, charging,

202
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:36,670
That's foul. Ok I'll take it.

203
00:14:58,616 --> 00:15:01,080
When I'm playing hoops,

204
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:04,961
all of the stress and responsibility
of my job here just melts away.

205
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:08,132
It's gone, in the zone.

206
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,121
Three ! What's with me today ?-

207
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:11,310
Who am I ? Am I Michael Scott ?

208
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:15,471
I don't know.
I might just be a basketball machine.

209
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:18,131
What's Dundler Mifflin ?
I've never heard of it.

210
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:22,323
Filing, paper works, who cares ?
Possible downsizing ?

211
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:26,642
That's probably going to happen actually.

212
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:32,033
Jim right here, give me the ball,
Ryan cut !

213
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:33,733
My bad.

214
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:41,520
Where you're at.

215
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:43,300
Where you're at.

216
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:49,391
Is that like the robot ?

217
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,433
Nice !

218
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:57,273
Just do one, that's cool, that's fine.

219
00:15:57,337 --> 00:15:59,533
All right let's go.

220
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:03,232
Back off !

221
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,672
Come on ! Hey Dwight !

222
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:12,291
Yeah, in your face !

223
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:13,442
Dwight !

224
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:16,700
Football, is like rock'n'roll,
it's just...

225
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:20,932
And basketball is like Jazz,
you know you kind of...

226
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:26,482
downbeat, it's in the pocket,
it's like you...

227
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,141
Time out !

228
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:52,462
Come on, sellers, over here.
Bring it in ! Come on !

229
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:56,063
What's going on ? You guys
are playing like a bunch of girls.

230
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:58,220
- You know what ? Let me take Roy.
- All right we'll switch,

231
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:00,242
Take it up a notch. Come on !

232
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,071
Foul ! Naked aggression !

233
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:26,052
Oh  that is, you're all right Jim ?
Suck it up.

234
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:35,541
Ouch ! How much does it hurt ?

235
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:49,832
Yes !

236
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,702
What the hell man ?

237
00:17:51,727 --> 00:17:53,850
- Take it easy.
- No you take it easy !

238
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,112
Same team Dwight.

239
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:07,440
Yes !

240
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,161
Yeah !

241
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:13,082
Yeah !

242
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:14,313
Yeah !

243
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:17,001
In your face !

244
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:20,090
- Angela, what's the score ?
- You're ahead.

245
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:22,523
Yeah baby, here we go !

246
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:26,710
Jim, Jim right here !
Ouch ! Hold it !

247
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:29,492
I'm sorry. Are you all right ?

248
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:28,142
Foul !

249
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:29,483
God !

250
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:31,130
- That hurts,
- I'm sorry.

251
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:33,891
- What's your problem man ?
- I didn't mean to do this.

252
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,950
Just clack at me for no reason ?

253
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,810
- Take you shot man !
- NO no no !

254
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,960
That was a flagrant
personal intentional foul.

255
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,640
- No way it wasn't.
- Yes it was.

256
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:46,882
- I'm just being fair.
- Oh really, I just moved my arm.

257
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:50,380
Game over ! That is it.
I'm sorry you know.

258
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:53,591
I hate to do it this way,
but you know that's just,

259
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:56,272
we're having a friendly game,
it's a shame !

260
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,872
This is a damn shame !

261
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,991
We're like a family here,
and that's just, that won't fly.

262
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:02,432
- This is a cold pack.
- Give me that.

263
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,062
You have to break into your bag.

264
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:07,240
Thanks Dwight.

265
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,670
What does that mean ?
What is it, a tie ? What's going on ?

266
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,152
- Let's just say, whoever was ahead won.
- That was you...

267
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:17,383
It was us really ? I didn't know.

268
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:22,983
Great. Now you see
who was work on Saturday, your face.

269
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:26,790
- No, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
- Yeah this isn't happening.

270
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:34,071
Guys, you know, I'm the boss so...

271
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:39,042
Yeah, so what's that,
we're coming on Monday right ?

272
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:46,192
Monday ?

273
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,990
You guys believed me ? Come on...

274
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:55,691
dogs you know,
you should know me better than that.

275
00:19:56,948 --> 00:20:01,462
No, do you think that
would have been good for moral ? No.

276
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:06,102
Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed with
even that close so. Now of course,

277
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:08,461
We're coming in Saturday.

278
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,391
Good game. Word.

279
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:49,951
So I talked to this accountant, it
looks good. I haven't signed anything.

280
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,441
- Hey baby !
- Hey !

281
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:55,012
Larry bird, Larry legend.

282
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:58,271
Yeah he's pretty good uh ?

283
00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:05,871
- Let's get you into a tub.
- Yeah ? And you in a tub.

284
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:13,651
Hey. What a game, what a game !

285
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:15,813
What time do we have to come in ?

286
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:22,162
Come on, lets not be gloomy here man,
we're on this together, we're a team.

287
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,361
You know what ?

288
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:29,761
Screw corporate !

289
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:33,292
Nobody's coming in tomorrow,
you have the day off.

290
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:37,130
Like how even an extra day is going
to prevent us from being downsized ?

291
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:39,333
Have a good weekend.

292
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:45,652
The great thing about sports is
that it is all about character.

293
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:52,083
And you can learn lessons about life
even if you don't win.

294
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:55,170
But  we did, because we were ahead.
