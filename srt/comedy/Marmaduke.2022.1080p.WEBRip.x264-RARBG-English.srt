382
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,541

00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,666
I heard Black Bart's been rustlin'
around these parts.

-Dad! What are you doing?

402

Marmaduke doesn't have time
to play cowboy. He's in training.

403
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,500
But I hardly even saw him today.

404
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,208
That's because he's working very hard
to get ready for the dog show.

405
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,375
Who cares about some stupid dog show?

411
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,750
Oh. Okay, this is where we both jump
for the couch and have that big fight

00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:15,458
Because he thinks
Marmaduke is gonna make us rich.

539
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,458
Billy, stop saying true things
about your father.

540
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,750
Why? All he cares about
is the prize money.

541
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,916
Yeah, what a jerk.

542
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,375
Mom, if Marmaduke wins, can I get a pony?

543
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,250
We'll see, honey. [chuckles]

544
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,208

Look how beautiful Shimmer Shampoo
makes Zeus's hair, no?

560
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:35,583
That is the best-looking dog
I've ever seen!

561

That's just the lights from the-- Oh! Ah!

562
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,541
Okay, that's the fur.

-…like the Zeus.

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,208
-No wonder he's so shiny.
-Billy, look.

573
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:14,041
[Marmaduke] He uses
name-brand shampoo. I use soap.

Dish soap.

Mom, can I use Shimmer Shampoo?

576
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,791
Don't be silly.

577
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,000
You're not using dog shampoo. [chuckles]

Zeus is so, so special. [giggles]

Come to buy some shampoo, fleabag?

596
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:16,791
Or did you just want to see
what a champion looks like up close?

597
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,708
You know what?
I'm gonna be a champion too.

Okay. First of all, ah, I'm going to be
the next World Champion.

600
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,416
Second of all,
the only thing you're going to win is

[Guy chuckles]

608
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,000
Congratulations, Marmaduke.

609
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,791
You're all signed up
for your first dog show.

Guy?

611

Oh!

612
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,166
Who's this pretty princess?

613
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,000
[scoffs] See ya later, loser.

614
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:00,416
Humph.

615
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,666
Ugh. Ooh.

616
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:07,208
Oh, I hope this disguise works
and no one recognizes me.

617
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,750
Come on, we have to get ready
for the competition.

620

Today, you'll show them all
that you are a champion.

621
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,041
Showtime.

622
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,125
[Marmaduke] Wow.

623

-Hmm?
-Hi, pal.

624
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,041
Hi.

625
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,750
So many new friends to talk to.

626

Yay!

627
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,791
Ah. Here we are.

628
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,125
Wow.

629
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:50,708
This is all for me?

630
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,458
You belong here.

631
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,791
-You have to believe you're a winner.
-Huh? [grunts]

632
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,750
So start acting like one.

633
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,166
[muffled] Okey dokey.

Believe you're a winner.

637
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,208
Got it. No problem.

638
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,791
I'm a winner. I'm a winner. I'm a winner.

639
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,375
-[dog gasps] Zeus.

00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:22,916
Okay, okay. Act cool.

643
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,083
Just ignore him, and he won't bother you.

644
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,416
Oh, Zeus. Zeus!

645
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,291

649
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:41,333
Hey, buddy. I just wanted to apologize
for how I acted earlier.

650
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,916
Whatever, Zeus.

651
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,750
But did… did… did you just apologize?

652
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,458
Yeah, man.

653
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:52,875
I spent the whole day on that lousy stage
taking pictures and…

654
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,500
-I just lost it.
-[woman] Oh! Oh no!

655
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,666
Us show dogs have to
stick together, bro-bro.

656
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,583
[woman] No, boy! Oh, stop!

657
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:04,125
[hesitantly] Okay, bro-bro.

658
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:08,666
I can tell I need to earn your trust.
Let me show you something.

659
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,958
Now, there's a well-known secret
about every single dog show.

660
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:16,958
Follow me.

661
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:24,250
Nobody comes here for
stupid little trophies or fancy ribbons.

662
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,958
-Huh?
-We come here for…

663
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,666
the food!

664
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,416
[Marmaduke] It's… it's a…
I don't… I can't…

665

I… I want… I…

666
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,291
I need…

667
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,833
There's… there's so much food!

668
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,041
[Zeus] You okay, buddy?

669
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,375
Yeah, yeah. I'm okay. I'm okay.
Just… just gimme a sec, all right?

670
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,625
It's so beautiful.

671
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:47,291
Go on. Dive in.

672
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:52,250
But we're not supposed to eat a large meal
before a competition.

673
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,083
A large meal before a competition
is exactly what you need.

674
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,458
We don't have much time, so dig in.

675
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,541
[chewing] Mmm. Mmm.

676
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,125
Okay, I'm in.

677
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,750
But just a tiny taste. [exhales]

678
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,041
I gotta rush and get highlight touch-ups.

679

So you lost the dog show competition.

Mom's right.
The whole thing is unfortunate.

Did you agree to that?

893
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:32,250
It was supposed
to come out of the prize money

894
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,958
that we didn't win.

1070
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,500
[Guy] Showtime.

[Phil] Hey! Wait up!

1078

[sniffing]

1082
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,625
[in Spanish accent] What is
that delicious smell?

1083
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:41,458
[trainer] Juan Pedro, self-control.

1084
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:45,458
[woman] Shantrelle! Shantrelle!

1085
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,000
[in French accent] This humidity
is not doing my coat any favors.

[grunting, snarls]

1087
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,291
[in British accent] Give us
another chop, eh?

1088
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:03,041
Good old boy.

1089

-[man] Vinnie!
-[chomping]

1090
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:18,583

then we have already won.

1092
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:29,208
So which of these mangy mutts
is fighting for second place?

Now, win!

[Guy humming]

1098
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,333
Are we sure these are all dogs?

1099
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,833
I mean, that one has two rear ends.

1100

-[boings]
-[Marmaduke] Oh.

1101

Wait. Where's me protein shake?

1107
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,625
Ronnie, this ain't funny.

1108
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,500
Ronnie! Ronnie! [barks]

1109

1111
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:18,541
Hey, Guy, where's my protein shake?

1112
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:20,166
Hold still, Marmaduke.

1113

Amy!

1117

Don't move.

1118
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:38,041
Hmm?

1119
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,041
Wait, don't leave me.

1120
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:44,583
I'm not good in social situations.
It gives me really bad gas.

[stomach rumbles]

1122
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,375
Hello, Guy.

1123
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,875
Thanks for making
this happen at the last minute.

1124
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,000
[Amy chuckles]

1125
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:53,750
Of course. I was glad you called.

1126
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:56,291
It's really good to see you.

1127
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:57,916
I'd love to chat,

1128
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,125
but I've got to get back to my office now.

1129

[gasps]

1130
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:03,166
Amy, wait.

1131
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,708
Are we still on for dinner?

1132
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,291
[Amy] You do owe me a dinner.

1133
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,291
[Guy] Great!

1134
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:10,208
Guy.

1135

-[sniffing]
-Huh? Huh?

1136
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:15,375
Hey, hello.

1137
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:17,958
[in French accent] I haven't seen
you around.

1138
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:20,708
[nervously] Yeah, well. Um, about that,

1139
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:24,541
I… I'm… I'm… I'm kinda new
to this stuff, so…

1140
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:26,500
[chuckles]

1141
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:30,250
Juan, buddy, you call that a scarf?

[growls]

1143
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:34,083
I thought it was a dishrag.

1144
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:35,625
Hey, Hansel.

1145
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:38,041
Ooh, better cut back on the strudel.

1146
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:40,750
Your belly's starting to drag
on the floor.

Zhi?

1150
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:48,791
All the way from Shanghai
just to lose to me? [laughs]

1151
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,750
Why waste your-- [grunts]

-[energy reverberating]
-[grunting]

1153

Choose your words wisely, Mr. Zeus.

1154
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,833
[Zeus grunts]

1155
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:59,125
They may be your downfall.

1156
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,000
Whatever. [clears throat]

1157
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:04,833
[muttering] Crazy dog.

1158
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:06,166
[giggles]

1159
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,708
Don't be so nervous.

1160
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,458
I don't bite.

1161
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:12,666
[hesitantly] Okay.

1162
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,750
Unless you want me to.

1163
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:15,666
[chuckles]

1164
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,875
Uh…

1165
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:18,541
What? Huh?

1166
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,458
<i>Au revoir!</i>

1167
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:23,833
Hey, Shantrelle.

1169

Zeus.

1170

Let's do lunch.

1171

-[scoffs] As if.
-Ugh.

1172
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:35,166
[chuckles] Same old Shantrelle.

1173
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,541
Marmaduke!

1174
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,625
[indistinct chatter]

1175
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:43,791
I never expected to see you again
after what happened at the last dog show.

1176
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:46,166
You tricked me. You're a weasel.

1177
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,333
Easy, big boy.

1178
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:52,750
Look, do you really want
to go out on the competition floor

1179
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:58,291
and embarrass yourself
while the whole world is watching?

1180
00:55:58,375 --> 00:55:59,250
[growls]

1181
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,750
The only embarrassment here
is you and your overpriced shampoo.

1182
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:06,666
Now, if you’ll excuse me,
I have to prepare my victory speech.

1183

Psych!

1189
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:30,541
[reporter] Welcome to
the World Dog Championship.

1190
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:34,166
There are always
so many incredible stories at this show.

1191
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:38,833
But topping my list is the return
of the dog whisperer himself,

1192
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:42,666
Guy Hilton, here with the star
of the "Pool Flop Fail,"

00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:53,333
Are you ready?

1196
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:55,083
I… I was ready born.

1197
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:58,041
I mean, I wasn't ready to be born.
I was born to be ready.

1198
00:56:58,125 --> 00:56:59,875
The simple answer is just yes.

1199
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:02,500
Welcome back, dog aficionados!

1200
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:05,625
