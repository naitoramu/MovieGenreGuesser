1
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:05,353
I really like Valentine's Day
in this office.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,085
It's kind of like grade school...

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,232
everybody gives out little
presents and stuff.

4
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:10,944
Like last year,

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,623
Jim gave me this card
with Dwight's head on it.

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,409
It was horrifying and funny. And...

7
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:25,811
Phyllis.

8
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:27,591
<i>You could just sign here.</i>

9
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:30,043
<i>Roy and I are saving
for the wedding, so...</i>

10
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:32,570
I made him promise not to
get me anything too big.

11
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:35,366
Happy Valentine's Day, Darling,

12
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:37,740
love Bob Vance,
Vance Refrigeration.

13
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:39,706
- Isn't he sweet ?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,872
Such a sweetie.

15
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:44,251
All right, Dwight. As you know,
I'm heading to New York today,

16
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:48,011
doing a presentation on the branch
to the new CFO.

17
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:50,801
- And you want me to come with you.
- No. Opposite of that.

18
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:53,020
I will stay here and
run things on this end.

19
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:54,260
Very good.

20
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,652
Question. Will you be seeing Jan
when you're in New York ?

21
00:00:57,705 --> 00:00:59,701
I probably will. Why do you ask ?

22
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:01,851
Well, it's Valentine's Day.

23
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,270
And you guys, you know...

24
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:06,303
Screwed.

25
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,012
What is your problem ?

26
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:09,913
This is a business trip.

27
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:12,391
I would have to be a raving lunatic

28
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:15,242
to try to talk to Jan about
what happened between us.

29
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:16,910
Her words, not mine.

30
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,880
She sent me an e-mail this morning.

31
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:22,881
But, it is Valentine's Day.

32
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:26,331
It's New York, city of love.

33
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:30,662
Hey, Pam, you heard NY, right ?

34
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:32,290
You want me to pick
you up anything ?

35
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,580
- That's okay.
- All right.

36
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:35,270
<i>The best present would be,</i>

37
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:37,443
you do a good job in front
of the new CFO.

38
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:39,360
Dude, I'm going to nail it.

39
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:41,951
Me in New York ?
Oh, I own that city.

40
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,321
Fuggit abat it !

41
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:45,532
<i>See ya !</i>

45
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,691
Well, here we go
on our way to New York.

46
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:22,422
New York, New York.

47
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:24,613
The city so nice,
they named it twice.

48
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:26,882
Manhattan is the other name.

49
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:29,171
<i>So, I broke up with Katy</i>

50
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:31,410
<i>and haven't been dating
anybody else.</i>

51
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:34,512
<i>So this year, I don't have to worry
about Valentine's Day.</i>

52
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:37,321
<i>It's gonna be good.</i>
I invited a couple of friends over,

53
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:38,520
we're gonna play some cards.

54
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:40,232
And I'll end up winning
a lot of money,

55
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:41,832
because, they're idiots.

56
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:43,882
It's gonna be great.

57
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:47,692
What's this ?
What is this ?

58
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,632
I don't know.
It's on YOUR desk.

59
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:53,742
Yeah, but who put it there ?
And for what purpose ?

60
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:55,713
It was there when I sat down.

61
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:06,223
Happy Valentine's Day.

62
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,792
It's me.

63
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,490
I'm the bobble head.

64
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,133
Yes !

65
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:28,832
Yeah.

66
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:30,210
The meeting isn't till 3:00,

67
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,692
but I always like to come
to New York a little bit early

68
00:03:32,757 --> 00:03:34,312
and hit some of my favorite haunts.

69
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:37,210
Like right here is my favorite
New York pizza joint.

70
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:40,961
And I'm gonna go get me
a New York slice.

71
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:45,172
Hey, Kelly.

72
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:47,421
- What's up ?
- Nothing.

73
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:49,321
Oh, except, oh my God, Jim.

74
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,841
Last  night, Ryan and I totally,
finally, hooked up.

75
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:54,693
- It was awesome.
- That's great.

76
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:55,812
I'm really happy for you.

77
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,991
I know. And it was so funny.

78
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:58,851
'Cause we were at this bar
with his friends,

79
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,840
and I was sitting next to him
the whole night.

80
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:03,203
And he wasn't making a move,
so in my head, I was like,

81
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:06,102
"Ryan, what's taking you so long ?"
And then he kissed me.

82
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:08,113
And I didn't know what to say.
So I said,

83
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,513
"Ryan, what took, you so long ?"

84
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:12,770
I mean, I just said it to him.
Can you believe that ?

85
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:15,102
Oh my God, Jim.
Is that embarrassing ?

86
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,612
- I'm embarrassed.
- No, don't be. No.

87
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,923
- Oh, thank God.
- All ri...

88
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:21,340
Because I was nervous, Jim.
You will not believe.

89
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:22,591
- I bet.
- I was so nervous.

90
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,653
But now, now I have a boyfriend.

91
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,062
All right.

92
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,360
I hooked up with her
on February 13th.

93
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:35,352
Here it is. Heart of New York City.
Times Square.

94
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,922
Named for all the good times
you have when you're in it.

95
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,541
Most people when they come
to New York,

96
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:44,862
they go straight to
the Empire State Building.

97
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:46,883
That's very touristy. I come here.

98
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:48,383
Great places to eat.

99
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:51,230
We have Bubba Gump Shrimp,
Red Lobster down there.

100
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:53,903
You know. This is...

101
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:56,343
this is the heart of civilization
right here.

102
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:06,543
Guess what ?

103
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:07,801
Really ?

104
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:11,421
- They're from Bob again.
- That's great.

105
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,623
Everybody takes the subway
in New York.

106
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:21,302
It's fast, it's efficient,
gets you there on time.

107
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,431
It's a way to... Okay.

108
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,133
There's a guy pooping in
a cardboard box down there.

109
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:29,823
This is the world-famous
Rockefeller Center.

110
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:31,933
Founded  of course,
by Theodore Rockefeller.

111
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,592
This is the skating rink.

112
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:36,973
And I think they Rangers,
practice there sometimes.

113
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:40,220
And, it's... that's Tina Fey.

114
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,902
That's Tina Fey
from Saturday Night Live.

115
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:46,541
Hello, hello. Hi.

116
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,363
Oh, I'm s... I'm sorry.

117
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:50,553
I thought you were... okay.

118
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:51,563
I thought that was...

119
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:55,093
<i>She looked like...
she looked a lot like Tina Fey.</i>

120
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,913
Hello, hello. I thought that was
Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So.

121
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:02,053
Are you serious ?

122
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:03,413
He was here ?

123
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:05,481
When ? When I was talking to
the fake Tina Fey ?

124
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:06,761
Come on ! No, are you s...

125
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,350
Hello, Angela. Did you hear ?

126
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:14,791
Somebody totally rocked the house 

127
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:16,841
and got me the best present
I've ever gotten.

128
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:17,900
Really ?

129
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:19,510
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

130
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:22,422
- But I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Oh, I did. I did.

131
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,992
I didn't get anything
for Valentine's Day.

132
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,073
Oh, I bet you will before
the day is over.

133
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:30,032
Really ? Well, I hope I do.

134
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,973
<i>I would love to live
in New York some day.</i>

135
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:43,221
<i>It's a big dream of mine.
Work corporate, with Jan.</i>

136
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:47,191
<i>It'd  be awesome.
Go to Broadway shows, eat hotdogs.</i>

137
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:49,671
<i>Scranton is great, but New York...</i>

138
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:52,303
<i>is like Scranton on acid.</i>

139
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,553
<i>No, on speed. Nah.</i>

140
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,102
<i>On steroids.</i>

141
00:06:57,935 --> 00:07:00,820
Okay. Um, I think...

142
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:03,593
that's either the Hudson or the East.

143
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:06,270
So, we're back...
should be back this way.

144
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:11,656
<i>There is a lot of pressure
on me right now.</i>

145
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,080
<i>It's like Michael Jordan
in the NBA finals,</i>

146
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:17,216
<i>or like
Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf.</i>

147
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:19,580
<i>And this presentation
is Desert Storm.</i>

148
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:21,623
And soon as it's over,

149
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:24,103
we will not have to deal
with those Iraqis anymore.

150
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:25,903
Let's do it.

151
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,080
No, that's alright.
Spend the money on her

152
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:32,913
instead of giving it to us.
That's fine.

153
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:35,713
No, I didn't even have
a seat for you anyway.

154
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:37,270
Yeah.

155
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:40,100
All right, man.

156
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:41,710
Okay, have a good night. Bye.

157
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:53,673
Phyllis Lapin ?

158
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:55,200
- Holy God.
- It's from Bob.

159
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:57,883
Man, that thing's bigger than I am.

160
00:07:57,995 --> 00:08:00,070
- No, it's not.
- Oh, zip it.

161
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,001
There they are. What's up ?

162
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:03,253
-Hey.
- Hey, hey.

163
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,643
- Michael Scott.
- Josh Porter. High five.

164
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:11,350
- You know Dan Gordon from Buffalo.
- Yeah, how you doing ?

165
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:13,440
Nobody needs to introduce this guy.
Craigers.

166
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,943
- What's up, buddy ?
- You have been kicked out

167
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,223
of every strip club in Albany.

168
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,690
- Is that true ?
- Guilty, yeah.

169
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:20,930
So what's going on,
what did I miss ?

170
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:23,063
No much. They're,
I guess running late upstairs.

171
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:25,340
So we're just waiting
for the presentation.

172
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:27,331
Cool. Good. Good. Good.

173
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:29,941
Give us some time
to catch up and...

174
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,482
Pam, hi. How you doing ? Good.

175
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:38,271
Listen, may I speak with you...

176
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:40,692
privately ?

177
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:43,212
You can't fire me, Dwight.
Just 'cause Michael's not here.

178
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:44,670
No, Pam, just,

179
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:46,673
Just...

180
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:48,442
Please.

181
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:51,570
You need to get something
for your... girlfriend ?

182
00:08:51,606 --> 00:08:52,590
Girlfriend. Yes.

183
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:55,300
And the reason I didn't get
anything for this particular person,

184
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:56,792
who shall remain nameless,

185
00:08:57,115 --> 00:08:59,341
is that she's not really
the kind of person

186
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:01,513
you'd think would be
in to Valentine's Day.

187
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:04,611
- She's kind of...
- Tightly wound ?

188
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:07,932
Exactly.

189
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:12,221
Okay. Well, sometimes the gift is
really about the gesture,

190
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:15,211
you know, like what it means
instead of what it is.

191
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,792
You mean, like a ham ?

192
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,751
No. Not like a ham.

193
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:25,042
It's about doing something,

194
00:09:25,337 --> 00:09:27,990
so that the person knows
that you really care about her.

195
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,810
- Okay, I get it.
- That you remember her.

196
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,203
That's great. Okay, shut up.
I know exactly what to do.

197
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:37,671
How about you, Craig ?
Did you lose anyone ?

198
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, man. Jan called me
in September.

199
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,861
And she's like,
you gotta fire four people.

200
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,551
And I was just like, what ?
You know.

201
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:48,220
- Did you ?
- No, I just ignored her.

202
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,410
She's the worst.

203
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,002
Well, she's our boss.

204
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:53,513
She ain't my boss, dude.
I don't work for that bitch.

205
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:55,062
Hey, come on.

206
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:56,521
- You know, that's not...
- What ?

207
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:57,931
- Just cool it.
- You like Jan ?

208
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,043
How can you like Jan ?

209
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:00,620
Maybe because she's my girlfriend.

210
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:05,831
Was, or not my girlfriend.
She's...

211
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,992
- we hooked up and...
- You hooked up with Jan ?

212
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:10,842
That was just, you know,
months ago.

213
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,722
It was just once.
God, it's just stupid.

214
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:15,530
Just... forget it.

215
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:18,330
- Yeah, let's change the subject.
- Yeah, yeah.

216
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:22,713
I don't know what he's thinking,

217
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,231
but I would just be so psyched
if we just dated forever.

218
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:27,251
Well, take it slow.

219
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:30,060
'Cause it seems like
a lot of the time,

220
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:31,893
things like that need to...

221
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:36,220
Soda.

222
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:37,492
Cool.

223
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:44,560
Hey, so do you want to do
something tonight ?

224
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:47,320
Oh, no, not while I'm here.

225
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:49,690
I mean, I know that
it's Valentine's Day or whatever,

226
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:53,030
but there's totally no pressure
at all of any kind, whatsoever.

227
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:54,342
- So...
- I can't tonight.

228
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:55,760
I have plans with my friends.

229
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:57,431
Okay.

230
00:10:57,877 --> 00:10:59,211
- That's cool. I...
- Okay.

231
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:01,181
- I completely understand.
- Cool.

232
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,811
Okay.

233
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,143
- Josh Porter, Stanford.
- Nice to meet you.

234
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:27,543
And  Michael Scott, Scranton.

235
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,300
- Nice to meet you.
- Ditto.

236
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:32,141
- How are you, Jan ?
- Fine, Michael, thank you.

237
00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:35,021
Okay, so we are in the process

238
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:38,052
of doing a complete review of
the company's financial strength.

239
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:39,541
All I'd like to do today...

240
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:41,370
<i>Nervous ? No, I'm not nervous.</i>

241
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:42,962
Well, I mean, I guess I'd be lying

242
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,792
if I didn't say
I was a little nervous.

243
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:46,931
The new CFO is judging me
on this too.

244
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:48,840
And, well, it is Michael. So...

245
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:52,051
yeah, I'm very nervous.

246
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:57,373
So with the 12 new local accounts,
we had a total of 4% organic growth.

247
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:59,972
Which was just above
our pre-year targets.

248
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,892
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.

249
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,973
Okay, Michael.

250
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,870
What is a business ?

251
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:16,610
Is it a collection of numbers
and sales reports ?

252
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:21,931
Sure. But as you know,
David and Jan, it is much more.

253
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:44,252
<i>Life moves a little slower
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.</i>

254
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,590
<i>And that's the way we like it.</i>

255
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,310
<i>'Cause at Dunder Mifflin Scranton,</i>

256
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,963
<i>we're not just
in the paper business.</i>

257
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:54,523
<i>We're in the people business.</i>

258
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:59,352
<i>Let's meet some of the folks
who make Scranton branch so special.</i>

259
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:04,510
<i>This is Stanley Hudson,
one of our talented salesmen.</i>

260
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:07,351
<i>An African-American
father of two...</i>

261
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:11,181
<i>Stanley's dedication is no doubt one
of the hallmarks of the foundation</i>

262
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:14,211
<i>of the business we're hoping
to build our basis on.</i>

263
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:18,232
Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage
around the office,

264
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:20,671
edited it together on my Mac.

265
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:23,112
Was thinking about entering it
in some festivals.

266
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:25,711
Probably won't.
You know, not what this is about.

267
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,552
<i>And finally, Pam Beesly.</i>

268
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,820
<i>Look at her. Look how cute.</i>

269
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:34,041
<i>Not bad at all.</i>

270
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:39,661
<i>As the receptionist, Pam is truly
the gateway to our world.</i>

271
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:42,620
<i>Well, I hope this gave you</i>

272
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:46,333
<i>a little taste of what life is like
here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton.</i>

273
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:49,742
<i>What it's like to walk
a mile in Oscar's shoes.</i>

274
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:51,912
<i>Or try on Phyllis' pants.</i>

275
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,983
<i>Next time you're in town,
give us a call.</i>

276
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:56,840
<i>Stop on by.</i>

277
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,891
<i>I'm sure you'll be greeted
by a big smile</i>

278
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:00,361
<i>and a "How you doing, pal ?"</i>

279
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:03,400
<i>Maybe even one of
Angela's famous brownies.</i>

280
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:06,281
<i>And you'll know that you're home.</i>

281
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:17,951
<i>Great Scott !</i> 

282
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:21,243
Questions ?

283
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,110
Okay, okay, thank you, Michael.
That was great.

284
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,472
Yes, thank you.

285
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,863
But, for right now, what I'd really
like to know about

286
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:34,111
is the branch's performance.

287
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:37,200
So do you have
that information as well ?

288
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:41,732
Yes, absolutely, David.

289
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,420
Get that for you. I...

290
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:50,753
-  Can you sign ?
- Yeah.

291
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:53,412
Oscar.

292
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,523
- Nothing for me ?
- Join the club.

293
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:01,483
- Who's it from ?
- My mom.

294
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:17,233
It's frustrating 'cause
we'd be so perfect together.

295
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:20,491
You know what ?
Here's the deal, Kelly.

296
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,061
It would be really nice
if he was into you, right ?

297
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:25,031
It would be great. But he isn't.

298
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:27,681
- You know.
- Yeah, but it would be so great

299
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:29,452
- if he was...
- Well, he's not, though.

300
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:30,681
So you just gotta suck it up.

301
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:33,000
You just gotta move on.
Try to have some fun.

302
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,600
Come to my poker game tonight.

303
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:36,993
Okay, cool.

304
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:39,503
Is it okay if I invite Ryan ?

305
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:48,963
And that about does it. Thank you.

306
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:50,481
Okay.

307
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:52,121
Craig.

308
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:54,721
Yeah, here's the deal.

309
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:57,821
I did not understand
this was supposed to be a...

310
00:15:58,156 --> 00:16:00,833
full on, like, report or whatnot.

311
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:05,792
I'm sorry, what did you think
"financial presentation" meant ?

312
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,151
I was under the impression

313
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,071
this was more of, like,
a meet-and-greet type of deal.

314
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:14,610
So, does that mean that you don't
have the numbers on your branch ?

315
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:16,102
That is correct, yes.

316
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:18,993
Craig, you realize that we are trying

317
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,672
to decide whether drastic steps
need to be taken.

318
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,231
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

319
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:26,743
Well, the point is that this doesn't
exactly bode well for your branch.

320
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:28,132
Oh, man. You know what ?

321
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:31,302
Michael made that stupid movie.
He doesn't get in any trouble.

322
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,631
Maybe I should've slept
with you too.

323
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:40,641
- Okay, okay.
- No, no, no.

324
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:42,383
- All right.
- I'm not, I just...

325
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:45,901
I just don't know what to do
anymore, Michael.

326
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,942
I mean, I'm probably
going to get fired.

327
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,793
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I...

328
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:52,371
Michael, the CFO thinks
that we slept together.

329
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:55,031
Don't you understand ?
People get fired for much less.

330
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:59,122
And I just can't believe
that you told everybody.

331
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,951
And we didn't even sleep together !

332
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,882
Technically, we fell asleep
in the same bed.

333
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:05,172
- So...
- Oh, God.

334
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:09,302
Michael, it was months ago.
It was once. It's over.

335
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:12,992
Do you understand ?

336
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:17,100
Yes. I'm sorry.

337
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:23,313
I'll, fix this. I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to David.

338
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,480
Surely, you cannot be serious.

339
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,421
I am serious,
and don't call me Shirley.

340
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:30,982
Airplane.

341
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,043
<i>Women, are like wolves.</i>

342
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,653
<i>If you want a wolf,
you have to trap it.</i>

343
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>You have to snare it.</i>

344
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,470
<i>And then you have to tame it.</i>

345
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:51,983
Keep it happy.
Care for it. Feed it.

346
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:55,203
Lovingly, the way an animal
deserves to be loved.

347
00:17:57,405 --> 00:17:59,731
And my animal deserves
a lot of loving.

348
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,243
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

349
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,152
- You almost ready to go ?
- I guess, yeah.

350
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:11,933
- What's wrong ?
- Nothing.

351
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:14,483
It's just that I had to sit here
all day while Phyllis got,

352
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:16,382
like, an entire garden
delivered to her.

353
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:18,551
What, you're mad at me ?

354
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:21,481
I mean, I know that
we said no big gifts,

355
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:24,620
but I was kind of hoping you'd get
me something for Valentine's Day.

356
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:26,900
Well, Valentine's Day isn't over.

357
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:31,242
Let's get you home, and you are
gonna get the best sex of your life.

358
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,300
You understand this is 
a very serious situation.

359
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:38,132
No, no, no. Yes, I... Okay, well...

360
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:40,152
All right, here's the deal.
This is my fault.

361
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,261
This is totally on me.
Before you guys came in,

362
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,702
I was talking to the guys,
we were all chatting.

363
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,942
And I made a joke.

364
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:48,162
A really dumb joke.

365
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:50,310
And Craig the idiot
took it seriously.

366
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:53,411
-  You made a joke ?
- I did. It was stupid.

367
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:55,302
And Craig, you saw him,

368
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,291
he's not the sharpest tool
in the shed.

369
00:18:57,997 --> 00:18:59,260
Although, he is a tool.

370
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:02,141
Well, I don't need
to explain to you

371
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:04,693
that even a joke about sexual
relations with your boss...

372
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:06,781
I know, it was borderline at best.

373
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:10,730
And... and Jan
is a fantastic executive

374
00:19:10,878 --> 00:19:12,752
and has all the integrity
in the world.

375
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:16,313
And, I'm really sorry.

376
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,021
It'll never happen again.

377
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:25,000
It's fine. Let's just...
just forget it.

378
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,222
Good.

379
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,812
- Heading out ?
- Yeah.

380
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,272
All right, Beesly.
Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.

381
00:19:45,657 --> 00:19:46,670
Bye.

382
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:53,363
- Good night, Pam.
- Night, Phyllis.

383
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:02,581
Thank you again, for that, really.

384
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,262
- It was very nice.
- No big deal.

385
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:07,063
- Really, sorry again.
- Oh, no. It's... it's okay.

386
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:08,421
It's okay.

387
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,570
So... Happy Valentine's Day.

388
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:13,432
Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day.

389
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:35,762
Oi vey...schmear.
