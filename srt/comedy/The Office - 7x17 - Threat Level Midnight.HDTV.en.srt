Clean up on aisle five.

5
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:51,521
After three years of writing,
one year of shooting,

6
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:53,723
four years of reshooting,
and two years of editing,

7

Did you guys know
that our own Michael Scott

13
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:26,756
has made a movie

14
00:01:26,824 --> 00:01:29,025
and that he maybe
will let us watch it,

15
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:31,962
but only if everybody's
dying to see it?

16
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:33,796
That's... Well,
don't put words in my mouth.

17
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:36,299
<i>Threat Level Midnight</i>

18
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,602
is the great lost film
of Michael Scott.

19
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:40,904
We're all in it,
from, like, years and years ago.

20
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:42,355
It's like a home movie.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,476
Yeah, if Michael Scott
did your home movie.

22
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:48,745
Michael screened
a work in progress for us

23
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:51,548
years ago, and it didn't go well.

24
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,917
We thought it was a comedy.

25
00:01:53,985 --> 00:01:56,169
Everything pointed
to it being a comedy.

26
00:01:56,254 --> 00:01:58,004
- Yep.
- We'd love to see it.

27
00:01:58,089 --> 00:02:02,425
Sweet.
I will go invite Holly.

28
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:04,661
Okay, everyone,
I know we're really excited

29
00:02:04,712 --> 00:02:06,496
to see this movie
that everybody's in,

30
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:08,715
but we have to remember
that Michael is sensitive.

31
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:10,500
So let's stay positive...

32
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:14,003
And no laughing, no comments,
just positive energy,

33
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:16,773
and we'll have
a pure fun day, okay?

Thanks, mom.

35

You never told me
you made a movie.

Mm-hmm.

37
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:23,513
It's got action. It's got heart.
It's got symbolism.

00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:25,782
- It's got you.

You have to let us go,
Goldenface.

Ha!

177

It's Scarn!

That man was
a wanted animal rapist.

181
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,008
We've searched
the whole building, Goldenface.

In the puck.

188
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:25,055
But why are you telling me this?

189
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:28,025
Because I'm going

You just said
the bomb is in the puck?

Yes.

208
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:32,857
Is that where
you hid the bomb, Goldenface?

209
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:38,062
But why would you blow up
the stadium?

210
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,864
You own the stadium.

211

For the insurance money...
I knew it all along.

You will never get away
with this.

213
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,768
Where had I gone wrong?

214
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:04,755
All I wanted was to start
a family with my beautiful wife.

215
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:08,425
But somewhere along the way,
things got messed up.

216
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,561
It wasn't easy for Scarn to admit

217
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,663
that he'd lost
his self-confidence.

218
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,164
And he hadn't, of course.

219
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:17,101
He just wasn't using it
right now.

220
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:18,469
Mike!

221
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,870
Beer me, Billy.

222
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:22,122
You don't look so good.
What's got you down?

223
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:24,742
I got problems, Billy,
big problems.

224
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:27,378
You got problems?
My TV don't work.

225
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,881
I pay 30 bucks a month for the
damn satellite "Whatsahoozit."

226
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:32,816
I can't even get the damn game.

227
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:35,352
Now, you tell me,
what's worse than that?

228
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,354
Don't ever change, Billy.

229
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,259
Goldenface is going to blow up
the NHL all-star game tomorrow.

230
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,329
I see what you mean
about problems.

231
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,398
I know what'll cheer you up.

of bachelorettes over there

bought you this drink.

234
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:55,472
Hey.

235
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,493
Ever banged an entire
bachelorette party, baby?

236
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,079
Why are you singling my line out,

237
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,814
like, a million years later?

238
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:06,684
I'm too depressed
to save the big game, Billy.

239
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:10,120
I'm gonna cheer you up
the only ways I know hows.

Hey, kid...

No, Billy, I haven't done
that dance since my wife died.

I'm really, really sorry.

268

I think I was just relieved

269
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,464
to see that Michael Scarn
got his confidence back.

I've ever seen in my life.

273
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,704
You should enter it in festivals.

- Or carnivals.
- Yeah.

275

No, it's not good enough.
It's not good enough.

- Mm, good?

00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:09,767
Everybody out there says
it's great.

288
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:12,153
- I loved it.
- Did you?

289
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:14,055
- What did you love about it?
- Um...

290
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:18,293
I loved that you got to work
together with all your friends.

291
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,744

- Isn't that so great

when you can all work
together like that?

293
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:24,132
No, no. Holly, this isn't
<i>Oean's Eleven,</i>

294
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:25,600
where you get together
with all your friends,

295
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:26,935
and you just have fun,
and you don't care

00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:28,269
about how it turns out.

297
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:30,171
What'd you really think,
honestly?

298
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,606
Um...

299
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:34,275
Is it... is it
because you're afraid

300
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:35,843
of where this is gonna take me?

301
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:38,947
Because, see, I need you
to keep me grounded.

302
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:41,766
I'm not worried about that.

303
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:46,020
This is 11 years, okay?

304
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:48,389
This has been my dream
for 11 years...

305
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,892
And if you don't think
it's great,

306
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:53,611
then you're basically saying
you don't believe in my dream.

307
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:56,130
It's your dream? You never
even mentioned it before.

308
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:58,566
We talk
about a lot of things, Holly.

309
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:01,069
You know, I was eventually
going to get around

310
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:03,404
to my dream, obviously.

311
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:05,373
11 years
that I could've been working

312
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,574
on <i>the Scarn Nebulus.</i>

313
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:09,310
Well, why do you have
to make a movie at all?

314
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:10,912
Because if I don't have this,
what do I have?

315
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,914
- I have nothing.
- Really?

316
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:15,817
You can't think of anything else
that you might have?

317
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:18,252
I have my book on business,
<i>somehow I manage.</i>

318
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:22,323
I have my HBO Comedy Special,
here I go again, dot, dot, dot.

319
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,509
But you know what?
When I think about it,

320
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:27,762
when I really think about it,
none of those things

321
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,964
are as real to me as my movie.

322
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:32,133
I'm real.

323
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:35,069
Yeah, you're
a real pain in the ass.

324
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:36,671
And now I'm gonna go
watch the movie

325
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:38,106
with people who think it's great.

326
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:40,708
And I'm sorry I called you
a pain in the ass.

327
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,877
I'm angry, and I love you.

328
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:47,615
I love you too.

329
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,418
I'm a huge Woody Allen fan...

330
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:52,387
Although I've only seen <i>Antz.</i>

331
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:55,390
But I'll tell you something...
What I respect about that man

332
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:57,558
is that when he was going
through all of that stuff

333
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,494
that came out in the press...

334
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:02,263
About how <i>Antz</i> was just
a rip-off of <i>A Bug's Life,</i>

335
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,666
he stayed true to his films...

336
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:08,536
Or at least the film that I saw,
which, again, was <i>Antz.</i>

337
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:10,571
Thing is...

338
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:12,573
I thought <i>Bug's Life</i> was better,

339
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,709
much better than <i>Antz.</i>

340
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:18,246
Point is,
don't listen to your critics.

341
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,982
Listen to your fans.

342
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:24,652
Who likes <i>Threat Level Midnight?</i>

343
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:28,389
Okay, well, then who wants
to watch the rest?

344
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:34,962
Michael, you have to get
to that puck before halftime,

345
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,831
or the whole stadium
will explode.

346
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:39,000
I know. It's a good thing
my trainer and mentor

347
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,386
- is here to cheer me on.
- Cherokee Jack?

348
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,939

00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:07,394
We filmed this during an actual

352
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:08,896
Scranton High School hockey game.

353
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,782
They were trying
to qualify for States.

354
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:12,900
Shh.
It's fine. It's great.

355
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,036
No, no, actually
it was really screwed up,

356
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:18,573
because they...
they were trying to qualify.

357
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,741
They were disqualified.
They had to forfeit the game.

358
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:22,810
Undefeated season...

359
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:24,796
That's why there were
so many people there.

360
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,417
- Why is your face gold?
- Why do you care?

361
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:32,320
I'm just making conversation.

362
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,088
I worked in a gold factory.

363
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:36,824
We had a boss
who only cared about money.

364
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:39,444
He wouldn't give us
lunch breaks, so we had to...

365
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:41,028
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

366
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:43,931
- It is good.
- No, no, it's not.

It's not.

But they really
seem to be enjoying it.

Come on.

Please, Goldenface, let us go!
