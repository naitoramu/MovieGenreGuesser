1
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,398
- Michael !
- Oh god, Dwight come on !

2
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:02,884
I wanted to talk to you
about the downsizing.

3
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:04,369
There's no downsizing.

4
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:07,042
But if there were, I'd be protected
as assistant regional manager ?

5
00:01:07,054 --> 00:01:10,070
- Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
- Yeah, so I don't have to worry ?

6
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:12,627
Look look look, I talked to corporate,

7
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:15,397
About protecting the sales staff and
they said they couldn't guarantee it

8
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:18,936
If there's downsizing. Ok ?
But, there's no downsizing.

9
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:21,628
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried ?

10
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,662
Maybe.

11
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:26,412
<i>It looks like there's
gonna be downsizing.</i>

12
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,292
That is part of my job, but...

13
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:31,061
I hate it

14
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:34,128
I think the main difference
between me and Donald Trump

15
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:38,687
Is that I get no pleasure out of
saying the words "you're fired"

16
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:41,508
"You're fired", "you're fired".

17
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:43,701
He just makes people sad.

18
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:45,887
And an office can't function that way.

19
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,864
No way. "You're fired".

20
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:50,341
I think that if I had a
catch phrase it would be,

21
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:53,656
"you're hired, and you can work
here as long as you want".

22
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:55,736
But that's unrealistic so...

23
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:00,910
<i>It's a real shame,</i>

24
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:03,663
<i>cause studies have shown that more
information get passed through,</i>

25
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:05,738
<i>water cooler gossips than
through official memos,</i>

26
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:09,483
Which puts me in a disadvantage because

27
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,162
I bring my own water to work.

28
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:15,108
- Why did you do this ?
- I didn't do it.

29
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:16,522
What do you mean ?

30
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:19,976
The water cooler was
brought over here for...

31
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:21,712
Maintenance.

32
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,776
So why are you guys here ?

33
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:26,240
What's the schedule bud'?

34
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:31,381
Gets that, for operation
moral improvement,

35
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:33,451
Starring Michael Scott.

36
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:35,840
Now I think I had a
little stroke of genius,

37
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,612
in that I have had
my assistant Pam,

38
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:42,162
smile Pam, I have had her go out
and find out whose birthday,

39
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:45,463
is coming up, so we can
have a little celebration for it.

40
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,641
Not bad, not bad at all, all right.

41
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,464
And the birthday person is :
Drum roll please....

42
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:01,199
who is it ?
Whose the birthday ?

43
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:03,702
Actually we don't have any
staff birthdays coming up.

44
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,433
- Next person on the calendar.
- Ok.

45
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:10,049
- That would be Meredith.
- Yes all right.

46
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:14,720
- Come on down Meredith !
- But it's not until next month.

47
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:16,435
Ok.

48
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,329
Great ! you know, it will be a surprise.

49
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:24,011
- You still want to have a party ?
- Yeah why not, sure,

50
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:26,140
go ahead ! Lead a little.
Come on Pam.

51
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:28,725
Come on shake it up, shake it in.

52
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:30,654
Shake it up.

53
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:36,114
Spok, is there any signs
of life down there ?

54
00:03:36,394 --> 00:03:37,937
Well, let me check captain.

55
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:45,181
No captain no signs of life down there.

56
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,230
Just a wet blanket, named Pam.

57
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:54,519
Star Trek.

58
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:57,828
Well for decorations maybe we could...

59
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:00,818
- Stupid forget it.
- What ?

60
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:04,279
I was just gonna say maybe
we could have streamers but,

61
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,172
that's dumb. Everybody have streamers.

62
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,375
- Never mind
- No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.

63
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,766
What color do you guys think ?

64
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:14,497
Well there's green.

65
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:16,778
Blue.

66
00:04:17,318 --> 00:04:18,505
Yellow.

67
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:20,878
- Red.
- How about green ?

68
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,482
I think green is kind of whorish.

69
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,286
<i>This was tough.</i>

70
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:27,389
I suggested we flip a coin.

71
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:30,177
But Angela said she
doesn't like to gamble.

72
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:34,180
Of course by saying that she was
gambling that I wouldn't smack her.

73
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:38,193
These are my party
planning biatches,

74
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,682
Pulled off an amazing
eighties party last year.

75
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:42,524
"Off the hook" !

76
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:45,805
<i>So I was thinking, if you
haven't already got the cake...</i>

77
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:48,620
Maybe going for one of those ice
cream cakes from Baskin Robbins...

78
00:04:48,842 --> 00:04:50,521
they're very good. Very delicious.

79
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:52,720
Meredith is allergic to dairy so...

80
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,860
She's not the only one
that's gonna be eating right ?

81
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:57,968
I think everybody likes ice cream cake.

82
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:01,045
It's not, not just about her so...

83
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:03,283
- It's her birthday.
- Milk chocolate chip !

84
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:04,681
Would be good.

85
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:12,996
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that
it might be a good idea...

86
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,706
if you and I formed an alliance.

87
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:19,584
Because of the downsizing.

88
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,503
I think an alliance
might be a good idea.

89
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,298
You know, help each other out.

90
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:28,044
Do you want to form an alliance ?

91
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,359
With me ?

92
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:34,627
- Absolutely I do.
- Good, good.

93
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:37,449
Excellent, ok, now we need
to figure out who's vulnerable...

94
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:39,078
who's protected the...

95
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,254
<i>At that moment I was just so happy.</i>

96
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:44,032
I mean everything Dwight does,
annoys me.

97
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:46,155
Did you get your tickets ?

98
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:47,775
To what ?

99
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:49,685
The gun show.

100
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:56,987
And I spend...

101
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:59,418
hours thinking of ways
to get back at him...

102
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:01,916
but only ways that would get me arrested.

103
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:06,276
Then here he comes and
he says "no, Jim, here's a way".

104
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:09,493
Just one other thing
and this is important.

105
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,606
Let's keep this alliance
totally a secret.

106
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:13,265
Yeah.

107
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,271
Don't tell anyone.

108
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:17,220
- An alliance ?
- Oh, yeah.

109
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:18,678
What does that even mean ?

110
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:21,416
I think it has something to do with
"survivor", but I'm not sure.

111
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:27,213
I know that it involves spying on
people and we may build a fort, Pam.

112
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,519
Jim ? Hey, Hi Pam.

113
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,590
Can I talk to you a second
about the paper products ?

114
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:36,358
- Did you tell Pam about the alliance ?
- No !

115
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,036
- Just now !
- Oh no, no, no !

116
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:40,255
Dwight no. I'm using her...

117
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:43,313
for the alliance, who knows the
most information about this office ?

118
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:45,442
- Pam ! Right.
- That's good, good, pursue this !

119
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:47,663
I'm trying to,.
Do you see what I'm doing ?

120
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,824
But listen, I'm gonna have
to talk to her a lot.

121
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,534
All right, there might
chatting, and giggling,

122
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:55,025
And you got to just pretend
to ignore it, wipe it away.

123
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:56,961
Done !
All right.

124
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:10,601
Can you get her, she's right there.
That is Meredith.

125
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,916
The birthday girl.

126
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:14,868
And this...

127
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:17,363
Is Meredith card. "Happy Bird-day."

128
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:22,129
Let's see... Jim.

129
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:26,894
Jim wrote : "Meredith I heard you're
turning forty-six but come on...

130
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:29,682
You're an accountant,
just fudge the numbers"

131
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:31,861
Not bad, pretty funny.

132
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:34,519
I don't appreciate condoning
corporate fraud though.

133
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:37,963
Here's the thing,
whatever I write here...

134
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:40,944
has to be really really funny.

135
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,307
Because people out
there are expecting it.

136
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:45,834
I've already set the bar really high.

137
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,226
<i>And they're all worried
about their jobs,</i>

138
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:50,161
<i>you know, it's kind of dark out there.</i>

139
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,827
<i>Can you imagine
if I wrote something like :</i>

140
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,933
"Meredith, happy birthday...

141
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:58,829
you're great, love Michael".

142
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:08,215
They seem awfully chummy.
Don't you think ?

143
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,559
Yeah, what do you think that's about ?

144
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,951
Only one way to find out.

145
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:15,131
Come on.

146
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:20,215
- You are not going to believe this.
- What ? I believe it.

147
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:23,408
- Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
- I can tell from the body language.

148
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,350
- That looks good, what is it, turkey ?
- Italian.

149
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:29,389
Oh Italian ! Nice. Wow.

150
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:32,948
Get the works there.
Red onion, provolone...

151
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:33,864
Yeah.

152
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:36,382
<i>Toby and Kevin, they're trying
to get Angela kicked off.</i>

153
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,236
Good ! Let them,
That's fine it helps our cause.

154
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:41,022
Well I don't know.
Because if Kevin is in accounting...

155
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:44,061
and Toby is in human resources...
and they're talking ?

156
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:45,271
They're forming an alliance.

157
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:47,553
- I love their sandwich.
- I love their sandwich too.

158
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:50,615
- Their bread is really good.
- Their bread is very good.

159
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:52,853
Damn it ! God !

160
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:55,284
God !

161
00:08:58,091 --> 00:08:59,731
Ok, listen.

162
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:03,221
We need to assume that everyone
in the office is forming an alliance.

163
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:05,085
And is therefore trying
to get us kicked out.

164
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:07,573
Damn it, why us ?

165
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:10,284
Because we're strong Dwight,
because we're strong.

166
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:12,591
Meredith, Meredith...

167
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,953
"Mary had a little lamb"...

168
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,417
Meredith had a little lamb,

169
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:19,998
don't bring that lamb to work
or it'll poop on the floor...

170
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,516
Hey ! Oscar ! Come on in. What's up ?

171
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:24,989
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- No not at all come on in.

172
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:28,235
- What's going on ?
- My nephew is involved with...

173
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:31,244
With charity for Cerebral Palsy,

174
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,752
And I was wondering
if maybe you would like to.

175
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:37,244
- You know, if...
- What ?

176
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:38,980
A donate to the charity.

177
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:41,045
Oh God !'Course I would.

178
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:44,469
Get it over here ! Get that over here.

179
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:47,006
- Thank you.
- No I'm always good...

180
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:51,270
For some serious buckage.
Wow ! Two dollars, three dollars ?

181
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,646
People out here, do not care about...

182
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:56,710
diseases.

183
00:09:56,807 --> 00:10:00,125
I'm going to give you
twenty five dollars.

184
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:03,362
That's...

185
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:06,102
- That's, that's very generous.
- Oh my gosh, well.

186
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:10,732
Listen Oscar, generosity and
togetherness, and community...

187
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:14,400
all convalescences into...

188
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:16,773
Moral.

189
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:19,155
That's what I say, so...

190
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:24,885
- Hey Jim, can I talk to you for second ?
- Sure, what's up ?

191
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:28,338
I don't know I'm just
going a little crazy...

192
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:31,058
cause I keep overhearing
all these conversations...

193
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:35,544
between Michael and
corporate about like staff issues.

194
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:38,514
- Oh no !
- Yeah. He's making me take notes

195
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:41,929
on his meetings, and I'm like,
these people are my friends.

196
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,453
- Right.
- But he's all like

197
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,086
this is confidential you
can't tell anybody but..."

198
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:48,778
I don't know I just
feel like I want to...

199
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,071
Just promise me you're
gonna say anything.

200
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:53,536
- I will not. I'm not gonna tell anybody
- Ok.

201
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:55,525
- It's between you and me.
- Yeah.

202
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:00,966
Jackpot.

203
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,387
<i>That was beautiful.
All her idea, too.</i>

204
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:05,476
Awesome.

205
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:07,656
She's so great.

206
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,411
Meredith bad-breath.
Meredith has bad breath.

207
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,074
- Hey
- Hey

208
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:18,406
- You wanted to see me ?
- Yeah. What do you know about Meredith ?

209
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,784
I don't think she'd be missed.

210
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:23,041
There's not going to be
downsizing Dwight, ok ?

211
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:25,694
I just, I need to know
a little bit more about...

212
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:28,048
My friend.

213
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,476
Name : Meredith Palmer.

214
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:32,167
Personal information :
divorced twice, two kids.

215
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:34,732
Employer : Dundler Mifflin
Paper Incorporated.

216
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,492
- Awards : multiple "Dundies".
- I know that, I know,

217
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:40,272
I just, I need something
kind of embarrassing, you know.

218
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:43,296
- Kind of fun, inside.
- She had a hysterectomy.

219
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,329
- Which one is that again ?
- That's when they remove the uterus.

220
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:48,930
Ho, God ! Dwight no !

221
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,533
I'm trying to write
something funny here ok ?

222
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:54,312
What am I gonna do with
a removed uterus ?

223
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:57,784
- It can be kind of funny.
- You know what, I'm on a deadline here,

224
00:11:57,915 --> 00:12:00,442
And just, ok, thanks,
thanks for your help,

225
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,240
I'll work it out, thank you Dwight.

226
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,282
That wasn't a waste of time.

227
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:10,069
Ok, here's the deal, all right.

228
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,558
Pam says that one of
the alliances is meeting...

229
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,230
- In the warehouse during Meredith birthday.
- Oh, my god we have to be there.

230
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:16,745
I know ! But it's going
to be a little tough

231
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,242
- Because there's no good place to hide.
- No no ! Yes there is.

232
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,577
- Behind the shells. Oh my god.
- What ? What ? What ?

233
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:24,625
- I know. I know exactly what to do.
- Great.

234
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:27,239
<i>I'm a deer hunter.
I go all the time with my dad.</i>

235
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,992
One thing about deer.
They have very good vision.

236
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:33,693
One thing about me...

237
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:37,628
I'm better at hiding
than they are at vision.

238
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,008
It's gonna be perfect, ok ?
Centrally located,

239
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,265
Perfect cover, I can hear
and see everything.

240
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,098
Good.

241
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,410
- Michael ?
- Just a sec.

242
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,336
- Are you done yet ?
- Almost there.

243
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,429
Ok. Just a second.
It is perfect.

244
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:53,265
Thank you, excellent, here we go.

245
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:56,805
It is time, thank you, ok come one !
Let's go ! Get the cake, let's go.

246
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,917
Here we go !
Come on come on come on !

247
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:00,847
Be quiet.

248
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:02,964
Wait this isn't gonna work.
The lid is open.

249
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,144
- So tape it down.
- I can't do that,

250
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,819
- then you won't be able to breathe.
- I can breathe just fine, ok ?

251
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:11,286
But if it makes you feel better,
I'll poke holes in the box.

252
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,941
- Thank you. Thank you,
- Ok.

253
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,900
Surprise !

254
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:21,678
- Surprise !
- No, it's...

255
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,629
It's surprise Meredith !
One, Two.

256
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,430
Happy birthday to you

257
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,572
- Find the key.
- Happy birthday.

258
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:34,459
So you want me to stay here,
and stand next to the box.

259
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:37,449
No, you need to go
upstairs to the party.

260
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:41,009
- So people don't notice we're both gone.
- Right. That's good.

261
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:43,420
Can I trust Jim ? I don't know.

262
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:46,256
<i>Do I have a choice ? No.</i>

263
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:48,831
<i>Frankly I don't. Will I trust Jim ?
Yes.</i>

264
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:51,900
<i>Should I trust Jim ?</i>

265
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:53,549
You tell me.

266
00:13:53,703 --> 00:13:56,568
<i>Happy birthday to you, Meredith...</i>

267
00:13:56,761 --> 00:14:02,954
<i>Happy birthday to you,
and many more</i>

268
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,425
- You were surprised weren't you ?
- Yes.

269
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,941
You looked freaked, man,
when we said surprise

270
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,529
You were like, "what ?
What the hell is going on here ?

271
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:21,176
- Ice cake. Why don't you have some ?
- I can't.

272
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,778
- Come on, a little bit, a little bit.
- No I can't eat dairy.

273
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:26,278
Oh right. Oh god too bad it's so good.

274
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,044
That makes me sick.

275
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,458
You know what if I were allergic
to dairy I think I'd kill myself.

276
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:35,018
This is way way too good.

277
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,394
<i>- He's in a box ?
- Pam, he's in a BOX.</i>

278
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:45,069
He's downstairs, in a box,
on the floor near the shells.

279
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:49,167
So you just go down there,
and work your magic.

280
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:57,002
Hey ! Where are you ?
Yeah, we were supposed to meet here !

281
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,768
What ?

282
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,654
Oh my Gosh !

283
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:07,352
That ties in perfectly with something
that Michael was telling me earlier !

284
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:12,060
I just don't know what some of the
people in like accounting are gonna do.

285
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:15,696
It's not specifically that...

286
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:20,654
Hey Jim, good party eh ?

287
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:24,291
Just a little some wiped up you know
a little moral boost, no big deal.

288
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:27,002
Speaking of which I meant
to tell you, very impressive,

289
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:29,712
the donation you gave
to Oscar's charity.

290
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,888
- Was that twenty-five bucks ?
- Well no, yeah you know.

291
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:36,542
Money isn't everything Jim.
Not the key to happiness.

292
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:38,972
You know what is ?
Joy.

293
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:42,995
You should remember that, maybe give
more than three dollars next time.

294
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,447
Yeah well, three dollars a miles
will end up like fifty bucks.

295
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:52,017
So, god, can't even calculate
what you're gonna have to give.

296
00:15:59,977 --> 00:16:01,569
Is Oscar around ?

297
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,651
I just thought it was
a kind of a flat, you know,

298
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:07,622
twenty-five dollars one time donation.

299
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:10,844
Didn't think it was a per-mile
kind of deal, you know so...

300
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,786
- Well, that's what a walk-athon is.
- I know.

301
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,474
It says here right on the sheet.

302
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:19,130
Look look at the sheet, it says
"it's however many dollars per-mile".

303
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:21,879
Got it, yes so it does.

304
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:25,062
I just think it's kind of cheap to
undonate money to a charity.

305
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:28,651
No, no no no.
I wasn't I wasn't, no no,

306
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:30,619
It's it's not about the money.

307
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:34,111
It's just it it...
It's the ethics of the thing,

308
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:36,503
Oscar.

309
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:40,650
How's your nephew ?
Is he in a good shape ?

310
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:42,753
- Yeah.
- How many miles did he do last year ?

311
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:45,502
- Last year he walked eighteen miles.
- Son of a bitch !

312
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:48,357
That is impressive, good for him.

313
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:12,154
- Happy birthday Meredith.
- Read it out loud !

314
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:15,289
Say who wrote everything.
So we know whose is the best.

315
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:17,711
Happy bird-day.

316
00:17:21,046 --> 00:17:24,675
"Meredith, good news !
You're not actually a year older,

317
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:27,887
Because you work here,
where time stand still."

318
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:32,248
- Not bad.
- That was Stanley.

319
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:34,785
"Meredith, happy birthday

320
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:37,968
You're the best, love Pam."

321
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,830
Thanks darer.

322
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:44,788
This is from Michael :

323
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:48,955
"Meredith. Let's hope that the only
downsizing that happens to you...

324
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:51,926
Is that someone downsizes your age."

325
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,034
Because of the downsizing. Rumours.

326
00:17:57,752 --> 00:17:59,716
And because you're getting old.

327
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:03,104
No, I, I get it.

328
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,940
- It's funny.
- You didn't get the joke.

329
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:08,226
That's cool, that's you
know what actually

330
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:10,802
I have a bunch of these,

331
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:13,715
good ones that I didn't use.

332
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:17,550
What was that ?
Oh ok ! Here's a good one.

333
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:21,563
"Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants
her age back and her divorces back".

334
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:25,086
Cause Meredith has been
divorced like, twice. Is that right ?

335
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:26,994
- You're right.
- Is that right ?

336
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:28,623
- Ok.
- You're right. Yes

337
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:30,331
Divorce...

338
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:34,865
Oh ok, "Meredith is so old..."

339
00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:38,250
- "How old is she ?"
- Right everybody, you can do it ?

340
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,151
"Meredith is so old..."

341
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:42,794
- How old is she ?
- "She's so old...

342
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:45,321
She went into an antique
store and they kept her".

343
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:53,829
That wasn't even mine, I got
that off the internet. Website.

344
00:18:54,273 --> 00:18:56,395
Don't get mad at me.

345
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:59,125
- Nice party Michael.
- This isn't my fault.

346
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:04,575
Ladies, not your best effort.
Streamers ?

347
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,797
You could have done better
than that don't you think ?

348
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:11,213
- Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
- Oh, boy.

349
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:15,177
Ok we, all right people
hold on hold on.

350
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:18,944
Just a second ok, I think we're losing
sight of what is really important here.

351
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:21,309
And that is that we are...

352
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,852
A group of people who work together.

353
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:29,217
I was, I really wasn't
gonna with on this.

354
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:34,630
I've made a very sizable donation
to Oscar's nephews

355
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:37,813
walk-athon.

356
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:40,366
Twenty-five dollars.

357
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,314
- Per mile.
- Per-mile, yes.

358
00:19:42,546 --> 00:19:44,658
When I retire I...

359
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,552
I don't want to just disappear
to one island somewhere.

360
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:50,668
I want to be the guy who
gives everything back.

361
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:54,189
A check for the kids, and for the teen.

362
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,128
<i>I want it to be like :</i>

363
00:19:57,382 --> 00:20:01,163
"Who donated that hospital wing
that is saving somebody's life ?

364
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,542
Well, I don't know that was anonymous.

365
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,346
Guess what ?

366
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:10,529
That was Michael Scott.

367
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:13,761
But it was anonymous, how do you know ?

368
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:18,401
Because I met him."

369
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:21,044
Thank you Michael.

370
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,420
Come here.

371
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,652
Don't cash that until Friday ok ?

372
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:30,034
- Really today ?
- Yeah.

373
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,761
- Happy birthday.
- Nice.

374
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:33,999
- I could say something...
- No don't do that.

375
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:40,385
Ok, ok, I have something
that totally tops the box.

376
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:41,861
Oh tell me, tell me.

377
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:45,903
I have just convinced Dwight
that he needs to go to Stanford

378
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,742
<i>and spy on our other branch,
no no no, but before he does so,</i>

379
00:20:49,986 --> 00:20:53,414
<i>I told him that he should die
his hair, to go undercover.</i>

380
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:56,427
If we can get him to
drive to Connecticut

381
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:58,739
and put some bright side in his hair.

382
00:20:58,794 --> 00:20:59,768
What the hell is this ?

383
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,282
What, are you trying to cop
a feel or something Halpert ?

384
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:04,030
- No, Dude no. Dude no ! Just listen !
- Hey hey, come on !

385
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:07,012
God, I don't even know
how to explain this.

386
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,842
Dwight asked me to be in an alliance,

387
00:21:11,363 --> 00:21:13,755
And then...

388
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,974
We've just been messing with him

389
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:18,617
because of the whole alliance thing...

390
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,273
- It's just office pranks.
- It's stupid, it's just office pranks.

391
00:21:22,437 --> 00:21:24,501
Dwight, what the hell
is he talking about ?

392
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:28,389
I have absolutely no idea.

393
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:32,180
Come on.

394
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,903
<i>Do I feel bad about betraying Jim ?</i>

395
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:41,180
<i>Not at all.</i>

396
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:44,276
<i>That's the game. Convince him
we're on an alliance.</i>

397
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:47,244
<i>Gets him information,
throw him to the wolves.</i>

398
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:50,022
That's politics baby, get
what you can out of someone,

399
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:51,990
Then crush them.

400
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,806
I think Jim might have learned
a very valuable lesson.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
