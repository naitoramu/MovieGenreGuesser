1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,216
Did you know that during pregnancy...

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:12,721
...your fingers swell up to twice
their size and never go back?

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,516
Oh, my God! Let me see that.

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,811
You fall for it every time.

5
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,691
Hey! I brought you
my old maternity clothes.

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:28,863
Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.
Oh, those are so cute!

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:33,283
Look. See how they expand
as the baby grows?

8
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:38,789
And after the baby's born
they're great for shoplifting melons.

9
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,169
Good, you're all here.
Thanksgiving, 4:00.

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:49,216
Guess who I invited? Remember
Will Culvert from high school?

11
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,677
- No.
- He was in Ross' class.

12
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:56,557
Marching band, was kind of
overweight. Really overweight.

13
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,392
I was his thin friend.

14
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:05,023
I don't remember. Are you talking
about your imaginary boyfriend?

15
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,193
No, that was Jared.

16
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,198
Wow. Haven't thought about him
in a long time.

17
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:19,913
Will's here on business
so I invited him here.

18
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:24,501
- That's nice.
- Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.

19
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,213
He looks good.
Okay, I mean really gorgeous.

20
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,389
- I still love Chandler.
- Wouldn't hurt you to say it.

21
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,352
Just so you know,
I'm not gonna make a turkey.

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,272
- What?
- Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.

23
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:49,901
- Phoebe!
- Turkeys are intelligent animals.

24
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:54,824
No, they're not! They're ugly
and stupid and delicious!

25
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:59,995
It's not just Phoebe. Chandler doesn't
eat Thanksgiving food...

26
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,831
...and Rachel has
her poultry aversion.

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,418
I had to leave when you had
that chicken.

28
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:11,257
I thought that was because
I put it on my hand and made it walk.

29
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:17,388
It's not worth it to make
a whole turkey. It's a lot of work.

30
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,099
But you gotta have turkey!

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,061
Thanksgiving with no turkey is like
Fourth of July with no pie.

32
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,482
Or Friday with no two pizzas.

33
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,111
Fine. But there's gonna
be a ton left over.

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,864
No, I will finish that turkey.

35
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,994
You can eat almost an entire turkey
in one sitting?

36
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:46,167
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani!
This is what we do.

37
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,378
We may not be great
thinkers or world leaders...

38
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:55,342
...we don't read a lot or run fast,
but damn it, we can eat!

39
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,387

<i>Four wide receivers. On third and 18.</i>

43
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:41,012
Isn't it weird how next year
there will be a baby at the table?

44
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,769
Rachel's. But good to know
where you're at.

45
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,771
- Hey!
- Hey!

46
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,940
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You too!

47
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,067
- Can I help?
- Yes.

48
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,363
Chandler usually helps
but he's into the game.

49
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:02,576
Could you fold these napkins?
I'm gonna go check on the yams.

50
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,580
No, sweetie. No, not like that.

51
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,916
We're not at a barn dance.

52
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,796
Fold them like swans.
I showed you at Christmas.

53
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,591
Yeah, it all just came
screaming back to me.

54
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,639
- So how's the game?
- I have no idea.

55
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,142
- What?
- I'm pretending to watch...

56
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,519
...so I don't have to help out.

57
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:35,526
I don't believe you!
That is brilliant!

58
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:41,323
- And Monica has no idea?
- No. I just yell stuff at the TV.

59
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,327
'Ey! What? 'Ey!

60
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,624
- Your team winning?
- Anderson just scored again.

61
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,668
There is no Anderson.

62
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,048
I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?

63
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,636
I can't help you.
I didn't realize this game was on.

64
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,764
- You like football?
- Normally, I don't.

65
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,851
But, you know, Green Bay is playing.

66
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:14,732
- You like Green Bay?
- It's only my favorite bay.

67
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,413
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Will, I'm so glad that you came.

68
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,499
You must've lost...

69
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:37,337
150 pounds. I'll be on one of those
Subway commercials.

70
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,718
- A pie!
- It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.

71
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,473
- It's no good. Throw it out.
- Meet some people.

72
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,684
This is my husband, Chandler.
This is Will.

73
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:55,730
Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand
but I'm really into the game.

74
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,610
Plus, it'd be better for my ego
if we didn't stand together.

75
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,239
- This is Phoebe.
- Hi.

76
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,535
Hey. Wow!

77
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,082
Well done.

78
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,462
- Wanna give me a hand?
- I can't get over how great you look.

79
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:24,384
- You too. You're so fit.
- I'm watching but I'm not deaf.

80
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,640
- I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
- Great, I love Ross.

81
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,726
Good. And Rachel Greene too.

82
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,524
- Is there a problem?
- No. It's okay.

83
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,695
It's just... God, I hated her.

84
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,906
- What?
- I hated her.

85
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,326
She was horrible to me in high school.

86
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:55,457
But hey, that was a long time ago.
Might be fun to see her again.

87
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,211
Got any cakes or cookies
or something?

88
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,632
No, Will! No!

89
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,427
It's been a while since we screamed.

90
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,680
- Oh, okay. No!
- Come on!

91
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,809
Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!

92
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,775
What are you doing?
You've got an entire turkey to eat.

93
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,612
Let me explain to you how
the human body works.

94
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,616
I have to warm up my stomach first.

95
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,495
- Eating chips is like stretching.
- Okay.

96
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:37,583
- Tribbianis never get full.
- I'm here to tell you something.

97
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:42,171
You can eat and eat, but nothing
will ever fill that void.

98
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:49,761
- Who the hell is this guy?
- This is Will, from high school.

99
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,388
- Will!
- Ross!

100
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:57,519
Hey, you came! Man, you
look incredible! Hot stuff!

101
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,731
- Hot stuff?
- It's good to see you, man.

102
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,776
Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?

103
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:09,281
- I'm a commodities broker.
- That sounds interesting.

104
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,075
- Yeah, it's not.
- Oh.

105
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,412
- But I'm rich and thin.
- Oh.

106
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:20,333
I haven't seen you since
Lance Davis' graduation party.

107
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,336
That was such a fun night.

108
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:26,757
Would've been good if we had
gotten in, but still fun.

109
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,637
We were lame. Do you remember
how into dinosaurs we were?

110
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,309
- Yeah.
- So, what do you do now?

111
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,730
So how long are you in town?

112
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,444
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.

113
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,153
Rachel Greene.

114
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,616
Oh, that's right.
Are you gonna be okay?

115
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:58,955
Oh, I'll be fine. It's just...
God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!

116
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,293
High school was a long time ago.

117
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,589
Look at her standing there
with those yams.

118
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:12,428
My two greatest enemies: Rachel Greene
and complex carbohydrates.

119
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,681
Oh, my God. Who is that?

120
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:22,229
- That's Will, from high school.
- Oh! I do not remember him.

121
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:27,943
Wow, really got that sexy
smoldering thing going on.

122
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,909
Oh, my God. Look at the way
he's just staring at me.

123
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,787
He's trying to mouth something to me.

124
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,666
I hate you!

125
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,128
- Okay, dinner's ready!
- Okay!

126
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:50,215
- Solid effort. Solid effort.
- Oh, so who won?

127
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,760
- Green Bay.
- Detroit.

128
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,513
- What?
- The Lions technically won.

129
00:09:55,762 --> 00:10:00,684
But it was a moral victory
for the Green Bay Mermen.

130
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,858
Hi! Will, right?
Right, hi. I'm Rachel Greene.

131
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:13,155
- Oh, I remember you.
- Really? Aren't you sweet?

132
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:18,535
I gotta tell you, I'm having
the hardest time placing you.

133
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,162
Hang on! I think I remember you.

134
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:26,877
Did we fool around at
Lance Davis' graduation party?

135
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,839
- You are unbelievable.
- Thank you.

136
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:36,970
Rachel? Why don't you sit here?
And Will, you sit way over there.

137
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:46,355
That's it? I can eat that, no problem.

138
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:51,860
- At least give me a challenge.
- This is Chandler's chicken.

139
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,573
This is the turkey.

140
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,702
Oh. How big is that?

141
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:06,375
- About 19 pounds.
- It's like me when I was born.

142
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:12,548
- Who would like some yams? Will?
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

143
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,094
What? Oh, can we please keep
the chicken...

144
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,847
...and the turkey on the other side?

145
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,809
- The smell is just...
- Typical.

146
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,980
- What?
- I said it was typical.

147
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:34,361
Typical of you. Queen Rachel does
whatever she wants in Rachel-land.

148
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,617
Seriously, who is this guy?

149
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,788
Sorry, do you have a problem with me?

150
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:50,043
- I don't know. Do I? Do I?
- I think you do.

151
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,423
You were mean to him in high school.

152
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:59,302
- You made my life miserable.
- I had no idea. I'm sorry.

153
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:03,223
Well, you should be.
Screw it. Bring on the yams.

154
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,225
But you worked so hard.

155
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,894
- Yams!
- Okay.

156
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:15,193
I'm real sorry for whatever
I did to you in high school.

157
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,321
It wasn't just me. We had a club.

158
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:23,452
- You had a club?
- The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!

159
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,330
So you all just joined together
to hate me?

160
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:31,835
- Who else was in this club?
- Me and Ross.

161
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,219
No need to point.
She knows who Ross is.

162
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,354
- You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?
- Yes, he was.

163
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,815
No, no.

164
00:12:54,525 --> 00:13:00,406
- So who else was in this club?
- That exchange student from Thailand.

165
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:04,785
But I don't think he knew what it was.

166
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:09,706
We went out for two years
and you never told me?

167
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,377
You went out with her? We had a pact.

168
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:20,718
- It's not like it was binding forever.
- It had the word "eternity" in it.

169
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,346
Monica? Did you know about this?

170
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,725
I didn't. Is that why you used
to lock the bedroom door?

171
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,480
- Yeah.
- A little relieved, I gotta say.

172
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,985
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
I was a stupid kid, okay?

173
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:43,949
- The only reason I joined...
- Cofounded.

174
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:48,704
Cofounded the club, was that
I was in love with you.

175
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:52,833
If you think about it,
the "I Hate Rachel Club"...

176
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,044
...was really
the "I Love Rachel Club."

177
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,422
But it was really
the "I Hate Rachel Club."

178
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:03,969
So you'd get together
and say mean things about me?

179
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:08,557
- We did a little more than that.
- No, no, no.

180
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,434
What else did you do?

181
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:14,813
- We started a rumor.
- What rumor?

182
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:19,067
Come on, Will.
Take off your shirt and tell us.

183
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:25,032
- Ross?
- It was no big deal.

184
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:31,079
We said that... The rumor was that...

185
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:36,710
...you had both male and female
reproductive parts.

186
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:40,714
- What?
- That's right. We said your parents...

187
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:46,553
...decided to raise you as a girl,
but you still had a hint of a penis.

188
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,597
- Oh, my God!
- You started that?

189
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:54,311
- You heard that?
- Everyone at our school heard it!

190
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,814
You were the hermaphrodite
cheerleader?

191
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,984
Oh, no!

192
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:05,614
It makes sense. This is why
Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me.

193
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,825
Why Billy would just stay
in this region.

194
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:13,205
Billy's gay now, so that one's
not really our fault.

195
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:18,002
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought it might be true.

196
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:22,590
I was afraid that you were gonna cry
and then show it to me.

197
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,724
Stop staring! There's nothing there!
It's not true!

198
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:35,102
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

199
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,536
You are my Everest.

200
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:57,124
- You don't have to finish.
- I do. Otherwise, what's next?

201
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:02,588
Today I can't finish a turkey,
but tomorrow I eat half a Power Bar...

202
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,092
...wrap it up and put it
in the fridge? No!

203
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:11,513
I gotta change my pants. What was
I thinking? Jeans have no give.

204
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:19,646
Listen to what Sean McMahon
wrote in my yearbook senior year.

205
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:24,819
"Dear Rach, you're such a great
person. " Not girl, "person. "

206
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,863
I think you're reading a little
too much into it.

207
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,993
"You're a great person.
Sorry about your weenie."

208
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:41,585
You want me to call everyone
and tell them it wasn't true?

209
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,338
- Yes.
- Also, tell them I'm skinny now.

210
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,424
Oh! Me too!

211
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,178
I won't call anybody.
It was a million years ago.

212
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:56,850
I don't care. You told people
that I was half and half!

213
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,854
I never did anything to hurt you
in high school.

214
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,482
That's not totally true.

215
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:04,984
- What?
- What?

216
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,986
You did start that rumor about Ross...

217
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:12,991
...making out with Mrs. Altmann,
our 50-year-old librarian.

218
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,744
How did you know that?

219
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,292
- It's true?
- No.

220
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:27,256
I saw you going at it
behind the card catalog.

221
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,008
Mrs. Altmann? She also made out...

222
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,304
...with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek
before he went back to Thailand.

223
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,101
In high school you made out
with a 50-year-old woman?

224
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:43,480
- Hey, she didn't look 50!
- Did she look 16?

225
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,859
There's a picture of her
in the yearbook actually.

226
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:52,281
- Wow.
- She didn't photograph well!

227
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:58,120
She wasn't familiar with the process,
having sat for oil paintings.

228
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:04,334
How did this happen? Did she lure
you to an early-bird dinner?

229
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:16,013
I was working late in the library.
It was just the two of us.

230
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:20,184
She needed some help
with her word jumble.

231
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:24,355
And one thing led to another.

232
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:30,610
If you must know,
Anita was very gentle and tender.

233
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,033
May she rest in peace.

234
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:41,872
- Didn't she walk with a cane?
- Only when it was damp!

235
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:47,294
I can't believe you told people
about this. Everybody knew?

236
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:51,882
- You know what? I'm back in the club!
- Yeah!

237
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,051
- I wanna join!
- Phoebe?

238
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:58,639
I never got to be in a club.
I didn't go to high school.

239
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:03,519
But three of us would meet behind
a dumpster to learn French.

240
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,730
Fine, you can have
your stupid, little club.

241
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,401
But what you did to me is way worse
than what I did to you.

242
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:15,072
- You gave me a teeny weenie.
- Yeah!

243
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:21,579
You're silly.
Even with that rumor you were...

244
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:26,833
...one of the most popular girls.
Everyone wanted to be like you.

245
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:30,754
One girl stuffed her pants
with a Tootsie Roll.

246
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,756
Wow.

247
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:39,013
If it weren't for her rumor,
no one would've known who you were.

248
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:43,559
- She put you on the map.
- As a romancer of the elderly.

249
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,938
Mrs. Altmann used to be pretty.

250
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:52,192
The eyes did still sparkle.

251
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:57,572
This stuff is so way in the past.
You've been through so much.

252
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:01,577
You got so much more
important stuff going on.

253
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,246
Can't you just let this go?

254
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:10,461
- She's right.
- We are having a baby together.

255
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,588
Hold on.

256
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,592
- You got her pregnant?
- Yeah.

257
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,386
- Are you getting married?
- No.

258
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:24,307
So you knocked her up but you're
not gonna marry her. Dude.

259
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,523
- Anybody?
- Okay.

260
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,571
It's exactly how I imagined
it would be.

261
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,035
All right, where's that turkey?

262
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:53,462
- Those are my maternity pants!
- No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!

263
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,723
Well, that's it. I'm done.

264
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,227
Here come the meat sweats.

265
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,483
Well, Joey, we're all
very proud of you.

266
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:20,405
I believe we can expect a call
from the president any moment now.

267
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:25,035
- Anything we can do?
- Just nobody press on my stomach.

268
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,288
You can keep those pants, by the way.

269
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,586
What you got there?
What is that, pie?

270
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:37,965
- You want some?
- Just cut me a little sliver.

271
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,261
Little bigger.

272
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,971
Little bigger.

273
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:48,308
What are you afraid of?
Cut me a real piece!

274
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:54,565
