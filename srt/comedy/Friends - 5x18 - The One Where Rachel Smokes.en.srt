1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,005
Pick a card.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,924
All right. Now, memorize it.

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,719
- You got it?
- Oh, yes.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,889
Is that your card?

5
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,858
- Hey, guys.
- Hi there!

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,736
Guess what?
Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.

7
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,738
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,531
It's not for sure.

9
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,910
We met this guy in the park
who thought Ben was cute.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,205
You know, which he is.
He gave us his card...

11
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:43,543
...and told us to bring him
for this commercial he's auditioning.

12
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,339
The biggest commercial
casting director in town!

13
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:52,385
Ben takes one lousy walk
in the park and gets an audition?

14
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,682
I mean, way to go, Ben!

15
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,354
I've been there a million times
and no one's offered me an audition.

16
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,107
It's crazy. We were pushing
Ben on the swings...

17
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,652
I'm always on the swings!

18
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,321
What am I doing wrong?

19
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,908
That.

20
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,036
The One Where Rachel Smokes

21
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,168
- Gotta go. Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

22
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,589
Since you work at Ralph Lauren,
can you get me some shirts?

23
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:16,595
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable
stealing on my very first day.

24
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,056
Unwilling to steal from work.

25
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,808
Interesting.

26
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,435
If anybody gets free stuff,
it's me.

27
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,646
Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.

28
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,565
Go get 'em!

29
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,942
Let's discuss Rachel's birthday.

30
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,404
I say we throw
a surprise party this weekend.

31
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,948
But her birthday's
not for another month.

32
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:40,953
If we throw a party on her birthday,
it's not a surprise.

33
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,790
Great! We can have a dinner party
and invite her close friends.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,502
Ross! We're having
a surprise party for Rachel.

35
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,338
Done.

36
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,757
Great. Wanna do it together?

37
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,177
I'd love to do it together!

38
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,349
They're gonna do it together.

39
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,809
That's my girlfriend.

40
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,229
So I gotta shut it down now?

41
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,315
I gotta go.
I'm picking up Ben...

42
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,943
...and then we're off
to the big audition.

43
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,655
It'll be weird seeing some actor
pretending to be Ben's dad.

44
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,450
Weirder than his two moms making out?

45
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,537
Dad? There's a dad
in the commercial?

46
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup
and pretend to enjoy it.

47
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,044
Maybe I'll go with you
and audition as the dad.

48
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,755
Who better to play Ben's dad
than his godfather?

49
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,550
- You're not his godfather.
- What?

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,720
Are you kidding?

51
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,848
Of course I am.

52
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,853
- Okay, let's go, godfather.
- All right!

53
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,694
They'll let me audition!

54
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,362
Really? That's great!

55
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,866
One of the casting ladies
has actually seen me in a play.

56
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,494
So I steered clear of her.

57
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,663
- That kid looks familiar.
- Oh, yeah.

58
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:10,835
He's done tons of commercials:
Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...

59
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,794
...and for the phone company.

60
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:17,007
He was so good, he convinced me
to switch phone companies.

61
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,177
Chandler was mad.

62
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,056
He's not gonna get this one.
Ben is way cuter than that kid.

63
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,017
I mean, look at him.

64
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,482
That's great.

65
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,485
Wouldn't it be great
if I got to play Ben's dad?

66
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,446
You look nothing like Ben.

67
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,491
I look more like him than you do.

68
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:49,123
I really don't know you
well enough for you to do that.

69
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,505
So it's down to these two.
Nancy, I know you like this one.

70
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,341
I think I agree.
Rachel, what do you think?

71
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,968
Well, that one is pretty...

72
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,722
...but I just love this fabric.

73
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:05,764
Sorry.

74
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,892
Don't be. Part of your job
is to give your opinions.

75
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,853
Then I take credit for them.
I'm kidding!

76
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,357
She is kidding. But don't ever
disagree with her again.

77
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,484
Okay, now I'm kidding!

78
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,946
What a fun office.

79
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,491
I don't know which one.
But I do know I need a cigarette.

80
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:29,996
Let's take a break, go outside
and sort this out when we return.

81
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,125
- You smoke?
- No.

82
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:39,673
My dad's a doctor. And he would
always tell me horror stories...

83
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,554
About ghosts and goblins...

84
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:50,934
...who totally supported
the princess's right to smoke.

85
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:59,568
Then they came back from smoking
and they'd made all of the decisions.

86
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,320
- That's not fair.
- I know.

87
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,199
It's like I'm being punished
for not having this disgusting habit.

88
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,702
Yeah, it is the best.

89
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,412
What if this keeps happening?

90
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,914
They'll be smoking,
making the decisions...

91
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:17,503
...and I'll be up in my office
breathing in my stupid clean air.

92
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,130
And when Kim wants
to promote one of us...

93
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,467
...who do you think she'll pick?
Me or Smokey Smokerson?

94
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:30,390
You can go down there and not smoke.
Say you want some fresh air.

95
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,309
I could do that.

96
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,521
Or you could do
the easy thing and smoke.

97
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,566
Do you wanna go get coffee?

98
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,692
- I would love to.
- Oh, good.

99
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,194
I'm gonna go too.

100
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,072
Oh, good.

101
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,034
Oh, I changed my mind.

102
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,831
Let's talk about the party.
I have so many ideas.

103
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,959
Me too!

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,086
Oh, look at that.

105
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,799
This is a little sketch
of the cake. See?

106
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,592
Some sample menus.

107
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,804
I thought we'd start with
a Tuscan-style finger food.

108
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,975
And for music, here's an
alphabetized list of all of my CDs.

109
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,770
I've highlighted the ones
that'll go with the food.

110
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,233
- What about the dinner party?
- We're not doing that.

111
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,655
Looks like you took care of
everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.

112
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,700
Wait a minute. There's plenty
of things for you to do.

113
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,162
Like what?

114
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,873
Cups.

115
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,958
You're giving me cups?

116
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,335
And ice.

117
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,798
Cups and ice? I get to be
in charge of cups and ice?

118
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,966
All right.

119
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,302
Fine. I will be
in charge of cups and ice.

120
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,265
- I can get ice at the restaurant...
- I got it!

121
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:59,605
- How did the audition go?
- Not so good.

122
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:03,025
Wait a minute.
Are you doing Joey's...

123
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:08,739
..."The audition didn't go so well.
Yeah, it did!"

124
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,492
Yeah, I am!

125
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,329
- Yeah, Ben got a second audition.
- Oh, great!

126
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,918
I had to teach Ross my bit because
I actually didn't get a callback.

127
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,963
You got a callback too, didn't you?

128
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,926
Yeah, I did!

129
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,098
What are you doing out here?

130
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,562
It got kind of lonely up there,
so I thought I would come out here...

131
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,272
...and get some fresh air.

132
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,316
We're discussing the fall collection.

133
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,400
Oh, great.

134
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,069
Anyway, we really...

135
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,197
- Sorry. We're smoking all over you.
- That's okay.

136
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,699
We'll move. You stay there.

137
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,995
I sent the designs to Ralph.
He was excited about it.

138
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:59,582
That's great!
You are the best!

139
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,958
Excuse me.
Can I bum one of those?

140
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,003
Actually, this one's...

141
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,049
What's so funny over here?

142
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,092
I thought you didn't smoke.

143
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:17,516
You know, I thought you guys
meant marijuana cigarettes.

144
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,686
You know what I mean?
Doobies?

145
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,397
Actually, I thought to myself,
"Those guys are crazy!"

146
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,901
But no, I smoke the
regular ones all the time.

147
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,737
We get high.

148
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,700
Me too.

149
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,994
I'm kidding.

150
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,456
Me too.

151
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,210
Oh, God! This is so nerve-racking.
How do you do this?

152
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,047
Fortunately, I don't get
many callbacks so...

153
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,009
Is it a good sign that
they asked us to wait?

154
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,262
Who knows?

155
00:09:56,555 --> 00:10:00,684
We have narrowed it down
to Raymond, Ben, Kyle...

156
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,186
...and Joey.
The rest of you, thank you.

157
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:07,149
Yes! I knew it!

158
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,360
Bye-bye.

159
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,113
So long.

160
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,115
Later.

161
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,744
This is great!
I might get to play Ben's dad.

162
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,454
That can't happen.

163
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,706
Because you have
such different looks...

164
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,876
...we're putting you with Raymond
and Kyle with Ben.

165
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:30,339
So it'll either be
you two or you two.

166
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:36,011
- This is gonna be kind of weird.
- Yeah, it is.

167
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:40,307
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.

168
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:45,896
No. We're like best friends.
That's why it's weird.

169
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,900
I thought we were just talking.

170
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:00,077
Is it okay if I leave this here
till Rachel's birthday party?

171
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,872
- Sure. What's in them?
- Cups.

172
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,918
Good, because we got Rachel
800 gallons of water.

173
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,504
That's a lot of cups.

174
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,589
I'm in charge of cups and ice.

175
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,220
And Monica's gonna rue the day
she put me in charge of cups and ice.

176
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:23,267
You know, I rued the day once.
Didn't get a whole lot else done.

177
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:28,063
Okay, time to bring up
the rest of the cups.

178
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,195
Ross, I'm glad you're here.

179
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,698
- I want to talk to you.
- What's up?

180
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,578
I've been thinking about this
commercial thing. Me against Ben.

181
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:47,875
The two of us competing.
That can't lead to anything good.

182
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:54,757
I think I'm just gonna step aside.
I'll tell them that I won't audition.

183
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:00,012
Joey, that's great.
Thanks, man.

184
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,934
That's it?

185
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,772
You're gonna let me do this?
It's my career we're talking about!

186
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:10,814
But you just...

187
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,401
I said that so
you wouldn't let Ben do it.

188
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,112
If anyone should step aside,
it should be Ben.

189
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,490
- What?
- Chandler, tell him!

190
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,913
Well, let me get the door first.

191
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,583
Hi, no one!

192
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,170
Why should Ben step aside?

193
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,840
It was his audition in the
first place. You tagged along.

194
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,593
You're like the tag-along dad!

195
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,970
I care about his feelings.

196
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,013
What?

197
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,266
You know how hard it'll be on him
when he doesn't get it?

198
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,769
And why wouldn't he get it?

199
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,562
Come on!

200
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:54,274
Have you seen what my kid can do?

201
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,111
He dials phones,
he eats tortilla chips.

202
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,656
He plays soccer
with the cartoon tiger!

203
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,576
Are you saying your kid eats soup
better than my kid?

204
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,495
You just give him a spoon, baby.

205
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,082
Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see!

206
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,334
This commercial belongs
to me and Mitch!

207
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:17,547
- Your kid's name is Raymond!
- Yeah? So is yours!

208
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,345
- How did work go?
- It was great.

209
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,681
I went down there like you said.
And we talked business.

210
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,767
And Kim took my opinions.

211
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,770
You stink!

212
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,481
- Thanks.
- No, I'm serious.

213
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,942
Because I went down
and they were smoking.

214
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,487
This is actually the smell of success.

215
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,739
But there's something different.

216
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh, my God! You smoked!

217
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,035
I did not.

218
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:51,123
Yes, you did. You look
happy and sick. You smoked!

219
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:55,085
All right, fine! But I had to.
I had to do it for my career.

220
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,713
I wish I had to smoke for my career.

221
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,716
That's so gross!

222
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,759
It's not that bad, you know?

223
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:08,015
Yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy
and my fingers sort of smell.

224
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,310
I actually feel like I could throw up.

225
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,816
But you gotta push past this, okay?
Because it's about to get so good.

226
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:22,404
You smell so smoky,
I gotta get up.

227
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,406
I'm not kidding.

228
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,909
I think you smell great.

229
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,708
So we're decided.
No on plaid, yes on pink.

230
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,501
Absolutely.

231
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,339
I'm so onboard.

232
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,426
- Didn't you just light that?
- Yeah.

233
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:44,801
But you know what?

234
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,681
I'm just really, really
trying to cut back, you know.

235
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,017
Good luck, Rach.

236
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,477
I've been thinking about quitting.

237
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,105
Every Sunday night,
I say I'm quitting.

238
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,441
Every Monday morning, it's like...

239
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,775
Tell me about it.

240
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,904
We'll just quit.
Let's all quit!

241
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,238
It sounds appealing.

242
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,158
- I never could do it.
- But you could. Absolutely.

243
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,328
We can help each other.
We could get those patches.

244
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,914
We could be like the Patch Sisters.

245
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,626
You know, we really should quit.
Okay, let's quit!

246
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,920
Great! Give me those cigs.
Come on!

247
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,840
Give it! Out. Done. Quit.

248
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:28,929
My late husband gave me that lighter.

249
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,181
I'm not kidding.

250
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,434
Okay, then.

251
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,480
Mmm... soup.

252
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,317
Mmm... soup.

253
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:49,450
Would you mind watching Ben for me
while I use the ladies' room?

254
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,369
- No problem.
- Thanks.

255
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,717
So you want to be an actor?
I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.

256
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:11,263
There's tons of rejection.
No stability.

257
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:15,434
I mean, one day,
you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.

258
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:20,439
The next day, you're eating
ketchup out of the bottle.

259
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,742
I mean, Ben. Ben.

260
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,746
Raymond, Joey, you're up.

261
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:45,339
All right, let's try one.
Whenever you guys are ready.

262
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,299
Is there a problem?

263
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,636
Well, this is noodle soup.
And I've been working with tomato.

264
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,972
But that's okay. No problem.

265
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,308
Mmm... noodle soup.

266
00:16:56,558 --> 00:17:00,228
You know, that's fine.
But the line is, "Mmm... soup".

267
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:04,525
- What'd I say?
- Mmm... noodle soup.

268
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,944
How's that different?

269
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:16,912
All right. Let's try one.

270
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:19,957
Mmm...

271
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,627
...noodle soup.

272
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,965
Let's do it again.

273
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,845
Mmm... soup.

274
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,098
I mean, noodle soup.
I mean, soup!

275
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,684
Come on!

276
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,271
You know what?
We need to move on.

277
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,523
No, I could do it one more time.

278
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:45,816
Look.

279
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,235
Mmm... noodle soup.

280
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,321
Damn it!

281
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,000
Busted!

282
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:08,589
Come on! What are you doing?
I thought we were the Patch Sisters.

283
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,925
That didn't work out.

284
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,803
We tried to quit.
But it was too hard.

285
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,473
If you started smoking again,
you could have at least told me.

286
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,185
Give me one.
What are we talking about?

287
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,853
Don't you give up.

288
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,981
That's why we didn't tell you,
and we won't drag you down.

289
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,275
Wait. No, no.
Drag me down.

290
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,278
We're so proud
of how well you're doing.

291
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,698
I won't let you blow it.
If I catch you, you're fired.

292
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,702
Go on, get out of here.
I don't want you breathing this stuff.

293
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,788
So, okay. You'll come with me
on the Paris trip?

294
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,376
Oh, man!

295
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:52,090
Check it out.
Cup hat, cup banner...

296
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:57,054
...cup chandelier and the thing
that started it all. The cup!

297
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:00,057
Great job with the cups.

298
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:04,144
Why don't you just go out with her?

299
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,438
Did you notice the ice? Look!

300
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:12,694
We have it all. We have crushed,
cubed and dry. Watch.

301
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,657
Mystical.

302
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,539
No one's eating my food.
They're eating her snow cones!

303
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,126
There are snow cones?

304
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,838
- Go, go!
- Thank you.

305
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,593
- Look, look!
- Surprise!

306
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:40,598
What? My birthday is not
for another month.

307
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,851
That's the surprise.

308
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:48,147
Oh, my God, you guys!
This is so great! It's so unexpected.

309
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:53,152
I mean, Chandler's birthday's
even before mine.

310
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:58,407
Surprise!

311
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:03,745
This is so great!
Look at all these...

312
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:04,830
...cups.

313
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,291
This is so weird.

314
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,418
I was in charge of cups.

315
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:13,172
Oh, okay. Not so weird.

316
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:21,180
Listen, man. I'm sorry
the audition didn't go well.

317
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,765
Yeah, right.

318
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,684
No, really. I am, Joey.
I feel bad.

319
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,438
Look, Ross.
You don't have to, okay?

320
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,356
It's not your fault I suck.

321
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:36,737
What kind of an actor can't even say,
"Mmm... noodle soup"?

322
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:44,662
You know what? Maybe you didn't
mess up your audition because you suck.

323
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:50,292
Maybe you messed up because
you care more about your godson.

324
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,626
What do you mean?

325
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,837
I think, subconsciously...

326
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,173
You lost me.

327
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,931
I think, on some level,
you sabotaged...

328
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:09,687
...your own audition
so Ben would get the part.

329
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:14,900
Your way sounds
a lot better than mine.

330
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,653
It's not that I'm a bad actor.

331
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:22,908
No, it's just that I care
so damn much about little Ben...

332
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,453
...that it was more important
for me to see him succeed.

333
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,247
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

334
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,250
- So did he get it?
- No.

335
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,294
What are you gonna do?

336
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,469
Is Rachel Greene here?
I'm meeting her for lunch.

337
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,639
She doesn't come down anymore.
You'll find her on 10.

338
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,849
Okay, great.

339
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,311
So we talked
about the presentation.

340
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:53,230
He wondered if one person
would be enough.

341
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,150
