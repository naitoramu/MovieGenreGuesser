1
00:00:55,726 --> 00:00:57,424
Pam ! Pamela,

2
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:00,269
Pamelamela Ding Dong !
Making copies.

3
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:03,318
- I'm not making any copies.
- Let's go !

4
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,802
Messages, date, lots to do lots to do...

5
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:08,190
Information superhighway !

6
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:09,784
- Nothing new...
- Let them unw...

7
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:12,103
- There's nothing new.
- That's not what you said earlier.

8
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:15,575
Oh do you want me to repeat
the messages that I gave you before ?

9
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:16,655
For the...

10
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:25,862
The most sacred thing I do is care,
and provide for my workers, my family.

11
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:27,598
I give them money.

12
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:29,113
I give them food.

13
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,148
Not directly, but through the money...

14
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,178
I heal them.

15
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:40,482
Today I am in charge, of picking
a great new healthcare plan.

16
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:43,070
Right ? That's what this is all about !

17
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:47,827
Does that make me their doctor ?

18
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:52,621
Yes... In a way...

19
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:55,263
Yeah, like a specialist.

20
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,236
So which health plan
have you decided on ?

21
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,608
I am going to go with best, Jan.

22
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:05,804
I am going to go with the one with

23
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:08,974
the acupuncture, therapeutic massage...

24
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:11,252
- You know, the works...
- Wait acupuncture ?

25
00:02:11,346 --> 00:02:12,719
None of the plans have acupuncture.

26
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,908
Have you looked at
them closely Michael ?

27
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:19,676
I think it was you who didn't look
closely enough at the "gold plan".

28
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,785
- The gold plan ?
- Yep.

29
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:23,440
I'm not even on that plan.

30
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:25,600
Well I recommend it, it's very good.

31
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,506
- You have to crack this things open.
- You know the whole reason we're doing

32
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:33,443
this, is to save money.

33
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:35,240
So,

34
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,887
you just need to pick a provider,
and then choose the cheapest plan.

35
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:41,863
Well that is...

36
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:44,454
kind of a tough assignment.

37
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:49,597
- It's not gonna be a popular
decision around the old orifice.
- It's your job... so

38
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:51,560
It's a suicide mission, you know...

39
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:54,367
- Michael,
- I, I Know

40
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:56,222
- Maybe, I, I mean...
- There... there

41
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,828
You know sometimes a manager...

42
00:02:58,517 --> 00:02:59,327
like yourself,

43
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:02,545
has to deliver the bad news to
the employees, I do it all the time.

44
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,656
- Yeah, when have you ever done that ?
- I'm doing it, right now.

45
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,081
To you.

46
00:03:10,012 --> 00:03:11,680
Last night on "Trading spouses"...

47
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:14,367
- There's... have you seen it ?
- No, I have a life.

48
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,527
- Interesting, what's that like ?
- You should try it sometime.

49
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,895
Wow

50
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,950
- But then who would watch my TV ?

51
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:21,889
So I like that

52
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,462
Ding Dong !

53
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:30,205
There's a decision
that needs to be made.

54
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,565
And I'm having a unbelievably busy day.

55
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:36,321
So, I'm going to let you pick

56
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,611
a healthcare plan for our office,

57
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,671
and then explain it

58
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:42,538
to your co-workers.

59
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,229
- Gosh !
- Yeah !

60
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:48,872
That is a great offer. Thank you.

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,879
I really think I should be
concentrating on sales.

62
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:55,480
- Really ?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:58,721
I just don't thing that this is
the kind of task, that

64
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:02,092
I am going to do...

65
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:04,079
You know who would be great for this ?

66
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:08,025
Anytime Michael asks me to do anything
I just tell me that Dwight should do it.

67
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:11,671
Yes ! I can do it ! I'm your man.

68
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:13,825
Right now this is just a job.

69
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:17,717
If I advance any higher in this company,
then this would be my career.

70
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:19,581
And a...

71
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:22,108
Well if this were my career,

72
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,809
I'd have to throw myself
in front of a train.

73
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:28,407
Ok first, let's go over some parameters,

74
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,565
how many people can I fire ?

75
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:33,520
None, you're picking
a healthcare plan.

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,915
Ok we'll table that for the time being.
Two, I'm gonna need an office.

77
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:39,397
I think the conference
room should be fine.

78
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,353
You can use the conference
room as a temporary workspace.

79
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:44,940
Yes, I have an office.

80
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,727
- Bigger than his !
- No, you cannot use it.

81
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,859
- Ok I take it back it's a workspace.
- Temporary workspace, you can use it.

82
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:53,106
Thank you.

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,501
If Dwight fails and that is
strike too and good for me,

84
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:00,154
for giving him a second chance.

85
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:03,202
And if he succeeds, then, you know,

86
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:05,734
no one would be prouder than
I am. I've groomed him.

87
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:07,803
I made him what he is today.

88
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:12,500
Unless he fails and,

89
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,363
talked about that already.

90
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:20,772
<i>What did I do ? I did my job. </i>

91
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,414
<i>I slashed benefits to the bone.
I saved this company money. </i>

92
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:28,806
<i>Was I too harsh ? Maybe.
I don't believe in coddling people. </i>

93
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,382
In the wild, there is no healthcare.

94
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:35,972
In the wild healthcare is
"How, I hurt my leg...

95
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,011
I can't run, a lion eats me,
and I'm dead. "

96
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,706
Well, I'm not dead.

97
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:45,233
I'm the lion.

98
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:47,973
You're dead !

99
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,127
There's no dental, there's no vision,

100
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,481
there is a 1200 dollars deductible.

101
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,169
Dundler Mifflin this is Pam.

102
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:03,561
<i>Pam, Michael Scott, how's tricks ? </i>

103
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:06,542
Where are you ?

104
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:09,745
<i>Oh, I'm in my office, I am swamped. </i>

105
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,349
I have work up to my ears

106
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:16,497
and busy busy busy, can't step away,
I just wanted to check in and

107
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:19,622
see how everybody's dealing.
Everybody cool out there ?

108
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:22,149
Actually, people are really unhappy

109
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,580
Dwight send around this memo

110
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:27,407
<i>- And people are freaking out cause...
- Pam, you, I'm sorry I'm sorry</i>

111
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:29,818
<i>I, I, I got to go I'm getting a call. </i>

112
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,317
No you're not.

113
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:36,493
I have to make a call
after I finish, my work

114
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,281
You know what ?
Don't let anybody in my office

115
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:43,661
Under any conditions today I'm just
too busy, too swamped, you know ?

116
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:47,934
I'm unreachable.
I'm incommunicado capisce ?

117
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,255
<i>- Ok
- Thank you,</i>

118
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,046
God here we go again, got to go,
I have to take this.

119
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:54,783
<i>Still no one calling. </i>

120
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:01,516
- Dwight, what is this...
- Uh, knock, please.

121
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:04,606
- Please knock, this is an office.
- It says workspace.

122
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,242
- Same thing.
- If it's the same thing,

123
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:08,629
then why'd you write "work space".

124
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:12,759
Just knock, please, as a sign of
respect for your superior.

125
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:15,643
- You are not my superior.
- Gee, then why do I have an office ?

126
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:18,353
- Thought it was a workspace, Dwight.
- Ok, Dwight.

127
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,238
Are you really in charge of
picking an healthcare plan ?

128
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,839
Yes. And my decision is final.

129
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,183
This is a ridiculously awful plan.

130
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,508
Because you cut everything.

131
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:30,830
- Times are tough, Pam, deal with it.
- You cut more than you had to, didn't you ?

132
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,320
Sure.

133
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:34,106
Then why did you do that ? You work
here, don't you want good insurance ?

134
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:36,690
Don't need it, never been sick,
perfect immune system.

135
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:40,019
Ok well if you've never been sick,
then you don't have any antibodies.

136
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:42,585
I don't need them, superior genes.

137
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:45,469
I'm a Schrute...
And superior brain power.

138
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:49,058
Through concentration I can raise

139
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:52,839
Why would you want to
raise your cholesterol ?

140
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,942
So I can lower it.

141
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:58,940
He literally won't
come out of his office.

142
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,733
He's got to come out sometime.

143
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:07,212
- To go to the bathroom.
- Kevin, that's inappropriate !

144
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:13,202
Michael can I talk to you ?

145
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,289
I would like to, but I'm
really busy, rain check ?

146
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,222
Michael, Michael please

147
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:21,633
Can we talk about this memo ?

148
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,431
- What ? Which memo ?
- Dwight's healthcare memo

149
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,090
- I told you about it.
- Is it a good plan ?

150
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:28,376
It's a great plan !
It saves the company a fortune.

151
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,444
- It's like a paid decrease.
- Michael, he made huge cuts.

152
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:34,608
Cuts ? what ?
Dwight did you make cuts ?

153
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:37,772
- Yeah you said go in the...
- No no no no no. You know what ?

154
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,617
I said nothing specific
because I was so busy.

155
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:43,077
Why don't you go in there Dwight ?

156
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:46,502
and find these people a
plan that will work for them. Ok ?

157
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:49,463
- I can handle it.
- Ok. All right.

158
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,129
We feel good ? All right, good !

159
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,846
Plus,

160
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:00,293
There's some other good news.

161
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,823
Today at the end of the day,

162
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:05,553
I will have for all of you

163
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:09,305
a big surprise. Ok ?

164
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:12,440
So hang in there, and I will
see you at the end of the day.

165
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,228
Right ?

166
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,067
- This is not good.
- It's ridiculous.

167
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:27,739
Did you talk to him ?

168
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:28,907
What was that ?

169
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,250
You let him off all over
you it's just pathetic.

170
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,064
- What are you guys talking about ?
- Nothing Kevin.

171
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:37,164
Do I know what the surprise is ?
Hell no !

172
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:40,415
Doesn't matter, the point is,
they're not unhappy anymore.

173
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:43,569
They're out there thinking "Wow !
My boss really cares about me.

174
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,424
He has a surprise, he's cool.

175
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:49,646
What a great guy, I love him.

176
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,321
I love him. "

177
00:09:55,347 --> 00:09:58,029
Ok everyone, gather round.

178
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:02,640
Step forward.

179
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,540
It has been brought to my attention that
some of you are unhappy with my plan,

180
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:09,006
so what I'd like you to do,

181
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:11,659
is to fill this out and write
down any diseases that you have,

182
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:14,331
That you might want covered
and I'll see what I can do.

183
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:17,192
Okay you know what Dwight ? We can't
write our diseases down for you,

184
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:18,981
- because that's confidential.
- Ok,

185
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:21,489
well I didn't say to write
your name down, did I ?

186
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:23,456
Fill that out, leave it anonymous.

187
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:26,032
Or don't write any disease down at
all, and they won't be covered.

188
00:10:26,186 --> 00:10:28,251
Sound fair ? Good. All right,
I'll be in my office.

189
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:30,354
Workspace.

190
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,489
You know what ? Come with me.

191
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:35,563
We are going on a little mission.

192
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:37,685
"Operation surprise. "

193
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:41,379
Where are you going ?

194
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,128
Headed out. Part of my busy day.

195
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:46,503
You know, meetings.

196
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,640
Couldn't find the knock.

197
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,447
So basically, I want to do
something nice for my employees.

198
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,119
Atlantic City. Ok ?

199
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:01,955
They have this thing
where they send a bus,

200
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,932
Right for free, picks everybody up,

201
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,952
and head down there, get to
the hotel, the room is count.

202
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:09,527
They give you a big pile
of chips, and your food.

203
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:13,940
Everything just kind of a all
inclusive free kind of weekend.

204
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,836
I don't know of anything like that.

205
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:19,694
But, you know what you might want to
do is just call the casino directly,

206
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:22,067
- Maybe.
- Yep yep, yep.

207
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:25,222
I did, so.

208
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,611
Wait what are you writing ?

209
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:41,022
Don't write Ebola, or mad cow disease.

210
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:43,347
All right ?

211
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,681
Cause I'm suffering from both of them.

212
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:48,672
- I'm inventing new diseases.
- Oh great.

213
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,797
So let's say that my
teeth turn to liquid

214
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,402
And then, they drip down
the back of my throat.

215
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:55,694
What would you call that ?

216
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,489
I thought you said you
were inventing diseases ?

217
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:00,074
That's spontaneous
"dentohydroplosion"

218
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,775
- Nice.
- Thank you.

219
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:05,254
Calling to ask you a little
favor Rooney my friend.

220
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:09,971
I'm trying to give the troops
around here a little bit of a boost

221
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,784
And I was thinking that

222
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:15,508
maybe we could take them down
to take a spin on your big ride.

223
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:19,926
<i>You mean the elevator that
takes you down in the mine shaft ? </i>

224
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:21,672
<i>It's not really a ride. </i>

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,431
It says here that it's a...

226
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:26,813
300 foot drop.

227
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:30,267
<i>Well that goes 300 feet in the
earth but it moves really slowly. </i>

228
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,797
So it's not a free fall ?

229
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:36,315
<i>It's a industrial coal elevator. </i>

230
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:40,829
All right. Once you get
down into the mine,

231
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:44,659
what, you got laser tag or something ?

232
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,987
OK ok so I don't know what
the surprise is, am I worried ?

233
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,755
Nooo. No way.
You see I thrive on this.

234
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:54,431
This is my world, this is improv,
this it "whose line is it anyway".

235
00:12:55,551 --> 00:13:00,483
<i>Damn it ! damn it ! Jim ! </i>

236
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:03,065
All right, who did this ?

237
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,427
I'm not mad, I just want to know
who did it, so I can punish them.

238
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:06,778
What are you talking about ?

239
00:13:07,144 --> 00:13:10,694
"Someone", forged medical
information, and that is felony.

240
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:14,090
Ok "wow", cause that is
a pretty intense accusation.

241
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:16,627
How do you know that they're fake ?

242
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,884
Uh, Leprosy ?

243
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,865
Flesh eating bacteria.

244
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,884
Hot dog fingers.

245
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:29,128
Government created
killer nano robot infection

246
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:32,408
- You did this didn't you ?
- Absolutely not.

247
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:33,469
- Yes you did.
- No I didn't.

248
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:35,341
I know it was you.
Ok fine, you know what ?

249
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,376
I'm gonna have to interview
each and everyone of you

250
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:40,270
Until the perpetrator
makes him or herself known.

251
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:44,128
And until that time, there will be
no healthcare coverage for anyone.

252
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:52,270
- Killer Nano Robots ?
- It's an epidemic.

253
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:58,617
The problem Jim, is that people
who are really suffering

254
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:01,921
from a medical condition,
won't receive the care they need,

255
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:06,515
because someone in this office has
coming up with all those ridiculous stuff

256
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:11,061
- "Count Choculitis. ".
- Sounds tough.

257
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:13,581
Why did you write that down Jim ?

258
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:15,981
- Is it because you know I love Count Chocula ?
- Do you ?

259
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:20,260
I think you need to confess the fact.

260
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:21,865
- Yeah.
- What are you doing ?

261
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:23,601
- What ?
- Those are my keys.

262
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:26,001
- Good luck.
- Jim ! Damn it !

263
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:29,968
No ! Jim let me out. Jim, let...

264
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,167
The light green is a green.

265
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:40,885
<i>- Jim Halpert.
- Let me out. </i>

266
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:42,872
<i>- Who is this ?
- Let me out or you're fired. </i>

267
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,968
<i>- No, you can't fire me.
- Yes I can, I'm manager for the day. </i>

268
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:47,377
<i>Clean out your desk. </i>

269
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:49,943
Ok, can you hold on one
second, I'm getting a bip.

270
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:54,872
<i>- Jim Halpert.
- Hey Jim, it's Pam. </i>

271
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:57,351
Hey Pam !
How are you ?

272
00:14:57,419 --> 00:14:58,769
- Jim open the door !
- Good. How are you ?

273
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:00,100
- I'm doing ok,
- Busy ?

274
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:02,039
- Getting excited for the week end now.
- Yeah.

275
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:04,605
- Yeah, what are you up to ?
- I'm not bothering you am I ?

276
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,619
- No not all.
- You don't have anything you're doing.

277
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:08,162
- I have nothing to do.
- Oh great.

278
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,037
Yeah no, this week end nothing
I'm not really doing anything.

279
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:13,362
- Might go to the mall.
- The mall ?

280
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:16,614
- I need new shoes.
- How interesting, what kind of shoes ?

281
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,251
<i>- Hello ?
- Hello.</i>

282
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,516
This is Dwight Schrute
calling for Jan Levinson-Gould.

283
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:24,667
<i>This is Jan. </i>

284
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:28,072
Hi, Dwight Schrute calling,
acting manager Scranton branch,

285
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,207
Listen I need your permission
to fire Jim Halpert.

286
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,976
<i>- Who is this ?
- Dwight Schrute.</i>

287
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,735
<i>- From sales ?
- Well.</i>

288
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:40,371
<i>- Where is Michael Scott ?
- He is not here right now.</i>

289
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:43,130
He put me in charge of the office.

290
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:46,988
<i>Dwight, listen to me very carefully,
you are not a manager of anything. </i>

291
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:50,442
<i>- Understand ?
- That's not entirely true,</i>

292
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:53,567
Because he put me in charge
of picking a healthcare plan.

293
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:55,612
<i>- Really ?
- Yeah.</i>

294
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:56,442
<i>Ok. </i>

295
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:58,805
<i>when Michael gets back, you tell
him to call me immediately. </i>

296
00:15:58,863 --> 00:16:00,156
<i>- Call you immediately, good.
- Yes. </i>

297
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,972
Listen, since I have you on the phone,

298
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,677
<i>- Can I fire Jim ?
- No. </i>

299
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,953
<i>Please don't use my
cell phone ever again. </i>

300
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,689
This is your cell, I thought
this was your off...

301
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,368
Everybody ice cream sandwiches.

302
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:24,956
There you go take one
take one it's all good.

303
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:27,020
Phyllis, safe pass.

304
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:30,126
I see Angela right, Angela !

305
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:34,255
Hey, temp, why don't you take two.

306
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,046
Because you don't get healthcare,
and faster metabolism.

307
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:40,969
Did you get the kind with
the cookies, instead of the ?

308
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,419
Why don't you just eat it ?
Ok.

309
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:46,371
Here you go Stanley the "manly" !

310
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:47,914
- Thanks.
- There you go.

311
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:49,631
This isn't the big surprise is it ?

312
00:16:49,786 --> 00:16:52,139
Because we've been having
a pretty horrible day.

313
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:54,532
Nope, nope.

314
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,085
This isn't the surprise.

315
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:59,249
It's surprising, because
you didn't expect it.

316
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:02,605
But you'll, you'll know
it when you see it.

317
00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:06,541
Michael, Michael !

318
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,256
I tried being rational.
Ok, and what happened ?

319
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,134
The employees went crazy,
I got no hope from corporate,

320
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,108
so that leaves me with no options.

321
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:29,610
I'm now gonna read aloud your
submitted medical conditions.

322
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:33,122
When you hear yours read, please raise
your hand, indicate that it is real

323
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,257
If you do not raise your hand,
it will not be covered.

324
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:38,910
- What about confidentiality ?
- You know what ?

325
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:43,249
You have forfeited that privilege.
I have tried to treat you all as adults.

326
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:46,294
But obviously, I'm the only adult here.

327
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:50,212
Number one, inverted penis.

328
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:59,255
Could you mean vagina ?
Because if you do I want that covered.

329
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:02,208
I thought your vagina was removed
during you hysterectomy.

330
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,971
A uterus is different from a
vagina. I still have a vagina.

331
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:25,461
Ok great. "Germatitus".
Thank you Angela,

332
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:31,451
I'll make sure that's covered. Ok now,
who wrote this, this hysterical one ?

333
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:34,504
- Anal fissures.
- That's a real thing.

334
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,876
Yeah but no one here has it.

335
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:42,148
Someone has it.

336
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:55,892
- Do you think we should go.
- I don't know, Kevin this is important.

337
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,185
I don't want futileness.

338
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,684
- What is he doing ?
- I don't know.

339
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,553
Well ?

340
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,232
Well, what ?

341
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:16,097
- You could be referring to anything.
- Ok,

342
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:17,582
The healthcare plan.

343
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,196
Why did you put Dwight in charge
of that, he did an horrible job.

344
00:19:20,515 --> 00:19:22,405
Dwight ?

345
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,962
- Did you raise benefits ?
- I most certainly did not.

346
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:27,817
come on ! That's horrible !

347
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,647
Thanks Dwight for a crappy plan.

348
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,145
Damn.

349
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:38,206
I wish I had time to change it, but...

350
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:41,814
Jan needs it by five and...
What time is it ? What time is it ?

351
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,814
It's after five.

352
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,582
It's awful.

353
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,081
So well, ok.

354
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:52,917
See you guys on Monday.

355
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,772
What about the surprise ?

356
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:58,270
Yes exactly.

357
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:01,338
Thank you Angela
for reminding me.

358
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:03,827
Terrific.

359
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,084
Before I tell everybody
what the big surprise is,

360
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:09,894
would you like to tell me,
what you think the big surprise is ?

361
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:13,222
We all think you don't have a surprise.

362
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,907
All right, I have some news for you.
There is a big surprise.

363
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:21,122
And... here it is, here we go...

364
00:20:21,364 --> 00:20:22,984
And

365
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,974
the big surprise is...

366
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:29,881
Drum roll.

367
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:53,717
<i>When I am backed into a corner,
that is when I come alive. </i>

368
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,344
See I learned improv
from the greats, like...

369
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:00,257
Drew Carey and Ryan Styles.

370
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:16,058
Robin Williams, oh man, would
I love to go head to head with him.

371
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:20,129
That would be exciting !
"Hi, I'm Mork from Ork. "

372
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:22,936
"Well I'm Bork for Smork".

373
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:25,855
"anounanouzoubliblublu"

374
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,809
Jan wants you to call her.
