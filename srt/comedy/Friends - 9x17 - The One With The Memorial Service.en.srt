1
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,506
- You ready to go?
- Let me just finish this.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,925
Hey, Ross. Check this out.

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,391
Yeah, I can't do that.

4
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,768
- What are you doing?
- Have you seen this?

5
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,355
It's our new alumni website
for college.

6
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:25,275
You can post messages for people,
let everyone know what you're up to.

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:29,863
Oh, great. A faster way to tell people
that I'm unemployed and childless.

8
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:33,033
It's actually interesting to find
out what people are doing.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,660
Remember Andrea Rich?

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,995
That tall girl that wouldn't sleep
with you?

11
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:41,959
Well, her Internet company went under,
and she lost an ear in a boating accident.

12
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,796
Bet she'd sleep with you now.

13
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,800
No, I already e-mailed her.

14
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,803
Let me see what you wrote
about yourself.

15
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,974
"Doctor of paleontology, two kids."

16
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,769
Wait a second. You split with Carol
because you had different interests?

17
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:05,399
I think you split with Carol because
you had one very similar interest.

18
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,403
I'm gonna finish this later, okay?
Let me just grab my coat.

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,697
Okay!

20
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,161
What, did you think you learned how
to do it in the last two minutes?

21
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:25,419
Maybe we finish this for him.

22
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:32,801
Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.

23
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,471
She is now my girlfriend.

24
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:42,895
I don't care what society says,
it's the best sex I've ever had.

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,524
- And send.
- No, no... You can't do that to him.

26
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,735
- All right, let's go.
- Dude!

27
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:54,407
I think you made it clear you can't be
trusted with the ball inside the house.

28
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,166
And send.

29
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,419
The One With the Memorial Service

32
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,000
Hey. How was basketball?

33
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,087
It was fun. Right up until Chandler
got a finger in the eye.

34
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,131
Oh, no! Who did that?

35
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,675
Chandler. Yeah.

36
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,968
Hey!

37
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,096
- Rach?
- Yeah?

38
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,265
What's Huggsy doing
in the crib with Emma?

39
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:07,604
She was just crawling around and found
him, so I just let her sleep with him.

40
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:11,483
- That's all right, isn't it?
- Of course. Yeah.

41
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,905
It's a stuffed animal, you know?
It's for kids. Not for adults.

42
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,782
I know that.

43
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,869
Joey, you're sure? I mean,
I know how much you love him.

44
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:27,249
Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?
I do not love Huggsy.

45
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,252
I like him a normal amount.

46
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,006
All right.
Well, Emma loves him.

47
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,634
Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she?
He's a wonderful person!

48
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,392
- Hi.
- Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?

49
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,854
- You feeling better?
- Breaking up sucks.

50
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,858
- Oh, I really miss Mike.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

51
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,861
I've tried everything to feel better.
I even tried writing a song about it...

52
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:00,157
...but I can't think of anything
that rhymes with:

53
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:06,122
Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need
your help getting through this.

54
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,499
You're saying you're
not gonna need my help?

55
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,918
No. When I get to the point
where I'm ready...

56
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,462
...to hear cruel, mocking jokes
about Mike, I'm gonna come to you.

57
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,592
Oh, good, because I've already thought
of three. Four! I just thought of a fourth!

58
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,138
Okay. I mean, I know
I did the right thing.

59
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,848
Mike never wants
to get married...

60
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,059
...and I shouldn't be in a relationship
that has no future.

61
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,562
But pretty soon,
I'm gonna miss him so much...

62
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,689
...I'm gonna want to see him again,
and you have to stop me.

63
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,150
Okay, you got it.

64
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,572
Unless...
Am I being too crazy about this?

65
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:45,577
All right, so there's no future. But that
doesn't mean we still can't have fun.

66
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,498
- You know what? Forget what I said.
- Really?

67
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,377
- All right, if that's what you want.
- That was a test, and you just failed.

68
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,422
Damn it! Rookie mistake!

69
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,055
I have sex with dinosaurs?

70
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,351
I believe I read that somewhere.

71
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,938
Not only is it not funny,
it's physically impossible! Okay?

72
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:18,277
Depending on the species, I'd have
to have a 6-foot-long... It's not funny!

73
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,073
I respectfully disagree.

74
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,617
I can't believe you put that
on my alumni page.

75
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,453
- Who cares? Nobody reads those.
- You better hope not...

76
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,913
...because I just read what
you put on your page.

77
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,459
- I don't have a page.
- Oh, I respectfully disagree!

78
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,647
"Look at you. All sweet and innocent",
<i>sleeping like an angel.</i>

79
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,818
<i>With Emma's chubby little hands</i>
<i>wrapped around you.</i>

80
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:05,199
It's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.

81
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,745
Step away from the crib!
I have a weapon!

82
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:13,666
It's okay! It's okay, Rach!
It's me! Put down the scrunchie.

83
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,294
- What are you doing?
- Well, I heard Emma stirring...

84
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:21,006
...so I came in to make sure
she could reach Huggsy.

85
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,719
Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that
I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

86
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,473
Okay, there you go, sweetie.

87
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,933
This isn't over!

88
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,482
Wait a second. Why would
Ross tell everyone in your class...

89
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:43,528
...that you are "as gay
as the day is long"?

90
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,658
Because I told everyone
he slept with dinosaurs.

91
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:53,121
Well, that's clearly a joke.
This could easily be true.

92
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,877
Would you get that, please? People have
been calling to congratulate me all day.

93
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,465
Hello?

94
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:07,678
No, he's not here.
Yeah, this is his wife.

95
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,849
Yeah. Well, it came
as quite a shock to me too!

96
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:17,687
Well, I guess I should've known. He just
kept making me watch "Moulin Rouge."

97
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,482
Hang up! Hang up!

98
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,650
And that was a great movie.

99
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,363
I'm so gonna get back at Ross.

100
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,907
Oh, yeah, this'll show him.
Here we go.

101
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,453
- What are you doing?
- Oh, you'll see, my friend!

102
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,501
I'm dead?

103
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,547
And so young.

104
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,009
Posting that I died?
That really isn't funny.

105
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,179
Well, how you died was funny.

106
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,056
Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?

107
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,978
It kills over one Americans
every year.

108
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,024
Unbelievable. My classmates
are gonna think I'm dead.

109
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,277
My professors. My parents
are gonna get phone calls!

110
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,446
You're messing with
people's feelings here.

111
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,241
You wanna talk about people's feelings?
You should have heard how hurt...

112
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:15,454
...Professor Stern was when I told him
I wouldn't be able to go to Key West!

113
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,208
You've really crossed a line here.
But that's okay.

114
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,168
Because I'm on my way
to buy some Photoshop software...

115
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,921
...and a stack of gay porn.

116
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:28,216
That's right. Your coming-out
is about to get real graphic!

117
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,766
God, I wish Mike were here.

118
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:39,395
Okay, if Mike were here, what
would the two of you be doing?

119
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,566
What are you, animals?
It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

120
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,404
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him.
There's no harm in that.

121
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,992
That's how it starts. "I don't need
to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing.

122
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,246
Why not just a little sliver?"
Or, "Okay, just a slice or two."

123
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,624
The next thing you know,
you're 210 pounds...

124
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,585
...and you get wedged in going
down the tunnel slide!

125
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,423
Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.

126
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,842
But look, if you talk to him,
then you're gonna want to see him.

127
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,762
And if you see him, you're gonna
wanna get back together.

128
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,682
And I know that's not what you want.

129
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,686
All right, so give me your phone.

130
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,813
Here.

131
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,234
- And now your cell.
- Okay.

132
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,615
There you go.

133
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,667
- This is your cell phone?
- Yes.

134
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,213
This is your current cell phone?

135
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,133
Yes. It reminds me
of a simpler time.

136
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,180
Phoebe? Where's your purse?

137
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,266
- Hey! No!
- No!

138
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,226
- Give it to me!
- You can't have it!

139
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,478
- Give it to me!
- No!

140
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,566
- I'll go in there!
- Oh, yeah.

141
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,943
- Phoebe, come here!
- No!

142
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:13,071
- Give it to me!
- You're crazy!

143
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:18,619
Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!

144
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,544
Hey, look who's here. It's Joey.
And he brought home a friend.

145
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,881
Emma's right here. You promised not to
bring girls home in the middle of the day!

146
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,967
No, no, no, it's not a girl. It's...

147
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,887
...a brand-new Huggsy!

148
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,348
Oh! Oh, that's so great!
Now Emma has two Huggsies!

149
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,603
No, no. Oh, no.
No, Emma has one Huggsy.

150
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,480
The new Huggsy.

151
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:50,234
The other Huggsy, I don't know,
I guess I'll just take him back.

152
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,280
You know what? When I was a little girl,
I had a little pink pony named Cotton.

153
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:59,952
Oh, I loved her so much. I took her
everywhere. I would braid her tail...

154
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,078
Make the transfer!

155
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,170
Should I be concerned that a button fell
off the old Huggsy and I can't find it?

156
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,300
No, don't worry about it.
I swallowed that years ago. Hey!

157
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,137
Oh, what? I don't think
she likes the new Huggsy.

158
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,182
- But he's the same.
- I think she wants the old one back.

159
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,394
- Yeah, but he's the same.
- Joey, come on.

160
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,230
But he's the same!

161
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,318
You're not the same.

162
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,617
You know, it's a lot
less surprising to do that...

163
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,077
...after I've buzzed you
into the building.

164
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,707
So, Phoebe, why are there
men's shoes by the door?

165
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,002
Those are my shoes.

166
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:53,297
Well, when you get over this breakup,
we need to go shopping.

167
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,926
Look, Monica, I really appreciate
you checking in on me.

168
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,553
- But I'm actually feeling a lot better.
- You are?

169
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,181
Yeah, I just kind of want
to be alone right now.

170
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,937
- Who's that?
- I ordered Chinese food.

171
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,193
What are the chances?!

172
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,321
One billion Chinese people,
and they send Mike!

173
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,579
- What are you doing here?
- Phoebe called me.

174
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,332
- Phoebe!
- I'm sorry. I broke down.

175
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,791
I wanted to see him.

176
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,085
Damn it, Phoebe,
how did you even call him?

177
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,546
There's a speakerphone
on the base unit.

178
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,133
Base unit. Think, Monica, think!

179
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,636
- Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she...
- This doesn't concern you!

180
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,474
Sorry. I guess I was thrown off
by the mention of my name.

181
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,438
Look, guys, you can't do this.

182
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,023
It's gonna make getting
over each other harder.

183
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:57,319
Not if nothing happens.
Why can't we just hang out as friends?

184
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,616
Sure. If you're just gonna hang out
as friends, then maybe I'll join you.

185
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,577
You know, I'm your friend
and Mike's friend.

186
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,916
Sit down.

187
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,714
Make room for your friend.

188
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,601
- So how have you been?
- I've been pretty good.

189
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:38,360
- You look really beautiful.
- Thanks. You look good too.

190
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:43,282
No, no, no. This is dangerous territory.
Keep it clean.

191
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,160
So how's the piano playing going?

192
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,705
Actually, I've been playing a lot
of love songs lately.

193
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:53,751
- I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

194
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:01,508
You know, on the way over here,
I saw this drunk guy throw up.

195
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,553
And then a pigeon ate it.

196
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,101
Hey. Ross.

197
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,480
Look, I just wanted to apologize.

198
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,608
Don't tell me you actually made
those gay pictures of me.

199
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,028
Check this out.

200
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,531
So that's what I'd look like
if I worked out.

201
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,786
And was being serviced
by a policeman.

202
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,121
You're not gonna actually
send these out, are you?

203
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,292
Actually, I don't need to, because your
little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work.

204
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,211
Okay? There were no responses.

205
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:42,007
Nobody posted anything, nobody called
my parents, so the joke is on you.

206
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:47,221
Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,
nobody cares that I'm dead.

207
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,809
Oh, my God.

208
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:56,647
- Nobody cares that I'm dead?
- Oh, come on, you know that's not true.

209
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,232
What are you talking about?
You get 60 responses...

210
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,109
...just for coming
out of the closet.

211
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,571
I didn't get one response,
and I'm dead!

212
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:09,159
Well, the gay community is a lot more
vocal than the dead community.

213
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:15,249
I can't believe this. Not even my geology
lab partner. And I carried that guy!

214
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,334
Look, let's think about this, okay?

215
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:20,713
You think people are gonna disturb
your family at this tragic time?

216
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,632
That people are gonna post condolences
on a website?

217
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,592
This isn't about people not caring.

218
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,764
This is about people not having
a decent outlet for their grief.

219
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,642
- You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
- Right.

220
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:38,522
I'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial
service, tons of people would come.

221
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,483
Exactly!

222
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,695
Ross, what are you doing?

223
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,198
You're having a memorial service
for yourself?

224
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,744
No, that would be stupid.
You're having it for me.

225
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:56,165
- Ross, don't press send. Don't press...
- No, too late. Too late. It's sent.

226
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,584
Sorry, so is that picture
of you and the policeman.

227
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,381
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.
Have you seen Huggsy?

228
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,509
Original or crappy?

229
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:10,387
- Original.
- No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.

230
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,766
Then what's that big lump
under your covers?

231
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:17,936
- It's Monica, okay?
- That's not Monica!

232
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,481
All right, fine!
It's original Huggsy!

233
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,652
I know Emma wants him,
but he's mine and I need him.

234
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,530
She's being unreasonable.

235
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:32,159
Joey, there is a reason that Emma
loves that stupid penguin so much!

236
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,452
Oh, don't cover its ears!

237
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,916
It's because it reminds her
of her Uncle Joey.

238
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,501
- It does?
- Yeah.

239
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:46,548
And she's comforted by him because
she loves her Uncle Joey so much.

240
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:50,594
- Really? She loves me?
- Oh, yeah.

241
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,763
But you know what?
If you need Huggsy, don't worry.

242
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,143
Emma will totally understand.
I won't, but whatever.

243
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,897
Okay, wait a minute, Rach.
I mean, if...

244
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:05,693
If Huggsy means that much
to Emma, then...

245
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,360
Well, she can have him.

246
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,489
Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey
would step up.

247
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,659
- Look, Emma. Look who's back.
- No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it!

248
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,746
Are you...? You're gonna take
Huggsy away from a little child?

249
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,332
How do you think I got him
in the first place?

250
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,254
All right, you two.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

251
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,505
I don't want anything going
on while I'm gone.

252
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,716
Here's a few things you can discuss:

253
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:34,137
Mucus, fungus, and the idea
of me and Ross doing it.

254
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,101
I've missed you so much.

255
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,146
I won't ask you to get back together.
I know we want different things, but...

256
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,899
- Just to be with you one more night.
- I want that too.

257
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:50,237
- But is that gonna make it too hard?
- It can't be any harder than this.

258
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:54,574
I mean, if I had known the last time
I saw you would be the last time, l...

259
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,744
I would have stopped to memorize
your face, the way you moved.

260
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,122
Everything about you.

261
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:04,376
If I had known the last time I kissed
you would be the last time...

262
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,004
...I never would have stopped.

263
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,841
Kiss him, you fool!

264
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,927
- What?
- Didn't you hear that speech?

265
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,346
If you don't kiss him,
then I will.

266
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,683
I missed you so much.

267
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,896
- I knew you'd be here!
- Crap.

268
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,899
- Who is this?
- My friend Manny.

269
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:31,069
I asked him to keep me
away from you.

270
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:36,074
- Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.
- Well, you're not doing a very good job.

271
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,785
- Excuse me?
- What's with the kissing?

272
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,538
Hey, at least I knew
where my guy was.

273
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,875
Yeah, thank God you were here
to oversee all the kissing.

274
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,545
- You didn't hear the speech.
- I've heard the speech.

275
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,965
If he knew it was gonna
be the last time...

276
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,508
Hey, it was very moving.
You're just heartless!

277
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,094
- You're weak!
- You're weird!

278
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,931
Your pants are undone.

279
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,769
Where'd they go?

280
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:08,065
- Damn it.
- Well, we blew it.

281
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,401
I blame myself.

282
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,819
And I blame you too.

283
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,955
It's been an hour, and not one
of my classmates has shown up?

284
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:27,959
I tell you, when I actually die, some
people are gonna get seriously haunted.

285
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,546
There you go. Someone came.

286
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,966
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go hide.

287
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,594
This is so exciting.
My first mourner!

288
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:43,017
Hi. Glad you could come.

289
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,812
- Please come in.
- Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?

290
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:51,400
- I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your class.
- Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.

291
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:55,279
Thanks. I'm so sorry
about Ross, it's...

292
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,114
No, at least he died doing
what he loved.

293
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:00,576
Watching blimps.

294
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,459
- Who is it?
- You know some guy, Tom Gordon?

295
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,085
I don't remember him.

296
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,964
But then again,
I touched so many lives.

297
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,801
So did you know Ross well?

298
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:21,138
Actually, I barely knew him.
I came because I heard Chandler's news.

299
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,933
Do you know if he's seeing anyone?

300
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:32,649
- Yes, he is. Me.
- What? You mean...?

301
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,739
Can I ask you a personal question?
How do you shave your beard so close?

302
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,243
Okay, Tommy!
That's enough mourning for you.

303
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,788
Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.

304
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:50,750
- Hey, listen. Call me.
- Okay.

305
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:57,883
- I'm dead and no one cares?
- I look like a man?

306
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:01,262
Please, one ridiculous problem
at a time.

307
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,222
This isn't ridiculous.
Look around, no one's here.

308
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:08,143
You gave them one day's notice. Not
everyone checks the website every day.

309
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,814
And Monica, it's probably
the way you stand!

310
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,360
I guess you're right.
Still, somebody must have seen it.

311
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:20,573
I went to that school for four years
and I didn't have an impact on anyone?

312
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:24,034
Well, that's not true.
You had an impact on me.

313
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,912
I mean, it's 15 years later
and we're still best friends.

314
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,790
Doesn't that count for something?

315
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:37,089
Oh, great, more party boys
for Chandler.

316
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:41,051
I'm sure it's somebody for you.
Now go hide.

317
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:48,392
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's
memorial service.

318
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,771
- Kori? Kori Weston?
- Yeah.

319
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:56,025
- You look amazing.
- And you are?

320
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,778
Chandler. Chandler Bing.
And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at all.

321
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,947
You are married, though.

322
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:05,326
Don't listen to him.
He's in a really bad mood.

323
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:12,416
I can't believe that Ross is gone.
It is just so sad.

324
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,668
I didn't know Ross and you
were so close.

325
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:18,714
Oh, we weren't. But we had one class
together. He was such a great guy.

326
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:22,468
And he talked so passionately
about science.

327
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:26,263
- I always remembered him.
- I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.

328
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,223
And if heaven has a door...

329
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,185
...I'm sure he's pressing his ear
up against it and listening intently.

330
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:38,025
I thought so many times about
calling him and asking him out.

331
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,069
I guess I really missed my chance.

332
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,779
No, you didn't!

333
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:47,201
I'm still alive!

334
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:50,121
Kori, I know this
is a big surprise for you.

335
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:54,458
It's a long story. But the things you
just said really made my day.

336
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,794
The fact that you're here
means more to me...

337
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,671
...than if this room were filled
with people.

338
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,842
You sick freak! Who does that?

339
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,802
I can't believe I had a crush on you.

340
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,891
Did you hear that?

341
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,771
Kori Weston had a crush on me!

342
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,573
No, Mom, I am not dead.

343
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,285
I know it's not something
to kid about.

344
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:35,373
It was just a practical joke between
Chandler and me, but it's over, okay?

345
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:40,629
Actually, no. Even if I had died,
you would not be left childless.

346
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:44,091
Monica?

347
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:50,389
