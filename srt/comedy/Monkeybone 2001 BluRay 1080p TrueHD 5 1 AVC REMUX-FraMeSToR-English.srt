1
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:57,864
Back, Stanley.
You are going back,

2
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:00,075
back to when it all began.

3
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:02,744
Are you back yet?

4
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,913
Get back!
We haven't got all day!

5
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,127
It was third grade.

6
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:11,795
The teacher was Miss Hudlapp.

7
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:13,755
She was kind of squat and lumpy.

8
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:15,090
She smelled funny.

9
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:16,508
But she was kind.

10
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:19,261
Class! How many times
have I told you

11
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:21,096
in this class, we do not pound

12
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:23,432
tenpenny nails
into Stanley's head!

13
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:24,742
Stanley: You know how
some teachers

14
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:27,102
have those kind of flaps
on their arms?

15
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,105
Those big sacks of limp flab
that, like, dangle?

16
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:34,484
It sounds weird,
but for some reason

17
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:37,154
as I watched those
big old flaps of hers,

18
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,325
I began to feel oddly aroused.

19
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,583
And then... the horror began.

20
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:02,471
Class:!

21
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:05,807
Young man,
what's that in your lap?

22
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:08,268
Stanley: It was useless,

23
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:10,896
like putting a baseball cap
on the Washington Monument.

24
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:13,982
And then, all at once,
there he was.

25
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:16,318
Monkeybone!

26
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:19,780
Hey, baby, I love your way.

27
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:38,006
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

28
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:39,841
How about it, Doc?
Can you help me?

29
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:42,636
All in good time, my boy.
All in good time.

30
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:46,848
What a loser!

31
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:49,059
Roll out the wacky wagons!

32
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:53,980
That was hilarious.

33
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:01,530
Well, that's our pilot,

34
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:03,698
and the good news is
the Comedy Channel

35
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:07,369
has picked us up
with an order for six episodes.

36
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:12,874
And now I'd like you to meet
the man who got it all started,

37
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,378
the creator of America's
most disturbed comic strip,

38
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:18,713
the man behind the monkey,
if you will.

39
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,716
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, Stu Miley!

40
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:25,220
Come on, Stu, don't be shy.

41
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:27,514
- Stu!
- Good job, Stu!

42
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:28,807
- Good job.
- All right, Stu!

43
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:29,975
- Whoo!
- Good job, man!

44
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:31,268
Good job!

45
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,412
You can't go yet.
There's a pot load of money here.

46
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:35,063
- Herb.
- And besides, you haven't even

47
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,565
talked to Bill from Bazoom Toys,

48
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:38,209
who's got a lot
of great ideas for you.

49
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,633
Mr. Miley, do we ever.
Check it out.

50
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:41,629
The Monkeybone phone.
Every kid's gonna want three,

51
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:42,880
and they're gonna want
their friends to have three.

52
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:44,423
Otherwise, they're not
gonna be friends anymore.

53
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:46,384
Check out the slippers.
You're walking down the hallway,

54
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:48,386
your tootsies are warm, and
you're laughing the whole way.

55
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,887
Hey, how 'bout this,
The Monkeybone backpack?

56
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:51,389
You're going to Europe,
flip it around,

57
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:52,773
- hide your passport...
- Stu. Stu.

58
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:54,554
Stu, what are you doing?
Come on. Come on.

59
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,343
We gotta go talk to the guys
from Burger God.

60
00:05:56,376 --> 00:05:58,211
- Come on. Let's go.
- Burger God?

61
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:00,523
Aren't they the ones that found
the rat gut in the French fries?

62
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:03,425
No. No. No, they found...

63
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:05,844
They found a pig gut,
which is different.

64
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:07,470
That's...
That's practically pork.

65
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:10,432
No, it's a lot of real money,

66
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,767
the kind of money
that can buy happiness.

67
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:14,311
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

68
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:19,649
- I got the ring, Herb.
- The what?

69
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:20,942
- The ring.
- What ring?

70
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:22,319
- That ring.
- No.

71
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:26,114
- What... What do you mean?
- Tonight's the night, Herb.

72
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:29,367
- But why?
- Tonight is the night.

73
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:32,120
That girl pulled me
out of a nightmare.

74
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:36,291
She makes me happy, Herb,
not all of this stuff.

75
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,804
I'll take that. Thanks.

76
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:51,806
Right over here.

77
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:53,725
Do you see this door?

78
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:57,646
The cool thing is
that you open it,

79
00:06:57,812 --> 00:07:00,941
you go out, it closes,
and you can't get back in.

80
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:03,276
Stu, you want to leave?

81
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:04,486
- Yeah.
- You're a big hit.

82
00:07:04,653 --> 00:07:05,946
- Everybody loves you.
- Come on!

83
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:07,948
Doc, I don't want
to be stuck here

84
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:10,158
with a bunch
of these media creeps.

85
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:13,745
I just want it to be us
home alone.

86
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:15,205
Come on. Besides, I...

87
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:18,667
I have something that I...
I want to give to you.

88
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,544
Well, can't you give it
to me later?

89
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,838
Yes, I could, but if later
got here sooner,

90
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:26,758
it would be a lot better.

91
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:37,852
Hi, Herb.

92
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,815
Aha. Yes.

93
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:43,525
Yeah, that...
Yeah, that'll be good.

94
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,360
You got everything?

95
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:47,737
Yeah, see, these are...
These are just prototypes.

96
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:49,739
No, they aren't
the real products, you know.

97
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:51,306
Just something for you
to take home.

98
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:52,742
- This is not for...
- You know,

99
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,244
just spend some time with them.

100
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:56,538
Get a feeling for them
before you say no.

101
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:58,289
No.

102
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:01,084
Stu, come on. One more thing.

103
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:03,169
Actually, there's still
a couple of trucks

104
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:05,216
to come with... with,
you know, Monkeybone stuff.

105
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:07,316
Would you guys mind just
waiting a little bit longer?

106
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,550
Good night, Herb.

107
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:10,427
Of course, yeah.
You guys get out of here.

108
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:12,095
You're a beautiful couple.

109
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:17,600
Would you look at this?
Now he won't let us leave.

110
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,102
- Who?
- The monkey.

111
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,646
Hey, Herb, can you get
this guy to move?

112
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:23,565
- Yeah. Okay.
- Come on, please.

113
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:26,192
- Help me out here.
- Stu, stop.

114
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:29,112
The monkey is good luck.
Come on.

115
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,574
I never had any good luck
until I met you.

116
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,576
You thought him up.
Everybody loves him.

117
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:37,746
You're gonna be a huge success,
so just relax and enjoy it.

118
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:48,131
Thank you, Herb!

119
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:56,097
- What happened?
- I don't know.

120
00:08:56,264 --> 00:08:57,974
- What is it?
- Some sort of

121
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,143
inflatable raft or something.

122
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,105
Whoa!

123
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:10,153
Waah!

124
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,822
- Stop the car! Stop the car!
- Whoa!

125
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:14,741
Whoa!

126
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:16,284
Put on the brakes! Stop the car!

127
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:18,328
That's a great idea!
Wish I'd thought of that!

128
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:35,804
Stu, I'm right here, baby.

129
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,973
It's me. It's Julie. I love you.

130
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,435
Everything's gonna be okay,
I promise.

131
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:44,354
I promise.

132
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:50,026
Julie: I'm Dr. McElroy
from the Sleep Institute.

133
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:51,778
This man is my patient.

134
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:53,988
Man: There's no response
to external stimuli.

135
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:56,199
He's probably
slipped into a coma.

136
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:58,493
Julie: I want to take him
to the University Hospital.

137
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,912
They have the best
head trauma center.

138
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:21,266
Waah!

139
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:45,123
Now arriving in Down Town.

140
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,126
Please exit
to the right of the car.

141
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:51,212
Hello?

142
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,256
Please exit
to the right of the car.

143
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:02,557
- Am I dead?
- Next stop, Land of Death.

144
00:11:02,724 --> 00:11:04,559
Wait, please.

145
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:06,728
I'd like to know if I'm dead.

146
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,754
Hey, young man!
Carry your bags to the Y?

147
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:36,262
Hello, handsome.
Like cigars? We got 'em cheap.

148
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:38,801
- Aah!
- Genuine Cubans.

149
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:43,139
Say, fella,
how's about a shoeshine?

150
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:45,558
Spit and polish. Woo-hoo!

151
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:57,278
Yo, coma dude, man,
what's your hurry?

152
00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:59,614
Nothing but
a bad freak show in there.

153
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:02,533
Yeah, big boy,
what about that backpack?

154
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,994
Coming through!
Get your nightmares here, sir!

155
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:06,329
Step right on up.

156
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:08,498
We got nightmares about Daddy,

157
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:10,124
nightmares about Papa.

158
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,834
- Step right up.
- Yeah.

159
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:14,671
Step right up here.
I got some nightmares here.

160
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:16,157
- First run.
- Excuse me. Help me.

161
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:17,632
- Hey there, young fellow.
- Aah!

162
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,777
- Want to see a nightmare?
- Ride the Tower of Terror!

163
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:22,971
Hey, mister, got a smoke on you?

164
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:24,973
No, I'm trying to cut back.

165
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,102
- Come on up here...
- Good eatin'!

166
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:33,147
Barbecue pork. Barbecue squab.

167
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:34,625
- Bacon. Chitlins.
- Step right up.

168
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:36,359
Three balls for a dollar.

169
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:38,319
Win a prize for the little lady.

170
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:39,779
Aah!

171
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:41,698
Hey, bud. Glad to see me?

172
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:44,492
- N-No.
- What's the matter?

173
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:47,662
Come on, dream buddy.
Don't run away.

174
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:50,331
We got a lot
of catching up to do.

175
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:52,333
Cyclops: You got
any new nightmares for me,

176
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,962
something scary? I love scary!

177
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,152
Hey, new in town?

178
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,195
How about a coma-tini?

179
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:25,491
There it is.

180
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,543
By the way, my name is Bull.

181
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,837
Hi. Hi. How do you do?

182
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,547
Stu Miley, right?

183
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:42,550
I seen all your dreams.

184
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:45,219
You're a big celebrity
down here.

185
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:46,721
Down where?

186
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:50,224
DownTown, land of Nightmares.

187
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:52,727
Wake up, everybody!

188
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:57,607
It's time for Monkeybone live!

189
00:13:59,859 --> 00:14:02,278
Time for a little singing,
a little dancing,

190
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:05,073
and of course some good-natured
bashing of my very own creator,

191
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:07,075
Mr. Stu-pid Mopey!

192
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,243
Hey, guy!

193
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,245
Now I know you're all in comas,

194
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:15,041
but my first guest
is gonna spike your charts!

195
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,576
Hiya, boss.

196
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:58,292
Kimmy?

197
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:00,294
Julie. My God.

198
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:01,796
My God. Look at him.

199
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:04,215
Look at my poor
little baby brother.

200
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:07,009
God, I can't even stand
to look at him.

201
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:09,887
God. Wow.

202
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:11,973
How you doing, little one?
You holding up?

203
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,809
I'm fine, Kimmy, fine.

204
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:17,687
At least he had a chance
to give you the ring.

205
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:19,313
The ring?

206
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,816
Grandmother's ring,
the engagement ring,

207
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:23,544
the one that he called
and had me send to him...

208
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:25,361
Good morning, Dr. McElroy.

209
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:28,698
Hello, Doctor.
Kimmy, this is Dr. Edelstein.

210
00:15:28,865 --> 00:15:31,325
Well, vital signs
have stabilized. That's good.

211
00:15:31,492 --> 00:15:34,203
Listen, Doctor, these machines

212
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,373
are actually what's keeping him
alive right now, right?

213
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,916
- At the moment, yes.
- Okay.

214
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,502
Well, then do you think
that you could possibly

215
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:43,004
give me a realistic...

216
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:44,797
Comas are unpredictable.

217
00:15:44,964 --> 00:15:47,758
He could wake up today
or tomorrow or a month...

218
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:49,177
Doctor. Hey, sweetheart.

219
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:53,097
Our father took
a long time to die,

220
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:56,309
so Stu and I made a pact

221
00:15:56,476 --> 00:16:00,313
that when our time came,

222
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,982
we wouldn't let it drag out,

223
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:05,776
SO...

224
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:07,612
which one's the plug?

225
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:10,156
What plug?

226
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:12,700
The plug, yeah,
the one you pull.

227
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:14,744
God, Kimmy,
don't even talk like that.

228
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:17,079
Hey, do you... I need
a realistic answer, Doctor.

229
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:19,207
- Give me a date.
- All right.

230
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:20,875
Three months.

231
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:24,295
There's always
some brain damage,

232
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:26,422
but after three months,
the chances of coming back

233
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:28,591
shrink dramatically every day.

234
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:33,262
Well, I want him to have
every chance, Doctor.

235
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:38,559
We could certainly give it
three months.

236
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:55,660
Poor Buster.
He hasn't eaten all day.

237
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,332
What's that?

238
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:35,783
Stu did this?

239
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,203
Yeah, right about
the time we met,

240
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,122
when he first came
to the sleep lab.

241
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:42,456
Jesus, honey.

242
00:17:42,623 --> 00:17:44,709
He hadn't had
a good night's sleep in years.

243
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,210
The nightmares
would wake him up,

244
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:47,857
and he'd just
start writing, painting.

245
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:52,466
How do you go from here
to cartoons?

246
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,136
- Switch hands.
- What?

247
00:17:55,303 --> 00:17:57,471
Stu was right-handed,
so I made him switch the pen

248
00:17:57,638 --> 00:17:59,557
to his left hand
to see what would come out,

249
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:02,643
and we got the first Monkeybone.

250
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,645
Wow. Two guys in the same brain.

251
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:06,480
Yeah.

252
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:09,483
Which one'd you
fall in love with?

253
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:21,245
Bull: Hey, Stu, why so glum?

254
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:23,706
At least they haven't pulled
the plug yet.

255
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,583
Have another 'tini.

256
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,169
No. I'm sick of martinis,

257
00:18:28,336 --> 00:18:30,254
carnival rides,

258
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:32,214
watching other people's
nightmares.

259
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:34,592
But you know the one thing

260
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,636
that I'm really,
really sick of is...

261
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:38,929
Monkeybone: Speaking of dames,
I'd like to sing a tune

262
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:41,474
about the beautiful Miss Julie.

263
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:44,101
She's conscious.
Boyfriend here is an eggplant.

264
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:46,687
I'm just kidding, pal,

265
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,522
'cause you know in your heart.

266
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:52,443
Miss Julie is faithful,
loyal, and true.

267
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,903
Jumbo!

268
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:09,543
You have humiliated me in public
for the last time.

269
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,253
I doubt that.

270
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,464
Back in the pack.

271
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:15,466
Monkeybone: Monkey-napper!

272
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,510
Help! Monkey-napper!
Come on, Stu, let me out.

273
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:19,220
It's not my fault.
I can't help myself.

274
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:21,222
I happen to be a figment
of your imagination.

275
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:23,224
Then you can learn
to act normally. I had to.

276
00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:24,725
Normal?

277
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:26,894
Hiya, Stu.

278
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:29,021
Hello, Kitty!

279
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:34,235
I brought you a refill.

280
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:36,696
I'd love a stiff one,
but Stu here

281
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:38,239
forgot to endow me, equip me.

282
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:39,740
Nothing for him.

283
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,158
He's being repressed.

284
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:43,369
|s something wrong, Stu?

285
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:45,913
You seem tense.

286
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,082
It's my girlfriend.

287
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:50,876
I'm starting to think
I'll never see her again.

288
00:19:51,043 --> 00:19:53,629
Why didn't I just propose
right there?

289
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:55,631
At least that way,
I'd know what she said.

290
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:57,633
I'd know if she's
still waiting for me.

291
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,136
She is waiting for you, Stu.

292
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:02,138
I know she is.

293
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:04,765
Guys like you, they don't
come around that often.

294
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,937
I mean it, Stu.

295
00:20:10,104 --> 00:20:12,523
You're one in a million.

296
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:23,826
That's it. Back in the pack.

297
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:25,703
Not by the hair
of my butty-butt-butt.

298
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,458
I'm reporting this to my union.

299
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:31,876
What union?!

300
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:33,210
The Sidekicks Union...

301
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:35,671
Me, Tonto, Robin the Boy Wonder,
Chewbacca.

302
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:38,366
You top bananas
better watch your...

303
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:40,176
That's it.

304
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:41,611
- Enemy fire. I'm coming in.
- Come here!

305
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,637
Ahooga! Ahooga!

306
00:20:43,804 --> 00:20:45,681
Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!

307
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:49,685
Aah! I left my phone number
in your undies.

308
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:54,148
Try not to lose it in traffic.

309
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:55,649
Sorry, Kitty.

310
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:57,318
Be right back
after I choke my monkey!

311
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:59,320
- Eat my dust!
- Monkeybone!

312
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:01,655
Loser! Wha hoo hoo hoo hoo!

313
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,833
Waah!

314
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:38,442
Earl Biegler.

315
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,611
I have come...

316
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:43,197
Can't... Can't hear you,
young fella. Speak up.

317
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:47,201
Earl Biegler...

318
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:49,703
Stop mumbling, you durn fool.

319
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,082
Jeez. Here.

320
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:05,177
An Exit Pass.

321
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:06,679
Got a reprieve.

322
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:08,722
Good for him.
He's gonna wake up.

323
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:16,313
No, no, no, this is not right.

324
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,315
- He's old.
- That geezer?

325
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:20,526
- Ancient.
- That decrepit old fart?

326
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:25,197
Monkeybone: Hey, Honest Abe,
the Great Emancipator!

327
00:22:37,918 --> 00:22:39,461
No. What...

328
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:50,264
- But...
- But...

329
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:52,266
- What...
- What...

330
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:53,976
I...

331
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:56,395
- The...
- The...

332
00:22:58,898 --> 00:23:00,608
Hey! Hey, you.

333
00:23:00,774 --> 00:23:04,111
I want to talk to you.

334
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:07,031
Hey. He got an Exit Pass.

335
00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:08,532
Where's mine?

336
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:10,034
- Stu!
- When do I get to go home?

337
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,119
Stu, please, let's not
stir up the nice Reaper.

338
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:16,081
Sorry, mate.

339
00:23:16,248 --> 00:23:18,626
- Off duty.
- What?

340
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:23,589
- Off duty?! You...
- D-Don't! Just calm down.

341
00:23:23,756 --> 00:23:25,299
Whoa, boss.
You got it all mixed up.

342
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:26,800
- You're the nice guy.
- Let go!

343
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,612
I'm the irrepressible screw-up.
No, don't, don't.

344
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:31,472
- Woo!
- Mr. Reaper!

345
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:33,474
Mr. Reaper, I'm sorry!
Wait! Wait, come back!

346
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:35,184
Come back!

347
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:37,353
Stu: That's right!

348
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,814
You fly away!

349
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:43,984
Fly away.

350
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:46,153
Fly, fly.

351
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:51,116
Who am I kidding?

352
00:23:51,283 --> 00:23:53,118
I am never gonna
get out of here.

353
00:23:53,285 --> 00:23:56,538
I'm never gonna see her again.

354
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,500
Good golly, Mr. Miley.

355
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:02,002
Mr. Stu Miley?

356
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:04,004
Package for you.

357
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:06,507
Thank you very much.

358
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,558
"You are invited to a pajama
party at Hypnos' Hideaway."

359
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:19,353
Woo! Playtime with Mr. Big!

360
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,855
Hypnos, the god of nightmares.
Do you know what this means?

361
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:23,857
I finally get a date.

362
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:25,859
He's finally gonna hear my case.

363
00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:27,528
Woo!

364
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:35,619
What do you think?

365
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:42,584
Come on, you.
I need an opinion. Wake up.

366
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,965
You know, you got
fan mail to read,

367
00:24:48,132 --> 00:24:50,384
people wanting autographs.

368
00:24:50,551 --> 00:24:52,594
You've got 15 minutes of fame,

369
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:54,321
and you're gonna sleep
right through it.

370
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,725
Of course, knowing you,

371
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:00,227
maybe that's the plan?

372
00:25:00,394 --> 00:25:02,771
Julie. Hi!

373
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:04,773
Kimmy.

374
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,942
- Hey.
- Hi. Why are you...

375
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:13,574
Listen, this is really hard
for me, but, um,

376
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:16,368
well, it's been three months,

377
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:20,414
and, um, I gave the order.

378
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:44,480
Woo! Now this is living.

379
00:26:00,454 --> 00:26:02,539
There is a live feed tonight.

380
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:06,085
Live feed? What is that?

381
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:08,670
Just watch.

382
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:12,508
J Can't shake free... J - Hey!

383
00:26:12,674 --> 00:26:13,675
- Aah!
- What?!

384
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:15,803
Get your fat ass out of my face.

385
00:26:18,013 --> 00:26:19,932
Showtime!

386
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:21,939
- The show's going to start.
- Over to the orb.

387
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:28,023
- It's gonna be...
- The orb is on.

388
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,192
Look, he's sitting on a cake.

389
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,654
Hey, that's me.

390
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:36,532
Nice tux, dude.

391
00:26:43,997 --> 00:26:46,208
Who's dreaming this?

392
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:49,628
Julie?

393
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:54,716
What is this?

394
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,596
Julie, I'm... I'm here.

395
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,674
Bon voyage, little brother.

396
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:39,928
No, Kimmy!

397
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:42,222
My God. No, don't! Julie!

398
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,442
Julie!

399
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:03,327
Julie!

400
00:28:09,082 --> 00:28:10,876
Julie, I love you.

401
00:28:11,043 --> 00:28:13,921
Julie, I love you.

402
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:15,923
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm up here.

403
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:18,091
Julie.

404
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,095
No!

405
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:35,067
Stu.

406
00:28:37,152 --> 00:28:39,571
- It's Hypnos.
- Yo, Hyp.

407
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:40,781
- Whoa.
- It's him.

408
00:28:40,948 --> 00:28:43,784
- Hyp, Hyp, hurrah.
- Love your honey.

409
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:45,953
Good evening. Good evening.

410
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:51,291
Stu Miley.

411
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,877
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

412
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:57,005
Hey, I'm glad
you could make it, man.

413
00:28:57,172 --> 00:28:59,633
We see a lot of nightmares
down here,

414
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,096
but yours are like caviar.

415
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:06,473
I just saw a dream.

416
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,475
It was my girlfriend.

417
00:29:08,642 --> 00:29:10,978
She dreamed that they were gonna

418
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:12,813
pull the plug on me.

419
00:29:15,357 --> 00:29:17,192
Give us a moment,
will you, darling?

420
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,361
Toodles.

421
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:22,364
You see, Stu,

422
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:27,119
you made this pact
with your sister?

423
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:29,413
No life support.

424
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:31,873
Pact? Pact? No life support?

425
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,002
Pull the plug.
Pull the plug, ple...

426
00:29:35,168 --> 00:29:36,503
No.

427
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,839
That's wrong.
Julie would never agree to that.

428
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:41,216
They're pulling the plug
at 9 AM.

429
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:42,718
Anybody that dumb

430
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:44,344
deserves to die.

431
00:29:45,595 --> 00:29:46,847
Can't you help me?

432
00:29:47,014 --> 00:29:49,391
Stu, I'm just the god of sleep.

433
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:52,102
This is Death's bailiwick.

434
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:53,520
Death?

435
00:30:05,782 --> 00:30:07,826
Cheating Death...

436
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:12,998
And this is
extremely off the record.

437
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:17,836
What you gotta do
is go into the Land of Death,

438
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:20,297
sneak up
right under Death's nose,

439
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:23,425
and steal one
of those Exit Passes.

440
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:25,427
Well, Hyp, thanks for the idea,

441
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:27,220
and good luck with
the shock therapy.

442
00:30:27,387 --> 00:30:29,681
Will you shut up?

443
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:35,896
He gave you a sign?

444
00:30:36,063 --> 00:30:38,565
If it doesn't sound rational,
okay, it's not rational.

445
00:30:38,732 --> 00:30:39,852
I don't care anymore, Alice.

446
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:42,736
We've got exactly six hours
to wake him up.

447
00:30:51,078 --> 00:30:53,497
Hey, look, Mr. Green Stain's
got a dead one.

448
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:54,831
What do we do now?

449
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:57,334
He's taking her
to the Land of Death, right?

450
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:58,728
So all we have to do
is hitch a ride.

451
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:00,587
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

452
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:02,798
Listen to you,
Xena, Warrior Princess.

453
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:11,765
Stu: The gates are closing.
Come on.

454
00:31:15,894 --> 00:31:17,938
Help, boss. I'm going fast.

455
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:19,189
I'm dying, boss.

456
00:31:19,356 --> 00:31:22,234
Shh. Come on, come on.

457
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:28,615
Monkeybone: Whoo!

458
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:31,868
Hey, look what I found.

459
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:41,962
Whoo!

460
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:43,797
Well, that's worth knowing.

461
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:56,143
Chart number one
is from five years ago.

462
00:31:56,309 --> 00:31:58,329
This is the worst nightmare
Stu had at the sleep lab...

463
00:31:58,353 --> 00:32:00,647
Abnormally intense
alpha wave activity

464
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:03,108
with a peak that lasts
just over a minute.

465
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:05,277
And this... Alice.

466
00:32:07,112 --> 00:32:08,321
This is earlier today.

467
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:09,823
Holy shit.

468
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,324
- Wow.
- Yeah.

469
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:14,536
He's caught in a loop,
a nightmare loop.

470
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:16,222
Does everybody here
know what Oneirix is?

471
00:32:16,246 --> 00:32:17,581
It's nightmare juice. I mean,

472
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:20,333
if those charts are right,
Stu's swimming in the stuff.

473
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,127
You thinking we can
decrease the levels?

474
00:32:22,294 --> 00:32:24,313
No, I want to give him more.
I want to give him a massive dose.

475
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:26,047
That's not gonna stop
his nightmare.

476
00:32:26,214 --> 00:32:27,567
Hutch, I don't want to stop
his nightmare.

477
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:29,819
I want to crank it up.
I want to take it right off the charts.

478
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:31,678
I want to scare him awake.

479
00:32:56,411 --> 00:33:00,040
DownTown trolley,
right on schedule.

480
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:01,791
Yes, yes, yes, all right.

481
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:04,503
I'm at a critical juncture here,
please.

482
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:08,882
The Last Days of Pompeii. Watch.

483
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:14,596
Nice eruption.

484
00:33:14,763 --> 00:33:17,224
Thank you. I'm yours.
What do you want?

485
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,934
- Let's get to reaping.
- Let's go.

486
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,936
We got a bunch
of new recruits,

487
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:22,896
fresh in from Dispatch.

488
00:33:23,063 --> 00:33:25,023
- Fine, fine. Send them in.
- Send 'em in!

489
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:30,946
Assistant: Okay.
First up on the docket today...

490
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:35,075
Chakasandra Singh, New Delhi.
Snakebite.

491
00:33:35,242 --> 00:33:37,202
Death: Singh, sang, sung.

492
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:39,454
Dead.

493
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:43,083
Okay, Scott,
step up here, please.

494
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,751
Scott, Death. Death, Scott.

495
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:46,920
- Hi, Scott.
- Hello.

496
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:50,882
Scott enjoys sunsets
and Steven Seagal movies.

497
00:33:52,592 --> 00:33:55,220
- Come on.
- Next up, Clarke Devereaux,

498
00:33:55,387 --> 00:33:57,097
Chicago, Illinois.

499
00:33:57,264 --> 00:33:59,099
Looks like complications
from a coma.

500
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:02,936
- Right. Come on.
- What?

501
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:05,021
- It says he recovers.
- Recover?

502
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:07,357
It says he's gonna live
another 40 years.

503
00:34:07,524 --> 00:34:08,608
It's a reprieve.

504
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:10,110
Let me have an Exit Pass.

505
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:11,987
- Exit Pass.
- Yeah.

506
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:16,366
That means forms.
That means bureaucracy.

507
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:17,951
- You.
- Assistant: Aw.

508
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:20,287
Yeah. What's your name?

509
00:34:20,453 --> 00:34:22,205
- Say something.
- Herb.

510
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:23,873
- Come here, Herb.
- Monkeybone: Now?

511
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,584
- Yes.
- Ooh hoo. Stand up straight.

512
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,228
- I am standing up...
- Stand up straight.

513
00:34:27,252 --> 00:34:28,587
- Shut up.
- Straight.

514
00:34:28,753 --> 00:34:30,964
I want you to picture this
with me if you can.

515
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:32,299
Yeah?

516
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:34,968
- You're a customer.
You're about to die.

517
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:38,179
You're a little excited,
a little fearful,

518
00:34:38,346 --> 00:34:40,515
and here comes the Grim Reaper.

519
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:43,393
Tell me, Herb, what the hell
is he covered in?!

520
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,186
- Stu: Pea soup?
- Monkeybone: Guacamole?

521
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:47,799
As you requested,
one Exit Pass

522
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,626
O Mighty
Wielder of the Scythe.

523
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,819
Stu: No, wait. Just behave.

524
00:34:52,986 --> 00:34:54,321
Monkeybone: Exit Pass.

525
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:55,739
What a coincidence.

526
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:57,300
I was just heading
over to DownTown.

527
00:34:57,324 --> 00:34:58,867
Don't bite me there!

528
00:34:59,034 --> 00:35:02,495
I'd be happy to drop that off
for you, if you don't mind!

529
00:35:02,662 --> 00:35:03,663
Shut up. Shut up.

530
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,750
- Herb?
- Monkeybone: Yeah?

531
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:09,002
Could I see you
over there, please?

532
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:10,211
- Over there?
- Over there?

533
00:35:10,378 --> 00:35:12,714
- Yeah.
- Okay.

534
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:15,216
Okay.

535
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:17,010
Latta.

536
00:35:24,017 --> 00:35:25,393
- Impostors!
- Get 'em!

537
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,561
Get that monkey!

538
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:30,690
Go, you idiots. Go! Go! Go!

539
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:33,860
Geronimo!

540
00:35:34,027 --> 00:35:37,614
Got it. You're... Whoo! Yeah!

541
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:40,033
- That's it!
- Well done!

542
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,369
- Fire in the hole!
- Whose hole?

543
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:44,371
Whose hole?

544
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:55,323
Hey, Monkeybone,
there's our train.

545
00:35:58,218 --> 00:36:00,887
Arnold, now. Now!

546
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:17,505
Come on, Monkeybone!
Come on, little buddy! You can do it!

547
00:36:17,529 --> 00:36:19,406
Okay. All righty.

548
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:21,074
Take it easy.

549
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:28,915
Help, boss!

550
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:33,128
Coming in.

551
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:38,091
Monkeybone: Whoo!

552
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:40,760
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

553
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:46,099
Yikes!

554
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:52,397
Monkeybone!

555
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,275
What's the maximum safe dose?

556
00:36:55,442 --> 00:37:00,113
Most we've ever used
is, um, half a cc.

557
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,282
Five ccs.

558
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:43,406
Monkeybone: Hold it, Doctor!

559
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:45,658
Stu, I'm coming in.

560
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:48,036
Monkeybone: Woo! Yah!

561
00:37:51,998 --> 00:37:55,710
That's it, boss.
Now hit those pedals.

562
00:38:19,192 --> 00:38:20,527
Monkeybone: Whoo!

563
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:22,529
Yes!

564
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:24,823
Terra firma, we made it.

565
00:38:25,865 --> 00:38:27,200
- Monkeybone.
- What?

566
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:29,167
- You saved my life.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

567
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:30,888
Whatever. Look, we only
have about five minutes.

568
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,164
It's just that
now that I'm leaving,

569
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:35,331
there's so many things
that I wanted to say to you.

570
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:37,544
Don't get mushy on me.
I'll be fine.

571
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,838
Just drop me off at the bar.

572
00:38:40,004 --> 00:38:41,673
You've been a hell
of a figment, pal.

573
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,633
Sure wish I could
take you home with me.

574
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,301
Right back at you, boss.
Tech tch.

575
00:38:45,468 --> 00:38:46,886
Right back at you.

576
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:50,056
No joke, little buddy.
I really do love...

577
00:38:51,057 --> 00:38:53,226
Wheel

578
00:38:53,393 --> 00:38:55,937
I love you, too, boss!

579
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,440
Love you, too!

580
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,363
Stu: Wait! Monkeybone!

581
00:39:07,782 --> 00:39:09,117
Don't do this!

582
00:39:09,284 --> 00:39:11,244
Please! Wait!

583
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:13,347
- Nice work, little brother.
- Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

584
00:39:13,371 --> 00:39:16,082
No, don't do this!

585
00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:22,922
Let go!

586
00:39:26,092 --> 00:39:28,011
Monkeybone,
we can talk about this!

587
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:29,429
Come on! Wait!

588
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:32,098
Come back here!

589
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:35,643
Wait! No, you don't understand!
He's got my Exit Pass!

590
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,813
I'm so sorry, Stu.

591
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,692
It's just all part of the deal.

592
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:45,945
We've got big plans
for that body of yours.

593
00:39:46,112 --> 00:39:47,238
What?

594
00:39:48,865 --> 00:39:50,909
No! This can't be happening!

595
00:39:54,621 --> 00:39:57,624
No!

596
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,001
Julie! Julie!

597
00:40:00,168 --> 00:40:05,048
Waah!

598
00:40:29,822 --> 00:40:31,658
Stu?

599
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:35,161
Ju...

600
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,663
Julie?

601
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:40,124
Whoa, baby!

602
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:43,127
Stu!

603
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:46,631
Two more little ticks
of the clock, and...

604
00:40:56,182 --> 00:40:58,017
Welcome home.

605
00:41:06,985 --> 00:41:09,195
Stu.

606
00:41:10,488 --> 00:41:13,658
Home, sweet home?

607
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:17,829
Actually, I was expecting
something a little swankier.

608
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,293
You have to assume
that Monkeybone would be

609
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,172
a pretty lucrative franchise
with

610
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:30,341
royalties

611
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:33,094
servants.

612
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:35,096
I gave all the servants
the day off.

613
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:43,896
Honey, why don't you just rest
on the sofa for a minute?

614
00:41:45,857 --> 00:41:47,025
All right.

615
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,576
Bitchin' good cake.

616
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:59,078
- Good.
- You want a hunk?

617
00:41:59,245 --> 00:42:00,538
No, thank you.

618
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:12,759
Here's to a celebration

619
00:42:12,925 --> 00:42:14,761
that should've
happened three months ago.

620
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,853
Stu

621
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,688
I want you to know

622
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:27,940
I found the little surprise
you left that night.

623
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:32,487
If you were wondering
what the answer was,

624
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:34,864
it was yes, and it still is.

625
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:36,866
- Tis?
- Yeah,

626
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:39,285
with all my heart.

627
00:42:39,452 --> 00:42:41,120
And what was the question?

628
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:42,872
You asked me to marry you.

629
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:44,624
Marry you?!

630
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,294
No, you did.

631
00:42:48,461 --> 00:42:52,131
Here.

632
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:53,633
See?

633
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:56,511
He did it!

634
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:59,180
No! No, no, no, no.

635
00:42:59,347 --> 00:43:00,973
Buster, look who's here!

636
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,559
Hello, Buster.

637
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:12,902
I've never seen him
act like this before!

638
00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:14,379
He's a liar!
He's a lying son of a bitch!

639
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:17,532
Don't believe anything he says!
I think he's got mental problems!

640
00:43:31,254 --> 00:43:33,881
Ooh, baby.

641
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:56,237
What are you watching?

642
00:43:59,031 --> 00:44:00,992
Nothing.

643
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:11,169
Ooh.

644
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:18,926
Do you think this is
medically advisable?

645
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:21,053
We got a doctor on duty.

646
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:25,224
As long as it's okay
with Monkeybone.

647
00:44:27,185 --> 00:44:28,895
Which it seems to be.

648
00:45:59,694 --> 00:46:01,445
Monkeybone: Whee yah!

649
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,033
Dive, dive, dive!

650
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:11,706
God, Stu!

651
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:13,332
My God.

652
00:46:13,499 --> 00:46:15,251
Are you all...!

653
00:46:19,714 --> 00:46:22,216
Heads up.

654
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:24,635
Feeding time!

655
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:37,898
What... What... What... What...

656
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:39,817
What... What...

657
00:46:39,984 --> 00:46:41,902
Who are you? What do you want?

658
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:43,404
Dinner.

659
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:45,781
You gotta move fast
in this crowd, or you'll starve.

660
00:46:45,948 --> 00:46:47,867
Here. Have some popcorn.

661
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:50,036
They feed us the slops
from the Morpheum Theater.

662
00:46:50,202 --> 00:46:52,413
You hope for Milky Way.
You settle for Skittles.

663
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,582
I'm Steve, Steve King.

664
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,377
Stephen King?

665
00:46:58,544 --> 00:47:00,421
What are you doing here?

666
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:02,089
I'm Jack the Ripper.

667
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:06,761
- I'm Lizzie Borden.
- How do you do?

668
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:08,596
Attila the Hun.

669
00:47:08,763 --> 00:47:10,765
Attila the Hun.

670
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:16,771
All hail the most glorious,
the most esteemed, the most...

671
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:20,483
Enough, enough, enough.
I'm hung over.

672
00:47:20,649 --> 00:47:22,902
Hyp, did you bring me
cough medicine?

673
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:24,779
How 'bout that night light
I asked for?

674
00:47:24,945 --> 00:47:26,989
King, you pussy.

675
00:47:27,156 --> 00:47:28,157
Bite me, Poe.

676
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:31,452
- You set me up!
- Easy, pal.

677
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,454
I was just coming
to congratulate you.

678
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:35,541
It ain't easy snatching
one of those Exit Passes.

679
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:37,416
Steve here was
the last guy to do it,

680
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,668
and that must have been,
what, 25 years ago?

681
00:47:39,835 --> 00:47:42,463
Why'd you do it?
What did I ever do to you?

682
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,965
It's nothing personal, Stu.

683
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:47,385
It's just we need nightmares,
fresh nightmares.

684
00:47:47,551 --> 00:47:49,261
We'd die without 'em.

685
00:47:49,428 --> 00:47:50,971
That's why we grabbed your body.

686
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:52,515
I'm no nightmare maker.

687
00:47:52,681 --> 00:47:54,100
That's the monkey's job.

688
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:56,519
Monkeybone?!

689
00:47:56,685 --> 00:47:58,145
What?!

690
00:47:58,312 --> 00:48:00,773
Let's face it, Stu.
Nobody wants to be a figment.

691
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,900
It's kind of a dead-end career,
so he gets fed up,

692
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:04,819
he comes to us
with a proposition.

693
00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:06,862
We help him swipe your body.

694
00:48:07,029 --> 00:48:10,616
He helps us get a heap
of brand-new nightmares!

695
00:48:10,783 --> 00:48:12,827
Hey, news flash, buddy!
I'm a cartoonist!

696
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:14,995
Sure, but you've
got a girlfriend

697
00:48:15,162 --> 00:48:17,140
who's figured out the chemical
basis of bad dreams.

698
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:19,333
And guess what.
She just whipped up

699
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,669
a big old batch
of nightmare juice!

700
00:48:23,754 --> 00:48:26,090
We're predicting
record box office.

701
00:48:28,717 --> 00:48:30,511
What's plural for "orifice,"
"orifi"?

702
00:48:30,678 --> 00:48:32,656
No, I wasn't in a coma.
All right, I was in a coma,

703
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,182
but it wasn't like I was
in a coma and goofing off.

704
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:37,389
I was thinking up hilarious
new bits the whole time!

705
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,230
You see, it's all synergy.

706
00:48:41,397 --> 00:48:43,315
The show synergizes the strip.

707
00:48:43,482 --> 00:48:45,443
The strip synergizes
the merchandising.

708
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:48,028
The merchandising
synergizes the religion,

709
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:50,531
and the religion synergizes
the Barbara Walters Special.

710
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:52,575
And then, baby, we are all

711
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:56,829
in the United Empire
of Monkeybonia!

712
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:00,332
No, really, he's...
He's ready to merchandise.

713
00:49:00,499 --> 00:49:02,179
Yeah, but we gotta move on this,
all right?

714
00:49:02,334 --> 00:49:04,211
So let's get the burger guys,
the toy guys,

715
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:06,218
and the lunchbox people
over here. Hi, sweetie.

716
00:49:06,297 --> 00:49:07,657
Herb, get off that phone
right now.

717
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:09,133
You're exploiting him!

718
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,634
- Am not.
- Herb...

719
00:49:10,801 --> 00:49:12,446
- Yeah, we need to get the...
- he's not himself.

720
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:13,804
He's your friend, he trusts you,

721
00:49:13,971 --> 00:49:15,389
and you're
taking advantage of him.

722
00:49:15,556 --> 00:49:17,057
- Am not.
- Are too!

723
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:18,893
- I'm on the phone!
- My cocina.

724
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:20,394
Hey, hey.

725
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:23,564
My refrigerator, where I store
and chill my food.

726
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:26,567
And this, the oven
where I cook my food.

727
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:28,027
And if you'll step this way,

728
00:49:28,194 --> 00:49:31,113
you'll find my dining room,
where I eat my food.

729
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,032
What is all this stuff
about merchandising?

730
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,658
You hate merchandising.

731
00:49:34,825 --> 00:49:36,243
I know, baby, I do.

732
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,870
But look at it
from another angle.

733
00:49:38,037 --> 00:49:40,456
There's a potload of money here.

734
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:45,646
You two-bit simian stooge.

735
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:47,648
We didn't send you up here

736
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:50,359
to shake your booty
with a bunch of lingerie babes.

737
00:50:50,526 --> 00:50:55,948
But it's my fantasy.

738
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:57,491
I don't care!

739
00:50:57,658 --> 00:51:00,452
We sent you up here
to make nightmares.

740
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:01,996
Now you get out there,

741
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:03,539
and you get
that nightmare juice,

742
00:51:03,706 --> 00:51:05,499
and you get to work.

743
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:16,510
'Cause you may be a free man
during the day,

744
00:51:16,677 --> 00:51:19,680
but when you dream

745
00:51:20,806 --> 00:51:24,059
your monkey ass is mine

746
00:51:24,226 --> 00:51:25,853
mine, mine.

747
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:36,530
Eep.

748
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:32,670
What the...

749
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:47,142
Baby.

750
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:49,144
I'd really like to,

751
00:52:49,311 --> 00:52:51,146
but it'd put me
in a lot of hot water.

752
00:52:51,313 --> 00:52:55,109
Why don't you just
give that back?

753
00:52:56,777 --> 00:52:59,655
Do you?

754
00:52:59,822 --> 00:53:03,409
Well, in that case, why don't
you give me a little preview?

755
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,787
J Making love with you J.

756
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:10,624
J Is all I wanna do. J.

757
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:14,545
Sucker.

758
00:53:16,588 --> 00:53:18,507
Yow!

759
00:53:18,674 --> 00:53:20,134
Let go! Let go!

760
00:53:41,238 --> 00:53:43,073
Stu.

761
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,825
Where have you been?

762
00:53:44,992 --> 00:53:47,786
Nowhere. I was asleep.

763
00:53:47,953 --> 00:53:50,497
Honey, don't lie to me.
I know you went out.

764
00:53:50,664 --> 00:53:54,334
No, not me.
You must be dreaming.

765
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:01,842
I know what this is about.

766
00:54:02,009 --> 00:54:04,369
You've been mad at me because
I haven't proposed to you yet.

767
00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:06,180
Go on. Admit it.

768
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:08,116
You've been giving me
the stink-eye ever since

769
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,951
the business with the banner,
you and that dog.

770
00:54:09,975 --> 00:54:12,060
I have not been
giving you the stink-eye.

771
00:54:12,227 --> 00:54:14,646
You're giving me the stink-eye
right now!

772
00:54:14,813 --> 00:54:18,525
Stu, you're wearing shoes
and a poncho

773
00:54:18,692 --> 00:54:21,403
with no pants in bed.

774
00:54:28,702 --> 00:54:32,289
Well, did you all
have sidekicks, figments?

775
00:54:32,456 --> 00:54:35,417
- Monkeys?
- A raven.

776
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:37,544
Mine was a dog.

777
00:54:37,711 --> 00:54:38,754
Man's best friend? Pfft.

778
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:41,006
I went through hell
to get that Exit Pass,

779
00:54:41,173 --> 00:54:43,550
and who got to use it? Cujo.

780
00:54:43,717 --> 00:54:46,220
Miley, you got a visitor.

781
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:50,390
Kitty.

782
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:53,060
God, Stu.

783
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:55,521
I'm so sorry.

784
00:54:55,687 --> 00:54:57,606
I wanted to tell you
what was going on.

785
00:54:57,773 --> 00:55:00,442
I really, really liked you.

786
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:03,195
Thank you, Kitty, but that
doesn't matter right now.

787
00:55:03,362 --> 00:55:04,947
The woman I love is living with

788
00:55:05,113 --> 00:55:06,740
a horny little monkey
that looks like me.

789
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:08,575
What a lucky girl.

790
00:55:10,577 --> 00:55:12,847
Kitty, listen. Is there any way
I can get a message to her

791
00:55:12,871 --> 00:55:15,040
to warn her about
what Monkeybone is up to?

792
00:55:15,207 --> 00:55:16,447
Time's up! Break it up, you two.

793
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:18,377
- No, no!
- Let's move.

794
00:55:18,544 --> 00:55:19,962
- No!
- Come on!

795
00:55:20,128 --> 00:55:21,940
Just give me a moment,
just to look at him! Stu!

796
00:55:21,964 --> 00:55:23,924
Feeding time!

797
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:31,139
As you know,
Burger God is prepared to launch

798
00:55:31,306 --> 00:55:34,726
our new Mega Monkey Meal.

799
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:39,606
- Something wrong?
- A pig gut!

800
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:43,902
How much is McDonald's offering?

801
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:45,487
Less.

802
00:55:45,654 --> 00:55:47,739
A pleasure to be
in business with you.

803
00:55:50,951 --> 00:55:52,911
Here's another thing.
The Natural History Museum

804
00:55:53,078 --> 00:55:54,597
is kicking off
a fund-raising campaign,

805
00:55:54,621 --> 00:55:56,432
and they want to know if you
could appear at a benefit.

806
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:58,959
I get it. We give the public

807
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:00,395
the impression that we're
doing something charitable.

808
00:56:00,419 --> 00:56:02,462
Brilliant!

809
00:56:02,629 --> 00:56:04,882
Yes, yes, that's it exactly.

810
00:56:05,048 --> 00:56:07,843
Now, I think you remember
Bill here from Bazoom Toys.

811
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:11,638
We have a little something here
we think you might just like.

812
00:56:11,805 --> 00:56:14,308
It's a prototype.

813
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:16,977
Code name... Little Jack Horner.

814
00:56:27,946 --> 00:56:30,365
Go ahead, pull out his thumb.

815
00:56:58,185 --> 00:57:00,687
No, it's mine!

816
00:57:00,854 --> 00:57:03,398
Say, could you fill these babies
up with a particulate solution

817
00:57:03,565 --> 00:57:05,817
of one part powdered chemical
enzyme to 10 parts water?

818
00:57:05,984 --> 00:57:07,361
Jerry?

819
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:09,696
Jerr... Yeah, I guess we could.

820
00:57:09,863 --> 00:57:11,531
All right!

821
00:57:11,698 --> 00:57:13,659
You got yourself a deal!

822
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:19,831
Shall we shake on it?

823
00:57:19,998 --> 00:57:21,208
Shake on it?

824
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:22,894
That's not the way we
do things in Monkey Land.

825
00:57:22,918 --> 00:57:25,796
In Monkey Land,
we rub our bottoms together.

826
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:31,468
You heard the man.
Get your asses on the table!

827
00:57:36,056 --> 00:57:37,099
Yeah!

828
00:57:43,397 --> 00:57:46,066
The thing is, I'm responsible
for the way he's acting.

829
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:48,110
It's the nightmare juice.
It's gotta be.

830
00:57:48,276 --> 00:57:50,696
Julie, that stuff probably
saved his life.

831
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:55,575
He's not Stu anymore.

832
00:57:55,742 --> 00:57:58,578
The Stu I love is gone.

833
00:57:58,745 --> 00:58:00,414
He spends all his time
in the garage.

834
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,249
He says that he's

835
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:03,917
autographing.

836
00:58:24,938 --> 00:58:26,940
Nightmare in a butt.

837
00:58:32,362 --> 00:58:35,991
I think I hear a guinea pig!

838
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:43,707
Listen, let's bring him in
for some tests.

839
00:58:43,874 --> 00:58:46,418
I guarantee you're overreacting.

840
00:58:50,464 --> 00:58:54,176
Actually, no, I don't think
I'm overreacting.

841
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:06,646
Waah!

842
00:59:16,406 --> 00:59:18,825
Sweet dreams,
you little bastard.

843
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:44,851
Dog dreams?

844
00:59:45,018 --> 00:59:46,895
This is completely humiliating.

845
00:59:47,062 --> 00:59:49,147
That stinking monkey.
I can't believe it.

846
00:59:49,314 --> 00:59:52,067
We give him a body,
and he sends us dogs?

847
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:57,114
Shh. Let's not think about dogs.

848
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,617
Let's think about pussycats.

849
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:05,247
What a luscious surprise.

850
01:00:06,915 --> 01:00:09,084
A delish...

851
01:00:09,251 --> 01:00:12,420
So I thought what the hell.
I'm a big celebrity now.

852
01:00:12,587 --> 01:00:14,965
I can get all the chicks I want.
Why get married?

853
01:00:15,132 --> 01:00:16,317
- Yeah.
- But on the other hand,

854
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:18,093
if you are married,
no more stink-eye.

855
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,178
Plus they can't testify
against you.

856
01:00:20,345 --> 01:00:21,972
Testify about what?

857
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:31,398
Hello.

858
01:00:31,565 --> 01:00:33,066
- Julie, it's Hutch.
- Hutch, what?

859
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:34,484
The nightmare juice, it's gone.

860
01:00:34,651 --> 01:00:36,695
Somebody switched it
for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid.

861
01:00:36,862 --> 01:00:40,532
Grape Kool-Aid?
But who'd want to...

862
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:46,079
Go! Go! Go!

863
01:00:48,665 --> 01:00:50,876
Stu.

864
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:52,752
Stu.

865
01:00:52,919 --> 01:00:55,755
Shh-shh-shh.

866
01:00:55,922 --> 01:00:58,258
Here, you'll need these
for your trip.

867
01:00:58,425 --> 01:01:00,093
What?

868
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:03,805
And this.

869
01:01:05,223 --> 01:01:08,101
Kitty, you can't do this.
You're gonna get in trouble.

870
01:01:08,268 --> 01:01:11,980
You're the one true-hearted man
I ever met.

871
01:01:12,147 --> 01:01:13,987
Now, you find a way back
to that girl of yours,

872
01:01:14,149 --> 01:01:16,109
and you make her happy.

873
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:19,654
Thank you.

874
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:21,323
What about the guard?

875
01:01:21,489 --> 01:01:23,658
I'll take care of that rat.

876
01:01:30,498 --> 01:01:31,833
Okay, Stu.

877
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,127
I'll see you tomorrow.

878
01:01:35,962 --> 01:01:38,632
Goodbye, Kitty.

879
01:01:50,602 --> 01:01:52,687
Guard: Hey, lady, what are you...

880
01:01:58,818 --> 01:02:00,320
Kitty?

881
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:04,908
Just go!

882
01:02:05,075 --> 01:02:06,826
Well, thank you, Kitty.

883
01:02:06,993 --> 01:02:08,870
I'll never forget you,
and I mean that.

884
01:02:09,037 --> 01:02:12,582
I'll really never forget you.

885
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:17,796
All right, guys, take it
over to the right a little.

886
01:02:17,963 --> 01:02:19,297
Right here?

887
01:02:19,464 --> 01:02:20,799
Yeah, take it over to the right.

888
01:02:20,966 --> 01:02:23,677
All right, that looks good.
Now tie it on.

889
01:02:25,553 --> 01:02:27,555
Last one.

890
01:02:51,913 --> 01:02:55,750
What kind of idiot sneaks
into the Land of Death twice?

891
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:57,919
One that likes a good stretching?

892
01:02:58,086 --> 01:03:00,005
Shut up.

893
01:03:00,171 --> 01:03:02,007
I want to hear
what he has to say.

894
01:03:02,173 --> 01:03:05,176
Death, I know you're mad at me,
and I don't blame you,

895
01:03:05,343 --> 01:03:07,012
but we're both mad at DownTown,

896
01:03:07,178 --> 01:03:09,723
and we're both mad
at your brother, Hypnos.

897
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:12,392
So now you're gonna
tell me it's all his fault

898
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,102
and you were
completely innocent.

899
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:15,895
No, I'm not gonna tell you that.

900
01:03:16,062 --> 01:03:17,902
I wanted that Exit Pass.
I wanted it bad enough

901
01:03:18,064 --> 01:03:19,904
I had to stare you
right in the face to get it.

902
01:03:19,941 --> 01:03:21,776
Why?

903
01:03:21,943 --> 01:03:23,778
Because...

904
01:03:23,945 --> 01:03:25,780
I got a girl up there,

905
01:03:25,947 --> 01:03:27,991
and I should have...

906
01:03:28,158 --> 01:03:30,201
I... l never...

907
01:03:30,368 --> 01:03:32,203
I want to tell her
that I love her.

908
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,706
Gosh.

909
01:03:34,873 --> 01:03:36,708
He loves her.

910
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:38,418
That changes everything.

911
01:03:38,585 --> 01:03:40,003
Okay, uncle.

912
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:41,546
Sit down. Sit down right now.

913
01:03:41,713 --> 01:03:43,715
Down! Down!

914
01:03:43,882 --> 01:03:45,633
And don't say another word.

915
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,597
Look, I'm a simple person.

916
01:03:50,764 --> 01:03:52,390
I do an honest day's work.

917
01:03:52,557 --> 01:03:54,559
Why does everybody
make it so hard for me?

918
01:03:54,726 --> 01:03:57,103
You're switching bodies.
You're stealing Exit Passes.

919
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:59,105
I work a long enough day
as it is.

920
01:03:59,272 --> 01:04:01,066
Look, you can take my soul.
I don't need it.

921
01:04:01,232 --> 01:04:02,752
You can turn me into
a paper doll, too.

922
01:04:02,859 --> 01:04:04,319
Just please...
Just give me one hour.

923
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:06,237
That's it.

924
01:04:06,404 --> 01:04:08,948
Assistant: Hey.
Hey, I love my girlfriend.

925
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:16,081
Well

926
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:20,085
you're gonna need a new body.

927
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:25,840
You know

928
01:04:28,718 --> 01:04:29,969
I don't generally do this,

929
01:04:30,136 --> 01:04:32,639
but I really like
your comic strip.

930
01:04:32,806 --> 01:04:34,516
Really?

931
01:04:34,682 --> 01:04:36,017
Yeah, it slays me.

932
01:04:36,184 --> 01:04:37,644
Death, coming from you, that's...

933
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:39,145
You know, that's...

934
01:04:39,312 --> 01:04:40,563
It's nothing,

935
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:42,249
but turn around
before I change my mind.

936
01:04:42,273 --> 01:04:43,608
Turn around.

937
01:04:45,151 --> 01:04:47,821
All right, could you
bend over, Stu, please?

938
01:04:47,987 --> 01:04:49,989
- Bend over?
- Yeah, just bend over.

939
01:04:53,743 --> 01:04:55,495
All right.

940
01:04:55,662 --> 01:04:57,122
- Bye-bye!
- Waah!

941
01:05:01,668 --> 01:05:04,003
Come on. Come... Yeah. Come on.

942
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,505
Fresh pancreas.

943
01:05:05,672 --> 01:05:07,799
That ought to pay
for that new Mercedes.

944
01:05:07,966 --> 01:05:11,469
And preparing to detach
my round-the-world cruise.

945
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:17,851
Where am I?

946
01:05:20,812 --> 01:05:22,522
What's wrong with my neck?

947
01:05:22,689 --> 01:05:24,524
You broke it!
You're an organ donor!

948
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:30,113
Those are our organs!

949
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,365
Get back on that slab!

950
01:05:33,408 --> 01:05:37,537
I need this body!

951
01:05:37,704 --> 01:05:39,747
- So get back...
- Hey!

952
01:05:39,914 --> 01:05:41,666
cause I got a...

953
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:43,042
It's a bone saw!

954
01:05:43,209 --> 01:05:45,044
Yeah! Hah!

955
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:48,715
Somebody get him!

956
01:05:54,512 --> 01:05:56,264
Sir, are you okay?

957
01:06:01,394 --> 01:06:03,062
- Hey!
- Get him! Get him!

958
01:06:04,397 --> 01:06:05,899
Get back here with that body!

959
01:06:06,065 --> 01:06:07,400
Whoa!

960
01:06:07,567 --> 01:06:09,402
What are you doing?

961
01:06:09,569 --> 01:06:12,071
- Sorry! Sorry!
- That's our body!

962
01:06:12,238 --> 01:06:13,865
Whoa!

963
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:24,209
- There he goes!
- There he is!

964
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:25,877
By the fence! Get him! Get him!

965
01:06:26,044 --> 01:06:27,754
Let's go! Let's head him off!

966
01:06:55,114 --> 01:06:58,201
Hey, Mr. Snyder. Hey!

967
01:06:58,368 --> 01:07:01,871
Wow. Garden's looking good.

968
01:07:02,038 --> 01:07:07,502
I apologize for
my appearance, but I'm your...

969
01:07:07,669 --> 01:07:10,755
Please, please, please,
just don't call the cops, okay?

970
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:13,299
Doc! Doc!

971
01:07:13,466 --> 01:07:15,301
Julie!

972
01:07:38,157 --> 01:07:39,951
Buster!

973
01:07:40,118 --> 01:07:42,287
Ooh, how you been, buddy?

974
01:07:42,453 --> 01:07:43,813
You been good?
You been a good dog?

975
01:07:43,955 --> 01:07:45,373
Yeah? What you got here for me?

976
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,417
What's this?

977
01:07:49,168 --> 01:07:51,504
I look like an idiot.

978
01:07:55,675 --> 01:07:57,176
Damn!

979
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,321
Stay. Stay.

980
01:08:16,487 --> 01:08:17,989
Good dog.

981
01:08:24,871 --> 01:08:27,248
Hi! Sorry! Excuse me!

982
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,877
Hey, bus! Wait!

983
01:08:32,003 --> 01:08:33,588
Hey!

984
01:08:37,717 --> 01:08:40,178
Hey.

985
01:08:42,347 --> 01:08:43,890
Sorry.

986
01:08:50,438 --> 01:08:52,565
The organs are, in transit.

987
01:08:52,732 --> 01:08:54,609
There he is! He's on the bus!

988
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:56,277
They're in perfect
working order.

989
01:08:56,444 --> 01:08:59,072
They're working even better
than we expected.

990
01:09:05,453 --> 01:09:08,331
So let's see what this

991
01:09:08,498 --> 01:09:11,626
particulate solution is all about.

992
01:09:19,175 --> 01:09:21,761
Damn, what the hell
is this stuff?

993
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,943
Man. This is weird.

994
01:10:04,053 --> 01:10:05,888
Hey, come back here, you!

995
01:10:06,055 --> 01:10:07,974
My God. We've got a flasher.

996
01:10:08,141 --> 01:10:09,726
Isn't that Herb?

997
01:10:09,892 --> 01:10:11,728
Must be some sort
of publicity stunt.

998
01:10:11,894 --> 01:10:14,480
The clothes...
Clothes have turned evil!

999
01:10:14,647 --> 01:10:16,065
They're working together!

1000
01:10:16,232 --> 01:10:18,735
Shirts! Socks! Whole ensembles!

1001
01:10:18,901 --> 01:10:20,737
For God's sake,
so get rid of your tie!

1002
01:10:20,903 --> 01:10:23,281
No, no, no! Herb, you ding-dong.

1003
01:10:25,283 --> 01:10:26,909
Get back here! Stop!

1004
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:32,331
Ladies and gentlemen.

1005
01:10:32,498 --> 01:10:35,209
Forget about the naked man
with the purple face.

1006
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,340
Your incredible,
misguided generosity

1007
01:10:41,507 --> 01:10:43,843
has made this a very
special day for the museum

1008
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,929
and also a very special day
for me,

1009
01:10:47,096 --> 01:10:50,349
all thanks
to a very special lady,

1010
01:10:50,516 --> 01:10:52,185
Ms. Julie McElroy.

1011
01:10:52,351 --> 01:10:54,687
Julie, take a bow!

1012
01:10:54,854 --> 01:10:58,483
On your feet, girl!
Give it up for Julie!

1013
01:10:58,649 --> 01:11:01,194
Stand up! Stand up!

1014
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,695
Looking good!

1015
01:12:23,609 --> 01:12:26,612
You're mighty mighty,
and I'm letting it all hang out.

1016
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:29,198
How 'bout it, Julie?

1017
01:12:31,951 --> 01:12:34,120
But it... it looks so new.

1018
01:12:34,287 --> 01:12:38,791
Well, that's because it is new.

1019
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:41,252
But the heirloom ring,

1020
01:12:41,419 --> 01:12:43,170
your grandmother's ring.

1021
01:12:43,337 --> 01:12:44,797
What?

1022
01:12:44,964 --> 01:12:46,883
You want a used ring?

1023
01:12:49,969 --> 01:12:51,846
There he is!

1024
01:13:02,273 --> 01:13:05,151
Get him! Stop that dead man!

1025
01:13:05,318 --> 01:13:07,361
We're doctors!

1026
01:13:07,528 --> 01:13:10,656
We don't want to hurt you!
We just want your organs!

1027
01:13:13,284 --> 01:13:14,660
Stop running!

1028
01:13:14,827 --> 01:13:16,829
- No!
- Then you'll be sued!

1029
01:13:16,996 --> 01:13:19,749
- Fine!
- Damn you, dead man!

1030
01:13:37,642 --> 01:13:39,226
- Hey!
- Invitation only.

1031
01:13:39,393 --> 01:13:42,772
We don't need invitations.
We've got diplomas.

1032
01:13:46,192 --> 01:13:48,069
Julie.

1033
01:13:48,235 --> 01:13:51,572
Operators are standing by.
Offer expires at midnight.

1034
01:13:57,703 --> 01:13:59,413
Doc, don't do it!

1035
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:02,166
He isn't Stu! He's Monkeybone!

1036
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:05,711
All right, let's go. That's it.

1037
01:14:05,878 --> 01:14:07,630
Say, babe,

1038
01:14:07,797 --> 01:14:09,715
what did that creep call you?

1039
01:14:09,882 --> 01:14:12,551
He called me Doc.

1040
01:14:12,718 --> 01:14:14,512
Woman: Show me the monkey!

1041
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:16,764
Crowd: Show me the monkey!

1042
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:18,391
Show me the monkey!

1043
01:14:18,557 --> 01:14:21,268
Come on, fella. Let's go.

1044
01:14:21,435 --> 01:14:22,561
- That's it.
- Please.

1045
01:14:22,728 --> 01:14:25,815
Please! I have to talk
to this man.

1046
01:14:25,982 --> 01:14:28,109
Okay.

1047
01:14:28,275 --> 01:14:31,529
Who are you?
Why did you say those things?

1048
01:14:31,696 --> 01:14:34,281
Doc, it's all a mix-up.

1049
01:14:34,448 --> 01:14:35,866
We were in the Land of Death,

1050
01:14:36,033 --> 01:14:37,576
he stole my Exit Pass,

1051
01:14:37,743 --> 01:14:39,620
and that's how Monkeybone
got my body.

1052
01:14:39,787 --> 01:14:44,375
See? All they had left for me
was this stinking corpse.

1053
01:14:46,293 --> 01:14:47,420
Thank you.

1054
01:14:47,586 --> 01:14:50,256
Doc! No, don't walk away!

1055
01:14:50,423 --> 01:14:53,551
He's only here
to give people nightmares!

1056
01:14:53,718 --> 01:14:55,678
Doc, the dream!

1057
01:14:55,845 --> 01:14:57,513
Don't you remember?

1058
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,725
They were pulling the plug,
and I called out to you!

1059
01:15:00,891 --> 01:15:03,102
And you heard me, remember?

1060
01:15:07,773 --> 01:15:09,358
Buster?

1061
01:15:12,361 --> 01:15:13,696
Aw, come here, fella.

1062
01:15:17,783 --> 01:15:19,910
Don't lie to me.

1063
01:15:22,163 --> 01:15:24,999
Is it?

1064
01:15:25,166 --> 01:15:27,126
Is it you?

1065
01:15:27,293 --> 01:15:30,212
I had to come back, Julie.

1066
01:15:30,379 --> 01:15:32,631
I had to give you this.

1067
01:15:39,096 --> 01:15:40,639
I meant to give it
to you before,

1068
01:15:40,806 --> 01:15:42,892
the night it happened.

1069
01:15:47,146 --> 01:15:50,149
I was happy, Julie.

1070
01:15:50,316 --> 01:15:51,692
I really was.

1071
01:15:51,859 --> 01:15:56,489
Just try to remember me
like that, okay

1072
01:15:58,657 --> 01:16:00,534
<i>not like this.</i>

1073
01:16:08,375 --> 01:16:09,668
What's wrong?

1074
01:16:09,835 --> 01:16:12,546
I'm crying, too.

1075
01:16:12,713 --> 01:16:15,299
I just don't have any tears.

1076
01:16:15,466 --> 01:16:17,468
I'm all dried up.

1077
01:16:20,429 --> 01:16:22,598
Lemmings and gerbils!

1078
01:16:22,765 --> 01:16:24,517
You know the next part.

1079
01:16:24,683 --> 01:16:26,018
It's 50 bucks a swat.

1080
01:16:26,185 --> 01:16:27,520
Who's up first?

1081
01:16:27,686 --> 01:16:30,856
Yeah! No, this one's on me.

1082
01:16:31,023 --> 01:16:33,609
Here's your bat, babe.
Step right up.

1083
01:16:36,028 --> 01:16:37,863
Just cock the bat like this.

1084
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:39,657
- That's good. Just...
- Alice: Julie?

1085
01:16:39,824 --> 01:16:42,576
It's all right. It's okay.

1086
01:16:46,622 --> 01:16:47,957
We have to stop this.

1087
01:16:48,124 --> 01:16:49,851
Those dolls have been
tampered with. They're toxic.

1088
01:16:49,875 --> 01:16:52,044
No, that's okay.
Hey, no problem.

1089
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:55,005
No.

1090
01:16:55,172 --> 01:16:58,050
Monkeybone.

1091
01:16:59,677 --> 01:17:01,428
Back in the pack.

1092
01:17:01,595 --> 01:17:03,514
Stu?

1093
01:17:03,681 --> 01:17:05,724
I mean it this time.

1094
01:17:05,891 --> 01:17:07,768
Back in the pack!

1095
01:17:10,563 --> 01:17:13,858
I can explain everything.

1096
01:17:14,024 --> 01:17:15,734
I was tired of being
a figment, see?

1097
01:17:15,901 --> 01:17:18,046
It's dirty, menial work.
It's kind of like being a pool boy,

1098
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:19,670
but even pool boys have
their own bodies.

1099
01:17:19,697 --> 01:17:20,937
Don't I at least deserve a body?

1100
01:17:21,031 --> 01:17:22,074
Not my body!

1101
01:17:22,241 --> 01:17:25,911
You get back in the pack,
you bastard!

1102
01:17:28,539 --> 01:17:29,957
Back in the pack?

1103
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:34,461
With the stinky gym socks
and the moldy cheese sticks?

1104
01:17:34,628 --> 01:17:37,214
No! I've got the body,

1105
01:17:37,381 --> 01:17:42,261
and I am never getting back
in that goddamn pack! Meh.

1106
01:17:42,428 --> 01:17:43,596
Waah!

1107
01:17:47,975 --> 01:17:50,769
Please, no! They're dangerous!
No, you can't!

1108
01:18:00,988 --> 01:18:03,240
Come on.

1109
01:18:08,954 --> 01:18:11,290
Excuse me.

1110
01:18:27,348 --> 01:18:29,058
What is he doing?

1111
01:18:30,434 --> 01:18:31,477
He's gonna jump.

1112
01:18:35,648 --> 01:18:37,149
I love you.

1113
01:18:53,165 --> 01:18:57,044
- No!
- Monkeybone!

1114
01:19:00,005 --> 01:19:01,924
Hey, stop! Let go! Let go!

1115
01:19:02,091 --> 01:19:03,425
Did you sleep with my girl?

1116
01:19:03,592 --> 01:19:04,843
Sleep with her?

1117
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,679
We did the whole
"Kama Sutra" twice.

1118
01:19:06,845 --> 01:19:09,974
Yeah? Where's her birthmark?

1119
01:19:18,816 --> 01:19:20,859
Come on!

1120
01:19:37,376 --> 01:19:39,795
Bingo!

1121
01:19:41,672 --> 01:19:43,173
Hey, where'd you get that body?

1122
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,717
It's a loaner, okay?!

1123
01:19:44,883 --> 01:19:47,386
You sprung a leak?

1124
01:19:52,057 --> 01:19:53,517
Boy: Ooh.

1125
01:19:54,727 --> 01:19:57,563
I think it can be saved.
Put it on ice.

1126
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:58,981
- Hike!
- Hut!

1127
01:19:59,148 --> 01:20:01,692
Stu: Don't move.
I'm coming at you!

1128
01:20:01,859 --> 01:20:03,402
Aah!

1129
01:20:03,569 --> 01:20:05,571
Damn it!

1130
01:20:05,738 --> 01:20:07,531
Boy: Over here!

1131
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:11,327
- Whoa.
- I'll take that, young man!

1132
01:20:16,707 --> 01:20:18,584
Here, have another!

1133
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:20,127
I'm dead!

1134
01:20:23,797 --> 01:20:25,132
No! Stop!

1135
01:20:25,299 --> 01:20:26,592
That's ours!

1136
01:20:29,428 --> 01:20:30,804
- Hey! Hey!
- Thanks.

1137
01:20:30,971 --> 01:20:32,348
Mine!

1138
01:20:33,474 --> 01:20:35,267
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

1139
01:20:35,434 --> 01:20:37,436
Aah!

1140
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:48,113
Come on, Monkeybone.

1141
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,948
Let's do it!

1142
01:20:50,115 --> 01:20:51,950
Mano y mano!

1143
01:20:52,117 --> 01:20:55,287
Hey, Stu, I got an idea,
joint custody!

1144
01:20:55,454 --> 01:20:56,789
I get the body on the weekends.

1145
01:20:56,955 --> 01:20:58,457
- You get...
- Shut up!

1146
01:20:59,666 --> 01:21:02,711
- I think I can bring 'em down.
- Julie: No!

1147
01:21:02,878 --> 01:21:05,214
Please, wait!

1148
01:21:39,498 --> 01:21:42,334
Monkeybone: Where's my body?
Where's my body?

1149
01:21:42,501 --> 01:21:43,752
You mean my body!

1150
01:21:43,919 --> 01:21:46,088
Crap! We're dead!

1151
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:51,390
A hundred bucks on the monkey!
A hundred bucks!

1152
01:21:51,468 --> 01:21:54,680
Stu: You hunk of cloth!

1153
01:22:06,442 --> 01:22:07,776
Go! Go!

1154
01:22:17,077 --> 01:22:18,745
Closing time.

1155
01:22:18,912 --> 01:22:20,747
Monkey killer! Monkey...

1156
01:22:38,432 --> 01:22:41,435
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1157
01:22:41,602 --> 01:22:43,937
Whoo hoo hoo. Hey.

1158
01:22:44,104 --> 01:22:45,564
Stu: Death.

1159
01:22:45,731 --> 01:22:47,399
Stu!

1160
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:49,109
You think I gilded the lily
a little?

1161
01:22:49,276 --> 01:22:52,112
I do like to dress up
when I come DownTown.

1162
01:22:52,279 --> 01:22:54,573
So how was she?

1163
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:57,910
She...

1164
01:22:58,076 --> 01:23:00,204
She was beautiful.

1165
01:23:01,914 --> 01:23:04,082
Of course, I was decomposing
at the time,

1166
01:23:04,249 --> 01:23:08,962
but at least now she knows
how much I love her.

1167
01:23:10,756 --> 01:23:12,216
So I guess I'm yours.

1168
01:23:12,382 --> 01:23:14,426
Excuse me, Death.

1169
01:23:14,593 --> 01:23:17,471
I hate to break up
this little love fest,

1170
01:23:17,638 --> 01:23:19,932
but my little bladder
is about to burst.

1171
01:23:21,099 --> 01:23:26,104
But I really gotta go!

1172
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,289
Hey, where... where's Monkeybone?

1173
01:23:44,456 --> 01:23:46,625
Back in your head,
where he belongs.

1174
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:48,794
You know, Stu, I don't want
to hurt your feelings,

1175
01:23:48,961 --> 01:23:50,796
but on your own,
you're a tad vanilla,

1176
01:23:50,963 --> 01:23:52,440
so I didn't want
to send you back without him.

1177
01:23:52,464 --> 01:23:54,299
What? Back? You...

1178
01:23:54,466 --> 01:23:56,301
Did you...
You're sending me back?

1179
01:23:56,468 --> 01:23:58,136
Yeah, I'm sending you back.

1180
01:23:58,303 --> 01:24:00,347
Thank you. Death...

1181
01:24:00,514 --> 01:24:01,890
I like you.

1182
01:24:02,057 --> 01:24:03,892
I'll take
the "South Park" guys instead.

1183
01:24:04,059 --> 01:24:05,644
I hear they're dying to meet me.

1184
01:24:05,811 --> 01:24:07,980
Come on, Stu. Come on.
Turn around.

1185
01:24:08,146 --> 01:24:09,731
Right. So I should assume the...

1186
01:24:09,898 --> 01:24:11,024
Yeah,

1187
01:24:12,526 --> 01:24:13,819
- Stu?
- Yeah?

1188
01:24:13,986 --> 01:24:15,988
Little higher.

1189
01:24:21,785 --> 01:24:23,245
See you!

1190
01:24:23,412 --> 01:24:27,791
Waah ha ha ha ha!

1191
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:33,505
Excuse me. That's our corpse!

1192
01:24:33,672 --> 01:24:36,049
We've been chasing it
all over town!

1193
01:24:36,216 --> 01:24:37,676
Help yourself, pal.

1194
01:24:37,843 --> 01:24:40,137
All right, smart-ass.

1195
01:24:40,304 --> 01:24:42,472
You prepared to cooperate now?

1196
01:24:43,515 --> 01:24:44,850
Whoa.

1197
01:24:52,733 --> 01:24:55,986
Buddy, can I borrow your, um...

1198
01:24:56,153 --> 01:24:59,031
Thank you.

1199
01:25:07,414 --> 01:25:09,374
Hey, buddy, how are you?

1200
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:12,044
How are you?

1201
01:25:27,184 --> 01:25:29,186
Is it you?

1202
01:25:31,021 --> 01:25:33,774
Is it really you this time?

1203
01:25:46,411 --> 01:25:48,914
People, for the love of God,

1204
01:25:49,081 --> 01:25:51,208
take off your clothes!

1205
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:54,252
Take off your clothes!
