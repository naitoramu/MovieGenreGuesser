1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:07,508
I can't believe we've never
done this. It's so good!

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:11,845
It's so good for Monica.

3
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,475
Time's up! My turn.

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,104
- That was half an hour?
- It's your timer.

5
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:27,444
I don't like to brag about it,
but I give the best massages.

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:32,073
All right, then massage me up
right nice!

7
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,162
It's so good, isn't it?

8
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:41,166
I don't know what
I did to deserve it.

9
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,377
Say goodbye to sore muscles!

10
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,713
Goodbye, muscles!

11
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,342
The One with Joey's Bag

12
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,600
She gives the worst massages ever!

13
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,354
It was like she was torturing me
for information.

14
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,817
I wanted to give it up.
I just didn't know what it was!

15
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,777
If it hurts that bad,
you should tell her.

16
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,781
For the first time,
I'm in a real relationship.

17
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:58,702
I won't screw that up
by telling the truth.

18
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,830
Dude, look out!

19
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,248
You almost crushed my hat.

20
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,250
Sorry.

21
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:09,046
And the bunny got away.

22
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:20,807
This would be the place
where you explain the hat.

23
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,935
There's this play, right?

24
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:27,147
I'm up for the part of this
cool, suave, international guy.

25
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,232
A clothes horse, so I figure...

26
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:34,029
...everyone at the audition will
wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

27
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,032
And you'll make them disappear?

28
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:42,037
Like you could find something
this sophisticated.

29
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,373
Done!

30
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:48,877
If you want to look good,
come to the store. I'll help you.

31
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,587
- Thanks!
- Sure.

32
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,841
Please, take those off!

33
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,178
Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?

34
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,182
Only okay. Because I just
got back from the hospital.

35
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,850
Are you all right?

36
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:08,606
I'm fine.
But my grandma sort of died.

37
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,606
Pheebs, sorry.

38
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:10,775
It's okay.

39
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,984
She had a really incredible life.

40
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:17,823
It's not like I won't see her again.
She'll visit.

41
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,493
Maybe she's with us right now.

42
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:26,665
Right. She's on a new spiritual plain
and she'll come to the coffeehouse.

43
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:31,920
I just saw two people having sex
in a car right outside!

44
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,759
Pheebs' grandmother just died.

45
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,512
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

46
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,931
Actually, it's kind of cool.
Because it's like...

47
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:47,478
...you know, one life ends
and another begins.

48
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,439
Not the way they're doing it.

49
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,484
What happened?
How did she die?

50
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,819
We were in the market...

51
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,741
...and she bent down to get some yogurt
and never came back up again.

52
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,285
I'm so sorry.

53
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,454
The last thing she said was:

54
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:10,959
"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,
and we'll meet at the checkout counter."

55
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,420
You know what?

56
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,673
We will meet at the checkout counter.

57
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,724
Since you're returning
all this stuff...

58
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,935
...you'll have to wear underwear.

59
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:33,565
All right.
You'd better show me that too.

60
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,319
It's missing something.

61
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,160
Really? A purse?

62
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,747
It's not a purse.
It's a shoulder bag.

63
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,458
It looks like a woman's purse.

64
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,795
Trust me, all the men are carrying
them in the spring catalog.

65
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,341
See, look.
Men carrying the bag.

66
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,804
See, look.
Women carrying the bag.

67
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:15,983
But it is odd how a woman's purse
looks so good on me, a man.

68
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,277
Exactly. Unisex!

69
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:23,198
Maybe you need sex.
I had sex a couple days ago.

70
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:28,286
No, Joey. U-N-I sex.

71
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,374
I ain't going to say no to that!

72
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,091
- Who is it?
- It's Phoebe.

73
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,343
Oh, great!

74
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,971
Oh, you.

75
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,974
What's up?

76
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:54,229
Well, I sort of have some bad news.
Can I come in?

77
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,065
No, thanks.

78
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,739
Grandma died today.

79
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,617
Didn't she die like five years ago?

80
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,787
No, she just died today.

81
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,873
We're having
a memorial service tomorrow.

82
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,876
Okay, I know I went to that already.

83
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,586
No, you didn't!

84
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,379
Then who's been dead?

85
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,341
Lots of people!

86
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,970
Look, are you coming or not?

87
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:34,019
I thought she was dead,
so I've made my peace.

88
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,937
Plus I'm going to a concert.

89
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:41,235
I'd invite you,
but I only have two tickets left.

90
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:47,241
- Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
- Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!

91
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,505
You look just like your son,
Mrs. Tribbiani.

92
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:06,093
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

93
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,680
I thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too.

94
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,017
It's got compartments for your
wallet, keys, address book...

95
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,645
Your makeup.

96
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,982
What are you doing?
The audition's tomorrow.

97
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:23,152
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.

98
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,196
You get mustard on that bag,
you can't return it.

99
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,240
Why would I return this?
I love this bag!

100
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:33,036
- All right, then you owe me $350.
- Fine.

101
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:37,833
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?

102
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:43,714
Relax, I'll pay you with the money
from the job I'll get. Thanks to you.

103
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,842
What's the part? Auntie Mame?

104
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,970
Don't listen to them.
I think it's sexy.

105
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,557
You-and-I sexy?

106
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,149
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.
Thank you for coming.

107
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,944
Here's your 3-D glasses.

108
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,283
Reverend Pong will say
when to put them on.

109
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,703
Hi, sweetie.

110
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,080
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.

111
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,293
Hey, Pheebs. I'm so sorry.

112
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:25,672
You know what?
My grandma had the exact same bag!

113
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,133
I brought you flowers.

114
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,884
Oh, thanks!

115
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:33,597
Pulling flowers out
makes the bag look masculine.

116
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,351
Excuse me, is this the memorial?

117
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,269
Welcome.

118
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,272
Here's your 3-D glasses.

119
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,442
All right.

120
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,902
So how did you know Frances?

121
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,780
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.

122
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,743
But I was pretty tight
with her and her daughter.

123
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,119
What's your name?

124
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,623
Frank Buffay.

125
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:05,670
You know what? Strike that.
My name, actually, is Joe.

126
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,464
Joe Hill.

127
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,548
You're Frank Buf...

128
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,219
No! Joe Hill.

129
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,470
You just said...

130
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,058
I got to go.
Thank you so much for coming.

131
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,854
Oh, my God!

132
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,355
What happened?

133
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,358
That was my dad.

134
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,402
Check it out!

135
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:32,197
It's like it's coming right at me.

136
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,997
- Did you catch him?
- What did he say?

137
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:45,461
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."

138
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,838
I couldn't give him my real name.

139
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,172
Why not?

140
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,841
You saw the way he ran.

141
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,885
You think he'd talk
to the daughter he abandoned?

142
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,846
What did you say to him?

143
00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:00,309
I said I was the executor of the will
and I needed to talk to him.

144
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,353
I'm going to meet him
at the coffeehouse.

145
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,481
Could everyone take their seats?

146
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,359
I just can't think about that now.

147
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,445
I want to say goodbye to my grandma.

148
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,531
Let's go say goodbye.

149
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,797
I'm off to my audition.
How do I look?

150
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,633
Great!
That bag will get you that part.

151
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,011
And a date with a man.

152
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:40,557
You know what? Make fun all you want.
This is a great bag.

153
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,476
And it's as handy as it is becoming.

154
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:48,065
Just because you don't understand
something, doesn't make it wrong.

155
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,735
You guys have to get used
to the fact that Joey...

156
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,280
...comes with a bag!

157
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,699
I've got to meet my dad.

158
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,618
Will you tell him who you are?

159
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,454
Not at first.
I don't want to freak him out.

160
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,581
But aren't you pissed at him?

161
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,750
This guy abandoned you.

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,296
If it were me, this guy would be
in some serious physical danger.

163
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:16,260
I'd walk in there,
I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!"

164
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,556
"You and me, outside.
Right now!"

165
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:23,434
I kind of scared myself.

166
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,313
Well, at least you scared someone.

167
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,523
You'd think I'd be angry.

168
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:34,486
You'd think I'd want to rip
his tiny little head off!

169
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,280
Fortunately, I'm past it.

170
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,493
You do seem a little tense.
Here, let me help you.

171
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,495
Get off!

172
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,290
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?

173
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,751
What are you talking about?

174
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,879
As a masseuse and a human...

175
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:56,258
...I'm begging you,
never do that to anyone!

176
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,678
I give good massages.

177
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:05,059
I gave them to Rachel
before she got allergic.

178
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:10,481
And Chandler, he loves them!
Watch.

179
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,067
He does not like it.
He's in pain!

180
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:16,195
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is!

181
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:21,533
- What?
- I'm sorry but...

182
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,954
You've been lying to me?

183
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,790
I can't believe that.

184
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,042
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.

185
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:35,088
But the minute we start
to lie to each other...

186
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,300
And by "we"...

187
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,803
...I mean society.

188
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,890
Anytime you're ready.

189
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,185
Well, you must be new here.

190
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,729
Maybe we get a table,
I buy you a drink.

191
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,774
Could you try it without the purse?

192
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,445
Yeah, sure.

193
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,785
Well, you must be new here.
Maybe we sit...

194
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,537
Can I ask you something?

195
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:07,788
Sure. What?

196
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:12,125
Well, first,
it's not a purse.

197
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:13,627
Anytime.

198
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,338
If you think
it's a woman's bag, it's not.

199
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,132
It's a man's bag.

200
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,803
Okay. And go!

201
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,014
Let me show you the catalog.

202
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,976
Look. See?

203
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,393
It's the latest thing.

204
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,522
Everyone's got one.
Men, women, children.

205
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,650
Do you sell these?

206
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:42,030
No, these babies sell themselves.

207
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,657
Thank you.
That was great.

208
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,450
But I didn't read anything.

209
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,371
I think we've seen enough.

210
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,165
All right, I'll see you.

211
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,752
We got it. We got it.

212
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,338
Is Rachel here?

213
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,594
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
about the whole massage thing.

214
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,388
I really like them.

215
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,724
Please stop!

216
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,019
We're supposed to be honest.

217
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:17,357
I wish you could tell me,
"I don't like your massages."

218
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:24,572
I don't like your massages.

219
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,493
See? It's no big deal.

220
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,537
But now you're crying!

221
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:35,917
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying about something at work.

222
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:39,838
My boyfriend said
he didn't like my massages.

223
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,507
You don't have
to be best at everything.

224
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:47,930
Oh, my God!
You don't know me at all!

225
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,225
You give the worst massages
in the world.

226
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,895
I'm crying here!

227
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,355
Look, hear me out.

228
00:14:56,605 --> 00:15:00,609
You give the best bad massages.

229
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,904
If anybody was looking
for the best bad massage...

230
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,365
...and they thought,
"Who's the best?"

231
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,660
They'd have to go to you.

232
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,459
So you're saying that
if there was an award...

233
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,297
...for the best bad massage...
Who would get that?

234
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,133
It would be you!

235
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:28,470
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.

236
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,682
So they could call the award,
"The Monica"?

237
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,061
Absolutely.

238
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,900
I suck!

239
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,907
Thank you for meeting me.

240
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,949
Thank you.

241
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,203
Come sit.

242
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,372
Sit.

243
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,625
Sit!

244
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,920
Alrighty.
Before we get started, I need you...

245
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:06,342
...to state for the record
that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.

246
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:10,096
Yes, I am.

247
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,224
What did Frances leave me?

248
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,811
That's why you wanted me to come.

249
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,399
Yes, she did. She left you...

250
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,777
...this lipstick.

251
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:32,826
It's used.

252
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,580
Cool!

253
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:44,421
I have just a few questions to ask,
so I'll get out my official forms.

254
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,758
So question one:

255
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,846
You were married to Frances'
daughter, Lilly. Correct?

256
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,724
Yes, I was.

257
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,643
Question two:
Did that marriage end...

258
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,521
A: Happily?

259
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,023
B: Medium?

260
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,443
Or C: In the total abandonment...

261
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,362
...of her and her two children?

262
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:10,823
It really says that?

263
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,701
Yeah, see?

264
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:18,080
I guess then I would have to say C.

265
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,375
Total abandonment.

266
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,210
Reasons for abandonment:

267
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,005
A: Top secret government work.

268
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,424
B: Amnesia.

269
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:31,969
Or C: You're just a selfish,
irresponsible...

270
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,930
...bad, bad man.

271
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,142
I don't want the lipstick that much.

272
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,646
Would you do me a favor?

273
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,315
Would you give Lilly...

274
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,443
...that, please?

275
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,862
When you see Lilly,
give her that note.

276
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,823
I wanted to talk to her
at the memorial...

277
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:58,287
...but I pictured her getting mad
the way you did, and I chickened out.

278
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:01,040
I wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?

279
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,668
But you came to see Lilly?

280
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,795
Yeah. Why?

281
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,423
Lilly's dead.

282
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,759
She what?

283
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,385
She's dead.

284
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,636
Are you sure?

285
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:19,141
If she isn't, cremating her
was a big mistake.

286
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,269
I can't believe this.
I just can't believe...

287
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,981
How?
Oh, my God.

288
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,149
How long ago?

289
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,360
17 years ago.

290
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:35,199
What about the girls?

291
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:41,955
Well, Ursula is a waitress
and she lives in Soho.

292
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,668
And Phoebe...

293
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:49,213
...is on this couch.

294
00:18:55,344 --> 00:19:00,140
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.
Big day for you!

295
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,853
Phoebe, I...

296
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:10,108
It's just, I don't know what to say.

297
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:16,282
I just can't believe that you're
my daughter. You're so pretty.

298
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:20,703
Yes, well, that's neither
here nor there.

299
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,247
Would it make you feel
better if I said...

300
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:29,628
...that I was very, very sorry I left?

301
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,674
It doesn't matter what you say.
It won't make a difference.

302
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,927
So you can just go.

303
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:42,349
Well, you know, in my defense,
I was a lousy father.

304
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,143
- That's your defense?
- Yes, it is.

305
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:49,398
I burned the formula,
and I put your diapers on backwards.

306
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:54,862
I made up a song to sing to you,
but that made you cry even more.

307
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,280
You make up songs?

308
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,616
Well, no, just that one.
But it was stupid.

309
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:03,829
Let's see, how did it go?

310
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,457
<i>Sleepy girl, sleepy girl</i>

311
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,836
<i>Why won't you go to sleep?</i>

312
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,797
<i>Sleepy girl, sleepy girl</i>

313
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,717
<i>You're keeping me up</i>

314
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,697
I'm not very good at this.

315
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,285
Well, I am.

316
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,958
Not yet. No.

317
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,007
How'd the audition go?

318
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,675
Estelle said I didn't get it.

319
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:02,179
What? Why?
Joey, you were so ready for it.

320
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,764
I thought so too...

321
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,642
...but the casting people
had problems with me.

322
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,143
What kind of problem?

323
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,979
To tell you the truth...

324
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,984
...they had a problem with the bag!

325
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,236
You know what?
It was a stupid play anyway.

326
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,447
It's time to give up the bag.

327
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,283
I don't want to give up the bag.

328
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:27,580
I don't have to give it up,
do I, Rach?

329
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,917
You think I should give up the bag!

330
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:38,131
Joey, I'm sorry. As terrific
as I think you are with it...

331
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:45,013
...I just don't know if the world
is ready for you and your bag.

332
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,558
I can't believe this!

333
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:51,979
Wait, I'm not saying
you shouldn't have a bag.

334
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:56,942
There are other bags
that are maybe a little less...

335
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,486
...controversial.

336
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:03,949
Yeah, they're called wallets.
