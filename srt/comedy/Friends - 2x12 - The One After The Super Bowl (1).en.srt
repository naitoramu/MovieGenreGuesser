00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,342
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,846
<i>Can't get the monkey off your back?</i>

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,265
<i>Then put it in your mouth...</i>

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,309
<i>... with Monkeyshine Beer!</i>

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,896
<i>Get it, monkey</i>

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,608
<i>Get it, get it, monkey</i>

8
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,527
<i>Monkey, monkey</i>

9
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,153
<i>Monkeyshine Beer.</i>

10
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,031
<i>Because it's a jungle out there!</i>

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,408
That commercial always
makes me so sad.

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,871
But then the guy opens his beer
and girls run at him...

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,372
...so everything works out okay.

14
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,501
I meant because the monkey
reminds me of Marcel.

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,794
I can see that.

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,757
Because they both have those big
brown eyes and the little pouty chin.

17
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,219
And the fact that
they're both monkeys?

18
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,097
I wonder if I did the right thing,
giving him away.

19
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:59,560
Ross, you had to. He was
humping everything in sight.

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:05,190
My Malibu Barbie will no longer
be wearing white to her wedding.

21
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,486
Remember when he'd borrow your hat...

22
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,989
...and when you got it back,
there'd be monkey raisins in it?

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,120
When he did it, it was funny.
When I did it to my boss's hat...

24
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,540
Suddenly, I had this big
"attitude problem".

27
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,675
Hey, check it out!
Guess what I got?

28
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,011
Rhythm?

29
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,890
No. My first fan mail!

30
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,059
"Dear Dr. Ramoray:

31
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,312
I love you and would do
anything to have you."

32
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:29,858
My gosh! "Your not-so-secret
admirer, Erika Ford."

33
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,234
Oh, wait.

34
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:37,116
"P.S. Enclosed, please find
14 of my eyelashes."

35
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:42,037
In Crazy World, that means
you're married.

36
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,417
It's not addressed to "Days Of Our Lives".
This came to your apartment.

37
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,128
She was in our building.

38
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,338
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,008
I got my very own stalker!

40
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,889
Where are you off to?

41
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,849
There's a paleontology
conference in L.A.

42
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,062
So I figured I'd go and drive down
to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

43
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:12,150
He will be surprised.
Till he realizes he's a monkey...

44
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,530
...and isn't capable of that emotion.

45
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,867
Phoebe? That really cute guy
is here again.

46
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,411
Okay, so everyone...

47
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,956
...pretend I'm telling you a story
and it's really funny.

48
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,835
So everyone just laugh. Now!

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,213
I know, I know!

50
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,425
I'm Rob Donan.

51
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,718
Hi, Rob Donan.

52
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:43,640
I don't know anything about music,
but I think you're really great.

53
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,896
Anyway, I schedule performers
for children's libraries.

54
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,776
And I was thinking, have you thought
about playing your songs for kids?

55
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:58,030
I would love to have kids...

56
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:04,912
...hear me play the songs
that I will write for them.

57
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,123
What do we do for dinner?

58
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,917
We could cook for ourselves.

59
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,758
<i>It's Erika.</i>

60
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,301
My God. The stalker!

61
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,262
<i>Never mind. It's open.</i>

62
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,807
Hitting her with a frying pan
is a good idea.

63
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:30,813
But we want a backup plan,
just in case she isn't a cartoon!

64
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,275
Let's get out of here!

65
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,530
The one time they're not home!

66
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,573
We'll leave.
When we pass her...

67
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,785
...she won't know me,
because we never met!

68
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:49,748
That's how radio stars
escape stalkers!

69
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,294
She's coming!

70
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,592
It's me.

71
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:03,637
This is it.
This is how we're gonna die.

72
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:04,846
You ready?

73
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,100
Wait, wait, wait!

74
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,901
Erika!

75
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,078
- Mr. Geller?
- Yes, hi.

76
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,997
Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

77
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,292
You had a question?

78
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,171
I can't find the monkey I donated
last year. He's a capuchin...

79
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,174
...answers to the name Marcel?

80
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,469
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

81
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:47,598
Marcel has passed on.

82
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,434
Oh, my God. What happened?

83
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,270
He got sick,
and then he got sicker...

84
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,814
...and then he got a little better.

85
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,234
But then he died.

86
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,612
I can't believe this!

87
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:06,617
I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.
But you know, there's an old saying:

88
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,954
"Sometimes monkeys die."

89
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,332
It's not a great saying...

90
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,835
...but it certainly is fitting today.

91
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,921
- Someone should've called me.
- I'm sorry.

92
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,008
Look, I know this can't
bring him back...

93
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,762
...but here, it's just a gesture.

94
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,347
Zoo dollars?

95
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:34,353
Yes, and come see the bird show
at 4. The macaws wear hats.

96
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:39,066
It's a lot cuter
if your monkey hasn't just died.

97
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,783
I know.

98
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,536
I can't believe Joey's having
lunch with his stalker!

99
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,246
What is she like?

100
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,873
You remember Kathy Bates in "Misery"?

101
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,002
Well, she looks
the exact opposite of that.

102
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,172
And she's not crazy?

103
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,798
Oh, no, no.
She's a total whack-job.

104
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:08,178
She thinks that Joey is
actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

105
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,138
Oh, my God!

106
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,974
And he's going out with her?

107
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,934
He cannot pursue this.

108
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,646
Just because this woman sees Joey
through the magical bo x...

109
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,440
...in her living room
doesn't mean she's not a person.

110
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:25,070
Does she not deserve happiness?
Does she not deserve love?

111
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,367
Why are you looking at me? He's
the one who wants to boff the maniac!

112
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,743
Are you okay?

113
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,954
No. I'm just nervous.

114
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,457
Maybe if I just picture them all
in their underwear...

115
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:43,380
That's not a good idea. That's
the reason the last guy got fired.

116
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,177
I'm used to playing for grownups.

117
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,722
Grownups drink their coffee
and do their grownup thing.

118
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,140
And kids...

119
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,475
...listen.

120
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,437
It's just a huge responsibility.

121
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,980
What?

122
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,983
Are you gonna kiss me?

123
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,737
I was thinking about it.

124
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,619
Alrighty! Let's play some tunes!

125
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:20,459
- Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.
- Hi, Phoebe!

126
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,257
I'm gonna play some songs
about grandparents, okay?

127
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,428
<i>Now Grandma's a person</i>
<i>Who everyone likes</i>

128
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,681
<i>She bought you a train</i>
<i>And a bright shiny bike</i>

129
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,852
<i>But lately she hasn't</i>
<i>Been coming to dinner</i>

130
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:42,314
<i>And last time you saw her</i>
<i>She looked so much thinner</i>

131
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,817
<i>Now your mom and your dad said</i>
<i>She moved to Peru</i>

132
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:51,031
<i>But the truth is she died</i>
<i>And someday you will too</i>

133
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:05,254
- Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
- Yeah, it is.

134
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,381
What?

135
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,300
Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...

136
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:14,847
...and a while ago you were
reattaching Simone's spinal cord.

137
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,808
That was a tricky one.

138
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,226
In reality...

139
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:24,231
...that operation takes 10 hours.
But they only showed it for 2 minutes.

140
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,858
Who's "they"?

141
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,654
No one.

142
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:35,117
Drake, you are so talented.
Let me see those hands.

143
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,537
Oh, these hands,
these beautiful hands.

144
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,747
I could just eat them.

145
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,250
But I won't.

146
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,878
Otherwise my watch would fall off.

147
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,011
No, seriously.

148
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,137
These hands...

149
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,056
...these miracle, magical,
life-giving hands.

150
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:03,270
Just to be near them, touch them,
maybe even lick one?

151
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,274
All right. Just one.

152
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,619
You're good at that.

153
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,871
Oh, my God! Someone!
He's choking!

154
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,249
Is anyone here a doctor?

155
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,501
Yes, the best doctor in Salem!

156
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,089
Dr. Drake Ramoray!

157
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:49,691
Meet me in the nocturnal
house in 15 minutes.

158
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:56,240
Hey, look. I don't really enjoy
being with other men that way.

159
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,451
But, zoo dollars?

160
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,287
It's about your monkey!

161
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:05,791
It's alive.

162
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,381
I don't understand.
Why didn't you help that man?

163
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,175
Because I'm a neurosurgeon...

164
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:19,179
...and that was clearly a case of...

165
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,098
..."foodal chokage".

166
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,438
I gotta tell you something...

167
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,566
You don't have to tell me anything.

168
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,152
You don't have to
explain yourself to me.

169
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,405
Who am I to question
the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?

170
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,657
I should be happy to be near you.

171
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,493
Hey, I...

172
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,372
Hey what?

173
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,500
That's it. Just hey!

174
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,629
Like at the end of a dance. Hey!

175
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,553
<i>There'll be times when you get older</i>

176
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,472
<i>When you'll want to sleep with people</i>

177
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:07,186
<i>Just to make them like you</i>
<i>But don't!</i>

178
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,312
<i>'Cause...</i>

179
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,397
<i>... that's another thing...</i>

180
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,108
<i>... that you don't wanna do</i>
Everybody!

181
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:19,698
<i>That's another thing</i>
<i>That you don't wanna do</i>

182
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,533
- Excellent!
- Very informative!

183
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,494
Not at all inappropriate!

184
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:29,875
Thank you for coming, everybody!
There are cookies in the back.

185
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,627
That was great.

186
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,962
The kids loved you.

187
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,716
Yea! I rock!

188
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,801
And you know why?
Because you told the truth.

189
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,263
Nobody ever tells kids the truth.

190
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,182
You were incredible!

191
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,725
But...?

192
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,145
- How'd you know there was a "but"?
- I sense these things.

193
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:54,232
It was either "but" or "butter".

194
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,860
The thing is, I think
some of the parents...

195
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,862
...they were hoping that...

196
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,865
...you'd play more songs
about barnyard animals.

197
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,408
I can do that.

198
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:04,577
Really?

199
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,496
Because that would be fantastic!

200
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,166
What? You wanna kiss me?

201
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,669
I'm thinking about it.

202
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,506
The bat.

203
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,967
Ambassador of darkness.

204
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:24,054
Flitting out of his cave
like a winged messenger.

205
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:28,767
Sightless specter of the macabre.

206
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,852
Buddy, my monkey?

207
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,939
Oh, yeah, right.

208
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,315
There was a break-in...

209
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,152
...a few months back.
Inside job.

210
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,820
Your monkey was taken.

211
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,739
The zoo told me
that my monkey was dead!

212
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,575
The zoo!

213
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:48,829
You believe everything
the zoo tells you?

214
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:53,292
That's the only thing
the zoo's ever told me.

215
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,879
Of course they'll say that!
They don't want the bad publicity.

216
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,881
It's all a great big cover-up.

217
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,676
Do you have any idea
how high up this thing goes?

218
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,803
That guy Lipson?

219
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,056
Lipson knows?

220
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,768
Lipson knows, huh?

221
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,645
Hello, Mr. Possum.

222
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,607
Enigma of the trees,
upside-down denizen of the night.

223
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:21,320
- Taunting gravity...
- Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?

224
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,572
Word on the street...

225
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:27,868
When I say "street", I mean those
pretend streets here at the zoo.

226
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,954
Of course.

227
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,999
Your monkey found a new career...

228
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,503
...in the entertainment field.
That's all I know.

229
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,422
This is unbelievable!

230
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:46,094
So what is this information
worth to you, my friend?

231
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,973
Are you trying
to get me to bribe you?

232
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,976
Maybe.

233
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:56,188
But you already told me everything.

234
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,320
<i>Check it out.</i>

235
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,907
He actually is
the Monkeyshine monkey!

236
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,325
What'll you do?

237
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,745
I'm gonna call the beer company
and try to find him.

238
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,749
That's what I did
when I lost my Clydesdales.

239
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,459
Okay, hi again!

240
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,087
Hi, Phoebe!

241
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:26,885
Today, we're gonna start with
some songs about barnyard animals.

242
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,137
<i>Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"</i>

243
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,348
<i>Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"</i>

244
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,892
<i>Then the farmer hits him</i>
<i>And grinds him up</i>

245
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,812
<i>And that's how we get hamburgers</i>

246
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:43,652
<i>Now chickens!</i>

247
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,946
<i>Only you who can save her, Drake!</i>

248
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,782
<i>Damn it! I'm a doctor.</i>
<i>I'm not God!</i>

249
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,619
There goes my whole belief system.

250
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,746
It's Erika.

251
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,415
Quick! Shut off the TV.

252
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,417
I wanna see what happens!

253
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,961
I get Leslie out of the coma
then we make out.

254
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,505
How can that be?
You were kissing Sabrina!

255
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:09,177
Rachel, it's a world
where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

256
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,430
Hey, Erika. Come in.

257
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,976
How did you get here so fast?
I just saw you in Salem.

258
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,438
Right, they choppered me in.

259
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:20,814
What's up?

260
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,108
You're having a little party too!

261
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,610
- Is she here?
- Who?

262
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,030
Sabrina. I know about you two!

263
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,826
I saw you today, kissing
in the doctor's lounge.

264
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,453
It's not what you think...

265
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:38,790
You told me I was the only one!

266
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,711
All right, look.
That's it.

267
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,963
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

268
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:47,466
I should have told you
a long time ago...

269
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,676
...but I am not Drake Ramoray.

270
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,806
I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.
I just pretend to be a doctor.

271
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:58,769
Oh, my God! Do the people
at the hospital know?

272
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,064
Somebody wanna help me out here?

273
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,776
Oh, I know! I know!

274
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,319
<i>Where am I?</i>

275
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,071
<i>University Hospital...</i>

276
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:13,075
<i>... where you've been</i>
<i>for the last 18 years.</i>

277
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,536
How can you be here and there?

278
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,955
Because it's a TV show!

279
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,375
What are you getting at?

280
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,669
I'm not Drake!

281
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,339
That's right!
He's not Drake. He's...

282
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,301
...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!

283
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,433
Is this true?

284
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,685
Yes! Yes, it is true!

285
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,687
And I know this...

286
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:46,817
...because he pretended
to be Drake to sleep with me!

287
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,450
And then he told me
he would run away with me!

288
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,494
And he didn't!

289
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:02,916
And you left the toilet seat up,
you bastard!

290
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:09,340
Is all this true?

291
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,970
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

292
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,305
You deserve much better than me.

293
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:22,102
You deserve to be with the real Drake.
He's the one you fell in love with.

294
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,437
Go to Salem. Find him!

295
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,648
He's the guy for you!

296
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:30,027
Oh, Hans!

297
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,404
Hans?

298
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,198
Hans!

299
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,701
Yo, evil twin!

300
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:41,496
Right. Goodbye, Erika.

301
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,541
Good luck in Salem.

302
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,543
Take care.

303
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,005
I'll never forget you, Hans.

304
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,011
All right.
The people who threw the water!

305
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,220
Helping you out!

306
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,014
Fired?

307
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,557
Why?

308
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,102
The library board got a lot
of complaints from parents...

309
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,855
...about the stuff in your songs.

310
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,772
I can't believe it!

311
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:13,737
Did you tell your board that
the kids want to hear the truth?

312
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,407
I see.

313
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:22,329
Maybe if you just played
some regular kiddy songs?

314
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,956
What do you want me to be?
Like some...

315
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:29,712
...stupid, big,
like, purple dinosaur?

316
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,422
You don't have to be Barney.

317
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,884
Who's Barney?

318
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:42,057
I tracked down Marcel and get this.
He's healthy, he's happy...

319
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:46,228
...and he's in New York filming
<i>Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.</i>

320
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:47,896
You're kidding!

321
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,856
- This is amazing!
- I know.

322
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:54,987
I finally get a part on TV,
and the monkey's making movies.

323
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,156
Rachel, I'm ready.

324
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:06,415
Excuse me. Is this where the
singing lady is, who tells the truth?

325
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,459
I guess that's me.

326
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:13,213
She's here!

327
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,055
<i>Sometimes men love women</i>

328
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,017
<i>Sometimes men love men</i>

329
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,644
<i>Then there are bisexuals</i>

330
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:32,316
<i>Though some just say</i>
<i>They're kidding themselves</i>

331
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,577
This is exciting! I haven't
seen my monkey in a year.

332
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:47,080
What, you never
look down in the shower?

333
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:51,544
I'm not allowed to make one joke
in the "monkey is penis" genre?

334
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,086
Back up, please.

335
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,672
Back up. Come on.

336
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,466
Excuse me.
Where can we find the monkey?

337
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,134
I'm sorry.
It's a closed set.

338
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,554
I'm sorry, you don't understand.
I'm a friend of his.

339
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,848
We used to live together.

340
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:09,769
And I have a timeshare
in the Poconos with Flipper.

341
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,690
There he is!

342
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,650
Hey! Buddy!

343
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,779
Marcel! Marcel!

344
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,286
<i>In the jungle</i>

345
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,371
<i>The mighty jungle</i>

346
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:31,875
<i>The lion sleeps tonight</i>

<i>In the jungle</i>
