1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,195
So Phil, has recruited
me to sell these cards.

2
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:06,022
- And now I'm recruiting you.
- Who is this guy again?

3
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:08,103
Don't worry about Phil.
He drives a Corvette.

4
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:10,132
He's doing just fine. Okay,

5
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:13,700
Calling cards, are the
wave of the future.

6
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:16,573
- These things sell themselves.
- Who uses calling cards anymore ?

7
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:18,542
You know what ?
That's a nice attitude, Ryan.

8
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,851
I'm just helping you invest
in your future, my friend.

9
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,575
It sounds like a get-rich-quick scheme.

10
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:24,430
Yes, thank you.
You will get rich quick.

11
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:25,876
We all will.

12
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:28,310
Didn't you lose a lot of money
on that other investment,

13
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:30,446
- the one from the e-mail ?
- You know what, Toby ?

14
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:33,412
When the son of the deposed king
of Nigeria e-mails you directly,

15
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:35,422
asking for help, you help.

16
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:38,390
His father ran the
freaking country, okay ?

17
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:43,380
All right. So raise your hand
if you want to get rich.

18
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:44,140
All right.

19
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:47,243
No. How is this not a pyramid scheme ?

20
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,722
All right, let me explain again.

21
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:55,021
Phil, has recruited me and another guy.

22
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:58,323
Now we are getting three people each.

23
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:01,873
The more people that get involved,
the more people who are investing,

24
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,811
And the more money we're all gonna make.
It's not a pyramid scheme.

25
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,720
It's not even a scheme,
per se, it's...

26
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:19,150
I have to go make a call.

27
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:44,741

30
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:01,152
Happy Birthday, Michael.

31
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,602
- What ?
- I said Happy Birthday.

32
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,930
Thank you. That's really nice.

33
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:10,522
Today is my b-day and people
around here just go crazy for it.

34
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,731
I don't know why.
Oh, fun fact.

35
00:02:13,138 --> 00:02:16,022
I share my birthday with Eva Longoria.

36
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:21,302
So I have a perfect icebreaker
if I ever meet Teri Hatcher.

37
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:24,022
- What's up ?
- Hi.

38
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:27,832
- Happy Birthday.
- Thank you sir.

39
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:38,132
- Did you hear anything yet ?
- No, I'm still waiting.

40
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:42,453
- Yeah.
- Yes.

41
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:44,842
- There he is, the birthday boy.
- God.

42
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:46,731
- Birthday hug.
- No, no, no. New suit.

43
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:48,800
- Please.
- That suit is amazing.

44
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,692
Thank you very much. It is from Italy.

45
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:54,393
Actually, no, Bulgaria.

46
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,853
- So...
- Maybe I should get one.

47
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,002
Good luck. One of a kind.

48
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:00,803
eBay. Question.

49
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:03,890
May I be in charge of the
party planning festivities ?

50
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,433
Not necessary. The party planning
committee is all over it.

51
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,601
They've been working 24/7
all day yesterday.

52
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:11,512
Excellent. On my part,
I did manage to reserve the...

53
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:15,232
Don't. No. Please. Don't want
to spoil it for anybody.

54
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,532
- Spoil the surprise.
- Let's get the party started.

55
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,111
Let's get the party started.
Not the way I taught you.

56
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,953
When should we bring out the cake ?
1:00 or 1:30 ?

57
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:29,881
- 1:00's good.
- 1:30.

58
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,482
I'm sorry. Are we boring you ?

59
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,180
- I don't...
- Party planning committee, listen up.

60
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,862
Michael would like trick
candles for his birthday cake.

61
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:41,411
- So make that a priority.
- Where do we get those ?

62
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:42,552
Not my problem.

63
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:45,900
Here's a list of things that Michael
would like to be surprised by.

64
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,263
Michael wants a strippergram?

65
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:52,360
Yes but he doesn't want
to know when or whom.

66
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,450
No. This is a closed door meeting.

67
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:07,461
- Yeah.
<i>- Michael, I have Jan on the line.</i>

68
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:10,043
Great. Put her through.

69
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:12,860
- <i>Hello, Michael.</i>
- Hey, you.

70
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,332
<i>I'm returning your call,
you said it was urgent.</i>

71
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:18,301
It is urgent. I just wanted to call
and wish you a happy birthday.

72
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:20,362
<i>Well, today's not my birthday, so.</i>

73
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:21,652
Really ?

74
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,761
'Cause  I thought we had
the same birthday.

75
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,560
- <i>Happy Birthday, Michael.</i>
- Thanks.

76
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:32,110
- <i>Am I on camera ?</i>
- Nope.

77
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,621
Totally private.

78
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:37,180
You can say whatever is in your heart.

79
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,980
You can take a five if you want.

80
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:04,590
Somebody brought in
doughnuts for my birthday.

81
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:07,443
- Happy Birthday.
- Thanks.

82
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,323
Man, I'm so sorry.

83
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:15,981
- When do you find out ?
- They said this afternoon.

84
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:18,331
They're waiting on a second opinion.

85
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,022
Second opinion on what ?

86
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:22,171
I might have skin cancer.

87
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:25,243
No. I was watching "Grey's Anatomy",
and there was a lifeguard on it.

88
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:27,830
- And he had skin cancer too.
- Kelly, you know what...

89
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:30,870
I never really thought about death
until Princess Diana died.

90
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,750
That was the saddest funeral ever.

91
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:37,571
That and my sister's.

92
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:39,241
Who brought in doughnuts ?

93
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,270
Somebody got doughnuts
for my birthday.

94
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:44,112
- Happy Birthday.
- You didn't know it was my birthday.

95
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:45,502
I guess I forgot.

96
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,901
Well, I guess I forgot
to give you a doughnut.

97
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:51,130
You serious ?

98
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:03,243
- Skin cancer is treatable.
- Right.

99
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,463
It's gonna be okay.

100
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:06,282
You don't know it's going to be okay.

101
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,680
Don't give him false hope.

102
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,762
It's probably nothing though.

103
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:16,201
Hi. Delivery for Michael Scott.

104
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:20,201
Here we go. Okay, this is great.

105
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,223
Thank you, my friends, she is perfect.

106
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,241
Dwight, may I have your chair please ?

107
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:28,921
And some singles, if you will.

108
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,353
All right.

109
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:34,652
Okay.

110
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:37,763
All  right.

111
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,293
This has arms.
Is that gonna be..

112
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:40,760
Is that all right ?

113
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:42,703
Sure.

114
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:43,973
Okay.

115
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,622
I'm so nervous.

116
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:51,520
- I can sign for it.
- Oh, thanks.

117
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:55,133
When I was seven,

118
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:58,043
my mother hired a pony,

119
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:01,973
and a cart to come to
my house for all the kids.

120
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:04,200
And...

121
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:07,742
I got a really bad rash, from the pony.

122
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,161
And all the kids got to ride the pony.

123
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:11,330
And I had to go inside.

124
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:15,610
And my mother was rubbing cream
on me for probably three hours.

125
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:17,413
And I never came outside.

126
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,210
And by the time I got out, 
the pony was already in the truck.

127
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:21,820
And around the corner.

128
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:24,051
So that was my worst birthday.

129
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:35,610
Stop it. Stop ! What is that ?

130
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,510
It's For the Longest
Time by William Joel.

131
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,380
- It's one of your favorite songs.
- Yeah, when it's on the radio.

132
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:43,403
My birthday blows.

133
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:46,360
Nobody even signed my birthday poster.

134
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:50,672
Apparently my mother is the only one who
cares enough to send me anything.

135
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:52,701
I probably care more than she does.

136
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,663
You're  making it worse.

137
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:58,821
I bet Luke Perry's friends
don't treat him like this.

138
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:03,360
- When does he hear ?
- Sometime today.

139
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,650
Poor Kevin.

140
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:11,283
If I knew I had a week to live
would probably go to Europe...

141
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:14,233
And South America...

142
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:16,843
And the Grand Canyon...

143
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,630
And I would want to
see the Pacific Ocean.

144
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:23,146
It would be a pretty busy week.

145
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:26,320
That's a list price of $4.50.

146
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:29,816
Unfortunately, this item is on back...

147
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,673
order.
Michael ! Michael ! Michael,

148
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,461
Michael, Michael.
Come here, come here, come here.

149
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,661
- What ?
- Listen up, everyone.

150
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:40,081
It is 11:23 exactly.

151
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:43,960
The exact moment when you emerged
from your mother's vaginal canal.

152
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:45,641
So ?

153
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,262
Have a seat, please.

154
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:49,851
- God.
- There is a tradition,

155
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:54,700
hat the Hebrews have of hoisting
the birthday boy up on a chair.

156
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:58,041
So come over, help me celebrate
Michael's birth moment. Kevin.

157
00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:00,492
- No, no, no.
- I'll do it.

158
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:02,641
- Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
- Creed.

159
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,023
Come on, Stanley, let's go.

160
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,103
I feel like we should
go get Kevin something.

161
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,920
Do you think we can sneak out of here ?

162
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:13,792
Maybe, but were going to need
somebody to create a diversion and...

163
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:15,913
<i>On three, we're going
to hoist away! Ready ?</i>

164
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:16,990
Okay.

165
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:19,413
- Happy birth moment, Michael.
- Thank you.

166
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,252
One, two, three.

167
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,481
All right. All right. Watch it.

168
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:26,503
- Please.
- Oscar.

169
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:27,671
It wasn't me.

170
00:09:30,795 --> 00:09:33,453
Okay, that is not an eight-foot sub.

171
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,540
We don't make an eight-foot sub.
This is eight one-foot subs.

172
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:42,150
- All right, what's the damage?
-  39.60.

173
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:46,690
39.

174
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:54,311
60.

175
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:57,361
Why tip someone for a job
I'm capable of doing myself ?

176
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,411
I can deliver food.

177
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:01,171
I can drive a taxi.

178
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:03,751
I can, and do, cut my own hair.

179
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,700
I did, however, tip my urologist.

180
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:10,770
Because I am unable to pulverize
my own kidney stones.

181
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,783
- Here they come.
- Get in here.

182
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,642
- Come and get it.
- Everybody.

183
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,983
- Birthday party subs. My gift to you.
- What is this ?

184
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:20,181
- Baloney, tomato, and ketchup.
- The best.

185
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:21,750
- These are all the same.
- Yes.

186
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,043
Baloney ? I don't eat baloney.

187
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:26,881
Well, then just have the
tomato and ketchup. Still good.

188
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,011
No.

189
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:30,492
- Just the bread. It's fresh baked.
- No.

190
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:32,971
Okay.

191
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:36,380
Get whatever you want.
You can choke on it.

192
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:38,532
When I was 16,

193
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:43,512
I was supposed to go out on
a date with a girl named Julie.

194
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,692
But there was another
Michael in the class,

195
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:50,673
that she apparently
thought the date was with.

196
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,270
So she went out with him on my birthday.

197
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:57,843
And she got him a
cake at the restaurant.

198
00:10:58,186 --> 00:10:59,850
And it wasn't even his birthday.

199
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,672
But I heard about it
the next day in school. So...

200
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:05,890
That was the worst
birthday I think I ever had.

201
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,300
So, we got Kev some stuff.

202
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:12,242
Party pack of M&Ms, his favorite candy.

203
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,433
A DVD of American Pie 2,
which is his favorite movie.

204
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:16,751
And he lent it to Creed.

205
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,231
So I can guarantee you
he won't get that back.

206
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,650
69 Cup of Noodles.

207
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:24,892
Which we realize sounds crass,
but it is his favorite number.

208
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,401
And his favorite lunch.

209
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:33,753
Hey, temp, you know, we still got
five feet of sandwich left.

210
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,032
- Someone ate three feet of that thing ?
- Hell, yeah.

211
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:39,540
Save room for ice cream cake.

212
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:40,743
- Thank you.
- I got it.

213
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:43,042
What are you... it's the party
planning committee.

214
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,361
His is the most important
day of the year.

215
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:47,881
I can't risk anything.

216
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:50,200
Fine.

217
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:52,550
What about that meeting...

218
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,290
later...

219
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:56,943
to discuss finances ?

220
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,760
Yes.

221
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,442
But don't expect any cookie.

222
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,411
But what if I'm hungry ?

223
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:06,671
No cookie.

224
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:25,931
What ?

225
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,612
You use fabric softener ?

226
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,802
- Yeah. You don't ?
- No, I do.

227
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:38,100
<i>Happy Birthday dear Michael.</i>

228
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:43,521
<i>Happy Birthday...</i>

229
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:47,032
<i>To you !</i>

230
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,873
Hello. Hey.

231
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,360
Kevin.
Respect the birthday, please.

232
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,461
No, not yet.

233
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:57,193
I will. Thanks.

234
00:12:57,805 --> 00:12:59,792
-  It was just Stacey.
- Are you done ?

235
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:01,341
Good.

236
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:04,252
- Okay.
- Here we go.

237
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,230
- I'm gonna...
- Make a wish.

238
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:16,113
I asked for trick candles.

239
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,842
- Pam was supposed to get them.
- Okay.

240
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,260
Well, when she comes back,
we'll do it again.

241
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:24,631
Hello. What about the birthday boy ?

242
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,053
Haven't had a hug all day.

243
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:29,280
No one cares about your birthday.

244
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,192
Kevin's waiting to hear
if he has skin cancer.

245
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:43,021
That sucks. Great.

246
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:48,923
That's good timing.

247
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:50,610
That's...

248
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,571
Sorry. That's terrible.

249
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,140
Terrible news. That's terrible..

250
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,462
Terrible news, for the both of us.

251
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:08,511
- We should probably head back.
- Yeah, okay.

252
00:14:09,768 --> 00:14:11,381
I dare you to make an announcement.

253
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:13,940
You dare me ? How old are you ?

254
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:15,950
Just quit stalling.

255
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:20,910
Luke, this is your father.

256
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:24,193
Come set the table for dinner.

257
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:27,090
Such a dork.

258
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:31,573
Jim Halpert, price check
on fabric softener.

259
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:33,053
- The kind ...
- Ma'am, please.

260
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:36,271
- Don't touch that. That is not a toy.
- I'm sorry.

261
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:38,172
Sorry.

262
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:41,823
- How old are you ?
-  I hate you.

263
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:45,650
Honestly, is there any way
you can get on your fiancee's plan ?

264
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,993
- Our health plan is, it's terrible.
- There you are.

265
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:49,522
Good news. Did some research.

266
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:53,683
It turns out that 98% of people
with skin cancer fully recover.

267
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:55,762
Still scary.

268
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,113
Yeah. But it's not brain cancer.

269
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:01,040
And it shouldn't stop us
from having fun.

270
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,961
You know what they say
the best medicine is.

271
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:06,551
Well, the doctor said a combination
of Interferon and Dacarbazine.

272
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:09,442
And laughter also.

273
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:13,090
I don't really think people
are in the laughing mood.

274
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:15,350
Why are you here ?

275
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,381
I didn't even invite you
to my birthday party.

276
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:19,552
- I work here.
- "I work here."

277
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:22,530
All right. Well, you know what,
since Toby doesn't speak for everybody.

278
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:23,870
And I am your boss.

279
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,923
I think you should just go home.
Take the rest of the afternoon off.

280
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,261
- Take a sick day.
- If I go home now,

281
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:31,160
I'll just drive myself crazy. 

282
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:34,042
Well, you're pretty much driving
everybody else here crazy.

283
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:40,230
Crazy with worry.

284
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:06,902
Where have you been ?
And don't say the bathroom.

285
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:10,013
- Cause I kicked in all the stalls.
- Well, that's an invasion of privacy.

286
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:12,492
- So I'm going to tell Michael.
- Please, don't.

287
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:17,063
- You, owe me.
- Excuse me, everyone.

288
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,651
Attention, please.

289
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:23,142
Kevin, we're going to take
you to a very special place.

290
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:25,590
A  place that will make you happy.

291
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,791
And a place that is far,
far away from the evil sun.

292
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:33,013
Is this trip in any way
related to your birthday ?

293
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:36,270
How dare you sir. You're gross.

294
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:40,893
- That should not be there.
- I'll get someone to take it down.

295
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:43,723
No, it's all right. It's already up.
Just leave it. Where's Kevin ?

296
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:45,793
Come on !
Let's get our skate on.

297
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,793
Don't be scared.
You're good.

298
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:58,330
- I wanna go
- Turn to the right.

299
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,852
- Do you think you can let go ?
- No.

300
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:06,952
Is that Michael ?

301
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:09,421
Yeah, I've been pretty much
skating my whole life.

302
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,492
I thought about playing in the NHL.

303
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:13,730
But you're on the road so much.

304
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:16,112
Get no time to spend
with your wife and kids.

305
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:19,131
And I really want a wife and kids.

306
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,360
I got it !

307
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:31,210
Hey, Pam, all the stuff with Kevin,
it's pretty scary.

308
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,383
And I'm thinking that the next time
you're in the shower,

309
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,320
you should check yourself out.
You know, give yourself an exam.

310
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,882
Those things are like ticking time bags.

311
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:42,581
All right ? Think about it.

312
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,592
Something to think about.

313
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,772
- Just can't relax about it...
- Kevin.

314
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:52,333
- Have you heard anything yet ?
- No, not yet.

315
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:54,230
Okay, well, Livestrong.

316
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:56,011
- Okay, Michael.
- Michael ?

317
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:57,760
Yeah. Carol ?

318
00:17:58,137 --> 00:18:00,282
- Yeah.
- She sold me my condo.

319
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,331
Hey, was this place on the market or...?

320
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:07,231
No. I don't just sell real estate.

321
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,791
My daughter has a skating lesson.

322
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:10,623
Oh, these all your kids ?

323
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:12,352
No, just the front two.

324
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,140
Oh, hey guys. What's up ?
You want to go for a ride ?

325
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:16,962
- Is that okay ?
- Sure.

326
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,292
Cool. All right.
Grab on. Here we go.

327
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:22,551
You ready ? Hang on tight. All right.

328
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:26,772
- We are moving.
- We are really moving now.

329
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:34,763
<i>Push.
Good. That's great. You got it.</i>

330
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:36,852
Scuse me.

331
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:42,372
Hello ? Yeah, okay.

332
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,980
All right.

333
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:49,672
Okay, I will. Thanks.

334
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:53,322
It's negative.

335
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:05,850
We're going to beat this, okay ?
We're gonna... come here.

336
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:11,120
Well, apparently,
in the medicine community,

337
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:14,921
negative means good, which
makes absolutely no sense.

338
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:20,461
In the real world community,
that would be chaos.

339
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:24,133
This is awesome.

340
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,831
Thanks you guys.

341
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:29,872
Okay, who's this from ?

342
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:36,161
- Look at that jersey.
- Turn it around.

343
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,503
- Turn it around.
- Cool.

344
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:40,200
Great.

345
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:42,583
- Thank you. Dwight.
- From Dwight. Number one !

346
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:44,182
- That's great. Thanks.
- Michael.

347
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:47,950
- This is from all of us.
- You didn't need to do that.

348
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:54,991
Night Swept. This is really amazing.

349
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,642
Thank you. I love it.

350
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:00,762
Michael's birthday was
actually pretty cool.

351
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,313
It was a good day.

352
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:04,953
I don't know.

353
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:07,361
It was a good day.
