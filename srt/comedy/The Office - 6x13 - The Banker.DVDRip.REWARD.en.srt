1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,093
Attention, everyone!
Jim and I, on behalf

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,432
of the Party Planning
Committee have an...

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,972
Too loud.
Too, too loud. Too loud.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,409
But effective. Look. On behalf
of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.

5
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,305
ALL: Merry Christmas.

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,678
Merry Christmas. Good.

7
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,684
My diabolical plot is
on hold for Christmas.

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,019
My heart just melts with the
sound of children singing.

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,722
(LAUGHING)

10
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:30,429
Not really. I'm just tired. The
days are short. I don't know.

11
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,660
Maybe I'm depressed.

12
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,693
It is time to
unveil the tree.

13
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,928
Hey, Rockefeller Center!

14
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,094
JIM: Yeah.

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,535
Uh, I've actually
been to Rock Center

16
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,663
and this is
nothing like that.

17
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,206
This is all we have.
Ugh!

18
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,673
Nope, it's not "ugh."

19
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,970
It is office camaraderie.

20
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,239
It is warm feelings.

21
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,109
Why don't we talk more
about it instead of doing it?

22
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,877
Thirty, 29, 28...

23
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,349
Why would you start so high? ...27...

24
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,408
Three, two, one.

25
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,475
...26...

26
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:55,712
PHYLLIS: Ooh!

27
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,983
You didn't decorate it.

28
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,046
No.
Exactly.

29
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,184
We didn't, because we think it
would be better to do it together.

30
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,126
Everyone. Why would
you wrap it in a sheet

31
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,255
if you're not
covering anything up?

32
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,231
Is... Is it fake?
Pam.

33
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:12,462
Yes! We are unveiling an
artificial tree that will never die.

34
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,528
Yes.

35
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,732
Like the spirit
of Christmas.

36
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,036
And we're supposed
to applaud you

37
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,100
for taking a giant
diaper off a fake tree?

38
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,341
This was a successful
unveiling! Go back to work!

39
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,073
Merry Christmas.

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,937
Hello. Sorry, guys.
Sorry, guys.

41
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,075
I'm not sure I've earned the
right to make announcements yet,

42
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,509
but whoever is giving me
the 12 Days of Christmas

43
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,376
as my Secret Santa,

44
00:01:54,714 --> 00:02:00,277
please stop. I can't take it
anymore. My cat killed a turtledove.

45
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,989
The French hens have started
pulling out my hair to make a nest.

46
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,718
Please stop.

47
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,817
What psycho would
send that as a gift?

48
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,891
I begged Dwight and Jim to
give me Erin for Secret Santa,

49
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,300
<i>and I decided to give Erin
the 12 Days of Christmas.</i>

50
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,530
Bowtie time.

51
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,598
<i>Is it my fault that the first eight
days there's basically 30 birds?</i>

52
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,339
Ho! Ho! Ho!

53
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,074
Merry Christmas, boys and
girls. It's me, Santa Claus.

54
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,614
Hey, Santa.

55
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,374
They finally let you do it. Yeah.

56
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,544
Congrats, Phyl.

57
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,678
It's so edgy.

58
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,984
<i>PHYLLIS: I have been wanting
to be Santa for years.</i>

59
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,047
I believe I have
the right temperament

60
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,059
and the figure to
do the job well.

61
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:45,393
<i>I slipped a note to Jim 11 weeks
ago, and he said I could do it.</i>

62
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,927
(PHYLLIS LAUGHS)

63
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,626
It's been a long journey.

64
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,203
But I'm Santa Claus!

65
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,373
So, Santa, what can we
expect from this party?

66
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,539
It's going to be a very jolly
time if you've been good.

67
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,946
What if you've been bad?

68
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,951
Then nothing but
a lump of coal for you.

69
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,782
What if you've been
really, really bad?

70
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,084
More evil than
strictly wrong.

71
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,647
Hey, Creed? We covered it. Lump of coal.

72
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,783
Yeah.

73
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,084
For the past several weeks,

74
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,028
my Secret Santa has been
giving me pieces of a machine

75
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,758
<i>that I've been
attempting to assemble.</i>

76
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:23,825
<i>I'm suspicious of this, because
I had the exact same idea</i>

77
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,298
<i>for catching Osama bin Laden.</i>

78
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,671
<i>I would simply send him
a different piece each day.</i>

79
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,469
He would assemble
it to find himself

80
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,340
in jail!

81
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,210
You know, Oscar, every
time I make this lasagna

82
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,548
people ask me if
it's a family recipe,

83
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,817
but really, I just get
the recipe from the box.

84
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,055
That's funny.

85
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,822
Is it funny? I thought it was
more interesting than funny.

86
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,497
I think my water
just broke.

87
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,901
That's too funny.

88
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,332
Oscar and
the warehouse guy.

89
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,700
Go, Oscar!
Go, gay warehouse guy!

90
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,072
Here's Santa!

91
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,881
Hey, little girl, what
would you like for Christmas?

92
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,817
Ooh! You have been a very
naughty girl, I see.

93
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,015
Michael, we already
have a Santa. Phyllis.

94
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,449
What the hell is going on?

95
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,259
Phyllis, Jim?
Phyllis is Santa?

96
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,655
Yeah.
Phyllis.

97
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,199
Yeah. I told her a long
time ago she could do it.

98
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,427
Take it back.
That is absurd.

99
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,559
No. I'm not gonna do that.

100
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,103
No, Jim, come on!

101
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,330
I think she's
doing a good job.

102
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,101
It's insane! A woman
Santa? Where does it stop?

103
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,735
No! Jim, this may be the last
Christmas that we have here.

104
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,575
Doesn't it make you
a tiny bit anxious,

105
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,980
me not playing Santa?
Come on!

106
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,885
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis
that she can't be Santa.

107
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,650
Fine. Then do it anonymously.
Ransom-note style. You can...

108
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,049
You know what?
I have a bunch of letters

109
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,616
cut out of magazines
in my desk.

110
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,718
You can use those.

111
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,387
If this were Russia,
yeah, sure,

112
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,987
everybody would
go to one Santa,

113
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,999
and there would be
a line around the block,

114
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,295
and once
you sat on her lap

115
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,460
and she asked you
what you wanted,

116
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,936
you would say,
probably, freedom,

117
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,633
at which point the KGB would
arrest you and send you to Siberia.

118
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,439
It's a good thing
Russia doesn't exist anymore.

119
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:16,004
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho! Ho! Ho!

120
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:21,752
Why pay more to sit next to
old Trannie Claus over there

121
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,721
when you can sit on my lap?

122
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,352
Phyllis is only pretending to
be a man. I'm the real thing!

123
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,263
Sit down on my lap
and there will be no doubt!

124
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,355
Okay.
Okay.

125
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,992
No, it's not,
like, penis-wise.

126
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,263
Hello, little boy!
What's your name?

127
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,865
Michael, it's me, Kevin.

128
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,907
Phyllis says
I'm too big for her lap.

129
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:47,879
Oh, I am so sorry that Phyllis
hates you and hates your body,

130
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,780
but Santa
remembers a reindeer

131
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,081
that was just a tiny
bit different as well.

132
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,745
When can I sit on your lap?

133
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,450
Right now!
Come on over here, big boy!

134
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,853
There we go! Oh, my God.

135
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,421
That's really comfortable.

136
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,459
What would you like for
Christmas, little boy?

137
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,905
I don't know. I didn't know
you were gonna ask me that.

138
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,375
Well, what did you think
was going to happen?

139
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:22,403
I didn't know. Nobody's ever
let me sit on their lap before.

140
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,973
(SOFTLY) All right,
just say some toys, please.

141
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,746
Can you give me some choices?

142
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,011
'Cause I really don't want
to mess up on this list.

143
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,056
Damn it, Kevin. Come on.

144
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,319
What about if I tell you
the things I don't want?

145
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,521
Okay, get off!
Get off! Off!

146
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,887
(GROANS)

147
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,932
Oh, God!

148
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,933
I didn't even get to
tell you what I wanted.

149
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,525
Okay, you know what you get?

150
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,901
You get a thousand helium
balloons attached to you

151
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,032
so Santa doesn't have
to go through this again.

152
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,601
Awesome.

153
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,202
Well?

154
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,939
I'm trying, Phyllis.
You're Santa.

155
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,048
The only Santa.
That's what I want.

156
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,482
You promised me this. Don't
make me get Bob involved.

157
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,184
What would Bob do?

158
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,552
Never mind.
I shouldn't have said that.

159
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,517
Does it hurt?

160
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,717
It stings a lot.

161
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,449
Hmm.

162
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,121
I keep trying to figure out
who's sending me these gifts.

163
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,289
I know, right?

164
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,299
So far no one
will admit to it.

165
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,062
(CHUCKLES)
Is it you?

166
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,997
Yeah!

167
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,300
Totally.
I admit it. It's me.

168
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,605
(LAUGHS) Seriously?

169
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,645
Seriously?
Are you serious?

170
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:29,840
Is... What... Is it you?

171
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:34,542
Yeah. Totally serious. I'm
your Secret Santa. Busted!

172
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,812

173
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,788
There he is.

174
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,113
Hey, man.

175
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,853
Is Matt around?
I've got his check.

176
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,454
Matt is on a delivery. Just
leave it here. I'll take it.

177
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,864
I'll just wait for him.

178
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,096
Matt's a pretty good-looking
dude, don't you think?

179
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,568
I'll just leave
it here with you.

180
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,600
Come here!
Come here! Come here!

181
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,339
I'm doing something
over here. Come on! Ah!

182
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,437
Ho! Ho! Ho!

183
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,414
MICHAEL: Come on, I need
this. Come over here!

184
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,541
Just sit down!

185
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,777
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

186
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,114
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,414
Ryan and I are
just having some fun.

188
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,580
Can I just talk to
you for a second? Yeah.

189
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,486
No, now.
Okay, what?

190
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,085
You can't yell out,
"I need this, I need this,"

191
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,991
as you pin down
an employee on your lap.

192
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,053
Okay. You know what, Jim?

193
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,325
With two Santas in the room,
things get ruthless.

194
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,992
Yeah. Do you understand?
You forced my hand.

195
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,934
Michael, it's Phyllis.
We want Phyllis as Santa.

196
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,734
Do we? Do we?
Is that what we want?

197
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,172
Why don't we
take a vote on it?

198
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,231
Great.

199
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,708
Hey! Okay, everybody.

200
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,811
The office is being pulled
apart. I realize that.

201
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,782
There are traditions at stake.

202
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,442
And there are women...
Who wants Phyllis as Santa?

203
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,545
No, no, no! Wait! No!
There are other choices.

204
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,748
There's information that we...
Are you kidding me, Kevin?

205
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,292
After you almost killed me?

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,022
Michael, I had you.
I just want to try Phyllis.

207
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,293
And if you want Michael
as Santa, raise your hand.

208
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,159
Can I get you
some punch?

209
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,500
I... No, I'll get some punch.
That looks delicious.

00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,735
KELLY: Michael!

212
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,903
Excuse me.

213
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,675
Whoever has been sending me
the parts to this gun,

214
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,684
I think you sent me a gear
instead of a trigger.

215
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,720
How do you know it's a gun?

216
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,379
What else does it look like?

217
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,317
Not a gun.

218
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,950
Well, I don't have
all the pieces yet.

219
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:25,697
Well, unless the missing piece
is a gun, you don't have a gun.

220
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,631
Not a gun.

221
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:33,461
In the North Pole, I spend many
nights alone tinkering with toys.

222
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:38,940
So today, let's put a twinkle
in old Kris Kringle's eye.

223
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,442
Let the party begin!

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

225
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,180
I don't ask for much for
Christmas. I really don't.

226
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,250
It's not like I am begging
people to buy me diamonds

227
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,623
and broach pendants.

228
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,123
Oh!

229
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,032
"Buy me something expensive, or I'm
gonna kill myself." That's not...

230
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,368
I don't care about that!
All I want to be is Santa.

231
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,302
And you want to take that
away from me, fine.

232
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,240
Go ahead.

233
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,179
But when
you need my help

234
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,646
because I am
ruining everything,

235
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,808
don't look at me!

236
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,148
Behold,

237
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,857
Jesus Christ.

238
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:30,257
And I bring to you
glad Christmas tidings.

239
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,856
I want to remind everyone
the true meaning of Christmas.

240
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,692
Those of you who wish
to join me, that's great.

241
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,032
I am excited by that,

242
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,965
and those of you who don't,

243
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,531
I forgive you,
but I never forget.

244
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:47,010
Wow, Michael. This must be
obvious how wrong this is.

245
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,741
The Antichrist.

246
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,008
Okay, you can't...
(EXCLAIMS)

247

Look, you cannot
push religion.

248
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,116
But I can push drugs in here.

249
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,346
Is that what you're saying? No.

250
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,946
Well, you have to pick one
or the other. Your choice.

251
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,720
Pick your poison. Get back
to me. In the meantime,

252
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:04,285
I am going to spread my
goodness all over this company!

253
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,129
Hey, Phyllis?

254
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,600
Could you not reveal to Erin
that I'm her secret Santa?

255
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,501
All right, sweetie, I'll
just tell her it's Michael.

256
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,663
Okay.

No. Hey.

Hmm.

Good pâté, right? Oscar
made it. Have you met Oscar?

265
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:34,882
I don't think so.

Hey, Oscar, come here.

267
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:45,165
Oscar, this is Matt,
and Matt loves your pâté.

268
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,333
I had some.

269

Oscar's pâté's great.

I could eat it all day,

are never straight, right?

316
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,491
<i>Stephanie,
can you hop off, please?</i>

317
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,796
<i>STEPHANIE: Sure, David.</i>

318
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:00,327
What the hell? How rude!
Does she do that all the time?

319

<i>ERIN: Do you want me off
this call too, Michael?</i>

320
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,607
Hey, what? Get off!
Get off the phone!

321
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,410
<i>DAVID: Listen, I shouldn't tell you
this, but the company has a buyer.</i>

322
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,974
<i>The board will have no
choice but to approve,</i>

323
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,317
<i>and they are going

324
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,616
What does that mean?

325
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,380
<i>I'll be fired.</i>

326
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,983
Well, can't Alan protect you?

327
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,585
<i>Alan will be out, too.
All of us.</i>

328
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,288
All of us?

00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,388
<i>Goodbye, Michael.</i>

330
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,897
Oh, my God.

331
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,632
<i>MICHAEL: Earlier today,
this office needed a Santa.</i>

332
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:38,837
And then it needed a second
Santa. And then it needed a Jesus.

333
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,740
And now,

334
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,978
it needs a Michael.

335
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,250
And that's one suit
Phyllis cannot fit into.

336
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,614
Hey, how's everybody doing?

337
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,886
Not great. You heckled
Santa for an hour and a half.

338
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,055
That was a different guy.
That was Jesus.

339
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,395
Jesus sort of
ruined the party.

340
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,127
Hurt, petulant Jesus.

341
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,534
Are you serious?
That is so offensive.

342
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,772
You know what's
even more offensive,

343
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:13,869
is bailing on this party because
some jerk ruined the first part of it.

344
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,875
Dwight, come here.

345
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,145
Here's my debit card. I want you
to go pick up a bunch of pizzas

346
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,311
and meet me in
the conference room.

347
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,445
What's your pin number?

348
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,386

00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,602
I thought that
you would like it.

354
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,108
It was a little much, Andy.

355
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,268
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

356
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,007
What were you thinking?

357
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,077
I suppose a gentleman might
throw in the towel at this point.

358
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,380
Guess what.
Not gonna happen.

359
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,518
You know what? Christmas
isn't about Santa or Jesus.

360
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,857
It's about the workplace. All
of you feel like my family.

361
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:13,828
Ryan, you are my son, and
Pam, you're my wife, and Jim...

you are my grandmas.

363
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,407
And Stanley,
you're our mailman.

364
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,207
And I can't help but look at all
of your wonderful, beautiful faces

365
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,048
and think, "How could
they do this to us?"

What?

MICHAEL: I didn't
say anything!

372
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,289
We're going out of business!

373
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,386
What?
What?

374
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,452
ANDY: You are kidding me.

375
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,588
Wait, wait, wait.
Who said that?

376
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,462
David told me on the phone.
David told me.

377
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,659
ANDY: When?
When did he tell you, today?

378
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,603
Earlier today,
he said we have been sold.

379
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,730
JIM: What?

JIM: Dwight! Jesus.
PAM: Come on!

382
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,273
Michael, wait.
So they said we are sold.

383
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,246
David is gone, Alan is
gone. We're all gone.

384
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,782
Okay, but we
haven't gone under.

385
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,875
We've been sold, and that can
mean many different things.

386
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,216
It's hard for me to
imagine a scenario

387
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,847
where Meredith Palmer keeps her
job and David Wallace does not.

388
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,618
No offense, Meredith.
No, I get it.

389
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,818
I'll call him.
I'll call David.

390
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,020
No you won't, because he's
not picking up his phone.

391
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,895
Yes, I will, because I always
know how to get through to him.

392
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,126
He told me where
his kids go to school.

393
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,727
I call the school. I tell
them I'm the pediatrician.

394
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,571
They patch me through to his
secretary. I use my little girl voice.
