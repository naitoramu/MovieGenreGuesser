1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:05,060
And then, I think I'm going
to go to the garlic festival.

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,197
Wow. Sounds like fun.
You guys would love it.

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,070
No, we wouldn't.
They have a TCBY booth.

4
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,973
Cool. Same stuff you get downtown.

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,636
Do you like TCBY?
Who doesn't?

6
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:17,911
"I can't believe it's
yogurt." Lt'll be fun.

7
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:21,283
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're
expecting the both of you in an hour.

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,049
Oh, actually, it's just going to be me.

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,750
They said
the both of you.

10
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:25,984
That's a mistake.

11
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,186
You should give them
a call, check that out.

12
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,627
All right,
just clear this up.

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,995
Well, there's actually been
a few changes in the company,

14
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,500
and Michael and I are
actually at the same level.

15
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,832
So, I can... No.

16
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,635
No, why would
that be a problem?

17
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,504
Jim's a good kid,
he can handle a lot,

18
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,443
but sometimes you
have to call in a master.

19
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:51,583
Why would you date an amateur
when you could date a professional?

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,179
Great. See you then.

21
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,619
What?

22
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,714
They said that they would feel
more comfortable if you came along.

23
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,726
Why don't they just want
you to go by yourself?

24
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,228
Why do they want me to come,
too? I don't understand.

25
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,264
I absolutely don't
understand, either.

26
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:09,233
I don't want you to feel like
I'm babysitting you or something.

27
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,637
All right.
All right.

28
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,298
Let me go get your stroller. (CHUCKLES)

29
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,473
JIM: Sure.
Michael's a good teacher.

30
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,409
A teacher is someone who stands

31
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,912
right next to you
your whole life

32
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,880
and never lets
you do anything.

33

a teacher is, right?

35
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,231
What are you going to call him? Dave.

36
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,207
No. What is his name? Dave.

37
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,334
Mr. Borchard.
They're very formal.

38
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,810
Yeah. I've spoken
to them on the phone.

39
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,347
Yeah, well,
this is not the phone.

40
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,816
This is real life, baby,
and you got to own it.

41
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,250
Is that what
you are wearing?

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
Yes, it is.

43
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,447
And that is the watch
that you are going to wear?

44
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,584
No, it is not. You
should wear this watch.

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,888
I will loan it to you.

46
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,487
It is a Tankard. I highly
recommend you wear that.

No, thanks.
They are into style.

Mmm-hmm.

49
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,602
They are into appearance.
We are selling success.

50

That's sort of secondary.

51
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,466
Nope. No.

52
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,675

micro co-manage me.

00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,236
Michael, don't
listen to them.

160
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,295
Thank you, Stanley.

161
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,433
You just ignore
their carping.

162
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,534
Okay.

163
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,635
(WHISPERING) Michael?
Yes.

164
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,374
A carp is both a fish
and a term for complaining.

165
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,847
They're mocking you
with word play.

166
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,146
Hey, boss,
did you find Nemo?

167
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,345
I can name
Pixar movies, too.

168
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,855
<i>Toy Story.
Don't you mean Koi Story?</i>

169
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,015
(ALL LAUGHING)

170
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,787
And when you fell in,
did you flounder?

171
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,195
Michael, flounder is
both a kind of a fish...

172
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,595
I know what a flounder is.

173
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,657
Hey, Michael.
No! No!

174
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,361
No more! That is it!

175
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,199
Everybody in the
conference room, right now!

176
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,206
I'm not usually
the butt of the joke.

177
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,071
I'm usually
the face of the joke.

178
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,706
I wish Jim had fallen
into that pond.

179
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,407
Then he'd have
to put on my suit,

180
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,383
and it would be too
short, and he'd look...

181
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,453
Damn it,
he'd still look good.

182
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,180
The most fundamental thing
about sensitivity training

183
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:43,854
is that you cannot make fun of a
person for something or some action

184
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,330
that they have done
that they regret.

185
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,526
You can only make fun of things
that they have control over.

186
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,835
Like, Oscar is gay.
That is his choice.

187
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:58,343
We can make fun of that. I did
not choose to fall into a koi pond.

188
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,504
Michael, you still
can't make fun of people

189
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,310
for race or gender or sexual
orientation or religion...

190
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,680
Who let the lemonhead
into the room?

191
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,582
You are a waste of life
and you should give up.

192
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,820
Is what I want to say
but I won't,

193
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,861
because that is why we
are doing this right now.

194
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,523
So, Toby, welcome to sensitivity
training for real. Show of hands.

195
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,892
Who here has
been koi-ponded?

196
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,132
Who here has been the butt of
a joke that has gone too far?

197
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,369
Phyllis. Michael, you
make fun of us every day.

198
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,240
Yeah. Every single day.

199
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,676
You never said anything.

200
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,213
We have. Countless times.

201
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:39,342
Well, it is hard to tell the
difference between you guys saying,

202
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,010
"Stop, because
I want you to stop,"

203
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:45,023
or stop as in, "Stop, you're
making me laugh so hard.

204
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,855
"What you're doing is so
funny. You're on a roll.

205
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,690
"I am busting
a gut. Stop!"

206
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,153
That's never
been the case.

207
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,563
We are going to make

208
00:08:54,634 --> 00:09:00,595
a Do Not Mock list.

209
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:05,838
Okay? Anything that we think might
be out of bounds, we put on this list.

210
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,612
Anything you put on this list,
you cannot be teased about.

211
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,740
Got it?

212
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,374
I'm going to kick it off.

213
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:18,219
Let's see what I have
to put on the list, right?

214
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,622
Okay.

215
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,651
I also have fallen into the
fountain at the Steamtown Mall.

216
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,890
You fell into
a second fountain?

217
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,726
(ALL CHUCKLING)

218
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,461
Can you kick me
out of the meeting now?

219
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:30,968
Go. Go.

220
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,341
Starting today, teasing
will no longer be tolerated.

221
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,139
You mean there's
no teasing of any kind?

222
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:43,648
No, no, no, just things that are on
the list. That is the beauty of it.

223
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,116
Okay, who else? Who
else? Dwight, come on.

224
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,085
I don't want people
making fun of my nose.

225
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,621
Your nose?

226
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,586
It's too small.

227
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,593
The geometric proportions of my face
are perfect in every way but one.

228
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,429
My nose is too small.

229
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,488
I mean, it still works.
I can smell things.

230
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,763
I just have to be a lot
closer than most people.

231
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,629
Oh, my.
That is small.

232
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,332
Just write it
down, please.

233
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,600
OSCAR: Can you
breathe okay?

234
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,266
What keeps your
glasses on?

235
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,742
Hey, it's on the list,
everybody.

236
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,109
No, I haven't
finished writing.

237
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,480
Did you sneeze it off?
That's it. No more. Okay.

238
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,576
Who else, who else? Everybody's
going to get their chance.

239
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,486
I don't want people
making fun of my weight.

240
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,751
Okay, that's too broad. It's
got to be something else.

241
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,986
How about your
stomach? Yeah?

242
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,327
Who else? I'm very sensitive
about my petite figure.

243
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,588
Oh, God.

244
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,395
I am. I'm afraid of being
thrown around like a football.

245
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,204
Well, you know, Nicole Richie
might think that you are fat.

246
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,002
Does that make
you feel better?

247
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,133
Meredith?

248
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,370
I don't want to
say it out loud.

249
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,072
Okay, fine. Come on up
here, write it yourself.

250
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,207
And don't sign your name
to it, and nobody look.

251
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,816
Everybody,
look away, look away.

252
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,416
Well, I really didn't want
to put it on the board,

253
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,754
but I thought maybe it was
going to come out somehow.

254
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,020
So, what are you
going to do?

255
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,656
Okay.

256
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,429
Some of you
may have noticed

257
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:16,806
I'm in that kind of ill-defined
relationship type of thing.

258
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,309
Okay, what do you
want me to write?

259
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,072
Just put Kelly.
Aw!

260
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,135
That still going on?

261
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,737
I will claw
your tiny nose off.

262
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,248
It's on the list.

263
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,681
Creed, your turn.

264
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,117
If I write it down,
I can't be charged with it.

265
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,714
No one said that.

266
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,353
That is our sales pitch,
and we are sticking to it.

267
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,391
Well, you two are quite the
salesmen, and a very cute couple.

268
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,193
Well, it's...
Oh...

269
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,502
Thank you.
Thank you.

270
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,529
Some couples don't seem like
a good match, but you two do.

271
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,835
Well, you know.

272
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,537
Yeah, you know,
two peas in a pod.

273
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,238
We complete
each other.

274
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,008
What can I say?
She loves to cook...

275
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,709
He loves to eat.

276
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,445
I love to dance...

277
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,678
I love to watch
him dance.

278
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,916
Yeah, right. Sometimes I'll just
dance for hours in the living room.

279
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,217
And I'll watch him.

280
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,089
And a baby on the way?
You must be so excited.

281
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,650
Mmm.
Yes.

282
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,959
Yeah, we are thrilled.
Mmm-hmm.

283
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,521
In fact, we spent
the whole weekend

284
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,863
researching various
birthing coaches.

285
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:16,924
Wasn't that
fun, honey?

286
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,128
It was, sweetie.
Yeah.

287
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,105
Oh, I know the best teacher.
Her name is Miss Janet.

288
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,401
Yeah, on Clearview Avenue.

289
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,499
KEENA: Yeah!

290
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,668
Yeah.

291
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:30,144
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some
people say that I eat like a squirrel.

292
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,743
So now you're comparing
yourself to a cute, tiny animal?

293
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:35,978
Michael?
Hmm?

294
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,650
The custodian called again.
Apparently a koi has died.

295
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,817
Oh, man!
(ALL EXCLAIM)

296
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:41,917
It's a fish.

297
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,891
They want you
to pay for it.

298
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,555
It could have died of
natural causes, though.

299
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:49,328
Well, they said you stepped
on its head. He did not suffer.

300
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,167
When is the funeral?

301
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,706
Do not mock, Oscar.
Do not mock.

302
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,605
How much do they want?
$300.

303
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:00,304
What? No. I could get a
fish for a five-cent worm.

304
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,372
You're paying way too much for
worms, man. Who's your worm guy?

305
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,647
Okay, great meeting,
everybody. That's it. No, no.

306
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,053
Thank you. No, we are
not done here. This...

307
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,618
One of the baby
books suggests

308
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,026
the best birthing posture is
on all fours, like an animal.

309
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,724
I just wish I had
a special telephone

310
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,962
so I could find out exactly
what the little soybean wants.

311
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,163
Right? Hey, little
soybean. What do you want?

312
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,331
Right? How do...

313
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,907
I felt it kick.
Oh, that's great!

314
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,141
Oh, my gosh, like a little
magical foot just high-fived me.

315
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,614
Yeah, well,
that'll happen.

316

Oh, my gosh.

317
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,885
It's like he's trying to say,
"I love you, too, Daddy.

318

"I love you, too."

Message received,
little soybean.

323
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,198
I think you just got to
ride this one out, man.

324
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,564
No, Jim, you don't understand.

325
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,728
Things like this
just don't die.

326
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,440
Kids in high school still call
me "Ponytail." No, they don't.

327
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,068
Yes, they do, Jim.
Because of the time

328
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,669
I got my ponytail
stuck in the power drill.

329

Maybe if you make fun of
yourself, it'll all go away.

I want to make fun
of you right now.

Really? Do it. I am a
big, stupid goofball.

332

No, don't do that.
You're not stupid.

333
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,350

334
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,720
Oh, my God.

Hey, I just want to say
that I cannot believe

336
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,299
that I walked
into a koi pond.

337
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,565
I mean, seriously,
walk much?

338

Oh!

339
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,902
I should wear a snorkel to the
next business meeting that I go to.

340
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,879
Michael, you know, when you think
about it, it's not all your fault.

341
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,812
I mean, who puts
a koi pond in a lobby?

342

MICHAEL: Well,
you know what?

343
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,653
You're right, Phyllis,
but I've been there before.

344
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,985
I've seen that pond.
This is the thing,

345

I am a world-class moron,
is the problem.

346
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,585
Michael, please stop it now.
You're embarrassing yourself.

347
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,992
It's okay.
We're having fun.

348
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,225
It's actually not the first time
I've been embarrassed by a pond.

In high school,

used to throw me into the frozen lake.

It was freezing! No, no,
no. This is even worse.

354
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,837
Couple of weeks ago, I
went to get a new cell phone

355
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,474
and I wanted one
of those packages

356
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,744
where you have
the five, you know,

357
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,809
the friends
and family thing?

358
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,912
And the guy was like, "Who
are your five friends?"

359
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,719
And I'm like...
I didn't even know.

I couldn't even think. Oh, my
God, it was so embarrassing.

361
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,920
That was so...

362
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,960
I don't even have Jan's cell
phone number, and I hate her.

363
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:41,572
She won't give it to me. I was
like, "I guess I'm a loser."

night janitor over there.

should go easy on Michael, guys.

00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,655
Jim is jealous of me?

468
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,793
Jim is jealous of me.

469
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,494
Hey, what's up,
lifeguard?

470
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,539
OSCAR: Jim, I think
I'm in your way.

471
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,632
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

472
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,106
Oscar's a douche.

473
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,083
He's all right.
No.

474
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,416
He's... Yeah,
he's all right.

475
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,249
Okay.

476
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,157
Thanks, Michael.
You're welcome.

477
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,729
Whoa! Almost fell.

478
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,165
(CHUCKLES)

479
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,531
Hey, Erin, do you mind
faxing this for me? Oh, sure.

480
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,338
Wait, hand them
to me upside down,

481
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,844
so I don't accidentally read them.

482
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,704
Okay.
Thanks.

483
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,805
Mmm-hmm.

484
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,544
How did today go, by the way?
Did you make any sales?

485
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,019
No, it was a total
waste of time.

486
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,282
It was fun, though,

487
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,917
because I got
to spend the day

488
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,258
with Andy Bernard
and he's really cool.

489
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,694
Yeah, he is.

490
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,061
Yeah, he is.

491
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,293
He's like the coolest
person I've ever met.

492
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,233
That's right.

493
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,305
He's like Marlon Brando.

494
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,443
Oh, do you mean Marlon
Wayans? 'Cause he is.

495
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,681
I actually do mean
Marlon Wayans. Yeah.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
