Okay, I'm calling
the police.

158
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,719
That is the stupidest thing
you could do right now.

159
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,450
No, he's right.
Cops can't do anything

160
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,718
until a crime
has been reported.

161
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:06,781
All right.
Not only that,

162
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,451
but if they find out you snitched,

163
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,588
you get a dead horse's
chopped off head in your bed.

164
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,097
You know what? (SHUSHING)
That's not going to happen.

165
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,531
That's an exaggeration.
ANDY: That's how it works.

166
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,828
MICHAEL: What am I
supposed to do here?

167
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,201
When somebody threatens you,
you give in right away.

168
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,832
Okay, you need to buy insurance from
this guy and get him off your back.

169
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,000
I was thinking exactly the same thing.

170
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,339
No. Criminals are like
raccoons, okay?

171
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,435
You give them
a taste of cat food,

172
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,309
pretty soon they'll be
back for the whole cat.

173
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,110
Dwight. The only way to defeat a bully

174
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,346
is to stand up to him. Trust me,
I have bullied a lot of people.

175
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,647
I don't know. I don't know about that.

176
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,745
Wait. Let's hear him out.
This is interesting.

177
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,690
Here's what we do. We
meet him in a public place,

178
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,522
ask him to lunch
or something like that.

179
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,562
Someplace where he
can't be openly violent.

180
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,789
Okay.
Let him know

181
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,355
that you are not the typical kind
of guy that he can shake down,

182
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:51,096
that you're stubborn, that you
might even be a little bit dangerous.

183
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,434
I like this plan. I'd like to
officially withdraw my plan.

184
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,871
Hold on, hold on,
just...

185
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,238
No, no, no, no.
My plan is out.

186
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,742
We do it the hard way.

187
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,211
All right, I will meet with
him, but I'm not going alone.

188
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,408
(CHUCKLING) Well, you're going to
have to. We'll be right beside you.

189
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,508
What?

190
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,053
All right.

191
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,096
What are you wearing?
Who's Pat?

192
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,626
If I'm going to back you up, I need
a weapon without drawing suspicion.

193
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,172
And I have to
justify it somehow,

194
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,504
so I'm a mechanic
with a tire thing.

195
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,735
Do you know
how to use it?

196
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,334
To change tires, no.

197
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,811
But, I mean, it's metal,
I can hit somebody with it.

198
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,576
Let's go, come on.

199
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,409
God. God.

200
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,287
Should I change?
You're wearing loafers.

201
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,346
Forget it.
Forget it.

202
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,187
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

203
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,788
Take that thing off
the table. Please.

204
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,631
Well, then I can't use it.
I'm just going to hide it.

205
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,494
Hey. The bathroom
checks out clean.

206
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,472
Nothing behind the toilet
except this roach motel.

207
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,406
No! God!
Oh, my God.

208
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,103
You'll never kill it that way. Guys.

209
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,508
You want to separate
the head from the thorax.

210
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,241
Guys, guys. Cool it.

211
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,973
There he is, there he is.

212
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,411
Hello.
Mr. Scott, hello.

213
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:19,481
Mr. Grotti, we meet again.
These are my associates.

214
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,821
Hi, Angelo Grotti.

215
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,951
Hi.
Hello.

216
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,053
So...
You got this table?

217
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,927
Yes. What's this, one
of them half-booths,

218
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,295
can't-decide-what-it-is
type of thing?

219
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,526
Well...

220
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,593
Waitress, we're going
to sit over here.

221
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,899
That's fine.

222
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,064
Okay.

223
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,568
(PHONE RINGING)

224
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,437
Hello?

225
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,574
<i>WOMAN: (ON PHONE)
Hello, Mr. Halpert.</i>

226
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,676
<i>I'm calling from the Identity
Theft department at Capital One.</i>

227
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,745
<i>We've detected some unusual
activity on your credit card.</i>

228
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,383
Oh, man. Do you think
it was stolen?

229
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,553
<i>First, would you mind
verifying your home address?</i>

230
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,755
Um... Yes.

231
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,392
383 Linden Ave.,
Scranton, PA.

232
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,961
<i>And may I have the last four
digits of your social security?</i>

233
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,666
Six-six-five-zero.

234
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,734
<i>Well, Mr. Halpert, you're obviously
not in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</i>

235
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,143
Wait a minute.
Yes, I am.

236
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,010
<i>I'm going to go ahead
and put a hold on your card.</i>

237
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,346
No. That... I...

238
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,251
I think that we should let the
criminal use the card a little longer.

239
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,582
<i>Very funny, sir. We'll get a
new card out to you right away.</i>

240
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,184
<i>No. Have a nice day and thank you.</i>

241
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,021
Shoot.

242
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,297
If you want to supplement
your coverage, we can do that.

243
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,931
If you want to replace your
current coverage, all the better.

244
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,201
Hey, you seem
like a nice guy.

245
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,468
Oh, he's not that nice.

246
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,009
That's true.
Mmm-hmm.

247
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,205
That's very true.
Okay, shut up.

248
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,076
Have you decided?

249
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,242
Yeah, I'll have the linguini,
red sauce on the side.

250
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,845
If the sauce does not come on
the side, I will send it back.

251
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,355
I want garlic bread,
toasted, not burnt.

252
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,790
If it comes burnt,
I will send it back.

253
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,795
Okay, then.
And for you, sir?

254
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,228
I will have
the gabbagool.

255
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,160
The what?

256
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,033
The gabbagool.

257
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,499
I don't really know
what that is.

258
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,266
You know,
gabbagool.

259
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,705
I don't have to have that.

260
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,572
What he's trying to
say is, gabbagool.

261
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:18,632
Guys, guys,
all right.

262
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,803
I don't really think
that we have that.

263
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,540
That's okay. Bring him the gabbagool.

264
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,981
(SHUSHING) I will have the
spaghetti with a side salad.

265
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,143
Okay.

266
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,014
If the salad is on top,
I send it back.

267
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,088
Why would you cancel
Jim's credit cards?

268
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,149
I usually can think
quick on my feet,

269
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,126
but they were so
fast on the phone.

270
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,095
This constitutes
identity fraud.

271
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,392
Oh, God.

272
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,829
I wouldn't last in jail,
Oscar. I'm not like you.

273
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,800
What's that
supposed to mean?

274
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,771
What, you don't
know about jail?

275
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,967
You would love jail.

276
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,709
Why would I love jail?

277
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,213
Because...
You would love it.

278
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:02,213
I don't think our company actually
needs any more insurance. So, I am out.

279
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,917
Look closely, Michael. I feel
there's a plan here for you.

280
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,820
Maybe we have
a plan for you.

281
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,725
How about you?

282
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,788
Maybe you can use supplemental
coverage of some kind.

283
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,493
Anybody can get hurt.

284
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,968
You always think it can't
happen to you, and...

285
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,061
(BANGS ON TABLE)

286
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,403
Think about it.

287
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,704
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

288
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,936
Are you a mechanic?

289
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,068
Yeah.

290
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,511
My battery's dead. I've got
my kid. Can you please help?

291
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,570
Yes, I can.

292
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,842
No, no, no,
no, come on.

293
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,349
I'm sorry, we're
having our salads.

294
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,750
Come on,
lady in distress.

295
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,809
Go, go.

296
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,685
Okay. Sorry.

297
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,022
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

298
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,253
Hey, do you
need any help?

299
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,092
I'm sure he can handle
a simple jumpstart.

300
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,654
Now, come on, sit down.

301
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,721
He's a good mechanic.

302
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,028
Sit down.

303
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,262
Where were we?
I don't...

304
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,635
He was trying to force you to
sign a policy. Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,697
So, we're choosing...
Okay. Yep.

306
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,744
Did you check out Dental?
All right, put it down.

307
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:04,306
Black goes on the red with
the... If we... Positive...

308
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,179
It being a motor drive,
it's probably down.

309
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,086
He seems bad at this.

310
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,126
You want to do this, junior?
I didn't think so.

You're gonna want to
get a refund on that.

great. But I can't do that for you.

this letter of intent,

I'll bring this
back to my boss

You okay, Pat?

326
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:56,957
Yeah, I was
just thinking

327
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:02,530
about how I had this car.
It was this Italian car.

328
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,439
And I was driving it,

329
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,444
and it kept
telling me how much

330
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,980
it needed oil, but I
wouldn't give it any oil.

331
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,949
And then, one day it exploded
and it killed everyone,

332
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,644
and that's what
I'm afraid of.

333
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,244
Aren't you a mechanic? Why
wouldn't you put oil in a car?

334
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,847
It was before my
technical training.

335
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,154
Don't do it.

336
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,118
Do it.

Don't.
Just do it.

338
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,923
Okay.
Don't do it.

339
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,662
Look, Mike, I don't know what
your friends are telling you,

340
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,637
but you have to
decide for yourself.

341
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,697

going to take care

down, Michael. I'm proud of you.

349
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,421
I had to make
a snap decision, Dwight.

350
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,789
It wasn't a snap decision. You
were sitting there for an hour.

351
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,055
It was a lot of
snap decisions.

Do you know what "snap
decision" means? MICHAEL: Yes.

I had to tell the hotel that
it was a medical emergency.

361
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,812
I chose a massive

you told me that your

Hey, question for you.

I recently purchased some insurance that
I can't afford given my present salary.

Is there anything

it all go away?

Not on the inside,
he's not.

400
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:07,488
Look at his life. Broke, living
in fear, no friends, dead-end job.

401
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,823
Yeah, some of that
existed before.

Yes.

to this Mafia guy.

that happening.

with you?

I am talking about convincing
Michael that the guy's not Mafia.

414
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,911
That seems
a little farfetched.

415
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,889
What, more farfetched than a
mobster walking into a paper company

416
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,892
for a low-level shakedown?
And that happened.

Michael, incredible
news. Grotti is clean.

No, he's not.
He's just good.

Nothing sticks to him. You still
don't understand how this works.

420
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,866
No, Michael, what
we're trying to say is,

421
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,502
we made a mistake
assuming he was Mafia.

422

I have a buddy who's a Fed and we
did a background check on the guy,

his background
is perfectly clean.

It's true,
he's clean.

425

I have a couple of friends still
on the force, checked with them,

426
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,117
ran his Fed friend up the flagpole
to make sure he wasn't on the take.

427
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,556
Turns out he's a totally lovely guy.

He's trying to intimidate
you to close sales.

He's just
a pushy salesman.

out and kill all the liars.

wouldn't tell the cops a thing.

Not that I would
be lying, per se,

<i>Why? I think you know exactly why.</i>

Next time you look
in the mirror,

465
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:47,685
you're going to be looking at
a guy who stood down the Mafia.

466
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,615
No. What do you mean?

467
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,420
We just told you he wasn't
Mafia so you wouldn't be scared.

468
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,616
What?

469
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,186
You successfully
backed down the mob.

470
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:03,928
You made the Mafia apologize to
you. You made the Mafia be polite.

471
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,265
Oh, man.

472
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,235
I should be mad
at you guys.

473
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,868
But I'm not.

474
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,574
So, I looked him
in the eye and I said,

475
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,116
"Not today, Grotti.
Not today.

476
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:23,280
"And not tomorrow, and not the
next day, or the day after that.

477
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,346
"And you can tell
all your friends that

478
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,587
"if I see them,
then they are already dead."

479
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,922
I said something like that.

480
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,019
Very close.

481
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,085
Just to be clear,
he backed down

482
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,189
an insurance agent from
Mutual of Harrisburg.

483
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,255
Erin?
ERIN: Yes?

484
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,528
Coffee.
Okay.

485
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,900
Not from the kitchen,
Stop & Shop.

486
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,461
If it's not Stop & Shop,
I send it back.

487
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,528
Okay.

488
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,632
Large. If it's a medium, I send it back.

489
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,939
If it's an extra large,
I send it back.

490
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,376
How do you
return coffee?

491
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,470
Go.

492
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,739
Any questions?

493
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,077
(PHONE RINGING)

494
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,414
<i>PAM: (ON PHONE)
Are you kidding me?</i>

495
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,648
Hi, Pam. Is Jim there?

496
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,283
<i>Listen, our credit card has been
canceled and we have to deal with that.</i>

497
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,385
<i>And I really can't handle the
fact that you're calling us here.</i>

498
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,829
Okay, that sounds good.
I'll let you go.

499
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:11,426
Just tell Jim
that I said hi.

500
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:15,837
<i>I will. I will, Kevin. I will
make that my top priority.</i>

501
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,602
Cool. Okay. Bye.

502
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,938
(DIAL TONE SOUNDING)

503
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,378
They have no idea
what happened.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
