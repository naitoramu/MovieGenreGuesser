00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,519
Oh, that looks good!

4
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,960
Oh, yes, it's awesome!

5
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,760
That's very good, yeah!

6
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,320
What are you doing?

7
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,040
You missed a spot.

8
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,999
Ok, I got it! Is this a good spot?

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,599
Perfect!...double knot it.

10
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,040
Right! You got it!

11
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,239
Hehe! This will be the
most awesomest party...

12
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,120
That the forest will be witnessing.
Whoohoo!

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,799
Yeah, it will, no thanks to you.
It was me and the other guys.

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,759
We did all of the construction.

15
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,400
You know it!

16
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:23,759
All you did was choke down bananas...

17
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,119
Whoa! I'm supervising!

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,719
That is the job suited for me.

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,320
Ha! Well we don't-uh?
Wait a minute. Bramble?

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
Yeah, over here, briar!

21
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,320
Bramble, let go of that!

22
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,560
Ugh!!

23
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,159
That does it. It took me all the morning
to create that mastery.

24
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,319
And now it's broken.

25
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,159
You done crushed all the snacks!

26
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,919
You made me look like Woodstock!

27
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,639
And you gave me this! And it hurts!

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,199
This is all your fault! What do you
have to saying for yourself?

29
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,280
You all right?

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,240
Hey! Wake up right now!

31
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
Wake up!

32
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,959
You guys don't have a hibernation season.

33
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,599
You just don't know how lucky you are.
We have a mental capacity...

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,719
Far superior to yours, so we need
hibernation to rest our minds.

35
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,239
It's complicated-anyway,
it's about time we get back to the cave

36
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,599
and have along nap.

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,039
You're kidding me...

38
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,119
You'll be going nowhere
after what you two did!

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,119
Yeah, whatever you say.
It's non-negotiable.

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,319
Hey, come back!

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,080
Get back, you-or stay gone forever!

42
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,719
Brother rat, brother ox from the sacred faction
tiger and the rabbit gotta see 'em in action

43
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,999
horse and the ram comin' down
for the fight, now

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,160
dragon's to the east,
snake's to the west, now

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,599
monkey! Rooster! Get the kung fu knack down

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,839
dog and the boar, you know
they're never gonna back down

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,119
circle of twelve, got celestial connections

48
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,679
like the mighty keepers
of the four different directions!

49
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,439
And now, the news: Travelers this
holiday season are in for a shock,

50
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,280
as ticket prices have doub...

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,280
Ha! Suckers! My folks are
in Hawaii this holiday,

52
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,000
so I've got nothin' to do but relax!

53
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,720
Where am I?

54
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,200
How weird...

55
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,440
Uh? What am I
supposed to do with this? Huh?

56
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,240
What the... ah!

57
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,760
Those little guys are really hungry!
Uh? That sure was fast... ah!

58
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,280
Gotta make my quota!

59
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,920
This work is never finished!

60
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,479
If I don't make my quota,

61
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,320
the boss is gonna fire me!

62
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,880
Faster, faster!

63
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,200
Keep moving!

64
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,960
They never stop...

65
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Huh?

66
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,480
Eeeee, I know those faces.

67
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,880
It's you two?

68
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,200
Let me go! Ahh!

69
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,800
How crazy! What a weird dream.

70
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,000
Who in the world could be calling? Alright.

71
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,519
Let's see. Hello?

72
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,199
Hello, vick! There's
been a change of plans!

73
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,879
What's that? I'm busy now, darn it!

74
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,600
Excuse me?

75
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:38,439
- Is that any way to talk to your father?
- Give me the phone!

76
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,999
- You should show me some respect...
- Don't talk to my baby like that, frank!

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,839
Hey, Vicky, this is mom.

78
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,119
Huh?

79
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,400
I thought they were on vacation.
I don't need this.

80
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,839
- Vicky! Vicky! Hello?
- Ah! Oh, hey! Hi, mom.

81
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,439
How dare you hang up on...

82
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,360
Your own mother?!

83
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:55,919
We raised you better than that!

84
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,479
What is wrong with you? What kind of
son hangs up on such loving parents?

85
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,959
What are you, a big shot now?

86
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,439
Don't have time to talk
to your mother?

87
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,559
I'm sorry. The lines must have
got crossed.

88
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,999
That's been happening a lot out here.

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,479
You should call the phone company.

90
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,239
Oh, I will right away, dad.

91
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,839
So how was Hawaii?

92
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,999
Your mother couldn't stand the humidity.
We decided to come home.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,719
- Now you can come back home for the holiday.
- Yeah! Whoa!

94
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,959
See? Great news!

95
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,039
Let me talk to him. Honey, you know
how I sweat profusely in...

96
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,759
That kind of heat. It was keeping
your father up all night!

97
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,279
Uh, too much, mom.

98
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,039
Are you keeping yourself fed?

99
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,159
You sound like
you're getting skinnier...

100
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,080
Everything's fine.

101
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:35,079
Pish-tosh! You couldn't take care of
yourself for love or money.

102
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,039
Now you get your heinie
on the first train home...

103
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,639
Unless you like making
your mother worry...

104
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,399
Mom! Don't worry!

105
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,720
I am capable of taking care of myself.

106
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,199
I'm actually living in a really nice place
and saving a lot of money.

107
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,599
You gotta trust me.
Things couldn't be better.

108
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,959
Good! Then you've got money
to come home!

109
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,519
I promise I'll visit soon.

110
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,359
Don't be sad! Ah!

111
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,079
No. Don't bother. I'd hate to
inconvenience Mr. Big man...

112
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,960
Who's too important...

113
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:01,640
To make his mother happy.

114
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,599
- Come on!
- No, it's fine!

115
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,520
I got a lot of laundry to do.

116
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,359
If he's not gonna come,
he's not gonna come.

117
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,039
I'm joking! Of course I'll be there;
You actually fell for that? Hehe...

118
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll have everything ready

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
by the time you get here.

120
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:13,519
If you're late,
we're startin' without you!

121
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,439
Ok. Alright. I'll see you later!

122
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,559
Hey vick! I heard your parents
canceled their vacation.

123
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,439
Good luck getting back
to your hometown...

124
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,439
- So close to new year's, sucker!
- You'll regret that, Nelson!

125
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,879
I hope
you run out of gas, you jerk!

126
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,960
Wait a sec. He's right. It is close...

127
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,519
So today is the twenty-fourth?
Oh no!

128
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,760
That only gives me...
Five more days?!?

129
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,399
No... no, no...

130
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,880
It isn't enough time!

131
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,480
I gotta get ready...

132
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,039
This is travel world, Betty speaking...

133
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,559
I need to book a ticket to stillwater.

134
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,719
It looks like there are only first class
tickets still available, sir...

135
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,359
First, second, fourth, fifth,

136
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,559
just get me a ticket!

137
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,599
Alright, sir. The price for your ticket
will be 875 dollars.

138
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,639
Will that be cash or credit?

139
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,239
Once again?

140
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,999
That will be 875 big ones, sir.

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,280
875?! That's the price for one ticket?

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,960
Well, um, can you hold on

143
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,799
- for a minute...
- This is a busy time of year, sir.

144
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,599
I don't have time to waste waiting for...

145
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,679
Penny-pinchers to scrounge up
loose change. Good day, sir!

146
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,000
Uh? Hey! Hold on!

147
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,080
You hung up on me! Dang you, Betty!

148
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,560
Looks like I'm going to have to go
into my savings.

149
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,200
Hehe_.

150
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,920
Stay outta my boot,
you stinking pest!

151
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,800
Ah, I found it! Hehe.

152
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,800
Haha, I can barely count it all!
Three hundred fifty six, point eight.

153
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,879
What? That's not even half the price!
Just when I thought my luck...

154
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,640
Was finally turning around...
Oh, now what? Uh?

155
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,519
That's right!
Jenkins still owes me money...

156
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,039
Look at all these ious.

157
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,880
That's more than enough
to get home!

158
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,719
How did I let that rotten root-picker's
debt get so out of control?!?

159
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,999
Jenkins better pay me back,

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,079
and I mean now!

161
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,919
I work so hard all year 'round,

162
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,959
and that Jenkins just takes and takes...

163
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,320
And I'm sick of it!

164
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,440
If he tries something smart,
I'll rip those hair plugs right out!

165
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,079
Hello, this is Jenkins.

166
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,759
Oh? Hey Jenkins, ya big jerk...
I mean, I was just messing with you, hehe.

167
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,119
- How are you? That's nice...
- What, now?

168
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,719
I just have this quick question
for you: I was wondering...

169
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,759
If I could collect on those ious.
They have really been piling up.

170
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,959
We have quite the collection now, and...

171
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,519
Ious?

172
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,599
Yeah, that's right!

173
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,919
Oh, yeah, umm... sure thing...

174
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,599
Yeah! All right!

175
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,919
But there's one condition...

176
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,439
I'm only about half way through
the week's wood choppin' quota,

177
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,199
you know what I mean?
Finish it for me, and I'll pay you.

178
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,560
Say what?! Half a week's quota?

179
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,199
But that would take me all...

180
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,399
Take it or leave it!
I don't have time for this.

181
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,719
And don't call back till you're done!

182
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,159
But Jenkins, you owe,

183
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,640
uh... hello?

184
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,319
Sorry, the person you're dialing has
chosen to ignore you at this time...

185
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,720
Darn you Jenkins, that's not fair,
that money is mine... ow!

186
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,320
Who let the owls out?
Who let the owls out?

187
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,240
Cool! Bring me another one!

188
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,919
Eee-zee... go on, get a moving on!

189
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
No slacking off!

190
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:15,520
Yes! Right, sire!

191
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,159
You're the only slacker here!

192
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,599
You show respect! I've got to
managing all of you!

193
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
So don't give me hard time! Hear?

194
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,519
Bad news, sire! Warren's gone.

195
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,240
Say what?!

196
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:30,560
Oh, yeah... where'd that guy go?

197
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,960
Far, far away! You guys'll handle it!

198
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,960
Now, as for me-
I've got sculpting to do!

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And now we'll toss on the olllll' head!

200
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,239
Ugh... yep! He's gonna pay me
every dime he owes!

201
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,680
Stinkin'jerkins!

202
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,960
That fool!...Mess with me...

203
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,960
He always has been such a mooch!

204
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,160
Ok...

205
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,399
That was so much harder
than I thought it would be.

206
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
I really need to get in shape.

207
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Huh?

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Wow!

209
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,720
This is...

210
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,000
This is too gorgeous!

211
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,999
This was absolutely worth the climb!

212
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,760
Jenkins' area has much
better wood than mine.

213
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,640
Wow! You're so beautiful!
I'm gonna cut you down!

214
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,640
You're my ticket home!

215
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,640
Wow...

216
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,160
These giants are such majestic beauties.

217
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,320
Well! Time to get to work!

218
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,600
Why, you...

219
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,760
Someone barbequing?

220
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,560
If I have to make this
stupid thing again...

221
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,880
Are you kidding me?

222
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,120
How'd that even happen? Yes!
Smart, vick!

223
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,760
That feels much better.

224
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,520
Good as new!

225
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,160
Huh? Logger vick? What's he doing?

226
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,680
Huh?

227
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,040
The blade...

228
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,799
Top quality...?

229
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,879
What are you made of-steel?
I'm gonna go back and build a...

230
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,519
Turbo-diesel-thermonuclear
monster tree-chopping machine!

231
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,920
Don't go anywhere!

232
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,680
That looks like nedric's tree!

233
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,000
I'd better go investigate!

234
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,200
He's crazy!

235
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,239
One and two,
now here's something new!

236
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,839
Three and four,
hear the lumberjack roar!

237
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,280
I wanna see my pop,
and the mom I adore...

238
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,479
Slash! Trash! Lop! Chop!
Down in a flash!

239
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,800
There's really nothing
this machine cannot do!

240
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,719
Plunk! Plunk! Clink! Clink!
Here comes the cash!

241
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,079
I'm just a one-man
tree-chopping crew!

242
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,320
Comin' home to yoooooooooooo!

243
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,640
Everything is gonna be fine!

244
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,280
Train ride home is gonna be mine!

245
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,319
Time to chop down ev-er-y pine!

246
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:17,119
Say! Hey! Let's take her...
For a drive!

247
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,200
Oh! I've got to hurry and warn the others!

248
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,479
Well, that went ok...

249
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,639
That tree won't stand a chance!

250
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,199
This is my ticket to buying my ticket!

251
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
I love the great outdoors!!!!

252
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,319
Hoo hoo! Come on,

253
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,719
I need a hand over here!

254
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,200
Yep, I'm comin!

255
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,720
Now that's a handsome monkey!
Like me! Oh, boy!

256
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,399
Heads up, guys! Logger vick is...

257
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,160
Aaaaarrrrrggghhh!

258
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,479
Chopping trees...

259
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,360
Remember your blood pressure,
sire!

260
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,760
Warren!!

261
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,240
Say what?!

262
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,639
Vick's doing what?

263
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,159
Chopping down trees?

264
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,639
That's right! And he's got this giant
tree-chopping contraption!

265
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,720
And you know what? He's headed
straight for nedric's tree!

266
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,799
Oh, no! Not nedric's tree!

267
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,679
Let me think... man!

268
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,159
That crazy ol' logger vick
ain't gonna stop...

269
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,839
Logging unless we destroy
that confounded machine of his!

270
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,719
- Ah! I can fly...
- You're so right!

271
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,479
Humph! As your king,

272
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,600
I've decided
we will destroy the machine.

273
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,799
It is a brilliant idea, yes!

274
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,999
We've got to go after vick and
destroy him...

275
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,399
Before nedric moves to
our part of the forest!

276
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,680
Uh, no offense, but... I...

277
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,999
Alright, let's get going!
This is the moment of vengeance!

278
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,919
This is the day that vickie will rue!

279
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,440
Whoohoo! Brilliant!
You're a true genius, my king!

280
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What's goin' on? Hey, Warren!

281
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,399
Holy Toledo! Vick's coming!

282
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,480
Oh. He's coming to the party?

283
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,279
No. He's not coming to the party;

284
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,479
he's coming here to destroy us all,
hoo hoo!

285
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,319
You don't say! I gotta go!
Sound the alarm!

286
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
Save the women and children!

287
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,200
You go ahead
and take a rest there, guy!

288
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,880
Hehe! Nice work. Vick'll be done for.

289
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,040
Yep, hehehe... like I planned.

290
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,640
No! Too small...

291
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,040
Well! It's not so scary!

292
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,799
Alright! Now you listening here, vick!

293
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,080
Put your feet on those brakes,
or else!!!!

294
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,240
Ahh... that is not what I said!
Ugh... that's it!

295
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,679
Animals, charge!

296
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,159
Sunny day,

297
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,799
everything's a-ok!

298
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,240
La-ia-ia...

299
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,360
Dangit! What are you doing??

300
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,360
Logger vick!

301
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,200
How are you going to cut down...

302
00:20:57,201 --> 00:21:00,520
That tree after I stun you
with my hypnotic gaze?!?

303
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,159
Am I doing this right, Warren?

304
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,519
You're getting sleepy, vick, sleepy...

305
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,480
'Cause I don't think
I'm supposed to get dizzy.

306
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,679
Your eyelids are getting heavier...

307
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,960
Get away from me!

308
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,839
Oh no! Hehehe... well, I hope you
enjoyed the show!

309
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,600
Let's not turn this into
a personal thi... ow!

310
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,840
Haha! Later, you little twerps!

311
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,439
Aye aye aye... what an embarrassment sight!
Quickly...

312
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,639
- Here!
- Move it!

313
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Sire!

314
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,800
Dun-dun-dun-dun,

315
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,280
It's my turn, monkey breath.

316
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,360
Babu, fight for your king!

317
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,960
Yes! Right, sire!

318
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,840
Nice try!

319
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,200
Get down!

320
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,639
Oh, I'm surely gonna pay for dis one.

321
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,799
- Haha...
- Sire?

322
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,360
That's why we keep
your kind in zoos!

323
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,399
- I hit a tree!
- We tried everything!

324
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,999
Sire! Oh, man! Please, sire!

325
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,279
Whatever you do...
Please just don't go into the light!

326
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,519
I'm not dead!

327
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,320
But, you are supposed to protect me!

328
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,559
This is a poor reflecting
of your loyalty.

329
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,320
Let's face it, right?
We need the bears!

330
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,319
With this baby, I'll be knee-deep in
lumber faster than you can say uh...

331
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,519
"Look at that cool guy, he's so knee-
deep in lumber. What a guy!"

332
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,160
Haha!

333
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,840
Briar! Bramble!

334
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:52,919
Wake up, bramble! Briar! Briar!

335
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,520
Wake up!

336
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,679
Come on. Come on, briar,
come on, get up! Emergency!

337
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,560
- Babu!
- Sire!

338
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:04,159
Commence operation wakey wake!

339
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,440
Yes, sire!

340
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,520
So this is hibernation?
What if they don't wake up?

341
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,360
I've got one more trick up my sleeve...

342
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,240
Free honey!

343
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,039
Bramble, thank goodness
you're awake!

344
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,760
We've gotta stop logger vick...

345
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,840
Argh... why does that always
happen to me?

346
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,480
- Ow! That's not honey...
- Yeah! This is serious!

347
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,080
Ok-your brother is stealing from you!

348
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,880
Huh? What happened? What?

349
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,119
What?!

350
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,639
You woke us up
'cause he's cuttin'one tree?!

351
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,080
But that's nedric's home, bro.

352
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,480
Ah, yeah!

353
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,159
So, we meet again, old friend!
I hate to do this to you,

354
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,239
but I really don't have much of a choice.

355
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
It's really nothing personal...

356
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,400
Well, gotta do what I gotta do!

357
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,320
Ahh! What's the big idea?!

358
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,439
Well, if it isn't king crazy
and his royal pains!

359
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,360
You dare mess with me?
Feel my wrath!

360
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,080
Hehehe!

361
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,240
Hehe! What the heck? You nuts?!?

362
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,519
Huh? So it's you two!

363
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,200
Hey, oi' vick!

364
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,360
Bramble!

365
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,800
Not so fast. Engage tennis defense!!

366
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,119
Match and set!

367
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,200
Tiki!

368
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,999
Haha!

369
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,560
Uh? Humph!

370
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,119
For my king!

371
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,080
Oh, my eyes! Ouch!

372
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,599
Spray paint in the eyes?
You're totally going to ruin my look...

373
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,280
With the ladies! How am I going to
get a date looking like this?

374
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,760
When I get my hands on you...

375
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,879
Hehe! Now!

376
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,040
Got it!

377
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,159
Hehe, yeah... uh?

378
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,800
Stinkin' bears! That was the last straw!

379
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,520
Now say good-bye!

380
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,720
Huh? Why'd it stop?

381
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,400
This doesn't make any sense.

382
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,400
Uh? What... argh!

383
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,840
Yeah! Warren did it!
Haha. Let's enjoy the show.

384
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,640
We win again, vick!

385
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,279
- Haha, what a sucker!
- Haha, he fell...

386
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,320
The best laid plans of mice and... uh?

387
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,879
Get away from me,
you stupid piece ofjunk!

388
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,520
You're supposed to cut down trees!

389
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,520
Haha... so, you guys wanna watch?

390
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Yeah!

391
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,760
Stay back! Stay baack! Leave me alone...
Oh, no! Ahh! Argh!

392
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,400
That's the last time I trust a
machine I build in one montage!

393
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,520
Gotta keep it out!

394
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
Gotta-arrrgh!

395
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,319
This is your boss! Have you got
the lumber ready?!

396
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,560
Just because you're covering a shift
doesn't mean you can slack off!

397
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,399
I don't know why Jenkins trusts you
to get this done.

398
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,839
But you'd better figure it out or you'll
go back to being a toll collector...

399
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,920
For minimum wage!
Vick, are you listening to me?!

400
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,559
Can I call you back? Ahh!

401
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,999
Don't give me that attitude!
I can't believe Jenkins left you in charge.

402
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,279
I should never have let him
go on vacation early!

403
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,999
Go on vacation early? Ow!

404
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,679
What?
Did you saw your brain in half?

405
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,479
Jenkins left this morning
after talking to you;

406
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,519
he said you wanted
to prove yourself.

407
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,920
I can't believe Jenkins played me
like that!

408
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,319
What are you talking about?
Played you?

409
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,239
I'm covering his quota so he'll
pay back the money he owes me.

410
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,879
Your personal money issues
are not my concern.

411
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,440
You agreed to cover his quota.
You get the lumber. And that is that!

412
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,760
That all you got, loser?

413
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,279
What did you say? Who you callin'
a loser? I know you weren't just...

414
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,480
Talking to me!

415
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,679
Vick? Vick!
I'm only gonna say it one more time!

416
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,520
Come on!!!!

417
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:30,439
That's it. I'm tired of the attitude
and the excuses!

418
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,719
You're fired!

419
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,240
Hang on! Lemme explain! Hello?

420
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,000
Hey! What else could go wrong?!?

421
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,359
Even we eeee-vil

422
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,919
mean, and dastardly peeee-ple

423
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,999
can't get to sleeee-ple

424
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,680
when the cash is running low

425
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,359
if only sheer greed

426
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,519
guaranteed what I need

427
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,440
and that's some dough!

428
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,239
Must I skip my trip
to mom and dad's house

429
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,959
to toil for that louse?

430
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,040
A train ticket's only a dream

431
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,959
my knees start shaking

432
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,199
my noggin's aching

433
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,879
if the boss or folks should call

434
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,159
tell them all

435
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,559
I'm going to crawl

436
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,240
to Portugal!

437
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,119
Bye

438
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,440
y'all!

439
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,839
Hello, ladies... I'm out saving the world,

440
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,039
one tree at a time.

441
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,919
Leave a message after the "beep".

442
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,079
Vicky, this is your mother.
We need to know what time...

443
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,839
Your train gets in so your father can
pick you up at the station.

444
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,679
Tell him I'm making
my famous plum juice!

445
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,479
He knows,
you make it every stinkin' year!

446
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,359
Anyway, call us back
when you have a chance.

447
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,639
Will you stop smothering the man?
He's an adult.

448
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,839
He's my boy, and I'll smother him
iflfeelhkeit

449
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,759
- for cryin' out loud, he's a grown man.
- I'm sorry, mom;

450
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,079
- he'll call when he calls...
- I'm sorry dad...

451
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,000
Thank you, mr obvious.
You know, you...

452
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,160
I wanna come home.

453
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,080
I do.

454
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,800
But I can't even afford a ticket...

455
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:09,160
That poor vick. He looks really sad now.
If only there was a way to...

456
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,640
Maybe we should help him out.

457
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,319
Are you crazy?

458
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,280
Yeah! Are you?

459
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:17,279
Look, he just wants to get home,
ok?

460
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,479
I believe you forgot
who we are talking about!

461
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Not true!

462
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,560
As the king, I am forbidding of this.

463
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,999
Let us be going, babu.

464
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,919
You know, I don't like my royalty-ness
being challenged!

465
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,720
That's right sire!

466
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:30,759
No one shall embroaching
on my degree.

467
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,640
I've never seen such
treachery behavioring!

468
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,799
Too bad, we're busy.

469
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
- We've got things to do.
- When the king has spoken,

470
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:36,399
- he is finished speaking!
- Now let's get a move on.

471
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,519
Now come on minions,

472
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,399
there's plenty working to be done.

473
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,599
Raise those lanterns,
hang the streamers.

474
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,720
Everyone get back to working.
I must fix my ice sculpture...

475
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,600
Diggs, go find us some food!

476
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,600
The rest of you go to
get the partying decor.

477
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,880
Humph! Oh, man.

478
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,680
This is just not fair!

479
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,800
If he had a wheelie machine,
he'd be able to get home.

480
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,239
That's it! I'm gonna build a car
for Vicky.

481
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,639
Oh bramble, you've done it again.

482
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,879
He's a mechanic, mechanic,
and he's a genius!

483
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,320
Time to get to work!

484
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,000
Oh, I don't even know
where to begin!

485
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,800
Ahh! Alright, then. Have it your way!

486
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,040
Ahh! My foot! Argh!

487
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,840
This thing is heavy...

488
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,600
Huh? Did somebody just
turn off gravity?

489
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,960
Alright!

490
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,720
We're here to helping!

491
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,400
I knew you guys
would come through! Let's do it!

492
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,360
Oh, bramble!

493
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,080
Haha_.

494
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,760
Isn't she a beauty?

495
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,159
She sure is.

496
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,800
That's how it's done.

497
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,920
Let's go get vick.

498
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,000
Not fair...

499
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,760
Everyone... expecting me...

500
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,680
My father is making plum juice.

501
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Wanna go home...

502
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,400
You'll be home before you know it.
Hehehe...

503
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,919
Engine's working. Herb?

504
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,079
Looks good down here.

505
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,319
And up here, too!

506
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,280
Bramble?

507
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,720
Okay!

508
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,000
Thanks hoo hoo, you're the best!

509
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,760
Alright, alright, let's get going!

510
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,480
Warren, out of the way.

511
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,936
- Wish us luck, everyone. We'll need it!
- I'll miss you guys!

512
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,280
- Now, you guys take care, alright?
- Uh? Where are tiki and babu?

513
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,519
Who cares, let's go!

514
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, you're right.
The mission can't wait!

515
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,519
- Have a good trip! Take care!
- Drive safe!

516
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,720
Don't forget to bring us
some presents!

517
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,440
Right... right. Right!

518
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,400
The hibernation's over now
and the clover's just in bloom.

519
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:56,760
A cheerful birdsong woke me up
and chased me right out of my room.

520
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,519
Sunshine beams through
the leaves and branches

521
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,519
and the pines stand tall and proud
dandelions dazzle...

522
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,120
And the nectar flows
and tiny forest critters shout out loud

523
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,999
"the grass is green.
The sky is blue.

524
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,279
The brook is babbling, friend
and so are you

525
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,039
we'll seize the day for endless play.
Picnic and party...

526
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,960
That's our woodland way!"

527
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,240
Danger lurks, but we'll be fine

528
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,680
we're gonna get you home,
vick! Don't you worry!

529
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,319
Honeycomb and apple tree
there'll be plenty here for you,

530
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,760
and you, and you-and meeeeee!

531
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,039
Briar! Hey, hey,
did you see that sign, briar?

532
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,399
It said that we're on the right track
to vick's hometown! Hehe.

533
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,320
Yup, soon he'll be out of our fur.

534
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,999
Sire, what if they find us back here?

535
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,120
Who is caring?
They aren't the bosses of me...

536
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,120
Yeah! I can't wait! Hehe.

537
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,920
Ouch!! What was that?
No! Not my fish!

538
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Uh? An apple?

539
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,120
No one litters on my highway!
Humph!

540
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,799
- Oh? The cops!
- What?!

541
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,799
Hey, blue truck! Pull over!

542
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,119
What are we gonna do?
I won't survive in jail!

543
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,400
- Get a grip, fool!
- Last warning! Pull over!

544
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,279
You're only making this harder
on yourself!

545
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,160
Hehe... perfect!

546
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,480
Disrespect my authority!

547
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,960
Citizen!
You know why I pulled you over?

548
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,640
Hey! You can't be serious.

549
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,720
Uh? Are you even paying attention
to me? I'm talking to you!

550
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,519
Uh... yeah. It happened back there.
You threw an apple into the road!

551
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,760
An apple?

552
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,599
Hey sire, they know
about your apples.

553
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,280
Humph. Relax, no big deal.

554
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,200
- Babu!
- Sire!

555
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,480
Right.

556
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:47,960
Do you country bumpkins know
what the fine for littering is?

557
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,519
Well neither do I,
cause no one's ever tried it!

558
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,000
That's it! License and registration...

559
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,839
Um, uh... one moment...

560
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,279
- Hurry up. That wasn't a request!
- Come on, come on...

561
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,120
Now move it!

562
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:01,096
There's gotta be something in here
that'll help us...

563
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,160
I don't have all day!

564
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,440
What's going on in there?

565
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Hey!

566
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,040
Why you...! You just got "resisting arrest"
added to your charges!

567
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,840
Uh? A monkey? What the...?

568
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,599
Hey monkey! That's my lunch you've
got there! Give it back, right now!

569
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,760
- Don't make me come up there and...
- Hehe, take that!

570
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,799
- Why... you... little...
- Bye-bye!

571
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,720
- You're gonna regret this!
- Monkeys?

572
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,360
Get down here!

573
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,319
- Briar, did he just say "monkeys"?
- Be quiet!

574
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,800
- We're getting out of here, bro.
- I'm gonna count to three...

575
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,520
Now you've done it!

576
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,999
Briar, maybe I should
check the back...

577
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,959
I can't believe you're still going on
about those monkeys!

578
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,800
- Wait, sire!
- Give it to me! I want the fish.

579
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,400
- Tiki, babu?
- It's you two?

580
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,279
What are you doing here?

581
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,159
We said to stay in the forest.

582
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,879
No one commands the king of the forest.

583
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,559
Whatever, it's too late now.

584
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,840
That's right!

585
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,199
All units, the perps are just ahead!

586
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,240
Oh no, they caught up to us, bro.

587
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,640
Careful, they're armed with
apple-throwing monkeys.

588
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,280
Pull over!

589
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,839
Ah! They're gaining on us, briar!!

590
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Watch this!

591
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,439
Uh? Bramble, logger vick's awake!

592
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,720
What?! Looks like the jig is up...

593
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,560
Yeah! We got rid of them!

594
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,039
Briar, who knew you were
such a good driver?

595
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,319
See? I told you to
bear with me. Haha!

596
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,560
Surprise, surprise.
Put your hands in the air.

597
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:47,680
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say - uh? Argh!!!

598
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,480
Haha, yeah! Never fear when
the bear brothers are here!

599
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,639
Let me try! C'mon, I want to drive!

600
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,959
- Settle down, babu...
- Hey, get off!

601
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,280
You're not driving! Ahhh!

602
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,880
Argh!

603
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,040
That was a close call, bro...

604
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,520
This is all you guys' fault!

605
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,319
Thank goodness we wore
our seat belts, right?

606
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,360
Sure!

607
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,519
Ah! You call that driving?

608
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,959
Where did you get your license?

609
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,840
You and your monkeying around!

610
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,840
So much for making good time...

611
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,240
We'll never get vick home like this...

612
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,760
What's with all these cars, anyway?

613
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,400
What's going on here?

614
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,559
Those stinking bears?

615
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,920
They are trying to get rid of me
once and for all?

616
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,760
Humph! Not on my watch!
Hehe. Perfect!

617
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,479
We may never getting a chance...

618
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,680
To mess with vick again!

619
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,679
This king needs a nap.

620
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,960
- Babu, come be my pillow.
- Coming!

621
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,880
Come on, man! We've hardly
moved at all in the last hour.

622
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,319
Maybe we should stop for lunch?

623
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,640
Oh, yeah! Tiki, hand me an apple.
Huh? Briar, look!

624
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,760
Who did this to you?

625
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,040
Who do you think did it? He escaped
through the roof up there.

626
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,920
Huh? I can't see him anywhere.

627
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,080
How could he have gotten away
so fast? Huh? There!

628
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,160
- Vick!
- Come back!

629
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,800
- Logger vick!
- Uh? Oh, darn!

630
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,039
Logger vick, I got you!

631
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,640
Argh...

632
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,680
Come on! Logger vick!
Get back here! Stop making me run!

633
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,200
Huh?

634
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,319
Hehe... hi!

635
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,159
Hehe. Daddy, look! A Teddy bear!

636
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,400
Ahh!

637
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,239
Hey look where you're going, buddy!

638
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,400
There's a bear back there!
Get out of the way!

639
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,360
I'm already miles away
from the forest.

640
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,160
What do they want?
Uh? Stillwater?

641
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,720
What do you know? I'm pretty darn
close to my hometown...

642
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,080
Uh? They found me.

643
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,120
Come on, think, vick!

644
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,920
What to do? What to do?

645
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,200
We got you now... oh?

646
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,479
Uh... check under the cars!

647
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
Oh?

648
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,639
Huh? Where can he be?
I know I saw him.

649
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,999
Maybe we should head back
to the truck now.

650
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,160
Uh, fine.

651
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,359
Argh! What a klutz!

652
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,920
Hey, there he is!

653
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,000
There you are!

654
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,320
Come back here! Wait!

655
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,600
Later, losers!

656
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,959
Now what do we do?

657
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,960
Hey, look!

658
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,959
The railway?

659
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,680
Yeah, that's right!

660
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,440
Hey, you fools! Get outta the way!

661
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,240
Hehe!

662
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,240
Bite harder!

663
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,600
Humph! You ain't getting away
this time!

664
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,039
Hands up! Do it now!

665
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,160
What? Nobody's inside?!
Wait a tick...

666
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,519
No! Come back!

667
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,560
Make way for the king!

668
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,400
Dirty thieves! That's state property!

669
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,040
Where am I now?

670
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,759
So close, but still so far away...

671
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,399
The train bound for
stillwater is about to arrive...

672
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Could it be true?!

673
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,280
- Attention, passengers, please stand by.
- What was that?

674
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,760
The train bound for stillwater
is about to arrive...

675
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,919
Attention, passengers, please stand by.

676
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,199
- I'm... I'm at the train station!?
- The train bound for stillwater

677
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,640
is about to arrive...

678
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,280
- Please have your ticket ready...
- Yeah, I'm gonna make it!

679
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,760
Huh? Bramble, jump off!

680
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,480
Where's vick?

681
00:48:11,481 --> 00:48:13,319
- Please! I've gotta get on that train!
- Over there!

682
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,600
And stay out!

683
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,680
Argh!

684
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,600
And don't even think about
coming back without a ticket! Humph!

685
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,200
But I'm broke. I can't even afford
a single one.

686
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,800
I'm sorry, mom; I won't be
coming home this year...

687
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,799
Attention passengers, now boarding
for the stillwater-bound train.

688
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,879
Please have your ticket ready.

689
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,680
That's it! I'm getting on
no matter what!

690
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,040
Ahhhh!

691
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,960
Good doggie... ahh, go away...

692
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,720
Uh? He must have sensed
my hunter's instinct! Haha!

693
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,599
Hehe!

694
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,199
Attention passengers,

695
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,640
this is the final boarding call
for the stillwater-bound train.

696
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,599
Hey, what are you doing?!

697
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,559
Once again this is the final boarding
call for the stillwater-bound train.

698
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,759
This car is too crowded.

699
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,639
Hey, get a move on. They ain't
gonna load themselves.

700
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,320
Yeah, yeah, don't rush me.

701
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,920
Finally, it's quitting time!

702
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,239
Oh? There's plenty of room in here...

703
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,159
Hey! What are you sneaking
around for? Where's your ticket?

704
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,239
I don't... know

705
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,359
- come along with us, buddy!
- I must have dropped it!

706
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,439
- Just let me go!
- You've got a lot of explaining to do!

707
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,079
- That's right, pal!
- Hey, let me go! Let me go!

708
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,360
- Save it for the cops!
- Oh no! Logger vick got caught.

709
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,439
This is horrible.

710
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,280
He'll never make it home.
His poor mother will miss him, briar...

711
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,879
Let me go! I gotta get home.

712
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,599
You just don't understand!
Let go of me!

713
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,639
Hey! Get back here!

714
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,680
I'm getting' on
that train! I've gotta go home!

715
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,320
We have no choice.

716
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,239
C'mon bramble,
let's finish what we started, bro.

717
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,720
Uh? Ehm!

718
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,440
Please! I'm begging you!

719
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,719
Daddy... I'm tired of
waiting for the train.

720
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,199
Just a little bit longer, sweetheart.

721
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,719
It's so boring.

722
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,319
Hi!

723
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,519
Ah! Daddy,

724
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,679
it's the giant Teddy bear from before!

725
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,879
Hi!

726
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,160
How are you?

727
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,960
- Come on, dear!
- Hey!

728
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,240
Ahh! Bear!

729
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,679
Are those bears on the platform?

730
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,559
They don't pay us enough for this!

731
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,360
It's those two... what're they doing?

732
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,360
Never mind! Now's my chance!

733
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,400
It worked! Hehe.

734
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,400
Freeze!

735
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,480
Uh? Thank goodness, it's almost over.

736
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,799
Hey, you two, get a move on.
You're coming with us you filthy animals!

737
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,879
- Let go of me!
- Let me go!

738
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,880
Quiet down!

739
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,120
Lock 'em up tight, boys! Haha.

740
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,880
So they caught the bears?

741
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,799
Hehe! How perfect!

742
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,880
With those stinking bears out of the way,
it should be smooth sailing! Haha!

743
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,840
But what were they doing here, anyway?

744
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,160
It doesn't really make sense.

745
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,000
Why would they be this far
from the forest?

746
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,359
Babu, is logger vick still tied up?

747
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,920
- Yes, sire!
- Good!

748
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,600
What's going on here?

749
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,680
Uh? Stillwater?

750
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,120
Go away!

751
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,440
Could it be!? Could they
have been helping me?

752
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,080
That's just crazy.
They would never do that.

753
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,200
I'm their archenemy, after all;
They hate me. Haha!

754
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,760
And I do hate them, hehe.

755
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,120
No way!

756
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,920
Ahhh! Bears! Run!

757
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,600
They don't pay us enough for this!

758
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,840
It's probably just a coincidence.

759
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,880
Maybe those bears are traveling
for the holidays, too...

760
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,240
But where would I be without them?

761
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,880
I certainly wouldn't have made it this far.

762
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,839
Attention please,

763
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,519
the stillwater-bound
train is about to depart.

764
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,920
Please take your seats. Thank you!

765
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,159
Haha. Forget about those stinking bears.

766
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,279
They'll probably just be sent back
to the forest.

767
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,559
And everything will be just great!

768
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,480
Did you hear what I said, Ralph?

769
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:25,200
Yeah, that's right, two giant bears!
And you want to know the best part?

770
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,079
Bob, he'll buy 'em. Yep, that's right,
pal. And he'll pay top dollar.

771
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,159
They said that bear meat melts
in your mouth.

772
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,520
Hahaha. I can't wait! I'm gonna go
preheat my oven right now.

773
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,760
Yes, you can bring Peggy...

774
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,960
Nighty-night, bear!

775
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,760
Ahh! They're gonna eat the bears!
I can't let that happen!

776
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,519
Attention please,

777
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,120
the stillwater-bound train
is now departing.

778
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,840
Have a safe and pleasant journey.

779
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,400
Alright, then! He got on the train.

780
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,520
Come on, time to escape!

781
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,199
Everything's ready on my end, Bob.

782
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,160
Remember, bring the money.
Right. Yeah.

783
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,280
Hurry up, bramble!

784
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:23,680
Or we're gonna end up on
the side of a grill. Uh?

785
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,439
Hey! Looks like you need
some help settling down.

786
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,640
Nothing that this bad boy can't fix.

787
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,800
Ahh!

788
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,320
Ahh!

789
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,120
Oh, man...

790
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,360
Hehe. You're gonna make me
a rich man, indeed.

791
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,079
I might even have me
a couple of bearskin rugs!

792
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,480
It's time to say good night. Haha!

793
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,719
Oh? Logger vick?

794
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,519
I thought you'd left already!

795
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,160
There! That makes us even!

796
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,520
Wait! Don't leave without me!
Come back here!

797
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,679
Hehe, I got the rope, hehe.

798
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,999
Don't leave without me, please!
Come back! Slow down!

799
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,400
I can't catch you. Please!
Slow down! Don't leave without me...

800
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,320
I only wanted to see my family.

801
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,120
Uh?

802
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,960
Hehe.

803
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,399
Come on, you guys.
Put your backs into it!!

804
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,159
Briar, faster! Bramble, pick it up!

805
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,319
That's easier said than done,
logger vick!

806
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,440
Bramble, keep focused!
We're gaining on it.

807
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,200
Ah!!!

808
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,079
Yeah!

809
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,720
Ah?! No way!

810
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,480
Yeah, that's the way! Oh, yeah!

811
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,000
Gotta get a little closer!

812
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,080
C'mon!

813
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm already going as fast as I can.

814
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,920
Grrr. Uh? Argh!

815
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,120
Faster!!

816
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,879
I'm kinda losing my grip here.
Please help me!

817
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,880
Oh, no!

818
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,240
Briar!

819
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,839
I got you, bro!

820
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,960
Don't let go...

821
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,520
Ahh!

822
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,639
- Great job, tiki!
- Alright!

823
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,080
Hehe! We was just passing
your neighborhood through.

824
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,359
That was close... ah, oh no, look out!

825
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,880
Ahh!

826
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,599
Are you crazy?
Where are we going?

827
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,920
We've gotta get back to the train!
Look out for the rock!

828
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,480
Ahhhh!

829
00:57:40,481 --> 00:57:43,000
Look ma, no hands! Hahaha...

830
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,800
A tree! No, no! Turn! Turn!

831
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,960
Ahh! Wait!

832
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:11,560
Come back! Come back...

833
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,160
Oh...

834
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,640
Uh? Ahhhhh!

835
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,000
Hey, logger vick, we're over here.

836
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,400
Ahh!

837
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,120
I'm losing it!

838
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,160
- Give me a hand here!
- Okay.

839
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:43,160
Ahhhhh! Ah! Pull me up!

840
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,400
Pull me up!

841
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,880
Hey, you take the wheel.
I'm gonna go check out that noise.

842
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,520
Yeah! Bro, good job. I got you, vick!

843
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,240
Ahh?!

844
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,440
It's gonna break.

845
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,320
Gangway! Coming through.
Pardon me, y'all.

846
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,960
I got it...

847
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,239
Hurry up before it breaks!

848
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,320
Don't worry.

849
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,680
Now which one?

850
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,640
I got it.

851
00:59:35,641 --> 00:59:36,919
A little more.

852
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,880
Come on...

853
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,400
Oh? Someone's coming.

854
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,120
- Ahh!
- Got you!

855
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,800
Ah?!

856
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:52,199
Look at this mess!

857
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,360
Whoever left that door
open ought to be shot!

858
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,240
Well that's unusual!

859
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,080
Yeah! Yay! We did it!

860
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,239
What an amazing adventure!

861
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,280
Get down!

862
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,960
What a close call... uh?

863
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,880
Thank you...

864
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:45,480
Huh? Hehe...

865
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:57,199
The curtain falls on yesterday
now home won't seem so far away

866
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:03,599
the storm that raged has drifted by
and left behind a moonless sky

867
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:10,279
but the shooting stars will light the way
so before the night has turned to day

868
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:18,280
let's imagine... our tears ahhhh-waaaay...
If I look back in time

869
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:29,800
and say the blame was
yours, it's also mine, also mine

870
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,279
now I sing you this song...

871
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,879
Ok, dudes, look! Let's ring in
the new year! All together, now!

872
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:45,239
Five, four, three, two, one-
happy new year!

873
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:52,960
If we're friends for just one day
who on earth can say

874
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:58,360
we can't chase the stars hand in hand

875
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:06,640
night sky's ablaze with light.
This time we got it right, friend

876
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,680
attention passengers,
we are now arriving at stillwater.

877
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,720
This will be
our final destination today.

878
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,640
Please collect all of your luggage,
and on behalf of our team,

879
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,160
I would like to wish you
all a very happy new year!

880
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,360
Uh?

881
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,080
Where'd they go?

882
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,920
Hey, bears!

883
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,320
Hey, bears!

884
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,760
They're gone?

885
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,199
Briar, are we really gonna walk
all the way home?

886
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,720
I'm already too tired...

887
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,200
Bro, what kinda bear are ya?

888
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,479
"Gummi", from the sound of it!

889
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,239
At least I'm soft and delicious,
unlike you, bro.

890
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:20,200
Whoohoo! Haha!

891
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,519
It's tiki and babu! Haha!

892
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,520
Can I offer you ladies a ride?

893
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,720
- Ah! Of course!
- Haha, yahoo!

894
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,959
This thing is way too slow.

895
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,280
Yeah, I wonder why...
'Couldn't be cause of the extra weight...

896
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,000
Hehe_.

897
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,119
I'll be flat as a pancake
by the time we're there.

898
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,920
Pancakes! That sounds real good!

899
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,600
- Bramble, what are you doing?!
- Watch where you are going! Argh!

900
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,840
Hey, mom and dad! I'm home!

901
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,959
Oh, hehe, hi, everyone!
In the end vick made it home,

902
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,880
but not without hilarious outtakes.
Haha! Enjoy!

903
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,320
Wha... what's going on? Uh? Ah!

904
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,720
What am I doing tied to this rocket?

905
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,159
Now, let me go! What's going on, here?
Let's talk about this, first!

906
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:46,240
Why am I tied up? Get that away from me!
Get awaaaaay!

907
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,799
Don't worry, vick-a-roonie, I'll
get you home. Hehe. Bye byyyyyye!

908
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,240
Ahh!

909
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,320
That's got some real kick to it!

910
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,400
Help me! Stinkin' beaaaaar!

911
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,520
Uh? It exploded? Oh, no!

912
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,320
Hang in there, vick!

913
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,519
What do you think you're doing,
you stinkin' bear?

914
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,160
Put me down right this instant,
you hear me, huh?

915
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,240
What are you doing?
Come on-let me go, bramble!

916
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,240
Let me go!

917
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,440
Let me go, bramble...
I promise, I'll be nice to you...

918
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,040
Ahhh! Let-me-go!

919
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,760
That's not good!

920
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,960
Bramble! This is not a good idea!
Ah! Argh!

921
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:06,240
Ah! Now you're just messing
with me...

922
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,360
It's the thought that counts...

923
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,800
Hi! It's me, your old pal,
logger vick.

924
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,320
That's right! Thanks to those bears,

925
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,919
I made it home just in time
for new year's day!

926
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,440
Maybe I should be nice to them.

927
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,959
That's my new resolution.

928
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,520
I'm gonna treat those bears
like they were my family!

929
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,199
Haha! I heard that!

930
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,200
- I take that back!
- Well, that's all, folks!

931
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,519
We hope you all enjoyed our
holiday special and one more thing...

932
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,240
Seasons greetings,
and have a happy new year! Hahaha!
