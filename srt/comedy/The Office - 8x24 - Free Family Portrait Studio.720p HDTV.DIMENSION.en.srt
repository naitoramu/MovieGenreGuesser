Hello, my name's Oscar,

2
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,920
I'm an accountant
at Scranton, Pennsylvania,

3
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:10,110
and I'm gay.

4
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:13,898
And I'm here to tell you
that yes, it does get better.

5
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:15,710
- When I was young...
- What's he doing?

6
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:17,685
Stretching at younger gays.

7
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:20,121
No, it's just a way
to tell young people

8
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:23,681
no matter how hard it gets for them,
there's a brave future ahead.

9
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:24,807
With you.

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,635
No matter how hard it gets for you...

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,292
Kelly! Seriously, I...

12
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:34,655
Keep chatting.
I'm checking my makeup in your webcam.

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,099
Do you not own a mirror?

14
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:38,606
Webcams make me look
the way I look in my fantasies.

15
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:40,301
I know, right?
What is it?

16
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:43,314
- You always look good in those things.
- I'm throwing out all my mirrors.

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,351
Okay, as you can see,
I now have a cool job

18
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:48,126
at a dynamic workplace.

19
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:51,606
Being gay is a celebration of life,
it's a simple...

20
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:55,009
No, I'm sorry,
I just can't sit idly by

21
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:58,930
and have the gay youth
of America mislead

22
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:01,747
- by some reductionist...
- I'm not misleading.

23
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:02,873
Pep talk.

24
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:07,807
Sexuality is a spectrum.

25
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:11,009
It's a paradox
to think of any sexual activity

26
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:12,135
as normal.

27
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:16,647
It gets better but it also
gets vastly more complicated.

28
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:20,151
Robert, that guy,
he looks just like you.

29
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:22,124
Damn it, Kevin!

30
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:23,782
God!

31
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:27,993
You okay, Robert?

32
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:30,694
- Fine.
- Put some ice on it.

33
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,719
In any case, it gets better.

34
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,709
Maybe not much better, but better.

8x24: <i>Free Family
Portrait Studio</i>

37
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,267
One, two, three!

38
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:55,987
I wanted to give a nice gift
to the tenants in the building.

39
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:57,993
At first I thought, "muffin basket".

40
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,537
Then I thought, "what's
even more precious to people?"

41
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,665
- Can you just smile, please?
- I don't want to!

42
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,459
Their own children.

43
00:02:06,238 --> 00:02:09,379
Hey, everybody, just a few hours left
for the free family portrait studio.

44
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,228
We'd love to see little Jada.

45
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:17,179
- You can bring by your little angel.
- No, thank you.

46
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:20,814
Jim, you've got those two cute kids.
We sure would love to see them.

47
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,934
I know why you're doing this.

48
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,350
Last week, I may have gone too far.

49
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,268
I'll explain it.

50
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:29,587
I found out
where he gets his clothes cleaned,

51
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:31,818
ordered the same suit,
made with tear-away velcro.

52
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:32,985
And...

53
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:35,210
You can fill in the rest.

54
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:37,240
Wha...

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,427
Damn it, Jim!

56
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,176
Now he's trying to get me
to bring my children into work.

57
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:46,923
I think it's fair to be cautious.

58
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,121
Let me get this straight.

59
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:50,865
You lost all of it.

60
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,990
All your winnings.

61
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:55,926
$150,000.

62
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,210
You're telling me
no one wanted an energy drink

63
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:02,516
for Asian homosexuals?

64
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,725
They did not.

65
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:06,431
And you got half a million of these?

66
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:12,776
- Well, I gotta try it.
- I wouldn't.

67
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,255
Come on, what's the harm?

68
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:22,202
- What flavor was that?
- Coconut penis.

69
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:25,497
- The coconut's pretty subtle.
- Come on, man.

70
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,207
Can't you give us a yes or a no?

71
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:31,567
I don't know, man.
Y'all quit with a lot of confidence.

72
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:35,382
Y'all came up in here dancing
and everybody was...

73
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,828
Hold on a second.

74
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,462
If I were Val,
I would break up with Brandon.

75
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:46,284
Then I would date the hell out of me.

76
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,752
I wouldn't give in to me too fast,
let me buy myself

77
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:50,409
some nice dinners and such.

78
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:55,304
But when I finally did give in,
I would go crazy on myself.

79
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:07,249
Hi, guys.

80
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:09,291
How's it going?

81
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,436
I'm good, thank you.

82
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:13,254
And how are you?

83
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:15,130
Great, yeah, good.

84
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,427
How the mediocre have fallen.

85
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,805
Oh, God.

86
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,224
I'm not here to get my old job back.

87
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,684
I blew my opportunity.

88
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,220
I'm moving on.

89
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:31,313
I just wanted to come in here

90
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,488
and literally beg you

91
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:35,775
for something, anything.

92
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:38,528
I will sweep the floors,
water the plants, clean the toilets.

93
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:40,238
I don't need anyone.

94
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,407
- Pull the poop out of it.
- That's not a thing.

95
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,366
Please.

96
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:44,993
Please.

97
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,995
Give me something!

98
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:51,082
Why don't you clean the carpets
for today?

99
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,208
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

100
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:55,876
Up you get then.

101
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,319
Pick yourself up.

102
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:00,467
- There it is.
- Thank you.

103
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:02,492
You don't need to...

104
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:09,753
I have a delicious secret.

105
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,522
Good.

106
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,733
This carpet's overdue
for a good mopping.

107
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:19,986
Is a mop the most efficient tool
to use on a carpet?

108
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,094
Yeah, it is actually.

109
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,823
I can't hold it in any longer.

110
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:28,719
I am faking this, okay?

111
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:31,039
Because I convinced David Wallace

112
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,084
to buy Dunder Mifflin back
from Sabre.

113
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,824
And at 3:00 today,
he's gonna walk in here

114
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,503
and reinstate me

115
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:40,131
as manager.

116
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:42,998
Family picture!

117
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,556
What?
Honey, we talked about this.

118
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:50,949
No, we talked
about not bringing them in

119
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:52,978
to Dwight's photo studio-slash-trap.

120
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,355
Yes, and then we decided
that was crazy.

121
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,732
No, we decided it was crazy
not to worry about it.

122
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,588
No, we settled
in a much more rational place, remember?

123
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:02,946
We decided that there's no way
Dwight would harm a child.

124
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,366
But are you 100% sure?
I don't think any of us are.

125
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:11,951
But it's free.
And we'll keep our eye on them.

126
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:14,291
And we will make sure
that Dwight doesn't do anything

127
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,458
C-R-A-Z-Y.

128
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:18,482
Wait, C-R-A-Z...

129
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:20,588
Great, right up there.

130
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,302
You just sit right here one time.

131
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:24,626
Here you go.

132
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,291
All right, why don't you just...
give him to me and...

133
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,992
Perfect.

134
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:30,585
- Ready?
- This is great.

135
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,753
There you go.

136
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:34,288
- Let's do it.
- I'll just stand here then.

137
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:35,666
Keep your eye on Dwight.

138
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,309
- Sir, could you look into the camera?
- Let's do it, shoot it.

139
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:39,854
- Great.
- Up here.

140
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:43,609
Jim, right here, right here.

141
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,502
- Good.
- Oh, so that's it?

142
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:46,422
Yes.

143
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,576
- See? That wasn't so hard.
- Cute kids, thanks for coming.

144
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:55,707
- Hello, everybody.
- Uh, what? Why?

145
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,417
What... How are you doing?

146
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,963
My office got a call that they were
shooting family portraits right here.

147
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,120
And if there's one thing that every
politician instinctively understands,

148
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:07,302
it's a good photo op.

149
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,430
You're going
to go through the hallway.

150
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,224
Here's a map. And if you get lost,
just follow the blue line.

151
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,669
Senator Lipton, welcome.

152
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,819
Nice to see you.
May I hold him?

153
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,216
- Sure.
- No.

154
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:29,657
I am going to hold him because
I haven't seen him all day.

155
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:32,230
I think that Dwight
is doing this whole thing

156
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:36,936
to get a sample of my baby's DNA
to prove he's the father.

157
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:40,614
Which...
Is impossible...

158
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:43,700
Because the Senator is the only man
I've ever been with.

159
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:58,269
Okay, hold on a second, folks. A few
of the baby's hairs are out of place.

160
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:02,176
I like the baby's hair the way it is.

161
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:03,650
Really?

162
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,585
This is getting more and more
delicious by the minute.

163
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:17,664
It's go time.

164
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,388
Hey, Nellie, I made you...

165
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,377
I made you some soup.

166
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,170
Well, I don't want any soup.

167
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,047
But it's really good...

168
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:27,757
Oh, come on, Andy!

169
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:41,521
I know this is going
to be a great payoff.

170
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,314
A delicious moment.

171
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,619
But after you're manager,
some of these images

172
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:48,736
are going to be hard to shake.

173
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:51,317
- Well, but it...
- Just calibrate.

174
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,262
Okay? Calibrate.

175
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,186
Okay, here we go.

176
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:59,982
I don't want to throw
a wrench into the works,

177
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:03,877
but I want everything to be perfect, and
his fingernails are bothering me abit.

178
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,188
Leave us alone.

179
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:07,323
I guess we're okay
with the fingernails.

180
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,786
Okay, great.
Suit yourself.

181
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:16,264
Although, are those excess skin cells
on his cheek distracting to you as well?

182
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:18,933
Dwight, we're fine!

183
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,268
Oopsie,

184
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,455
did somebody make a boopsie?

185
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm just gonna take him out
and change him just for a second.

186
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:28,755
He defecated.

187
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:30,987
You're stinky.

188
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,988
A lot has changed
since y'all left, okay?

189
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:36,117
You're gonna have to
jump through some hoops.

190
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:38,135
And the new foreman is here.

191
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,258
Now she's one of the best
we've ever known, okay?

192
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:43,791
So I need you
to show her your utmost respect.

193
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:47,073
Make sure that she feels welcome
and at home, okay?

194
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:48,357
Can you do that?

195
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:50,609
That's
some pretty blatant complimenting.

196
00:09:50,734 --> 00:09:52,550
- I don't talk to her like that.
- Brandon?

197
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:53,510
I would.

198
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,114
- You would?
- Yeah.

199
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,722
- You're trying to hit on my girlfriend?
- He's not.

200
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,057
Yes, I am.

201
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:01,976
Just so everyone's on the same page.

202
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:03,362
So you really think

203
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:05,660
she's gonna leave a guy
who owns his own restaurant

204
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:07,565
for a dude who ate
his own restaurant?

205
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,004
- Good slam.
- Thank you, biggie.

206
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:13,228
- Good luck to you.
- Oh, and have a burger for me.

207
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,247
- Okay, shall we take a few more?
- I think we have all the shots we need.

208
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,935
- Thank you, Dwight.
- Okay, here we go...

209
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:41,825
Give me the diaper!
Dwight!

210
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,924
Is this what you were looking for?

211
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,326
Andy, we wanted to talk to you.

212
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:03,566
A lot of us are
very concerned about you.

213
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:06,860
You're dirty, you stink of booze,

214
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:08,793
you're limping inexplicably.

215
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,730
I just want you guys not to worry.

216
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:12,839
'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.

217
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,653
This is what we're talking about.
What was that accent?

218
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:20,221
And last time I checked, you were drunk
and now you're not drunk.

219
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,150
No, unfortunately it's true.

220
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,411
He's been a nightmare.

221
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:30,049
And the worst part is
he's been taking it out on me.

222
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:31,853
- You hit her?
- What?

223
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,236
That is not the deal.

224
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:37,322
Calibrate.

225
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,214
He's not hitting me.

226
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:42,340
But he's been verbally abusing me...

227
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,412
That's not true either!

228
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,510
That's also total...
Everyone, please relax.

229
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:50,960
I think you're gonna
like this surprise guest.

230
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:56,299
Happy birthday to Gabe.

231
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,925
Oh, get out, skeleton man!

232
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:03,851
I can refer you
to someone to talk to.

233
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,773
Hold on. {\*- Give you a name or--
}I'm just gonna...

234
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,866
Hey, what's the scoop?
Are you close?

235
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:13,285
What?

236
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:17,072
You have to come now.

237
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:20,490
Traffic clears.

238
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,242
No, next Friday...

239
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:24,485
That's not gonna work.
Okay.

240
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:30,583
Damn it!

241
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:35,246
Well, this is not gonna be quite
as delicious as I wanted,

242
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:38,091
but I do have a very tasty
announcement for you guys.

243
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:42,224
Not only am I not a lowly janitor,

244
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:44,847
I am the regional manager once again.

245
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:46,909
Guys, I got my old job back.

246
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:50,478
I'm not crazy.

247
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,606
I convinced David Wallace
to give me my job back.

248
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,192
David Wallace hasn't
worked here in years.

249
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,387
Okay, yes, I see the confusion.

250
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,116
I saw David at the fundraiser.

251
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:03,426
He is now a multi-millionaire
because he sold his toy vacuum

252
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,576
"Suck It," to the US Military.

253
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,329
- Andy, come on.
- Even I know that's weird.

254
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:10,900
I... Okay, I get
how that sounds crazy.

255
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:13,519
Hey, Andy, nobody's
calling you crazy, Andy.

256
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:15,336
We're your friends, Andy.

257
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:16,754
Stop saying my name.

258
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,923
- He's not making this up.
- Thank you.

259
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,093
Andy tells me about seeing
David Wallace all the time.

260
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,632
But have you ever
actually seen him yourself?

261
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:28,933
Oh, my God.
Wait.

262
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,893
Erin, come on.

263
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:33,884
You know
I've been talking to David Wallace.

264
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:37,859
Do you see David Wallace
in the room right now?

265
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,042
Operation Phoenix is a go.

266
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:50,341
Just get the car ready.

267
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,784
Look at me like you're adoring me
and I look at the camera

268
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:56,210
- like you're not there.
- I do adore you.

269
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,233
Andrew, it's time for you to go home.

270
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,638
You're better than this.

271
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:09,450
Yeah, I know.

272
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:13,250
Everyone's better than this,
because this is the worst thing

273
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,212
I have ever seen.

274
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,852
Why'd they add coconut?
I miss original.

275
00:14:27,561 --> 00:14:28,367
Long time.

276
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:30,277
What are you doing here?

277
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,288
Is it true you're buying the company?

278
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,497
Okay.

279
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:35,870
I guess the word is out.

280
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:37,541
Please keep this a secret.

281
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,801
I've been talking with Andy...

282
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:40,927
What?

283
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:43,132
Thought I heard my name.
What?

284
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:45,053
I'm the new manager?

285
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,550
I'll get to that in a second.

286
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:48,846
But... it's me, right?

287
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:52,035
- As we've discussed.
- What?

288
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,699
- It's very possible. Probable.
- My God.

289
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,916
From janitor to manager?

290
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:00,149
That's quite a cinderella story.

291
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:02,193
From M-O-P

292
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,909
to M-V-P.

293
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:07,054
There's an official announcement,
a few details to...

294
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,896
From total loss, to total boss.

295
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:12,620
Can we expect
any payroll interruptions?

296
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,473
Now that is a great question.

297
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:16,682
All your operations,
or most of your operations

298
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:19,418
are down in Florida,
so to shift back up...

299
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:23,449
I was so looking forward to that
and it did not...

300
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:26,858
go as I thought it would.

301
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:46,141
So we're not gonna be
a part of Sabre anymore?

302
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,414
Nothing is gonna be a part of it.

303
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,908
Joe Bennett's planning
on liquidating the rest of the company.

304
00:15:53,922 --> 00:15:56,622
Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee
right about now.

305
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:00,286
I'm actually the CEO.

306
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,302
I didn't realize
you were standing there.

307
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:05,745
My friend, trust me,
this is for the best.

308
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,370
I never understood
that corporate mess.

309
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,638
- Great to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm Bob Kazamakis.

310
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,087
Pleasure.

311
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:17,560
I'd love to give you a little rundown
on what I've learned about this place.

312
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,231
That's very gracious of you, Bob.
I would love that.

313
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:21,357
Please.

314
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,162
Guess I'd better take off
these dirty rags.

315
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,492
Figure out how to be
a manager of this place.

316
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:37,705
Perhaps your year of experience
managing this branch will come in handy.

317
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,213
Gosh, I hope so.

318
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,788
- No! God, Mose!
- Hi, Angela.

319
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:49,467
Get out of the car!
Get out!

320
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:53,801
Where is he?
Where is he?

321
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:55,821
- I'm not supposed to say.
- Tell me!

322
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:57,446
Tell me where he is!

323
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,603
Mose, damn it!

324
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,856
Where did he go?
Mose, get back here!

325
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:08,285
Let's see that smile.

326
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:15,329
- Right here?
- Cool.

327
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:43,132
Looks like I might get
my delicious moment after all.

328
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:45,481
May I say one thing?

329
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:48,401
It would be rude of me
not to let you...

330
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:50,913
say whatever is on your mind.

331
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,156
The quality of mercy is not strained.

332
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,201
- No.
- It droppeth.

333
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:01,163
As the gentle rain from heaven,
upon the place beneath.

334
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:04,288
Do not bring Shakespeare into this.

335
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,709
How dare you play the bard card?

336
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:10,359
<i>It blesseth he who gives
and he who takes.</i>

337
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:13,050
<i>'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.</i>

338
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,093
I just want one

339
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:17,488
motherfucking delicious moment.

340
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,140
Is that too much to ask?

341
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:26,939
If I were to hire you back...
If...

342
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,485
What do you think you would do well?

343
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,967
Special projects manager,
that's my background.

344
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:36,198
I just go around
doing whatever I want.

345
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:37,742
All right, you sly bastard.

346
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,077
When can you start?

347
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,880
Okay, everyone.

348
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:54,970
Had a conversation with Bob,

349
00:18:55,095 --> 00:18:58,288
and since I'm going to be CEO now,
there will be no need for him.

350
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,931
That's gotta hurt.

351
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:03,968
But he's going to make
so much money from the liquidation,

352
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:06,854
he's gonna be freed up
to do something much more important.

353
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,192
David has generously offered
to donate one million dollars

354
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,612
in matching funds
to a cause that's very...

355
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,738
dear to me.

356
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:19,711
So for the next three years,
I'll be traveling overseas,

357
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:24,048
concentrating on all of my efforts
on educating, mentoring,

358
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:26,421
some African, some Asian,

359
00:19:26,546 --> 00:19:29,335
but mainly Eastern European women.

360
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,679
I had no idea how pervasive this was
until Bob explained it to me.

361
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,668
Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy

362
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:38,069
and other schools like it,
while wonderful,

363
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:39,556
end with high school.

364
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,896
I wanna see these girls
right through college.

365
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:43,855
Especially the gymnasts.

366
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,018
They've lost so many...

367
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:49,405
years of crucial education

368
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,977
to perfecting their bodies.

369
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,681
Muscle groups the rest of us
can't even fathom.

370
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,600
Gymnasts?

371
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,087
You're going to seek out
uneducated gymnasts?

372
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:00,697
Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify

373
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:03,476
some truly exceptional women

374
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,080
who show great promise.

375
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,707
It's been fun.

376
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:20,959
It's been a great year.

377
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:29,291
Hello.

378
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,516
Where is it?

379
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:32,751
They're testing it now.

380
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,703
How long does it take
to get the results?

381
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:35,829
72 hours.

382
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:37,631
You're gonna wait here?

383
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,390
Dwight, I can't do this.

384
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:14,595
- Hey, how are you?
- You didn't call.

385
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:19,311
Well, the issue that concerned me...

386
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:20,955
You know what this is about...

387
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:23,240
Cock.
