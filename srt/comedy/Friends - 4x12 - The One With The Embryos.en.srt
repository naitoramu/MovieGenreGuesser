1
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:17,851
What the hell is that?

2
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:23,691
What the hell is that?
Is that you?

3
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:33,908
- You're really not a morning person.
- Just back off!

4
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,956
Get up! Get up! Get up!

5
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,878
What is that noise?

6
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,006
You!

7
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,968
It's the chick.

8
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,304
She's going through some changes.

9
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,973
What kind of changes?

10
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,183
The vet seems to think...

11
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,270
...she's becoming a rooster.

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,984
We're getting a second opinion.

13
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,529
The One with the Embryos

14
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,495
Why are you shopping
at eight in the morning?

15
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,247
I've been up since six...

16
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,749
...thanks to somebody's
dumb-ass rooster.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,046
You should get rid of those animals.
They shouldn't be in an apartment.

18
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:14,134
Especially not with these
knives and cookbooks around.

19
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,596
I'm going to the doctor
and see if I'm ready...

20
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:23,268
...to have Frank and Alice's embryo
transferred into my uterus.

21
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,104
How will they know?

22
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,774
They'll just see if my
endometrial layer is thick.

23
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,985
I can check that for you.

24
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,779
Okay, think "thick".

25
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,157
Good luck!

26
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,158
Wish me luck.

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,910
Good luck.

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,455
- I'm still right.
- That is so not true.

29
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,748
What?

30
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,334
I know it's her laundry day...

31
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:52,339
...and that means she's wearing
her old-lady underpants.

32
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,550
I can check that for you.

33
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,178
You two think you know
me and Rachel...

34
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,680
...better than we know you.

35
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,392
Well, we do.

36
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,687
You can only eat Tic Tacs
in even numbers.

37
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,189
What's that about?

38
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,442
And you!
Ross, if you check Rachel's bag...

39
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:17,072
...you'll find a half-eaten box
of cookies in there.

40
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,327
You're good.

41
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,663
These are not.

42
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,333
I'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.

43
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,670
Ross, how many items
left in that bag?

44
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,838
Five.

45
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:38,218
Okay, ten bucks says we can
name every item in that bag.

46
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,886
How many guesses?

47
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,013
Six.

48
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,391
Challenge extended.

49
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,896
- Deal!
- Challenge accepted.

50
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,940
All right, we'll start with...

51
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:52,983
...apples.

52
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,738
We'll be starting with apples.

53
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,825
Stop that now.

54
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,201
Yes.

55
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,746
Okay. Tortilla chips.

56
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,041
- Yogurt.
- Diet soda.

57
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:15,881
- Orange juice.
- There's no orange juice! We win!

58
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,675
They have another guess.

59
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,554
Well, we won that one.

60
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,473
Okay. The last thing is...

61
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:32,356
Not for another two weeks.

62
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:34,942
I got it.

63
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,402
Scotch...

64
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,196
...tape.

65
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,703
How did you know
she would buy Scotch tape?

66
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:50,499
We used up theirs last night
making scary faces.

67
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,750
Oh, man!

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,628
All right! Ten bucks.
Fork it over.

69
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,298
Cough it up. Pay the piper.

70
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,676
Give me it!

71
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,595
You don't know us better.
I want a rematch.

72
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,141
And no stupid grocery questions.
Real personal questions.

73
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,144
And the winner gets $100.

74
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,854
Serious?

75
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,065
Are you scared?

76
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,984
No.

77
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,987
Who makes up the questions?

78
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,406
Ross will do it.

79
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,324
Sure, Ross will do it.

80
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:28,579
It's not like he has a job
or a child or a life of his own.

81
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,622
Fine. We'll ask Phoebe.

82
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,667
No, I want to play.

83
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,549
Looks like your uterus
is ready for implantation.

84
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,511
I knew it!
I felt really thick this morning.

85
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,765
Okay, so what's now?
Go get the eggs. Put them in there.

86
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:52,311
It'll take a little while
to prepare the embryos.

87
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:56,607
- Embryos? As in more than one?
- Five, actually.

88
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,817
Where am I giving birth...

89
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,987
...in a hospital or
a big box under the stairs?

90
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:06,742
Doing five gives you a 25% chance
that at least one will attach.

91
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,827
That's it? 25%?

92
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,789
That means that it's, like,
75% chance of no baby at all?

93
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,209
I was thinking,
what are the odds...

94
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,546
...if you stuff 200 of them in there?

95
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,881
Sweetie, now...

96
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:25,510
...she's a woman,
not a gumball machine.

97
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:31,600
Don't worry. I'll do this as many
times as it takes to get it right.

98
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,896
The thing is, we kind of
only have one shot.

99
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:40,692
It costs $16,000 each time you do this.

100
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:46,907
We're kind of using all the money
we have to do it this one time.

101
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:53,456
Okay, that's a lot of
pressure on me and my uterus.

102
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:58,335
Maybe there's something I can do
to make sure I get pregnant.

103
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,920
No, I'm sorry.

104
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,965
Wow, you guys really
don't know anything.

105
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:10,556
Why don't she get drunk? It worked
for a bunch of girls in my high school.

106
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,895
Do you realize that
any minute now...

107
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,647
...Phoebe could be pregnant?

108
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,941
I know, I know.

109
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:25,570
It's such a huge,
life-altering thing.

110
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,325
The test is ready.

111
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,663
Okay. Each team will
answer 10 questions.

112
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,708
The first team to answer
the most questions wins.

113
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,463
The categories are
"Fears And Pet Peeves"...

114
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,381
..."Ancient History"...

115
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,174
..."Literature"...

116
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:50,220
...and "It's All Relative".

117
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,597
Now...

118
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:56,894
...the coin toss,
to see who goes first.

119
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,905
Somebody call it this time.

120
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,448
Tails!

121
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,492
It's heads.

122
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,245
Gentlemen, pick your category.

123
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,081
"Fears And Pet Peeves."

124
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,544
"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"

125
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,130
- Animals dressed as humans.
- Correct.

126
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,507
Ladies?

127
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,261
Same category.

128
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:36,350
"According to Chandler, what phenomenon
scares the bejesus out of him?"

129
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,562
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!

130
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,273
Correct.

131
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,777
The Irish jig guy?

132
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:52,741
His legs flail about
as if independent from his body!

133
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,034
Gentlemen, your pick.

134
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,369
"It's All Relative."

135
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,164
"Monica and I had
a grandmother who died."

136
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,791
"You both went to her funeral."

137
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,671
"Name that grandmother."

138
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,422
Nana?

139
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,134
She has a real name.

140
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,427
Althea!

141
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,928
- What?
- I took a shot!

142
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,137
With Althea?

143
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:18,392
- Althea is correct.
- Nice shooting!

144
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,187
"Literature."

145
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:27,025
"Every week the "TV Guide" comes
to Chandler and Joey's apartment."

146
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,321
"What name appears
on the address label?"

147
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,949
Chandler gets it!
It's Chandler Bing!

148
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:39,913
I'm afraid the "TV Guide"
comes to "Chanandler Bong".

149
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,874
I knew that!

150
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,629
Rachel, use your head!

151
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:50,799
Actually, it's Miss Chanandler Bong.

152
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,726
Hello, teeny embryos.

153
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,479
I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi!

154
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:09,234
I'm hoping to be your uterus
for the next nine months.

155
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,736
We're doing this
for Frank and Alice...

156
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:15,949
...who you know.
You've been there.

157
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,203
They want you so much.

158
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:23,540
So when you guys get in there,
really grab on.

159
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,960
And I promise that I'll keep you
safe and warm...

160
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:32,007
...until you're ready
to have them take you home.

161
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,222
Next time you see me,
if I'm screaming, don't worry.

162
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:43,268
That's what's supposed to happen.

163
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,062
Ready?

164
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,107
Good luck!

165
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,986
The score is nine to eight
in favor of the guys.

166
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,907
Ladies, if you miss this,
the game is theirs. Pick a category.

167
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,369
"It's All Relative!"

168
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:05,248
- You don't have to shout everything.
- I'm sorry!

169
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,337
"What is the name
of Chandler's father's...

170
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,007
...Las Vegas all-male burlesque?"

171
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:18,304
<i>Viva Las Gaygas!</i>

172
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:22,475
Unfortunately, that is correct.

173
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,477
All right. We have a tie.

174
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:31,233
Luckily, I've prepared
for such an event.

175
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,361
The Lightning Round!

176
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,741
Thirty seconds.
All the questions you can answer.

177
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,785
You guys are dead!

178
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,997
I am so good at Lightning Rounds!

179
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,834
I majored in Lightning Rounds,
all right?

180
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,252
We'll destroy you.

181
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,837
Want to bet?

182
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:56,550
I'm so confused as to what
we've been doing so far.

183
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,845
How about we play for more money?
Say 150?

184
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:04,141
One hundred and fifty dollars.

185
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,268
Say 200?

186
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,062
Two hundred dollars!

187
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,523
You're doing it again.

188
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,899
Excuse me.

189
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,944
- I don't want to lose $200.
- We won't.

190
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,572
Three hundred?

191
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,491
I'm spicing it up!

192
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:25,371
So play for some pepper!
Stop spending my money.

193
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:26,622
I got it!

194
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:30,334
If we win, they have to
get rid of the rooster.

195
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,461
That's interesting!

196
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,588
No way! That rooster's family.

197
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:35,630
The duck too!

198
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,841
The duck doesn't make noise!

199
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,635
He gets the other one all riled up!

200
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:45,057
- We are not...
- All right, hold on!

201
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:46,850
If you win...

202
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,270
...we give up the bird.

203
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,690
But if we win...

204
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:57,778
...we get your apartment.

205
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,615
Deal!

206
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,537
Betting the apartment?
I don't know about this.

207
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,875
I have not missed one question
the whole game. I own this game!

208
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,126
Look at my hand.

209
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:16,630
You have the answers written there?

210
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,093
No. Steady as a rock.
Now are you with me?

211
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,471
All right, let's do it!

212
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,141
All right.
Gentlemen, you're up first.

213
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:30,686
You have 30 seconds.

214
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,105
The Lightning Round begins...

215
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,358
Stop it!

216
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,820
"Monica's nickname
when she was a hockey goalie?"

217
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,448
- Big Fat Goalie.
- Correct!

218
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,993
"Rachel claims
it's her favorite movie."

219
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,579
<i>Dangerous Liaisons.</i>

220
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:53,000
<i>- Her actual favorite is...?</i>
<i>- Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

221
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:59,381
"In what part of her body did Monica
get a pencil stuck at age 14?"

222
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,594
No!

223
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,140
Her ear!

224
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:14,063
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

225
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,397
- Everyday use.
- Fancy.

226
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,023
- Guest.
- Fancy guest.

227
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,066
Two seconds.

228
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,110
Eleven?

229
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,114
Unbelievable!
Eleven is correct!

230
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,617
All right.

231
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:31,663
That's four for the guys.
Ladies, you're up!

232
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,961
Thirty seconds on the clock.

233
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,965
Five correct questions
wins the game.

234
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:44,552
The Lightning Round begins now.
"Joey's favorite food?"

235
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,219
- Sandwiches!
- Correct.

236
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,931
"Chandler was how old when he
first touched a girl's breast?"

237
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,432
- 14?
- No, 19.

238
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,309
Thanks, man.

239
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,895
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend."

240
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,563
- "His name was..."
- Maurice!

241
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,608
- "His profession was...?"
- Space cowboy!

242
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:04,780
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

243
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,702
It has something to do with numbers!

244
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,079
- And processing!
- He carries a briefcase.

245
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,665
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.

246
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,126
Something to do
with transponding.

247
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:21,255
He's a transponster!

248
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:25,342
That's not even a word!

249
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:29,513
I can get this! I can get this!

250
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,240
- I call Monica's room.
- You can't just call Monica's room.

251
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,409
Sure I can.
Standard Shotgun Rules.

252
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:54,621
I'm in sight of the room
and I called it.

253
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,957
<i>Damn!</i>

254
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,128
I feel like I'm coming down
with something.

255
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,298
Guess the color of my tonsils.
I bet the apartment!

256
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:08,635
I would never bet this place.
It's too nice.

257
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,846
Are they in there?

258
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,182
Yeah, I'm implanted.

259
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,351
How do you feel?

260
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,687
Well, freaked.

261
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,481
It turns out the odds
are really sucky.

262
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,360
And this is
Frank and Alice's only shot.

263
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,615
They are literally putting
all their eggs in my basket.

264
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,408
But I bet it works.

265
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,287
Really? How much?

266
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,332
I'm going to take
a pregnancy test now.

267
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,459
Wow! You can tell this soon?

268
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,961
The doctor says it takes a few days.

269
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:48,843
But my body's always been a little
faster than Western medicine.

270
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,514
I can't believe you guys think
you're moving in here.

271
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:58,435
Well, believe it, baby!

272
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,937
Well, I'm not moving.

273
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,939
What?

274
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,609
No. It was a stupid bet.
We were just playing a game.

275
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,986
You can't ignore the bet.
It's a bet!

276
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:12,074
Bet on a bet
and if you lose, you lose the bet.

277
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,367
We have to move.

278
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:18,455
We would have made them
get rid of the birds.

279
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:25,045
I hate this as much as you,
but if it makes you feel better...

280
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,548
...this is all your fault.

281
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,633
What?

282
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,595
Chanandler Bong!
We steal that "TV Guide" every week!

283
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,557
I knew it!

284
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,059
I don't care.
I'm not going anywhere.

285
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,063
Cool! Girl roommate.

286
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,525
Well?

287
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,236
Nope, not knocked up yet.

288
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,530
It's only been a couple hours.

289
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,534
Meanwhile, I'll do
whatever I can to help this.

290
00:17:55,784 --> 00:18:00,789
I'm just going to, you know,
lie in your chair, okay?

291
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:05,753
Good. I'm going
to let gravity do its jobs.

292
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,633
Can you give me a hand?

293
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:16,389
Put that box down!
We are not going anywhere!

294
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,391
This is my apartment and I like it!

295
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,768
This is a girl's apartment!

296
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,315
That is a boy's apartment!
It's dirty and it smells!

297
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,485
This is pretty!
It's so pretty!

298
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,946
And look, it's purple!

299
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:35,574
I tell you, you with your
steady hand, I am not moving.

300
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:39,619
And now I have got the steady hand.

301
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,705
- I'll take care of it.
- That's right.

302
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,375
You do what the hand says!

303
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:59,765
- How'd it go?
- I lost our mattresses.

304
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:09,774
<i>Are you in there, little fetus?</i>
<i>In nine months will you come greet us?</i>

305
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:14,822
<i>I will buy you some Adidas</i>

306
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:24,873
We were just at the drugstore
so we got you a little present.

307
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:29,878
It's a lollipop
and a home pregnancy test.

308
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:35,133
Don't mix those up.
You could really ruin that lollipop.

309
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:43,809
You feel like taking a test?
There's only one question.

310
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,561
All right. I will.

311
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,398
Remember that
it's still really early.

312
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:54,486
If it says I'm not pregnant,
that doesn't mean I won't get pregnant.

313
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,489
Just so I don't go completely nuts...

314
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:02,118
...try not to put
all your hopes on this.

315
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,457
Great.

316
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:18,176
You are mean boys
who are just being mean!

317
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,680
Don't get mad! No one
forced you to raise the stakes.

318
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,391
That is not true!
She forced me!

319
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,144
You got the question wrong.

320
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,646
It was a stupid, unfair question!

321
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,482
Don't blame the questions!

322
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:36,028
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.

323
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:40,491
- Stop calling it your apartment!
- It is!

324
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:46,872
You're going to have a baby.
They're going to have a baby!

325
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:56,590
My sister's going to have my baby!

326
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,268
Okay, but this can't
be good for the baby.

327
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,614
I can't find garbage bags.

328
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:24,534
I think I saw some in here.

329
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,831
What is it?

330
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:35,254
I don't know. But maybe if we keep
that drawer shut, it'll die.

331
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:39,925
I can't believe we're living here!

332
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,222
What is it?

333
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:48,850
Did you see the size of the closets?

334
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:53,731
I can't believe we live here!
