00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,673
- How did the audition go?
- Incredible.

4
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:08,467
You'll never believe
who the director was.

5
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,843
Who?

6
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,803
I'll give you one hint.

7
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:14,515
Warren Beatty.

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,727
There's just one thing
that might be a problem.

9
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,396
See, I had to kiss this guy.

10
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,400
Because he was just so darn cute?

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,278
No, I'm up for the part
of this guy...

12
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,113
...who the main guy kisses.

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:35,452
Well, you're an actor. I say
you just suck it up and you do it.

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,957
Or you just do it.

15
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,917
I did do it.
I'm a professional.

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,960
- What's the problem?
- After the scene...

17
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:48,632
...Mr. Beatty comes up to me and
he says, "Good actor. Bad kisser."

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,094
Can you believe that?
Me, not a good kisser.

19
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,971
That's like...

20
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,891
...like Mother Teresa,
not a good mother.

21
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,934
Who cares what that guy thinks?

22
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:04,439
What does Warren Beatty
know about kissing?

23
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,654
The One With Barry and Mindy's Wedding

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

25
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,744
What did your agent say?

26
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,497
This kiss thing is
definitely a problem.

27
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,250
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again.

28
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,918
I gotta figure out
what I'm doing wrong.

29
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,464
One of you girls
come over here and kiss me.

30
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,424
- Forget it.
- Yeah, right.

31
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,634
Come on.
I need your help here.

32
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,555
I'll do it. I've kissed him before.
I can do it again.

33
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,807
See this? This is a friend.

34
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,810
Let's go.

35
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,397
Oh, wait. I have gum.

36
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,533
Good. Very good.
Firm, but tender.

37
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,037
I'd recommend you to a friend.

38
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,373
Then I don't know
what the problem is.

39
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,750
Maybe you're not used
to kissing men.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,877
Maybe you tensed up a little.

41
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,962
Maybe you need to work on it.

42
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,425
Yeah, that makes sense.

43
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,390
Over my dead body.

44
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:08,105
And I'll be using
his dead body as a shield.

45
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,069
Come out, honey.
I'm telling you, you look good.

46
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,740
Tell her she looks good.
Tell her she looks good.

47
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,248
Oh, my God!

48
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,085
You look so good!

49
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,422
I cannot believe I have to walk down
the aisle in front of 200 people...

50
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:38,510
...Iooking like something
you drink when you're nauseous.

51
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,554
So don't.
I don't see why we have to go.

52
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,435
Because I promised Mindy I would.

53
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:51,064
Yeah, well, you promised Barry
you'd marry him.

54
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,942
You guys, I have to go.
I'm the maid of honor.

55
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:57,905
Besides, I need to be in a room
again with these people...

56
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,950
...and feel good about myself.

57
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,669
Someone's wearing the same clothes
as last night. Get some action?

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,672
I may have.

59
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,757
Stud!

60
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,592
- What's she look like?
- We haven't met.

61
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,846
We stayed up talking on the Internet.

62
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,223
Geek!

63
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,352
I like this girl.
I seriously like this girl.

64
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,980
You know how I tend to get
a little defended and quippy?

65
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,400
- Get out!
- No! Please.

66
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,572
Well, she called me on it, okay?
She said, "Cut it out, get real."

67
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,574
And I did.

68
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,328
What's that like?

69
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,580
It's like this. Me.

70
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,874
No jokes.

71
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,753
Stop it.
You're freaking me out.

72
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,423
I don't like you this way.

73
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,008
I'll see you guys.

74
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,302
- Bye, Richard.
- Bye-bye.

75
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,471
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

76
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,848
I love you too.

77
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,274
I think my boyfriend's
ever so dreamy.

78
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,987
I wonder what
our wedding will be like.

79
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,531
What are you talking about?
What wedding?

80
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,658
You never talk about that?

81
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,743
No, never.

82
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,163
We're just living in the moment.

83
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:33,375
It is so nice for once not to get
hung up on, "Where is this going?"

84
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,920
- Afraid to ask him?
- Could not be more terrified.

85
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,757
I think you should
seriously consider marriage.

86
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:45,304
Give Rachel another chance to dress
like Princess Bubble Yum.

87
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,474
Where's Benny?

88
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,560
There he is!

89
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,103
Where's Benny?

90
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,690
There he is!

91
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:04,114
Babies probably learn to talk
so they can tell grownups to cut it out.

92
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,533
Hey, I got a question for you.

93
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,328
Just a little thing, no pressure.

94
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,709
Do you ever think about the future?

95
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,751
Sure, I do.

96
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,047
Yeah? Am I in it?

97
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,507
Honey...

98
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,759
...you are it.

99
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:28,680
Oh, God.
You're about to get so lucky.

100
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,812
Keep talking.

101
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,899
Sometimes I think about
selling my practice.

102
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,027
We could move to France.

103
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,489
Make French toast.

104
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,116
Okay, so...

105
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,869
...we're in France...

106
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,079
...and we're making the toast.

107
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,834
Do you see a little bassinet
in the corner?

108
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,795
Like a hound?

109
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,631
Not a basset.

110
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,842
A bassinet.

111
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,929
You really need the bassinet?

112
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:14,768
Well, I just think the baby
would keep falling off the dog.

113
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:19,731
Do you not see kids in our future?

114
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,775
I love children.

115
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,818
I have children.

116
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,072
I don't wanna be 70
when our kids go to college...

117
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,575
...and our life finally starts.

118
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,123
I want you...

119
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,876
...now.

120
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,752
Well, that's great.

121
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,546
We don't need to talk now.

122
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:47,050
Really, this is so, like,
way, way in the future.

123
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:52,515
I'm talking hovercrafts
and apes taking over the planet.

124
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,854
Come on, Chandler.
I want this part so much.

125
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,607
Just one kiss.
I won't tell anyone.

126
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,319
Joey, no means no.

127
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,993
I'm sorry,
we don't have your sheep.

128
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,541
I think you look cute.

129
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,461
And you. You...

130
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,754
I could eat you.

131
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,883
Get away from me.
I said no.

132
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,344
Richard's downstairs.

133
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:34,515
Richard's here?
I should go say goodbye.

134
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,938
- Bye.
- Good luck.

135
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,690
How's your date with cyber-chick?

136
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,234
What is all that?

137
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,487
It's a web site.
It's the Guggenheim Museum.

138
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,323
She likes art...

139
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,826
...and I like funny words.

140
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,580
What does she mean by "H.H."?

141
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,666
It means we're holding hands.

142
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,335
Are you the cutest?

143
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:07,255
I'm afraid I might just be.

144
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,426
I think it's so great
that you're into this person...

145
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:17,391
...yet for all you know, she could be
90 years old or have two heads.

146
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,144
It could be a guy.

147
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,397
It's not a guy, all right?
I know her.

148
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,651
It could be like a big giant guy.

149
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:34,158
Man, I got this close to him,
and Monica kneed me in the back.

150
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,200
What's going on?

151
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,370
We're wondering if
Chandler's girlfriend's a girl.

152
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,539
Ask her how long she's gonna live.

153
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,917
Women live longer than men.

154
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,881
How do you not fall down more?

155
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,635
Ask her what is her method
of birth control.

156
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,680
All right.

157
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,519
"My husband is sleeping
with his secretary."

158
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,021
She's married?

159
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,859
At least we know she's a woman.

160
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,612
I can't believe she's married.

161
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,407
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

162
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:19,786
This must be really tough for you.

163
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:27,211
I read this article that says
you shouldn't throw rice at weddings.

164
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,505
When pigeons eat rice,
it kills them.

165
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:33,842
That's why you never see
pigeons in sushi bars.

166
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:38,097
- See, we're having fun.
- Oh, absolutely.

167
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:41,725
I'm not thinking about that thing
that we're gonna not think about.

168
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,852
Neither am I.

169
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,313
Hey, there.
Are you all right?

170
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,275
Yeah. But I saw the window
I crawled out of at my wedding.

171
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:54,488
And I just started thinking
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't.

172
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:58,909
People are gonna look at me and judge me
and think about the last time.

173
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,536
It's gonna be okay.
It's a wedding.

174
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,456
People focus on the bride.

175
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,874
I know, you're right.

176
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,209
Alrighty.
Everybody look at me. Good.

177
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,004
It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers...

178
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,717
...let's see two lines.
Thank you.

179
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,677
I'll see you after the thing.

180
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,264
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

181
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,317
Why didn't you tell me?

182
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,569
What could I do?

183
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,822
Stand up and shout,
"Hey, your butt's showing!"

184
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,991
This is so humiliating.

185
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,702
The only thing worse
was in eighth grade...

186
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:46,165
...when I had to sing the "Copacabana"
to the entire school.

187
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,250
Two lines into it, I freaked out.

188
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,003
My entire life's flashing
before my eyes.

189
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:54,173
Rach, look, I remember that.
It wasn't so bad.

190
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,928
Ross, would you stop!
You got me. I'm dating you.

191
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,347
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Weinberg.

192
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,142
It's wonderful
to see you again, my dear.

193
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:10,314
In fact, I hardly expected
to see so much.

194
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:14,860
- You told me you didn't see.
- I tell you a lot of things.

195
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,989
Well, it's wonderful to have you
up and about again, dear.

196
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,658
Stay well.

197
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:26,872
That's the third time someone has
said something like that to me today.

198
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,206
Rach!

199
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:31,210
- Oh, my God, I'm married!
- I know!

200
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,797
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter,
hyphen, Farber.

201
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,049
I am so proud of you, Min.

202
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,342
Min.

203
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,886
Oh, Rach. Still here.

204
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,598
At our wedding, they'd packed up
the chopped liver by now.

205
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,934
Yeah, I love that story.

206
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,729
I have a question for you.

207
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,523
Why do people keep saying
it's good to see me up and about?

208
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,235
After you ran out on your wedding...

209
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:59,655
...Barry's parents told people
you were sort of...

210
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,865
...insane.

211
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,241
Insane?

212
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,119
From the syphilis.

213
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,371
What?

214
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:12,251
What were they gonna say?
You didn't love me anymore?

215
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,419
Angela?

216
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,505
Joey Tribbiani.

217
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,925
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

218
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:25,597
I know you're seeing that guy.
I thought maybe you could bring him...

219
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:40,696
You gonna answer? That's the 10th
bing-bong message she's sent.

220
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,114
She asks what's wrong.

221
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,283
What's wrong?
You're married!

222
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,536
That's what's wrong!

223
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,372
Oh, my.

224
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,332
She wants to meet you.

225
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,127
Look, Phoebe,
I wanted to meet her too.

226
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,671
But she's married.
She has a husband.

227
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,633
What if he's the wrong guy
and you are the right guy?

228
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,136
You don't get these
chances all the time.

229
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:07,139
If you don't meet her, you'll
kick yourself when you're 80...

230
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,393
...which is hard to do
and you'll break a hip.

231
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,021
Okay. I'll do it.

232
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,859
Okay, great! Put on your shoes
and then march out there and meet her.

233
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,029
No, wait! You have
to take a shower because...

234
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,530
And I'll get the...

235
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,866
No, you have to answer her.
Answer her first.

236
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:31,705
No, make some coffee
because it's too much.

237
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,711
Okay, one more, please.
I'm gonna get it in this time.

238
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,339
Okay, last chance.

239
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,889
Again, I'm sorry.

240
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:55,062
You know what, maybe I don't
need to have children.

241
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:58,941
Maybe I just think I do
because that's what society...

242
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:02,277
...and by that, I mean my mom...

243
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:06,323
...has always convinced me that I...

244
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,578
I do.

245
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:15,081
I have to have children.
I'm sorry, I just do.

246
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,460
Could I have your attention?

247
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,879
Best man making a toast here.

248
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,506
Thank you.

249
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:29,054
I remember when Barry got home
from his first date with Rachel.

250
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:35,060
You hired the same band.
I can't use the same speech?

251
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,521
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

252
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,815
Anyway, I wish you both...

253
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,359
...a wonderful life together.

254
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,027
And, Rachel.

255
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,070
What?

256
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,155
No, no, in all seriousness.

257
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:50,242
Not a lot of women would
have the guts to be here.

258
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:54,663
And even fewer who'd do it
with their asses hanging out.

259
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,797
I'd like to add something to that.

260
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,342
What are you adding?
What are you adding?

261
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:11,097
Most of you don't know me.
I'm Rachel's boyfriend...

262
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,431
Oh, dear God.

263
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:14,600
...Ross.

264
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,977
And I'd just like to say that...

265
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:22,149
...it did take a lot of courage
for Rachel to come here tonight.

266
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,484
And just for the record...

267
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:29,698
...she did not run out on Barry
because she had syphilis.

268
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,952
I'm serious.

269
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,704
The reason...

270
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:39,416
...she walked out on Barry
is simply that...

271
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,501
...she didn't love him.

272
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:46,632
Which, incidentally,
worked out pretty well for me.

273
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,306
Cheers.

274
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,727
- See you in the parking lot.
- No, Rach.

275
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,105
And once again,
she is out of here!

276
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:06,110
Okay, who had 9:45?

277
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,625
You know what, Bar?
I'm not gonna leave.

278
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,711
I probably should, but I'm not.

279
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:30,843
I promised myself I'd make it
through at least one of your weddings.

280
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:37,683
Tonight, all I wanted was
to make it through this evening...

281
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,979
...with a little bit of grace
and dignity.

282
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:47,693
Well, I guess we can all agree
that's not gonna happen.

283
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:53,115
I guess there's nothing
really left to say...

284
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,285
...except...

285
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:04,001
<i>Her name was Lola</i>

286
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:08,589
<i>She was a showgirl</i>

287
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,841
<i>With yellow feath...</i>

288
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,926
<i>Feathers in her hair</i>

289
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:16,138
<i>And a dress cut down to there</i>

290
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,931
<i>She would...</i>

291
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,726
<i>- Merengue</i>
- "Merengue..." Thank you, honey.

292
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:23,479
<i>And do the cha-cha</i>

293
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:28,359
<i>And while she'd like to be a star</i>
<i>Tony always tended bar</i>

294
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,610
<i>At...</i>
Wait, wait!

295
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,195
Everybody!

296
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:34,907
<i>Copa</i>
<i>Copacabana</i>

297
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,327
<i>The hottest spot north of Havana</i>

298
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,245
<i>At the Copa</i>

299
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,747
<i>Copacabana</i>

300
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:49,296
<i>Music and passion were always</i>
<i>In fashion at the Copa</i>

301
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,512
I'll do it.

302
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:58,764
You'll do what?

303
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:02,684
If it takes kids to be with you,
then kids it is.

304
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,520
Oh, my God.

305
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,855
If I have to,
I'll do it all again.

306
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,316
I'll do the 4:00 feeding thing.

307
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,443
I'll go to the PTA meetings.

308
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,321
I'll coach the soccer team.

309
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:18,033
- Really?
- Yeah, if I have to.

310
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,744
Monica...

311
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,749
...I don't wanna lose you.

312
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,960
So if I have to do it all again...

313
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,171
...then I will.

314
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,885
You are the most wonderful man.

315
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,263
And if you hadn't have said...

316
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:44,059
..."If I have to", like, 17 times...

317
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,230
...then I'd be saying,
"Okay, let's do it."

318
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,942
But you're not.

319
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:59,324
Oh, my God. I can't believe
what I'm getting ready to say.

320
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:05,581
I wanna have a baby.

321
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:12,796
But I don't want to have one with
someone who doesn't really want one.

322
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,675
God.

323
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:24,058
I love you.

324
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,814
I know you do.

325
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,985
Me too.

326
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,744
So what now?

327
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,788
I guess we just...

328
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,251
...keep dancing.

329
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,182
Where is she?
Where is she?

330
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,017
Oh, hey, I have a question.

331
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,019
Where is she?

332
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:13,148
Relax, Chandler.
She'll be here.

333
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:15,942
Oh, that's her.

334
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:19,780
Yeah, because life's just that kind.

335
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,032
You gotta stop
staring at the door...

336
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,492
...like a watched pot.

337
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:27,913
If you keep looking at it,
the door's never gonna boil.

338
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:32,709
I think what you have to do
is try not to...

339
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,092
Oh, my God.

340
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,928
Oh...

341
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,763
...my...

342
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,974
...God.

343
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,692
Oh...

344
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:57,943
...my...

345
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,987
...God.

346
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,163
All right.

347
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:13,584
I've felt guilty because
I wanna be a good friend.

348
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:19,214
And damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

349
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,846
You are a good friend.

350
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:29,975
The audition's over,
and I didn't get it.

351
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,728
But that was a hell of a kiss.

352
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:36,607
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
