00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,128
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,337
Previously on "Friends"...

4
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:05,631
I tracked down Marcel. And get this:

5
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,593
He's here in New York filming
<i>Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.</i>

6
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,763
Hey, buddy! Marcel!

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,771
Excuse me, this is a...

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,817
Closed set. We know.
But we're friends with the monkey.

9
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,028
Good morning.

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,654
Look who I brought!

11
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,325
Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!

12
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,413
Whoa, dude. Burn!

13
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:39,999
I don't get it.

14
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,334
He seemed so happy
to see me yesterday.

15
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:48,423
Don't take it personal. He's under
pressure, starring in a movie and all.

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,550
How big of a star is Marcel?

17
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,929
In human terms? I'd say...

18
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,307
...Cybill Shepherd.

19
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:04,023
So you guys in the movie
or you just really paranoid?

20
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,274
Hey, Sal?

21
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,651
Jerry wants to know
if the monkey's ready.

22
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,777
Excuse me?

23
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,780
Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,991
- The one in the director's chair?
- Gotcha.

25
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:19,121
Pheebs, walk with me.

26
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,497
Why am I walking with you?

27
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,167
We're just going over here
so that we can get away from...

28
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,921
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!

29
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,840
For the love of God, woman,
listen to me!

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,552
Is he looking? Is he looking?

31
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,849
The One With the Super Bowl, Part 2

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,685
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

33
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,358
- We've got a problem.
- Tell me.

34
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,026
I can't do Chris' makeup.

35
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,570
She refuses to acknowledge
her mustache.

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,990
- Is it bad?
- It looks like her eyebrow fell down.

37
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,702
Unless we convince her
to let me bleach it...

38
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:43,330
...Van Damme will be
making out with Gabe Kaplan.

39
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,624
I'll talk to her.

40
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,210
I hate actors.

41
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,924
Nice camouflage. For a minute there,
I almost didn't see you.

42
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,011
Excuse me.

43
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,223
Is your name Chandler?

44
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,891
Yes, it is.

45
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,392
Chandler Bing.

46
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,855
Do you know me or are you
just really good at this game?

47
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,607
I'm Susie Moss.

48
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,193
Fourth grade? Glasses?

49
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,570
I carried a bo x of
animal crackers like a purse?

50
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,905
Susie Moss!

51
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,616
Right! Yeah! Wow!

52
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,369
You look...

53
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,870
Great job growing up.

54
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:28,459
It's nice to see you don't still
wear the cap with the mirrors on it.

55
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,421
I graduated fourth grade
and realized I wasn't a pimp.

56
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,256
Remember the class play?

57
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:40,429
You pulled up my skirt and the
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

58
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:44,683
Yes. Back then, I used humor
as a defense mechanism.

59
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,854
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

60
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,025
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

61
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,028
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

62
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,531
I didn't know he was in
this movie. He is so hot!

63
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,824
You think?

64
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,286
The Muscles from Brussels?
Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?

65
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,871
Did you see "Time Cop"?

66
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,539
No. Was he any good in it?

67
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,960
Rachel, he totally changed time!

68
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,423
So why don't you go talk to him?

69
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,842
Go tell him he's cute.
What's the worst that could happen?

70
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,720
He could hear me.

71
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,598
- I'm doing it for you.
- Don't you dare! Don't!

72
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,974
Don't!

73
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,853
Tell him I cook!

74
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,980
Excuse me.

75
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,944
This is gonna sound kind of goofy...

76
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,613
...but my friend over there...

77
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,741
...who cooks, by the way...

78
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,409
She thinks you're cute.

79
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,705
You don't think I'm cute?

80
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,707
I don't know.

81
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,127
Do you think you're cute?

82
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,756
We're getting off the track.
I was supposed to tell you...

83
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,425
...my friend thinks you're cute.

84
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:01,844
What should I tell her?

85
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:08,309
You can tell her
I think her friend is cute.

86
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,902
- Makeup!
- That's me. I gotta go.

87
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:27,703
How many times must I touch you on
the arm before you ask me on a date?

88
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,582
Well, let's try one more.

89
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,876
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

90
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,419
I'll be there.

91
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,422
And if things go well,
maybe this time...

92
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,050
...I'll get to see your underwear.

93
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:50,476
No one was around to hear that?

94
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,606
So what'd he say?

95
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,566
What a jerk!

96
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:02,738
I kept talking about you,
and he kept asking me out.

97
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:07,910
Naturally, you know, I said no.

98
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:10,662
Thanks, anyway.

99
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,498
He just kept asking...

100
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,417
...and asking, asking, asking...

101
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,004
If you want to go out
with him, you can.

102
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,465
Sounds like a jerk to me, but...

103
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:26,345
Jean-Claude, she said yes!
I'll see you tonight!

104
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,516
Thank you.

105
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,439
Then Jean-Claude took me
to Crossroads...

106
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,734
...and we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

107
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,153
Oh, man. She's so smokin'!

108
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,740
She's got the greatest set of...

109
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,037
No guys around, huh?

110
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,165
- Does anybody need anything?
- I'll have an espresso.

111
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,333
I'll get it.

112
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:01,296
If I ask you to, you'll end up
drinking it yourself.

113
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,758
- That is so unfair.
- I know.

114
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:10,514
Like you'd drink her coffee after
what you did to her with Van Damme?

115
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,016
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

116
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,437
Marcel's trainer will let me
have him for a couple of hours.

117
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,439
You're blowing me off for a monkey?

118
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,358
We can reschedule for Saturday.

119
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,612
Unless you hook up
with a bunch of pigeons.

120
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,823
Stick a fork in me...

121
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,534
...I am done!

122
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,077
Stick a fork what?

123
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,329
Like when you're cooking a steak.

124
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,708
I don't eat meat.

125
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,960
How do you know vegetables are done?

126
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,255
Well, you don't.
You eat them and you can tell.

127
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,758
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

128
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,721
I've met the perfect woman.

129
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,724
We're sitting on her couch,
fooling around...

130
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,435
...and then she turns to me and says:

131
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,938
"Did you ever want to do it
in an elevator?"

132
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,148
What did you say?

133
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:05,319
I believe my exact words were...

134
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,697
How do you know if you wanna do that?

135
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,491
You just know.

136
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:21,961
We gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

137
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:27,674
What I had planned shouldn't take
more than two, three minutes, tops.

138
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:32,304
Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.

139
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,181
But...

140
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,225
...here's an idea.

141
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,938
Have you ever worn women's underwear?

142
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,566
Well, yes, actually...

143
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,527
...but they were my Aunt Edna's.

144
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,781
And there were three of us in there.

145
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,117
I was thinking
it would be kind of sexy...

146
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:59,039
...if you wore mine tonight
at dinner.

147
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,878
You want me to wear your panties?

148
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,171
Could you?

149
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,090
If I was wearing your underwear...

150
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,719
...then what would you be wearing?

151
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,144
You're swell!

152
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,148
I made Marcel's favorite dish,
banana cake...

153
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,527
...with mealworm.

154
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,283
Candle.

155
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,912
What do you think's
gonna happen here tonight?

156
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:47,338
Hi, are you on your way over...

157
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,803
No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.

158
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,263
It's no big deal.

159
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:02,144
It's not like I had
anything special planned.

160
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:16,575
Rachel, why don't you
start talking first?

161
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,952
I feel that this is
totally unjustified.

162
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:23,833
She gave me the green light,
I did nothing...

163
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,837
Do you think I can't
see you in the TV set?

164
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,801
If there's something
you'd like to share...

165
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,636
You had no right to date him!

166
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,847
- That's the most ridiculous...
- You sold me out!

167
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,932
- I did not!
- You absolutely...

168
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:44,687
Would you let me talk!

169
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,316
Did you just flick me?

170
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,486
Well, you wouldn't let me
finish and I was...

171
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,906
That hurt!

172
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,324
Quit flicking!

173
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,992
Stop flicking!

174
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,954
You flicked me first!

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,920
Let's not do this!

176
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,341
Happy thoughts!

177
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:26,020
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

178
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,990
All right. Now, I will
let go if you both stop.

179
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,535
You want me to stop seeing him?

180
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:45,122
You want me to just tell him
you're seeing him instead?

181
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,959
Is that what you want?

182
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:53,088
That's what you want?

183
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,383
- Fine!
- Fine!

184
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,969
There we go.

185
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:04,391
If we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

186
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,068
Thanks for letting me tag along.

187
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,570
Forget about it.

188
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,864
How you doing there, squirmy?

189
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,949
I'm hanging in.

190
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,953
And a little out.

191
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,456
So assistant to the director?

192
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:32,544
That's an exciting job. You must
have a ton of responsibilities...

193
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,212
I don't do the casting.

194
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,883
So what are you guys gonna eat?

195
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,387
How come all I can think about is
putting that ice in my mouth...

196
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:47,059
...and licking you all over?

197
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:53,106
Because I went to an all-boys high
school, and God is making up for it?

198
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,861
I want you right here...

199
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,696
...right now.

200
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,782
Right now, right here?

201
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:06,161
Don't you think we're in
kind of a public place?

202
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,832
They do have the shrimp.

203
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,462
Meet me in the bathroom.

204
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,845
I'm going to the bathroom now.

205
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,773
Come on.

206
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,067
All right, mister.

207
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,195
Let's see those panties.

208
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,573
Alrighty.

209
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,912
But you know what
would be even sexier?

210
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,538
What?

211
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:55,252
If you didn't have
your shirt tucked into them.

212
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,966
All right. Now, I would like
to see you wearing nothing but them.

213
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,510
Take your clothes off.

214
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,849
I hope you realize this means
we'll miss hearing about the specials.

215
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,976
Come on, hurry!

216
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,438
Do you want this done quick
or done right?

217
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,817
All right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.

218
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:23,196
Somebody's been doing
his "Buns of Steel" video.

219
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:28,577
So you want me
to clench anything or...?

220
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,498
Susie?

221
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:36,793
This is for the fourth grade.

222
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,547
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

223
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,840
What do I mean?!

224
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,635
I mean underpants, mister!
That's what I mean!

225
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,262
What? What do you mean?

226
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,723
My skirt...

227
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,725
...you lifted. Kids laughing!

228
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:56,021
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!

229
00:14:56,563 --> 00:15:01,359
That was in fourth grade!
How could you still be upset?

230
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:06,991
Call me in 20 years and tell me
if you're still upset about this.

231
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:15,541
I hope you realize you're not
getting these underpants back!

232
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,634
I can't believe this.

233
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:29,179
Just two weeks ago,
I was watching "Sudden Death"...

234
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,891
...and now I'm on a date
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

235
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,394
Can you beat up that guy?

236
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,064
- Can you beat up that guy?
- Sure.

237
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,650
This is so wild.

238
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,905
I gotta admit, I was surprised
that you agreed to go on a blind date.

239
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,283
Normally, I would not do it.

240
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,454
What made you make
the exception for me?

241
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:54,788
Rachel told me...

242
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,750
...you were dying to have a threesome
with me and Drew Barrymore.

243
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:03,714
By the way, Drew has
some ground rules and...

244
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,841
Say you're sorry!

245
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,175
Say it!

246
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:10,804
No! I'm not gonna!

247
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,975
Say it! Say it!
Great!

248
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:20,105
Say you're sorry
or your sweater gets it.

249
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:24,902
That is my favorite sweater!
That is my third-date sweater!

250
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,988
Say you're sorry.

251
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:31,199
You wanna play?
Okay, let's play.

252
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,078
Let's play.

253
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,291
What'll you do?

254
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,920
Give me back my sweater
or it's handbag marinara.

255
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,466
You don't have the guts.

256
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:53,013
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken
to tell some guy he was cute.

257
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:06,318
Stop! Stop the madness!

258
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,988
This is crazy!

259
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:14,785
Who can remember why
you're fighting in the first place?

260
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,833
Yes, that's right.

261
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,460
But still...

262
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,129
Look at your purse!

263
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,049
Look at your sweater!

264
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,761
Look at yourselves!

265
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,723
I'll help you fix your sweater.

266
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,350
I'll help you...

267
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,978
...throw out your purse.

268
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:45,566
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

269
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:50,863
I'm sorry I went out with him
when I knew you liked him.

270
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:55,826
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

271
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,846
Joey?

272
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,640
Ma?

273
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,938
What are you doing here?
I thought you guys took off.

274
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:28,693
She took off with my clothes!

275
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:34,156
- Are you naked in there?
- Well, not exactly.

276
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,826
I'm wearing panties.

277
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,373
You always wear panties?

278
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:47,545
No, no. This is the first time.

279
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,047
Talk about your bad luck!

280
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:56,428
The first time you try panties and
someone walks off with your clothes.

281
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,724
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.

282
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:01,766
Let me see!

283
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:05,562
No! I'm not letting you
or anybody else see, ever!

284
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,024
All right, all right!

285
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:16,531
Someone's flossing!

286
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:24,873
Joey, some people don't like that.

287
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,875
Chandler's wearing panties.

288
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,335
What?

289
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:32,631
- Let me see!
- You don't have to see!

290
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,967
Hi, tushy!

291
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:39,137
One of you give me your underpants.

292
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,266
I'm not wearing any.

293
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,227
How can you not be wearing any?

294
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:50,148
I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot pink thong.

295
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,946
Look, Ross. I'll give you
$50 for your underpants.

296
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,016
- Can I have the milk?
- I'm almost done with it.

297
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,478
Keep your panties on.

298
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,443
And I'm in the movie!

299
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,196
- What happened?
- A virus victim called in sick...

300
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:42,785
...so Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney!

301
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:48,249
Marcel just finished his last scene,
if you wanna go say goodbye.

302
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:54,129
That's okay. He's probably
got parties to go to and stuff.

303
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,968
He's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?

304
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:01,887
Oh, my God!

305
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,514
What?

306
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:11,730
<i>Looks like we made it</i>

307
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,941
<i>Left each other on the way...</i>

308
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:18,404
<i>... to another love</i>

309
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,702
<i>Looks like we made it</i>

310
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,956
<i>Or I thought so, till today</i>

311
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:33,293
<i>Until you were there, everywhere</i>

312
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:39,925
<i>And all I could taste was</i>
<i>Love the way we made it</i>

313
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:46,515
<i>Looks like we made it</i>

314
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:53,647
I think I want to write
a song about all this.

315
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:57,401
Except one of the strings
on my guitar is broken.

316
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,612
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

317
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:05,868
- How long you been waiting to say that?
- About 20 minutes!

318
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,668
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

319
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,712
Cut!

320
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:21,967
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

321
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,761
Cut!

322
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:30,100
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

323
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:32,770
Mommy!

324
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,816
Can't you see what's going on?
This man is dead!
