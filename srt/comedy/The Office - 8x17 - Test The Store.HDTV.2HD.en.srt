00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:05,280
Today is the test launch day for
the inaugural Sabre store.

2
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:06,410
(Makes trumpets)

3
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:09,790
And I, Dwight Truth I'm in
charge of the entire operation.

4
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:11,491
If I can prove myself today

5
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:12,927
and the store
is a hit with the media

6
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:14,712
and Nellie sees this,

7
00:00:14,763 --> 00:00:16,380
the vice presidency is mine.

8
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:18,048
- Are you holding this chair?
- Yes.

9
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,767
'Cause I feel like
I'm gonna fall off.

10
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,135
- Yes. Yes.
- I'm not wearing

11
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:22,836
- the right shoes for this.
- We went over this, okay?

12
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:24,021
Your tiny fingers
make the best knots.

13
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:25,306
Hey, strangers.

14
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,575
So stoked
for the Sabre store opening.

15
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,180
Hey, my name's Tabitha.

16
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:34,782
I'm camped out in front
of the Sabre store

17
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,251
so I can be first in line
for the new pyramid.

18
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:39,553
Psst. It's me, Erin.

19
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:42,222
Dwight had me pretend
to be a hipster to create hype,

20
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:43,490
and it's working.

21
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:45,910
There's already people
camped out behind me.

Test launch day, people.

25
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,378
Now, I would like
to fill you in

26
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:06,413
on a little secret about me

27
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,432
to inspire you today.

28
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:09,767
Now, I know you probably
all think

29
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:11,518
I'm this patrician goddess.

30
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:13,720
But here's the truth.

31
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:17,424
I was born in the little
working class town of Basildon,

32
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,243
and until the age of 32,

33
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:21,078
[cockney accent]
I talked like this,

34
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:23,631
which was bloody horrendous,
innit?

35
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:25,449
I came from dirt--

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,568
No, lower than...

37
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:29,069
What's lower than dirt?

38
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:31,789
Loam, magma, mantle,
outer core, inner core.

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,941
- Yeah, thank you.
- Loam.

40
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:35,609
Bloody loam, I came from.

41
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,411
I hit rock bottom.

42
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:38,846
When I auditioned
for the Spice Girls,

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,080
I didn't even get a callback.

44
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:41,315
Which Spice Girl?

45
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:42,916
The black one.

46
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,985
I never stood a chance.

47
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,620
Okay.

48
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:48,222
Now, think about
my journey here today,

49
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:52,059
and let it inspire
your journey.

50
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:53,360
Okay.
Nellie, thank you.

51
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:54,895
- Thank you so much.
- Yep.

52
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,430
Today is press day,

53
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:59,933
and press is gonna make
or break this store.

54
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:02,269
And for a tech company,
press can only mean one thing--

55
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:03,620
Bloggers.

56
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:05,906
Dossier on bloggers.

57
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,792
Bloggers are gross,
bloggers are obese.

58
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,744
Bloggers have halitosis.

59
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:12,963
You're gonna love 'em.

60
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:16,150
Ryan is going to be
the main event today.

61
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:18,302
He is the pitchman
who is going to give

62
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:20,587
the feisty, yet profound speech

63
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:21,972
worthy of a world's fair.

64
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:23,123
Ryan, you ready to do this?

65
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:24,591
When people
see this presentation,

66
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:26,126
they're gonna [Bleep]

67

- Okay.
- Come on, man.

68
00:02:27,462 --> 00:02:29,013
Seriously disgusting.

69
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:31,131
Cathy, you will be the hot
girl who talks to bloggers.

70
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,649
Ugh.
Kill me.

71
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:34,134
That was my idea.

72
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:35,502
Packer, you will be
the sexual predator

73
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:38,172
who has come to prey
on the trendy teenage girls

74
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:39,606
who are obsessed
with the pyramid.

75
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:41,375
- Uh...
- Uh...

76
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:42,976
That is excellent.

77
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:45,029
I don't see what that gets us,
but I'm a team player.

78
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,280
Perfect casting, right?

79
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:47,948
Schrute's out to get me.

80
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:49,416
But I'm playing the long game.

81
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,751
As soon as he messes up,

82
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:54,021
I swoop in like
a sexual predator.

83
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:56,924
I want to create
a sense of wonder

84
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,625
and enthusiasm

87
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,135
I wanna get goose pimples.

88
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,020
Speaking of pimples,

89
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:12,339
let's release the bloggers!

90
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,559
Morning, everyone.

91
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,977
Oh, Andy, guess what
happened to me this morning?

92
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:18,395
Don't care.
Tell me later.

93
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:21,848
Listen, it's important.
You've gotta hear this.

94
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,233
What do you got?

95
00:03:23,284 --> 00:03:25,235
- Oh, my God.
- Do you have a black eye?

96
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:26,553
Yes, I do, Phyllis.

97
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:28,522
I woke up at 4:00 A.M.
by accident,

98
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,374
in time for the paper
to be delivered.

99
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:32,526
Guess what.

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,379
It's not a kid on a bike.
It's a man in a car.

101
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:36,747
Andy, who punched you?

102
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:38,365
Hey, I was on the can.

103
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:40,250
What's this about a black guy
in the office?

104
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:41,835
Black eye, Meredith.

105
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,870
Will someone please explain
what's going on here?

106
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:45,756
Since the interesting thing
happened till now,

107
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:48,842
so much time has passed,
it's like my life is buffering.

108
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:51,378
Here's what happened.

109
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:53,046
Pam and I were arriving
for the day,

110
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:55,616
and there was a gang
in the parking lot

111
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,818
on bikes,
on-- on motorcycles.

112
00:03:57,852 --> 00:04:00,387
And they just were
hassling Pam...

113
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:02,856
- That's true.
- They had, uh...

114
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,241
- Weapons.
- Weapons.

115
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:07,161
I just stepped in to talk
some sense into them.

116
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:09,947
But these were not the kind
of people who use their words.

117
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:13,000
Punches were going,
and I ducked a few,

118
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:15,735
landed a couple,
and I was fighting them off.

119
00:04:15,753 --> 00:04:18,738
It was totally, like--
like, senseless crime.

120
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:20,374
- Thank goodness he was there.
- Good job, Andy.

121
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:22,643
Yeah!
[All murmuring]

122
00:04:22,677 --> 00:04:25,712
I didn't do anything
any of you wouldn't have done.

123
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:27,747
Open the gates!

124
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,468
There's plenty for everyone.
No need to panic.

125
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,654
- There's plenty for everyone!
- Quit it!

126
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:35,088
There's plenty!
Don't stampede.

127
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:36,890
No need to stampede, sir.

128
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:39,226
- I was ahead of you!
- Okay, okay, hey, hey!

129
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,978
It's gonna be fine.

130
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,763
It's gonna be fine.
There's plenty of pyramids.

131
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:45,566
Come on.
I was in line before you.

132
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,568
So you're a blogger, right?

133
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:50,103
Yeah. Blogger.

134
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:52,939
God, stay away.

135
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:54,992
Oh, I always get in trouble
around bloggers.

136
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:58,495
I'm trying to be
a good girl for once.

137
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:00,013
Uh, yeah, I already
bought my pyramid,

138
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:01,832
but I don't want to leave yet.

139
00:05:01,883 --> 00:05:03,517
I haven't had so much fun
since seeing...

140
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:07,087
Zoo-ey Desh-channel at
the Couch-arilla Music Festival.

141
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:08,589
So fun.

142
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,507
How can we feel safe knowing
that there are gangs here?

143
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:12,426
We should call the police
right now!

144
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,861
- No!
- Yes!

145
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:16,129
No, no, no, no, no, we don't
need to call the police.

146
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:17,681
They'll just ask everybody
questions,

147
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:19,533
get up in everyone's business,
right, Pam?

148
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:22,769
Police are a hassle.
We settled this on the street.

149
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:25,439
And my eye will heal.
But if the police come,

150
00:05:25,473 --> 00:05:27,474
then we will forever
stain our neighborhood

151
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:28,992
as a troubled area.

152
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,327
Why would you care

153
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:32,479
what the police think
of our neighborhood?

154
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:35,148
Because <i>I</i> have
neighborhood pride.

155
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,717
1-8-5-0-5.

156
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:38,485
- 1-8-5-0-5.
- Guys, guys.

157
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:40,320
That's so vague.

158
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:42,556
You gotta do the zip plus 4.

159
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,124
1-8-5-0-5...

160
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:46,510
Dash 7-4-2-7!

161
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:48,495
Look, I don't feel safe.

162
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:50,564
I think we should
call the police.

163
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:52,299
Exactly.
We need to feel safe.

164
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,301
Which is why...

165
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:58,639
Toby is teaching us
self-defense.

166
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:00,006
Me?

167
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:01,358
Toby, will you teach us
self-defense?

168
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:03,977
Yeah. Um... I can't
believe you remembered

169
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:05,979
I do self-defense.

170
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:08,065
Um, I'll go put on my cup.

171
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:09,650
Great.

172
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:11,184
- Yes!
- Okay.

173
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:13,237
I wasn't sure which one
of you was Chuck!

174
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,455
Yeah, no, it seems
to be going great.

175
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:18,692
Andy got beat up
by a fifth grade girl?

176
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,260
Look at that guy.

177
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:22,162
He's got his Sabre phone on,
and he's not even using it.

178
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:25,749
This is a perfect photo
for my "Daily Fail" blog.

179
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,051
Uh, I-I gotta go.
Okay.

180
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:30,637
Dwight, what is a fail?
That sounds bad.

181
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:32,105
Oh, no, no, no.
It's good.

182
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,574
It's really-- on the Internet,
it's a really--

183
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:36,710
That's a really good,
good thing.

184
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,762
Are you trying to sabotage
this entire event?

185
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:39,896
I'm very sorry.

186
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:43,150
We gave you
an Arrowhead for free

187
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,685
for the day.

188
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:46,787
How hard would it have been

189
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:48,522
to do this, hmm?

190
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:51,024
"Hello. Hi, sweetie.
It's Jim.

191
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:53,076
"I'm calling you
from the new Arrowhead,

192
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:54,928
"which is why my voice
is crystal clear

193
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:56,580
"and my hand
won't ever get tired

194
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:58,732
because of the ergonomic
shape."

195
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,951
I'm really sorry.
Is there anything I can do,

196
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:02,602
maybe pretend to be Chuck?

197
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:04,121
You could have pretended
to be Chuck.

198
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:05,906
I begged you to pretend
to be Chuck,

199
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,274
but you chose to be yourself,

200
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:08,959
and you can no longer be Chuck!

201
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,295
Surrender the tripack.

202
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,752
You know what you have to do.

203
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:26,326
Point it towards
the store, idiot!

204
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,559
(Laughs)
You know what I mean...?

205
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:40,060
One of these buttons is--

206
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,396
Damn it.
Take over.

207
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,098
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
you guys, you must be lost.

208
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:47,100
Listen.
Excuse me, sir.

209
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:48,702
Yeah, the fountain where
you can feed the pigeons

210
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:49,987
is out behind the bank.

211
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:51,905
Tell your great grandson
to bring his kid by.

212
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,074
Okay. So long.
Here we go.

213
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:56,243
Erin! Psst!
Come on!

214
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:58,078
The elderly suck the life
out of the young.

215
00:07:58,112 --> 00:07:59,246
Get them out of here!

216
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,082
We are closed!
Come on.

217
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:05,335
Self-defense is not
some fun boxing match, okay?

218
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:07,187
This is about escaping
with your life.

219
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:11,175
So... Strike,
scream, and run.

220
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:14,828
All right?
Let's try it.

221
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:18,798
- [Screams]
- Ow.

222
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:20,300
That may have been my fault.

223
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,602
What the hell, Toby?

224
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:23,637
Okay, look,
in a real crisis situation,

225
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:26,323
you're not gonna
have time to think, okay?

226
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:28,692
So just remember,
I-a-a-t-g.

227
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:30,911
"It's all about the groin."

228
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:34,181
What if you're being
attacked by a...

229
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:36,183
Smallish man

230
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:38,285
who happens to not
have a groin?

231
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:40,287
I don't think
that's very common.

232
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:43,657
What if you're being attacked
by a 4'11" man

233
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,626
- who's penisless?
- Why are you fixated

234
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,328
on this hypothetical
transgendered attacker?

235
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:49,830
Why don't we start
with the basics?

236
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,632
Show us how to defend ourselves
against a baby,

237
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,668
and then like
a fifth-grade girl,

238
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:56,386
and then, you know,
if we have time,

239
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:57,871
on up to a scary man.

240
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:59,640
Well, the most common
scenario

241
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:02,209
is a larger man
attacking a smaller female.

242
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,027
So in that scenario,

243
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:06,980
what if the victim

244
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,449
sucker-punches the attacker
in the face?

245
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:11,318
What can the attacker then do

246
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:12,719
to better protect himself?

247
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:14,521
It's interesting
that you're drawn

248
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:16,740
to the point of view
of the attacker.

249
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,409
You would like
<i>the turn of the table.</i>

250
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,994
Okay, the latest
Chad Flenderman novel...

251
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,213
[Everyone groans]
Based from the point of view

252
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:25,666
of his nemesis,
Dr. Lucifer Wu.

253
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,051
Can I please leave?
I have a rape flute.

254
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:30,704
All right, well, let's try
one simple technique together.

255
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:32,873
Why doesn't everyone stand?
Okay, so...

256
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,675
You're being attacked.
You got your hands up.

257
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:36,760
Simple palm strike to the chin.

258
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,179
Up to the chin.
One, two.

259
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,931
All: One, two.

260
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:43,233
- One, two.
- [Softly] Take that, kid.

261
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:46,019
Cathy, I would like
to introduce you

262
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,321
to fatty gruesome.

263
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:50,073
He is a freelancer
for <i>Wired Magazine.</i>

264
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:52,075
Patty Grossman.
I'm a woman.

265
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,610
But you still work for
<i>Wired,</i> right?

266
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:54,895
Yes.
Good!

267
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:57,898
Okay. Flirt away.

268
00:09:57,932 --> 00:09:59,116
Sabre.

269
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,702
It's time to come home.

270
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,106
Yeah.

271
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,708
Yeah. I mean, I think...

272
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:09,543
It seemed like you were
a little nervous.

273
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:11,628
Yeah, no [Bleep], Sherlock!
Can somebody please tell me

274
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,146
something encouraging
about this presentation

275
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:15,081
before I go out there in front
of a million people and do it?

276
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:16,633
I know, I know, champ,
just calm down,

277
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,769
because listen...

278
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:20,437
When you're out in front
of all those people...

279
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:22,889
- Yeah, what?
- You just need to realize

280
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:26,059
so much rides on this.

281
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,761
- You have no idea.
- Dwight.

282
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,597
I'm trying to make him
feel important.

283
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:32,399
God. I wish Kelly
were here.

284
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,234
She always knew what to say.

285
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:36,486
Um...

286
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:38,605
[Imitating kelly] Oh, Ryan,

287
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:39,740
you're so smart.

288
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:41,208
You're smarter than
Mark Zuckerberg

289
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:43,443
and those Google guys
all combined.

290
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:45,612
- Hee hee hee.
- You're so ignorant,

291
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:47,164
you barely know
what you're talking about.

292
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,115
That's so ridiculous.

293
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,385
You really need
to read a couple of books.

294
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,253
What's a book?
[Giggles]

295
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:56,306
Oh, my God.
You're so embarrassing.

296
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:59,192
My mom would say
the best stuff, though.

297
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,263
[Ahem]

298
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,701
You can...

299
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,336
[Slightly effeminate]
You can do it, Ryan.

300
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,838
And you know
that I'm capable of this.

301
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:14,207
- You're the only one
who can do it, s-sweetie.

302
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:16,476
What did you think
of the presentation?

303
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:19,212
I thought it was great,
sweetie.

304
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:20,714
I would just fix
that one--

305
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,499
Oh, "fix" means you hate it!
I knew it!

306
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,885
- I need something to drink!
- Jim, get him a water.

307
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,286
No, not a water.
A sports drink.

308
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,704
I hate everything
in that fridge.

309
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:29,706
Not red-- Get me something
yellow or green

310
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:31,208
from a nearby store.

311
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,992
Not red!

312
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:34,661
Why are you just
standing there?

313
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,499
Go to a nearby store and get him
a yellow or green sports drink!

314
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:42,669
Now, if your attacker
is willing to defile a corpse,

315
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:45,004
you better stop playing dead
right away

316
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,973
and just make it known
that you're alive.

317
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,058
Forgive me for interrupting.

318
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:49,810
I believe my daughter

319
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:51,978
had an altercation

Will be available in 2013.

482
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:55,492
You can play anything

483
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:58,378
from <i>Chuck</i> to <i>Cars 2.</i>

484
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:02,265
With the pyramid,

485
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,100
you have the connection

486
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:06,069
to everything,

487
00:18:06,103 --> 00:18:07,570
in time...

488
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:09,506
and space.

489
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,207
Crowd: Oh!

490
00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:14,377
Psst!

491
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:16,813
Oh.

492
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,402
Ryan: Sabre.

493
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:26,022
It's time...
to come home.

494
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:38,134
All right.

495
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:40,303
Thank you so much.
Wow.

496
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:42,555
Wow!

497
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,974
And good night.

498
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:45,542
[Applause continues]

499
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:46,593
Yeah.

500
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:49,129
Thank you.

501
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,281
Thank you very much.

502
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:53,633
Okay, this isn't over.
Let's stay focused, okay?

503
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:55,084
We made fun of Andy earlier

504
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:56,936
for getting beat up
by a little girl,

505
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:59,422
but... little things
can be dangerous.

506
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:01,808
Whether it's a Gremlin

507
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,326
or Chucky The Doll--

508
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:05,962
The key is to throw it
in something.

509
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:07,614
Like a fireplace

510
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,116
or a tub of electricity.

511
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:11,951
Okay, good point.
Um...

512
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:15,171
Good point?
What is a tub of electricity?

513
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:17,374
- I don't-- I don't--
- With all due respect,

514
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:19,275
we know
what we're defending against.

515
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:21,127
It's a 12-year-old
female bully.

516
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:23,480
- I was a 12-year-old bully.
- Great!

517
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:25,782
I think Kelly
should attack Toby.

518
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,017
Yeah.

519
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:28,284
Yeah, that's not
a bad idea, actually,

520
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:30,470
because I have had a lot
of pent-up aggression.

521
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,455
- Thanks.
- Good. Go.

522
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,090
- I don't know if this
is gonna help--

523
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:35,525
Let's go, Kelly.

524
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,594
We should stay to maybe
some more traditional models--

525
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:38,978
You think you're so pretty!

526
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:41,464
Well, you're not gonna be
so pretty come prom time!

527
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:43,350
Okay, this is what's called
pre-violent posturing.

528
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:46,603
Take that!
Not so pre-violent anymore!

529
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:49,022
Okay, I'm at what's called
"the decision point."

530
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,357
- Hey, hey, hey,
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly--

531
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:51,941
[Smack] Ow!

532
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:54,144
God! My good eye!

533
00:19:54,178 --> 00:19:56,513
Oh, boy!

534
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:57,881
Oh, no, I'm not
laughing at you.

535
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:00,617
I'm laughing at, um...
something that

536
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:03,953
Cece did on the playground
earlier-- Yesterday.

537
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:05,988
This morning.

538
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,024
You know why I got
hit by girls?

539
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:11,261
Because I stood up
for others...

540
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:14,347
Pam and Toby.

541
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:16,466
I stepped in, and I didn't care

542
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,668
that I was standing up
to girls.

543
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:20,553
You may wanna ask yourselves,

544
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:24,357
"where were you
when the girls came?"

545
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:28,611
Tough day. Yes.
But I feel good.

546
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:31,247
I put the office
in their place,

547
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,817
took a bunch of pain killers,
drank half a bottle of wine,

548
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:35,218
took my pants off.

549
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:38,655
I just feel good!

550
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,524
Okay, okay, I will be
the first to admit it.

551
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,693
We could have integrated more
Chuck into the presentation.

552
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:44,694
Dwight.

553
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:48,164
You're the Vice President.

554
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,749
Ha ha ha ha!
Yeah!

555
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,401
- [Squealing]
- Okay!

556
00:20:51,435 --> 00:20:53,536
- Come on!
- Aah!

557
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:54,838
Right on!

558
00:20:54,872 --> 00:20:56,506
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

559
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,792
Boom!

560
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:32,224
