1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,424
Come on, no peeking.

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,720
Our eyes are closed, and we're
crossing the street. Very good.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,182
Okay. Open up!

4
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,728
What do you want to show us?

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:24,483
Because all I can see
is this bitchin' van!

6
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,568
It's for our catering business.

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:30,322
I think I know that girl.

8
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:34,034
We won't keep it this way though.

9
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:38,789
We'll replace the sword
with a baguette.

10
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,002
Also, we don't know
what to do with this.

11
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:49,008
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.

12
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,968
The One Where
They're Going To Party!

13
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,727
Remember that guy that
put cilantro in everything?

14
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,354
Sure, Cilantro Larry!

15
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:48,901
I'm filling in for him as
food critic for the "Chelsea Reporter".

16
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,988
What an amazing opportunity
to influence...

17
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,283
...dozens of people!

18
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,620
What about our catering business?

19
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,538
It's just one night a week.

20
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,917
Plus, I get to take you out
for free dinners.

21
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,296
Well, in that case...

22
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,009
That was me, hopping on board.

23
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,052
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross!

24
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,388
Quick question for you.

25
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,142
Are you ready to party?

26
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,686
I could maybe go out
for a couple of beers.

27
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:29,150
There's this thing about bees
on the Discovery Channel.

28
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,152
I don't think you heard me.
Are you ready...

29
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,196
...to party?

30
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,284
Gandalf?
Gandalf is coming to town?

31
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:44,457
I have nothing to do, so tomorrow
we are partying with Gandalf, dude!

32
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:49,002
Dude, we are so going to party!

33
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,631
Wow, okay. Dude alert!

34
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,549
Who is this guy?

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,096
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson.
Only the funnest guy in the world.

36
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,390
I'll call to get off work tomorrow.

37
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,101
I'll call after you!

38
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:08,814
This will be so cool!
We never party anymore.

39
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,653
Were you smoking something
in the back of our van?

40
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,989
"We never have fun anymore"?
You have fun with me.

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,912
Remember those strippers?
And you paid me $50 to eat that book?

42
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,583
You are going to love this guy.
Gandalf is the party wizard.

43
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,794
Why do you call him "Gandalf"?

44
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,964
Gandalf the Wizard.

45
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,385
Didn't you read
"Lord of the Rings" in high school?

46
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,514
No, I had sex in high school.

47
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,898
Joanna? I was wondering if
I could ask you something.

48
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,234
There's an opening for
a buyer in Junior Miss...

49
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,027
That'd be a step down for me.

50
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,031
Actually, I meant for me.

51
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,993
The hiring committee
is meeting people all day and...

52
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,496
I guess you can't stay
my assistant forever.

53
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:11,502
Neither can you, Sophie,
but for different reasons.

54
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:16,007
I'm so glad you don't have a problem.
If you did, I wouldn't apply.

55
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,257
In that case...

56
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,428
That's why I'm glad
there's no problem.

57
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,222
I'm on the hiring committee,
so there'll be one friendly face.

58
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,808
That's great!

59
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,561
Junior Miss is where I started.

60
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,897
I slept with the ugliest guy
to get that job.

61
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,776
Really?

62
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,074
I mean, no.

63
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:46,787
With your qualifications,
you won't need to do that.

64
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:51,333
Although I might need
some convincing.

65
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,670
Kidding!

66
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,216
God, I feel wild today!

67
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:07,391
Man, I am so excited,
I may vomit.

68
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,311
Will you calm down?
He's just a human guy.

69
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,606
You don't understand.
He's amazing.

70
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,775
You never know what'll happen.

71
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:20,946
You go out for beer
and end up on a boat to Nova Scotia.

72
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,741
It's beautiful country up there.

73
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:31,248
I got my passport, fresh socks,
and a snakebite kit.

74
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:35,043
It won't be exactly like last time.

75
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,463
I'll see you guys.

76
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,259
I have an audition,
but I'll meet you.

77
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,261
Where will you be around noon?

78
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:48,974
Somewhere maybe along the equator?

79
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,065
It's Gandalf!

80
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,403
So are you in town?

81
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,075
Maybe next time, then.

82
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,410
What happened?

83
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,704
He can't come.
He's stuck in Chicago.

84
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,122
Oh, man!

85
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,667
Chicago's so lucky.

86
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,378
Stupid, useless...

87
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,673
...Canadian money!

88
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,684
I especially like what I see about
implementing a new filing system.

89
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,186
Thank you.

90
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,482
Filing system? Those colored labels
you put on all the folders?

91
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,736
It did brighten up
the filing cabinets.

92
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,698
They did more than that.

93
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,579
I notice you've been entrusted with
a lot of important responsibilities.

94
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:56,249
Joanna really has been
an incredible mentor to me.

95
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,420
Rachel has been incredible
at getting my bagels.

96
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,883
She gets it right almost every time.

97
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,760
Of course, I have more
responsibilities than that.

98
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,887
Of course!
There's the coffee too.

99
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:13,391
Rachel can carry two things at once.

100
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,645
That's very good.

101
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,939
Now a big part of this job is...

102
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,318
...cultivating personal relationships,
especially with designers.

103
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,030
- Yes, I...
- She shouldn't have any problem.

104
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,910
Her only problem might be getting
too friendly, you know?

105
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,786
I love working with designers.

106
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:37,541
With them. Under them.
What's the difference?

107
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,881
My first review is out.

108
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,509
The "Chelsea Reporter".

109
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,971
These used to keep me so warm.

110
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,349
Look, I'm on the back page.

111
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,812
"Would I go back to Allesandro's?
Sure, I'd get two meals."

112
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:02,107
"One for me, and one for the guy
pointing the gun to my head."

113
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,693
You really laid into this place.

114
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,904
They don't pay me a penny
a word to make friends.

115
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,492
I found a guy who'd fix up
the van for catering.

116
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:12,701
You want me to go?

117
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:17,330
It's okay. Are we sure
we don't want the waterbed?

118
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,541
Haven't we made this decision?

119
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,252
Yeah, all right.

120
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:35,390
- Who is it?
<i>- It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.</i>

121
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:40,354
<i>I want to talk to you</i>
<i>about your review.</i>

122
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,148
Call me on the phone.

123
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,775
<i>What? So you can hang up on me?</i>

124
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,820
I'll never let you up,
so just go away.

125
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,324
<i>- Just give me a chance to...</i>
<i>- Do you need to get in?</i>

126
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,992
No, Phoebe!

127
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:57,246
<i>Hey, Monica!</i>

128
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,879
I want a retraction.
Our food is not "inedible swill".

129
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:05,962
I couldn't eat it.

130
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:10,801
My five friends couldn't eat it,
and one of them eats books.

131
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,303
Our service isn't
"grossly incompetent".

132
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:17,600
The waiter carried
the breadsticks in his pants.

133
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,562
Well, you said that we accept
the Discover Card...

134
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,440
...which we do not!

135
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,984
All right, that I'll retract.

136
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,738
But I stand by my review.
I know food, and that wasn't it.

137
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,990
Your marinara is like tomato juice.

138
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,118
You should serve it
with vodka and celery.

139
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,620
I'm proud of that sauce.
It's delicious.

140
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:43,125
You own an Italian restaurant,
and you think that tastes good?

141
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,003
Where are you from?

142
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,005
Lebanon.

143
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,841
Hand me those tomatoes.

144
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:55,053
I'll show you
what it should taste like.

145
00:09:55,304 --> 00:10:00,518
How long will this take?
I got another critic I got to yell at.

146
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,024
Joanna, I want to talk
about that interview.

147
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,111
I thought it went very well.

148
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:16,950
No, it didn't. That's what
I want to talk to you about.

149
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,995
Now just to brief you...

150
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,040
...I may cry.

151
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,878
But they are not
tears of sadness or of anger...

152
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,298
...but just of us having
this discussion.

153
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,842
Please, don't make a scene.

154
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,136
There's nobody here.

155
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,598
Sophie, get in here.

156
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:43,185
See? You're making
Sophie uncomfortable.

157
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,978
No, she's not.

158
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:50,693
Congratulations. You crossed
the line into completely useless.

159
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,321
Do you want me to quit?

160
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,782
What makes you think that?

161
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,284
Those things you said
in the interview...

162
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:04,248
...if you believe them,
I must not be a good assistant.

163
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,208
You know what?

164
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:11,046
I am just going to pack up my desk...

165
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:15,967
...and I will be gone
by the end of the day.

166
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:22,432
There's no use staying
till the end of the day.

167
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:23,976
Wait, wait.

168
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,730
You can put
your sad little muffin back.

169
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,944
If you must know the truth,
I didn't want to lose a good assistant.

170
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:38,991
That's why I said those things
about your flirting and drinking.

171
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,035
My drinking?

172
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,623
I must have said that
after you left.

173
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,166
Said what, exactly?

174
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,084
You enjoy the occasional drink...

175
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,254
...- ing binge.

176
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,007
Oh, my God!
That is it. I'm leaving!

177
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,134
You are just a horrible person!

178
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,510
Wait, wait.

179
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,596
If you're going to get
all sensitive about it.

180
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,140
I don't want to lose you.

181
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,976
What if I create a position for you?

182
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,272
I'll make you assistant buyer
in this department.

183
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,567
Say more things like that.

184
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:17,362
Your own office and a raise,
effective tomorrow.

185
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:20,491
- I need an expense account.
- Done!

186
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,827
- And an assistant.
- Sophie!

187
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,128
Hey, I thought you'd be
out partying with Gandol...

188
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,589
...- dorf.

189
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,925
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.

190
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,554
You've been sitting here all day?

191
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,474
I balanced my checkbook.

192
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:50,520
And I gave first names
to all the foosball players.

193
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,356
I can't believe he didn't come.

194
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,735
So what? We can still go out
and party ourselves.

195
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,530
With Gandalf, we'd be out all night.

196
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,994
We'd meet total strangers
and hang out with them.

197
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,788
We could do that.

198
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:11,083
There was other stuff too.

199
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,085
We'll do it all and better!

200
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:18,757
After tonight, Gandalf will want
to party with us, dude!

201
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,177
As if we
don't know how to party!

202
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,678
All right! Let's go.

203
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,807
Maybe we could end up
on a boat again?

204
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,643
All right!

205
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,396
When were we on a boat?

206
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:37,442
Remember that cold morning
when those dogs were licking your face?

207
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,571
Those were seals, man.

208
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,872
How would this suit
look on an assistant buyer...

209
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,207
The owner of Allesandro's
came to yell at me.

210
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:56,586
But I made him sauce, and he
offered me the job as head chef!

211
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:01,592
You just ruined the thing
I was practicing, but I'm so happy!

212
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,595
Can you believe it?
I get to run my own kitchen!

213
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,223
Oh, you've waited so long.

214
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,684
Pheebs! Quick question for you.

215
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,811
How would this suit look...

216
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,480
...on an assistant buyer
at Bloomingdale's?

217
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:19,610
It would totally depend
on her coloring and...

218
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,862
You got the job!

219
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:25,866
You got the job?
Why didn't you tell me?

220
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:30,579
It'll be so great!
I'll help decide what we sell.

221
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,373
I'll have an office
with walls and everything.

222
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,502
I'm going to have walls!

223
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,005
Is this the day of good news or what?
I got us a job.

224
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,841
The wedding reception.

225
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:49,223
I kind of need to
talk to you about that.

226
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,063
I think it's time for me to take
a step back from the catering.

227
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,857
But we've only had one job.

228
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:04,904
But now we have this second one,
and it feels like it's snowballing.

229
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,865
What are you saying?

230
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,994
I got offered the head chef job
at Allesandro's.

231
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,915
It's okay, because
you don't really need me.

232
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,751
You're the cook!

233
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,463
Without you, it's just me
driving up to people's houses...

234
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,133
...with empty trays,
asking for money.

235
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:31,306
All right. But I'll pay you back
all the money you invested.

236
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,059
And you can keep the van!

237
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,186
For what?

238
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,938
I can't believe this!

239
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,648
I got to get out of here.

240
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,901
Phoebe, wait a minute.

241
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,532
I'm an assistant buyer!

242
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:55,455
We'll get coffee, get energized,
then head back out.

243
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,959
- Yeah, all right.
- Okay.

244
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,004
So we're having fun, right?

245
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,257
We don't need that wizard guy.

246
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,510
We hit some clubs,
talk to some strangers...

247
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,765
...then go down to the docks
and see about that boat thing.

248
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,685
I'm kind of beat.

249
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,395
Actually...

250
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,230
...me too.

251
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,482
Are you serious?

252
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,986
Thank God! I'm exhausted.

253
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,113
You guys want coffees?

254
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,533
I don't want to be up too late,
so I'll have a decaf.

255
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,451
Yeah, me too.

256
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:38,498
Actually, could I get
some hot water with lemon?

257
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:43,795
I strained my voice screaming in there.
Does it have to be so loud?

258
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,174
I can't hear a word.
My ears are ringing so bad.

259
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,843
I was glad I had
that extra pair of socks.

260
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,428
I used them as mittens.

261
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:56,224
I didn't want to touch a thing
in that last place.

262
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,937
How sad are we?

263
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,399
Yeah, I know.

264
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,442
You know what?
We're not sad.

265
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,736
We're just not 21 anymore.
You know?

266
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,529
I'm 29 years old, dammit!

267
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,324
I want to sit in a
comfortable chair, watch TV...

268
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,786
...and go to sleep
at a reasonable hour.

269
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:20,749
I like to hang out in a quiet place
where I can talk to my friends.

270
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:27,297
And so what if I like to go home,
put on Kenny G and take a bath?

271
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,220
We're 29.
We're not women.

272
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,145
There you are.

273
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,149
I'm glad you decided to hear me out.

274
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,902
Okay, I'm hearing.

275
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,528
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

276
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:57,119
I came up with a bunch of businesses
that you can do with your van.

277
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,831
You could be
a flower delivery person.

278
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,293
Or a bakery delivery person?

279
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,129
Pizza?

280
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,008
I got a whole bunch
of stuff in this area.

281
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:15,554
But I get the feeling
you don't want to deliver.

282
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,686
I guess if you
don't want to deliver...

283
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:27,357
...you probably don't want
to pick up stuff either.

284
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,280
You know what?

285
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,032
Let's do the catering business.

286
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,492
Really? Are you sure?

287
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,579
Yeah, I made a commitment to you.

288
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,122
It'd be fun.

289
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,709
It will be fun!

290
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:50,172
Let's plan the wedding reception.

291
00:18:56,345 --> 00:19:01,141
You really wanted me
to do something with this van.

292
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,688
You know what?
I want you to take the chef job.

293
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,233
Really?

294
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,527
That's what you really want.

295
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:15,823
I don't want to be the reason
you're unhappy. I'd be unhappy.

296
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:19,535
And I really don't want to be
the reason I'm unhappy.

297
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,663
Thank you.

298
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:29,086
Besides, it might be kind of fun
to form the new A-Team.

299
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,552
Hi, Mrs. Lynch.

300
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,388
Is Joanna in already?

301
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,224
Oh, my goodness!
You haven't heard.

302
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:43,600
What?

303
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,269
Joanna...

304
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,396
...passed away last night.

305
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,065
Oh, my God! How?

306
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,109
She was leaving work,
and she was hit by a cab.

307
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,154
Oh, my God!
I cannot believe it!

308
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:59,325
I know.

309
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,208
I didn't realize
that you were so close.

310
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,837
Yes. So close!

311
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:19,719
I know that this is an emotional
and difficult time for all of us.

312
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,431
But by any chance, did Joanna...

313
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,517
...send any paperwork
your way before...

314
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:26,810
...it happened?

315
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,354
No, nothing.

316
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:30,564
Imagine...

317
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:35,569
...if she'd just stepped off
that curb a few seconds later.

318
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:39,323
Yes, just a few seconds
and she'd still be with us.

319
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,242
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

320
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:46,329
I'm sorry. I have to go.

321
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,708
Good morning!

322
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,418
You didn't hear about Joanna.

323
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,588
I sure did!

324
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,262
I'm excited about having
Monica on board with us.

325
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:06,225
Although I do feel bad
about having fired Chef Emilio.

326
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,144
It is like losing
a member of the family.

327
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:15,066
Of course, that literally
is the case for several of you.

328
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,778
Tony, Carlos, Marie...

329
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:23,575
...please tell your father
how much we're going to miss him.

330
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,704
I know Monica has a lot
of great ideas for this place.

331
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:30,958
Well, you all read the review.

332
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,502
So without much further ado...

333
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:39,258
...I present to you
our new head chef.

334
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:48,558
I just want to say that
with a pinch of excitement...

335
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,104
...a dash of hard work
and a dollop of cooperation...

336
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:55,816
...we can have the recipe...

337
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:02,364
Are you going to kill me?
