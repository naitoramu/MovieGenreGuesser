1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,589
Oh, damn. Lost another file.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,323
Gonna have to reboot again.

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,675
Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,365
What do you think?

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,494
In school, we learned about this scientist

6
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:23,050
who trained dogs to salivate 
at the sound of a bell

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,873
By feeding them whenever a bell rang

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,888
So, for the past couple weeks

9
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:30,240
I¡¯ve been conducting a similar experiment.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,335
Dwight, do you want an Altoid?

11
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:34,747
Okay.

12
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:38,990
Altoid?

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,596
Sure.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,508
Yes.

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,190
What are you doing?

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,718
I...

17
00:00:57,713 --> 00:00:58,451
What?

18
00:00:58,451 --> 00:00:59,488
I don¡¯t know, I...

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,858
Oh, my mouth tastes so bad 
all of a sudden.

<font color=yellow>The Office 3x16 "Phyllis' Wedding" 
Original Air Date: Feb 8, 2007 (NBC)

22
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,325
Always the bridesmaids. Right, ladies?

23
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:46,096
Okay, for the next one, 
everybody hop out.

24
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:47,090
Just Phyllis and dad.

25
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,870
Actually, lets bring mom back in, 
and the sisters.

26
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:53,952
And, you and you and you.

27
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,437
Great.

28
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,531
<i>Phyllis is getting married.</i>

29
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:01,161
<i>And I am in the wedding party.

30
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,976
She has asked me to push 
her father¡¯s wheelchair down to aisle.

31
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:07,058
So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,989
<i>Since I pay her salary, 
it is like I am paying for the wedding.

33
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:13,229
<i>which I¡¯m happy to do.

34
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:14,968
It¡¯s a big day for Phyllis.

35
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,410
But, it¡¯s an even bigger day for me.

36
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,725
Employer of the bride.

37
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:23,039
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding.

38
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:27,301
It was the only way I could think 
to get six weeks off for my honeymoon.

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,962
No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.

40
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:35,317
Phyllis ended up using 
the exact same invitations

41
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,825
as Roy and me.

42
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:41,005
So, it was kind of like 
being invited to my own wedding.

43
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:44,724
And I was like, 
¡°Wait, I thought I called that off.¡±

44
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:48,450
So. What¡¯s in the box?

45
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,020
A toaster, you?

46
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:52,024
Uh, toaster.

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,776
Unbelievable.

48
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,197
- Hello, Angela. 
- Hi, Dwight.

49
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:02,190
You look as beautiful 
as the Queen of England.

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,787
Thank you.

51
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:05,964
Don¡¯t linger. Break left.

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,954
Left.

53
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:17,643
The Schrutes have their own traditions.

54
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:20,222
We usually marry standing in our own graves.

55
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,255
Make the funeral very romantic.

56
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,998
But, the weddings are a bleak affair.

57
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,924
Those flowers are nice.

58
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,950
Yeah. ¡°P and R?¡±

59
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,273
¡°Phyllis and Robert.¡±

60
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:33,228
Ah, of course.

61
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:36,177
Also, ¡°Pam and Roy.¡±

62
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:40,114
There she is!

63
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:45,958
I swear Phyllis, you are as beautiful 
as the first day you started work at Dunder-Mifflin.

64
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:48,300
Thanks, Michael. That¡¯s sweet.

65
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,184
Same as when you said it outside.

66
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,756
How you doing? You excited?

67
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,254
- Yes, very. 
- Me too.

68
00:03:56,061 --> 00:04:00,086
If, um... if you need to vomit, 
that is okay.

69
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:00,791
I did.

70
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,626
Do you want to talk about tonight?

71
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:03,730
No.

72
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:06,827
Because I know you¡¯re probably 
worried about pleasing Bob.

73
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:07,672
A lot of pressure.

74
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:12,269
Phyllis, did you break wind?

75
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:15,015
It¡¯s okay if you did.

76
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:17,100
It¡¯s a very natural reaction.

77
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,066
It¡¯s your wedding and you¡¯re nervous.

78
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:21,527
Um, that wasn¡¯t me.

79
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,481
Okay. Um...

80
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,277
I¡¯m sure that Bob...

81
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,870
Wow, that is...

82
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:34,992
That is pungent.

83
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,215
Um, I lost my train of thought.

84
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:41,926
Are you set on the hairstyle?

85
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:44,771
- I thought it was...
- Here, let me...

86
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,938
Michael, no.

87
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:48,000
- Just cover up that bald patch.
- I don't need your help. Thank you.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,847
No, Michael, please.

89
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:51,745
- Please, I just need some time alone.
- Okay, okay.

90
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,528
You might be surprised to learn 
that I have only been to one other wedding.

91
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,221
It¡¯s actually a very cute story.

92
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,750
<i>My mom was marrying Jeff,

93
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,450
<i>and they asked me to be ring bearer.

94
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,085
<i>And, I was understandably emotional

95
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:07,294
<i>And, somehow my pants became wet.

96
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,964
<font color=lightblue>I hate you!

97
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,785
<i>Long story short.

98
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:16,200
<i>Jeff¡¯s dog ended up as ring bearer.

99
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,747
<i>And the irony is that after the ceremony,

100
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:23,985
that dog peed on everything

101
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,096
and nobody said boo.

102
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,771
Why are all these people here?

103
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:30,354
There¡¯s too many people on this earth.

104
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,680
We need a new plague.

105
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,506
Who are all these people?

106
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:35,464
You know what?

107
00:05:35,522 --> 00:05:38,300
- I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
- No way.

108
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,810
- Did you ever see that movie?
- Of course I saw it.

109
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,370
I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally.

110
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:43,609
I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man,

111
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,890
and went into the wrong theater.

112
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:49,000
After one hour, I figured I was in the wrong theater.
But I kept waiting.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,616
Because that¡¯s the thing about bear attacks.

114
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,325
They come when you least expect it.

115
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,767
You know, I just wish...
I wish I had the investigative powers

116
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,413
To actually smoke 
some of these guys out, you know?

117
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:03,716
Once again, Jim...
I will take care of this.

118
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:05,766
I will locate the wedding crashers

119
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,490
And report them to Phyllis.

120
00:06:08,758 --> 00:06:10,395
That way I won¡¯t have to get her a gift.

121
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:12,361
Hi, I¡¯m Kevin.

122
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,046
Where did you find her?

123
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,936
At the gym.

124
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,324
Right. The gym!

125
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,795
Could you scoot over? 
You¡¯re on my dress.

126
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I thought you¡¯re not supposed 
to wear white to a wedding.

127
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,351
I know, but there was an emergency.

128
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:34,527
I look really good in white.

129
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:38,539
This strapping young lad sitting here is 
Phyllis¡¯ father, Elbert.

130
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,115
And, he is quite the ladies¡¯ man.

131
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:41,705
Aren¡¯t you, Elbert, huh?

132
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:43,115
Ah, ring bearer.

133
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:45,094
I could¡¯ve done better.

134
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,237
I will do better.

135
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,480
I am going to be better.

136
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,462
Can¡¯t believe I¡¯m actually doing this.

137
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,444
Are you ready for this, Elbert?

138
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,087
I am.

139
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,104
Let¡¯s do it!

140
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,422
That¡¯s my dress.

141
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:27,957
No, no, it¡¯s okay.

142
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,000
<i>It¡¯s a miracle.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,950
This is bullshit.

144
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:52,254
Me walking Phyllis down the aisle

145
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:54,496
was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding.

146
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:57,982
And now... the wedding has no highlight.

147
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,988
<i>I can¡¯t believe I pushed that¡¦

148
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:11,914
<i>That guy¡¯s lazy ass around all day

149
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:14,476
Until he was ready to stand up

150
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:15,420
And steal the show.

151
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:16,378
That¡¯s¡¦

152
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:19,476
Well, I got news for you, Elbert...

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,324
If that¡¯s your real name...

154
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:22,988
The show¡¯s not over.

155
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,862
And, do you, Phyllis, 
take Bob Vance of Vance refrigeration

156
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:04,698
To be your lawfully wedded husband.

157
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:05,913
I do.

158
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,083
Ladies and gentlemen!

159
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,570
May I present to you for the first time as a couple,

160
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,651
Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,465
And do you, Bob, take Phyllis
To be your lawfully wedded wife?

162
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:25,395
I do.

163
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:27,181
- You may now kiss the bride.
- Ladies and gentlemen!

164
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:30,377
for the first time as a couple, 
Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!

165
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:36,650
That's what I'm talking about!

166
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,929
Congratulations, Phyllis.

167
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,614
You look lovely.

168
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,576
Your dress is very white.

169
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:46,241
So white my eyes are burning.

170
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,843
Thank, Angela.

171
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,490
Congratulations, Bob.
You¡¯re a good man.

172
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,553
But, just know...

173
00:09:51,618 --> 00:09:55,125
If you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.

174
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,370
If you ever lay a finger on Phyllis,

175
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:58,890
I will kill you.

176
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,538
Agreed.

177
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,581
No fingers will be laid on Phyllis!

178
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:05,719
Oh, decide to sit down again, huh?

179
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,400
Great.

180
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,900
But you can hear me, too.

181
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:09,747
Best of luck, Phyllis.

182
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:11,670
Also, I¡¯m gonna need to see a copy of the guest manifest,

183
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,861
as well as photographs of the caterers.

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,355
I don¡¯t have that, Dwight.

185
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,657
Damn it, Phyllis!

186
00:10:19,506 --> 00:10:20,416
Are you alright?

187
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,600
This must be so awful for you.

188
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,150
What do you mean?

189
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:25,372
Well, this was supposed to be your wedding.

190
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,921
Oh, um... No, that¡¯s, um...

191
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:30,643
It¡¯s actually fine.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,803
There¡¯s no way it¡¯s fine. I¡¯m sorry, but...

193
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:34,612
If I was you, I would just like, freak out.

194
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:37,048
and get really drunk,
and then tell someone I was pregnant.

195
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:40,212
Okay, that¡¯s a lot of good ideas. Thanks.

196
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,301
Excuse me, sir.

197
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,680
How do you know the happy couple?

198
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,194
Who?

199
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,442
The bride and groom.
What are their names?

200
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,300
Oh, I... I don¡¯t... uh...

201
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,385
- I¡¯m not sure.
- Oh, I get it, I get it.

202
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:04,108
Come on, freeloader, let¡¯s move it.

203
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,416
- Oh! Come on! Come on! 
- Okay, okay. Where are we going?

204
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:10,139
You gotta find yourself 
another wedding to crash, my friend.

205
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:13,367
Phyllis? Are you happy with everything?

206
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,337
What can I do to make it more perfecter?

207
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:17,091
Oh, it¡¯s beautiful.

208
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:19,870
Why don¡¯t you find your seat 
and enjoy the buffet?

209
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,646
I¡¯m already on it.

210
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,831
Chicken, totally undercooked. 
I sent it back.

211
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,400
It¡¯s fish.

212
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,871
I will take care of that.

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,090
I do. I know a fair amount about 
fine food and drink.

214
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:33,917
This is a white.

215
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:37,038
No, this is not our first wedding.

216
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:40,894
This is the third wedding 
that Scrantonicity has played.

217
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,996
We also played our bassist¡¯s wedding

218
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,128
And our guitarist¡¯s wedding.

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,837
Ah, attention, everyone. Attention, please.

220
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:53,988
Uh, I¡¯m supposed to ask 
if anyone has seen Uncle Al.

221
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,196
He is old and has brown eyes 
and dementia.

222
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,187
<i>His family is very concerned.

223
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:04,530

- Hey 
- Hey

227
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,159
I know I don¡¯t normally notice 
these kinds of things, but, uh...

228
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:27,280
This wedding is really nice.

229
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,697
I mean the flowers and stuff...

230
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,610
Phyllis has got some great taste.

231
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,876
You are kidding me, right?

232
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:34,554
I know you probably not gonna remember this.

233
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,446
But, um, those color roses...

234
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,118
I got you those color roses for our prom.

235
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,569
Roy, I picked those flowers.

236
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,957
Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.

237
00:12:52,817 --> 00:12:55,678
I guess I wasn¡¯t really too involved in the planning.

238
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,102
Yeah.

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,822
Sorry about that.

240
00:12:57,822 --> 00:12:59,095
It¡¯s okay.

241
00:13:00,216 --> 00:13:01,755
Well, I think it¡¯s suck for you.

242

I¡¯m the one who actually wanted to get married.

243
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:24,275
Phyllis, you¡¯re a wonderful woman.

244
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:25,844

And, for the next 40 minutes,

00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:46,265
I am going to be your tour guide
through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.

252
00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:52,223
One of the great, 
seemingly impossible love stories of our time.

My name is Michael Scott.

Webster¡¯s Dictionary defines ¡°wedding¡±

255
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:03,367
As the fusing of two metals with a hot torch.

256
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,610
Well, you know something?

257
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,218
I think you guys are two metals...

258
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:12,537
Gold medals.

259
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:19,150

"Marriage"

263
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,880
The most important part of a speech is the opening line.

264
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:37,364
When time is not a factor,
I like to try out three or four different ones.

265
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:38,555
Phyllis and Bob...

266
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,619
Their celebrity couple name would be

00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:43,688
"Phlob.¡±

268
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:47,650
You look at her,

269
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,238
And she¡¯s kind of matronly today.

270
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:51,510
But, back in highschool,

271
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,891
I swear her nickname was ¡°Easy Rider¡±.

272
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:58,743
Now, as for Bob... Bob Vance...

273
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,179
- Okay, that¡¯s enough. Thanks. 
- ¡¦ is a guy that

00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:02,400
- Thanks, Michael. Give me, Michael.
- He works...

Okay, hold on. Hold on, hold on.

276
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:10,606
Look, um... I didn¡¯t say anything
when Phyllis¡¯s dad upstaged me at the ceremony.

277
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:12,553
And I think you owe me this, okay?

278
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,367
- Give me the microphone. 
- Well, I¡¯m not going to.

279
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,075
- It¡¯s okay. 
- Okay, good.

280
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:18,923
- You¡¯re outta here!

323
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,068
I¡¯m really happy I¡¯m with Karen.

324
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:25,395
<i>The Police - Every little thing she does is magic</i>

325
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,800

328
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:39,026

00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:48,066
Toby! Yeah!

330
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,629
I just want Phyllis to have a great day.

331
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:55,019
Phyllis and you will be great together.

332
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,208
We are great together.

333
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,759
We are a great team.

334
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:01,964
The Celtics were a great team.

335
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:05,973
Yes, yes¡¦ they were.

336

Robert Parrish.

337
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,611
I should talk to her.
I don¡¯t want this to ruin her honeymoon.

338
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,254
Well, nobody ever helped me.
I had to do it myself.

339
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:20,459
Even the doctor didn¡¯t know.

340
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,591
Dude, keep it together.
I listened to you for a half an hour

341
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:26,173
Even though most of that stuffs were right over my head.

342
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:39,241
Phyllis...

343
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:41,770
Phyllis, wait, please?

344
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:42,511
I¡¯m sorry.

345
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:45,897
I just... I just wanted to 
make this a day to remember.

346
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:48,069
You found Uncle Al!

347
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,986
Yeah, yeah. He¡¯s kind of a weirdo.

348
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:52,575
- Thank you, Michael. 
- You are¡¦

349
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,917
You¡¯re welcome.

350
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:57,654
They say that your wedding day goes by in a such a flash

351
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,353
That you¡¯re lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake.

352
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,982
I say that¡¯s crazy.

353
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,836
I say, ¡°Let them eat cake.¡±

354
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,322
Margaret Thatcher said that a marriage is...

355
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,181
Smart broad.

356
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:18,307
Be careful with the Bob... Oh, no!

357
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:24,908
Phyllis, Phyllis! Come on!

358
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:26,740
You look like a clown. Here.

359
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,465
Oh, get me! Get me!
