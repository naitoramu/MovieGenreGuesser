1
00:00:01,588 --> 00:00:03,318
- Hey, I got you one.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:06,333
Thank you. I was gonna grab
some chips, you want some?

3
00:00:06,493 --> 00:00:09,218
No, thanks.
We're still having lunch today, right?

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,515
I guess.

5
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:15,958
How dare you?

6
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,192
Hey, Toby?

7
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:32,752
What's this?

8
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:36,805
I just wanna remind everyone
about the company rules involving PDA,

9
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,418
- or public displays of affection.
- Yes...

10
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:41,406
Some people in the office
have complained.

11
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:44,814
- Oh, really.
- About other people engaging in PDA.

12
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:47,967
And you know, just wanted to remind them
it's not appropriate to do that.

13
00:00:48,442 --> 00:00:50,262
Is this about me and Jan in my office?

14
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:52,551
Because I'll have you know that
that was consensual.

15
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,813
What we did has nothing to do
with you or anyone here.

16
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,103
I don't think anyone heard anything.

17
00:00:58,734 --> 00:00:59,807
We're very discreet.

18
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:02,562
And most people had left by that point.

19
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,775
So I don't think
it's any of your business.

20
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:08,031
What I think you should do,
is roll up the memo real tight...

21
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,699
Okay, look, the memo was not out you.

22
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,388
For the record, I've never been involved
with anyone at work in any capacity.

23
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,441
All right, everyone, look.

24
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:19,249
All right, the complaint was
about Jim and Pam...

25
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:24,011
- No way.
- What?

26
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,798
You guys are together?

27
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:30,643
Yep.

28
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:32,198
Yes, we are.

29
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,442
- Tuna!
- Awesome!

30
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:36,725
I knew it!

31
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:38,587
To the two of you.

32
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:43,032
Toby, was this your fun little way
of congratulating us?

33
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:45,942
- Yes.
- Okay.

34
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:47,860
Mind is exploding.

35
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,577
Get over here.
Come on.

36
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,130
Come here.

37
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,118
Okay, stand up.

38
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,943
Here we go.

39
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:02,501
Everyone, this is a day
that will live in infamy.

40
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:04,456
Because today...

41
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:05,924
is the day...

42
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:07,746
that Jim and Pam...

43
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,077
- become one.
- Actually, we're dating for 2 months.

44
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:14,346
I love you guys so much.

45
00:02:19,786 --> 00:02:22,196
- Phone's ringing.
- No, no. Pam, let'em ring.

46
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:27,234
Let the bells of Dunder-Mifflin
chime out your love.

47
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,723
Because...

48
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,179
this is really good.
This is really good.

49
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:35,397
My heart soars...

50
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,744
with the eagle's nest.

51
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:41,089
I don't see it.
I think they both could do better.

52
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,358
It's not a surprise to me.

53
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:45,930
Pam is the office mattress.

54
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,670
Jim Halpert's off the market.

55
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,266
Guess who just became the best looking
single guy in the office?

Episode 4x02
"DUNDER-MIFFLIN INFINITY"

91
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,697
Can you make that straighter?

92
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:29,721
That's what she said.

93
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,507
Did you plan that?

94
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:33,130
No.

95
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,051
"Can you make that straighter?"

96
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:37,348
"That job looks hard."

97
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:40,039
"You should put your mouth on that."

98
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,660
How can you even use that one naturally?

99
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,436
Blowing up balloons, I thought.

100
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:46,565
You might wanna trim it a little?

101
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:49,233
- Michael.
- Oh, is Ryan coming back today?

102
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,454
Yeah, he is.

103
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:57,311
Pam and Jim are together.
Ryan is visiting.

104
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:01,373
Only thing that could make
this day better is ice cream.

105
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:05,633
What do you want?

106
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:07,671
To give you this.

107
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,912
- What is that?
- It's a ferel barn cat.

108
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,917
I trapped him
and I'm giving him to you

109
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:16,078
as a replacement cat
for the one I destroyed.

110
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,137
Her name was Sprinkles.

111
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:21,459
And his name is Garbage.

112
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:24,438
Most calls him Garbage
'cause he likes to eat garbage.

113
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,700
Don't you, Garbage?

114
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,588
I can't believe you just thought
you could replace Sprinkles,

115
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:31,185
before she's even in the ground.

116
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:33,019
You haven't buried her yet?

117
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:35,343
Don't rush me.
I'm grieving.

118
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:38,644
Garbage can be very helpful, okay?
He's a useful cat.

119
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,946
He killed an entire family of raccoons.
Look at him.

120
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,144
I don't want Garbage.

121
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:44,746
I want Sprinkles!

122
00:04:58,835 --> 00:04:59,689
Hey Toby.

123
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,543
Hey, Pa...

124
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:03,796
- You two.
- Hey.

125
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:06,344
So now that we are dating,

126
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,895
we just wanted to know
if we had to sign one of those

127
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:10,714
"we're dating" things for the company.

128
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:14,340
Oh, well, you know, those are only for,

129
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,528
you know, relationships.

130
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:21,158
So... if it's just a casual thing,
there's no need, really.

131
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:26,245
Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim,
but it's, like, pretty official.

132
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,280
Sorry, so do we need to...
sign one, or...

133
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:38,008
Let's just wait and see what happens,
you know.

134
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,793
- What?
- Well, let's just wait.

135
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,285
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

136
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:44,445
Great.

137
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,739
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hold on one sec.

138
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:05,561
Hey, Pam. It's great to see you.
Is Michael in?

139
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,856
- Hey, there he is!
- Yeah.

140
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:10,004
He's back!
And he's with a beard.

141
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:12,278
He has facial hair.

142
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,827
Look at him!

143
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:16,311
All grown up and no place to go.

144
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:18,306
Hello, M. Sonny Crocket.

145
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,930
I'm Tubbs.

146
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:22,019
Okay.
Should we get started?

147
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:24,565
Yeah, let's get started
because, uh, yes.

148
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:27,257
- 'Cause this is very serious business.
- Yeah, exactly.

149
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:28,802
This is a business meeting.

150
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:30,292
- Fire guy!
- Stop that!

151
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:34,256
That's right! Fire guy!
Don't start any fires, Ryan.

152
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,353
Fire guy!

153
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,691
- You weren't here for that.
- Here for what?

154
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,861
- When he started the fire.
- Look how big he is.

155
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:41,786
Look at you!
You are so...

156
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,783
mature and old
and little man now.

157
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:48,033
- You're like our little man.
- Little old man boy.

158
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:50,664
- Michael, everybody...
- Bearded like man boy.

159
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:53,278
Let me say something.
I know I used to be a temp here,

160
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,014
but now everything is different.

161
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:56,426
I'd like your respect.

162
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:59,779
I'm your boss now. You're gonna have to
treat me the same way you treated Jan.

163
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:02,516
- So...
- That's a little kinky.

164
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:03,949
I don't swing that way.

165
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,412
- I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
- Enough, okay!

166
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,975
This is inappropriate
and it stops right now.

167
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,101
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

168
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,718
Everybody, come on.
Settle down.

169
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:20,161
Let's get serious here.

170
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:24,164
Ryan has a very special
important presentation to do

171
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:26,810
which we will be doing
in the conference room in ten minutes.

172
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,615
- Perfect.
- Sound good? Okay.

173
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:29,857
All right.

174
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,287
Yeah, Ryan snapped at me.

175
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:35,385
Bu there was this twinkle in his eye
that I picked up on which said,

176
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:37,294
"Dude, we're friends.

177
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:38,959
"I'm doing this for appearances.

178
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,742
"I'm the big boss now.

179
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:42,627
"And I have to seem like an ogre.

180
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:43,980
"But you know me

181
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,043
"and you trust me,
"and we like each other.

182
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,263
"And we'll always be friends.

183
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,482
"And I would never take you for granted
"in a million years.

184
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:58,563
"And I miss you, man.
"And I love you."

185
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,708
His words.

186
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:08,742
Dunder-Mifflin Infinity represents
a floor to ceiling streamlining

187
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,137
of our business model.

188
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:11,745
The center piece of the campaign

189
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:15,072
is a new business to business
website interface

190
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:18,502
that will allow us
to compete directly with big box chains.

191
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,055
Wait a second.

192
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:22,726
Last time I checked,
Dunder-Mifflin already has a website.

193
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:26,398
And quite frankly, I'm not really sure
what's wrong with it.

194
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:30,055
This is a massive overhaul.
We're getting younger,

195
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:34,279
sleeker and more agile with the way
that we adapt to the marketplace.

196
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:37,271
Essential personal will be issued
blackberries for company use.

197
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:38,420
Gimme, gimme.

198
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,917
I'll stick around for a while
to help you set them up.

199
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:42,221
Any questions?

200
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:47,233
What if we don't wanna use a blackberry
because they are stupid and pointless?

201
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,068
- This's company-wide, Dwight.
- Got it.

202
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:53,548
You should call it
Dunder-Mifflinfinity.

203
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:55,694
You know, push the words together.

204
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:57,460
Any other questions?

205
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,962
Can we speak privately
about our relationship?

206
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:03,759
Thank you, everybody!

207
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,647
Ryan Howard everybody!
Good job!

208
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,445
That was some fun stuff.
When's the website go up?

209
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,107
As fast as possible.
We wanna start re-training people ASAP,

210
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,152
to hit the ground running
with the new system.

211
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:17,387
Cool beans.

212
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:20,374
- We're screwed.
- Who is?

213
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:22,853
Us, you and me.
The old timers.

214
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,894
I am not old.
You are old.

215
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,876
You are, like, a 100.

216
00:09:27,112 --> 00:09:28,689
You're over 40.
That's the cut off.

217
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:32,091
Are you listening to what he's saying?
Re-training.

218
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:33,872
New system, youth.

219
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,227
I'm telling you,
this kid is the grim reaper.

220
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:37,842
You deal with this,

221
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:40,646
or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis,
the chick you hit with the car,

222
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:42,225
we're goners.

223
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:46,691
I swore
I wouldn't tell anybody this, but...

224
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:49,711
in the interest of...

225
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:51,386
revealing secrets...

226
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:54,013
Oh, my god, this is gonna make
your brain explode.

227
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:58,600
Dwight and Angela...
dating.

228
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,570
Have been for six months.

229
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:03,159
Swear to god.

230
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:04,686
This is great.

231
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:07,861
I was gonna wait and tell you on your
birthday, but this is much more fun.

232
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:11,493
No, they have been dating
for, like, two years.

233
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:14,374
Since before your barbeque.

234
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:17,767
Wait, what?

235
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:21,436
You knew.
And you didn't say anything?

236
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,318
You didn't say anything to me.

237
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:25,891
Fair enough.

238
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:30,405
We should have started dating,
like, a long time ago.

239
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:33,108
Sorry, I didn't know
you guys were in here.

240
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:36,098
- No, we're just sitting here.
- I couldn't see your hands.

241
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:40,368
Oh, hey Pam, by the way,
it's great that you're dating.

242
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,894
But when a new client calls,

243
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:46,330
you just have to randomly assign them
to a sales person.

244
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:49,736
You can't base who gets new clients
on who you're sleeping with that week.

245
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:51,201
Okay?

246
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:52,771
- Okay.
- Okay.

247
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:54,066
Okay.

248
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:58,523
And... that is why
we waited so long to tell people.

249
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:11,313
- Okay, what's up?
- Yeah, okay.

250
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:12,729
Um, I was just...

251
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:15,128
After the presentation,
wanted to make sure

252
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:18,163
that vis-a-vis me in the office,
everything is business as usual.

253
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:20,573
Well, it's business but not as usual.

254
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:22,608
Yeah, no, I understand.

255
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,689
We're making great strides
and you're updating.

256
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:28,095
- But business as usual, no?
- No.

257
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:31,032
We threw out the playbook,
we start from scratch.

258
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,829
We're implementing a brand new system.

259
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:35,594
- Good, so we're on the same page.
- No.

260
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:37,618
We're not.

261
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,429
Michael, I know exactly

262
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:45,417
how much time and manpower
are waisted in this branch.

263
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:49,272
This company is getting younger,
faster, more efficient.

264
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:51,285
You need to prepare yourself.

265
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:55,406
We had a foreign exchange student
live with us when I was young.

266
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:59,680
And we called him my brother.
And that's what I thought he was.

267
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,471
Um, and then he went home
to what is now formerly Yugoslavia,

268
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,147
taking all of my blue jeans with him.

269
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:12,240
And I just spent
the entire winter in shorts.

270
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,680
That is what Ryan is like:

271
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:18,855
a fake brother who steals your jeans.

272
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:24,565
So...

273
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,544
- How are you?
- Awesome.

274
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,284
I am dating a lot of guys.

275
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,480
- Good.
- A lot. Black guys, mostly.

276
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:32,675
What?

277
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:36,454
Wait...

278
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:39,765
How do you touch
just one of these buttons at a time?

279
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:41,378
I don't know.

280
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:42,808
Did you even try?

281
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:46,527
If the kid wants to set mine up,
I'll let him.

282
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,857
I can't see half the things.

283
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:51,675
It's too little.
Use the phone.

284
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:55,426
I want you to tell me that you care
about me. That is what I want.

285
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,228
Kelly, I'm your boss now, okay?

286
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:59,369
Stop talking to me
like I'm your boyfriend.

287
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,706
Oh, big strong man.
Fancy new whatever.

288
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,140
- You never cared about me.
- I never cared about you?

289
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,125
Six months ago, Karen Filippelli
sent me an email asking me out.

290
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:10,491
I said no because
I was committed to our relationship.

291
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:13,064
Well, I hope you're still committed,
because I'm pregnant.

292
00:13:16,724 --> 00:13:19,052
And guess what buddy?
I am keeping it.

293
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:23,183
- You feel prepared to raise a baby?
- I ca...

294
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,394
I can't talk about this right now, okay?
After work, we'll go out to dinner,

295
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,320
we'll talk about it then, okay?

296
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,550
We have a date!

297
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,461
- Hello.
- Hello, Dwight.

298
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:43,950
I've been thinking about things...

299
00:13:45,831 --> 00:13:49,221
and I wanted to know if
you would have dinner with me tonight.

300
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:50,362
Really?

301
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:51,323
Yes.

302
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:55,045
I'll make a reservation.
No, no, let me cook for you.

303
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:58,106
Cauliflower and noodles.
Baked potato on the side.

304
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,780
I would prefer a public place.

305
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:03,061
See you after work.

306
00:14:09,603 --> 00:14:11,094
- Hi, Pam.
- Hi.

307
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:13,244
- Is Michael in?
- In his office. Go right in.

308
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,972
So, elephant in the room,
I have your old job.

309
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:26,087
Well, not exactly... my job.

310
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:28,275
- A different title.
- Oh, well, excuse me.

311
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,980
Same office.
Same responsibilities.

312
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:31,427
Different salary.

313
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:33,978
You'll get there.
Don't worry.

314
00:14:34,337 --> 00:14:36,589
- You look great.
- Thank you.

315
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:39,125
- Thank you.
- Scranton seats you.

316
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:41,009
Best decision I ever made.

317
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,294
You were let go.

318
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:46,248
You know what?
Love the beard, keep it forever.

319
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:53,897
What is the actual deal
with these things in terms of testicles?

320
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:55,474
What?

321
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,808
I don't wanna grow weird sperm
in case we ever wanna have kids.

322
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:03,005
So what's Ryan doing here?

323
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:08,601
I don't know. They're launching
a big new business plan, a new website.

324
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,640
He's being a real twerp about it though.

325
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:17,510
It's all about youth,
and agily, and streamlining.

326
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:21,423
- Try to squeeze out the older people.
- He's such a snake.

327
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,991
Hope he gets them an ageism suit.

328
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:27,064
What is that word?

329
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:28,336
Ageism?

330
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:32,732
The companies, they can't discriminate
against people due to old age.

331
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:36,125
Two years ago, we tried to force out
some of the older branch managers

332
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:39,276
with a mandatory retirement age
and then Ed Truck, your old boss,

333
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:42,575
threatened us with a lawsuit.
So, we had to back off.

334
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:45,102
So older people have just
as many rises as younger people.

335
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:47,701
Yes, Michael.

336
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:49,906
They do.

337
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:13,670
- Creed?
- Yes, sir?

338
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:16,313
- Everything okay?
- Everything's cool, dude.

339
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:17,717
I'm 30.

340
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:19,650
Well, in november, I'll be 30.

341
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:23,865
Another meeting's scheduled?

342
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,989
I was gonna do
the blackberry tutorial, in here.

343
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:29,009
Michael told us to wait in here,
we don't know why.

344
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:33,720
Oh, man.

345
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,480
Good, we're all here.

346
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,196
- We can get started.
- Michael.

347
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,358
Have a seat.

348
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,416
Have a seat like everybody else.

349
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:42,146
Okay, this is for everyone's...

350
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:43,835
Still my office, Ryan.

351
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:53,284
Well, there has been a lot of talk

352
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:56,173
about new ideas today.
Well...

353
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:58,283
new ideas are fine.

354
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,858
But they are also illegal.

355
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,174
Because they are a form of ageism.

356
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,613
What?
Yes, I am right.

357
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:08,875
Did you know...

358
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,854
that the age discrimination
and employment act of 1967

359
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:17,165
prohibits employment discrimination
based on age with respect to employees

360
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:19,238
40 years of age or older?

361
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:20,335
I did.

362
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,132
Technically, he's right.

363
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:23,548
Hey, shut up, Toby.

364
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:28,135
Why do we as a society
hate old people so much?

365
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:30,153
- Because they're lame.
- No!

366
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:32,294
Creed, no, they are not.

367
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:36,736
In fact,
many cultures revere old people

368
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:40,733
because of their storytelling ability.
Like the old lady from <i>Titanic</i>.

369
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:45,569
Or the funny things that they can do,
like, "Where's the beef?"

370
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,420
- Yeah.
- Why the big picture's up again?

371
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,385
You used that when you burned your foot.

372
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:52,054
We were using the Ben Kingsley too.

373
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:55,621
I was going to put up
some new pictures, but,

374
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:58,349
all of the ink in the printer was gone.

375
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:02,408
- Michael Scott?
- That is me! Come on in.

376
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:04,819
Whis this old fart?

377
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:09,441
Did you just stagger off the street,
out of a box or something?

378
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,562
Who's this worthless bag of bones?

379
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:15,896
Well, this guy is none other than one
of the founders of Dunder-Mifflin,

380
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:17,336
Mr. Robert Dunder.

381
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:20,747
Oh, yeah!

382
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:22,550
Yes!

383
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:26,369
- Michael, can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure thing.

384
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:28,268
Excuse me.

385
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,578
- We've actual work to do.
- Fine.

386
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:35,227
Then I'll call David Wallace
and you can explain to him

387
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:38,931
why you threw the founder
of the company out on his ancient butt.

388
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:44,568
Bob, how old are you?

389
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:48,244
- I'm 87.
- 87 years young.

390
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,089
And still tive.

391
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:51,298
That is great.

392
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,694
Did you know that Bob is still a member
of the board of Dunder-Mifflin?

393
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:58,455
Well, I haven't been
to a board meeting in years.

394
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:00,313
I send a proxy.

395
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:03,047
Still sends his own proxy.
Good for you.

396
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,690
I'm going to live for a very long time.

397
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:08,313
My grandma Schrute lived to be 101.

398
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:11,637
My grandpa Mannheim is 103,

399
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:14,390
and still puttering
around down in Argentina.

400
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:15,904
I tried to go visit him once

401
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:19,121
but my travel visa was protested
by the Shoah foundation.

402
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:22,779
I started this company in 1949.

403
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:26,992
Back then,
it was an industrial supplier

404
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:30,340
of metal brackets,
mostly for construction.

405
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:31,598
Oh, boy.

406
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:34,720
And then Mifflin,
of course he killed himself later,

407
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,312
but I knew Mifflin
through the rotary club.

408
00:19:38,472 --> 00:19:39,373
Great.

409
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,611
He was...

410
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:44,716
He was at dinner
with Beverly and her husband.

411
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,426
What was his name?

412
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:48,531
Uh,`jerry.

413
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:51,430
Jerry Trupiano...
from South Jersey.

414
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:53,282
And he was tall.

415
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,903
Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.

416
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,494
Great.
That's great.

417
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:00,117
Thank you for coming in.

418
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:01,690
Robert Dunder, everybody.

419
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,979
Thank you.
That was wonderful.

420
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:07,101
- Do you have a ride?
- Well, I came here in a cab.

421
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:09,470
- Perfect.
- Well, could you give me another...

422
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:11,141
Inspirational.

423
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:12,591
What have we learned?

424
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:16,970
Well, we have learned that
you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

425
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,453
Because it's illegal
and you will go to jail.

426
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,755
I should help him get home.

427
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,459
No, no, don't help him!
He doesn't need help, Pam.

428
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:35,025
What a nice guy.

429
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:38,208
Good night, guys.

430
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:42,170
Well, today was
a fantastic waste of time.

431
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,341
I disagree.
It think it was very valuable.

432
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,744
Michael,
technology helps business, okay?

433
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:49,434
You shouldn't resist it.
This is the way the world is moving.

434
00:20:49,606 --> 00:20:52,311
I happen to think that old ways
of doing business are better.

435
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:53,752
And I can prove it.

436
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,483
- Okay.
- I look forward to hearing your ideas.

437
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:01,274
- Where do you wanna go?
- Some place romantic and expensive.

438
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,526
Kelly, come on.

439
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,993
You know what? You're right.
I'm feeling kind of nauseous, anyway.

440
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,024
So...
we can just skip it.

441
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:16,175
Are you enjoying
your vegetarian noodles?

442
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:17,676
Very much.

443
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:20,015
How is your meat?

444
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:22,411
Dry, delicious.

445
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:29,935
- I heard a joke today.
- Oh, that's funny.

446
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:32,316
Yes, it was.

447
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:38,097
Are you enjoying your mineral water?

448
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:40,629
- I can't do this.
- What?

449
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,252
I can't be with you.

450
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:46,901
Every time I look in your eyes,
I see Sprinkles' stiff, lifeless body.

451
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:49,211
Then don't look in my eyes.

452
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:51,887
Look right here.
It's an old sales trick.

453
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:52,948
I'm sorry.

454
00:21:53,488 --> 00:21:55,036
I gave this everything I could.

455
00:21:55,537 --> 00:21:57,575
No, please don't do this, monkey.

456
00:21:57,825 --> 00:22:01,288
I will leave your toothbrush
on top of your tire tomorrow morning.

457
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:08,727
Smell that.

458
00:22:09,482 --> 00:22:10,547
You smell that?

459
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:12,947
- Dry rot.
- No, Dwight.

460
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:15,020
That smells like good business to me.

461
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,266
What I've done here,

462
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:20,524
is I have collected the finest gourmet
items that Scranton has to offer.

463
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:23,305
- Sweet, chocolate turtles.
- Yes. Nope!

464
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:25,818
No, those are for our clients.

465
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,868
Actually, our ex-clients.
I'll explain later.

466
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,188
Ryan wants everything in our company
to be about emails and I.M.S.

467
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:38,345
But I think he is forgetting
about the original instant message.

468
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:43,896
Letters attached to baskets of food.

469
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:50,991
Excuse me, Angela.

470
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:54,713
Michael asked me to turn in these
receipts for these gift basket items.

471
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,854
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

472
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:00,990
- Is that all?
- Yes.

473
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:05,610
I miss you.

474
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:07,401
Elevators.

475
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,244
Dwight, you have to listen to me.

476
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:13,212
We are not seeing each other anymore.

477
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:14,956
Can you accept that?

478
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:18,240
Fine.

479
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,912
Then I just wanna be friends.

480
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:21,981
Good.

481
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:23,475
Plus a little extra.

482
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,885
Also, I love you.

483
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:30,273
I don't understand what the big deal is.

484
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,693
- You lied about being pregnant.
- Right, so?

485
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:35,062
You really don't understand
why that makes me angry?

486
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:37,337
- No.
- We're never getting back together.

487
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:38,497
Why not?

488
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:47,404
All right, I just have to ask.

489
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,464
Now that we're public...

490
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:52,217
is the magic gone?

491
00:23:53,872 --> 00:23:56,480
It's funny you bring that up,
because yes, it is.

492
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
I knew it.

493
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:00,497
Oh, man.

494
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,918
- Just like that, huh?
- I think...

495
00:24:03,932 --> 00:24:06,533
I mean, I don't--
I don't know what it is, but...

496
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:10,259
- Be honest.
- I now find you repulsive.

497
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,132
That's honest.

498
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,137
All right, fair enough.

499
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:20,904
It was really fun
while it lasted, though, wasn't it?

500
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:22,062
Yeah.

501
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:23,643
For me it was.

502
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,166
Okay.

503
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:26,793
All right.

504
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:35,168
Hey, boss.
I didn't know you were coming in today.

505
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,230
What's, uh, going on here?

506
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,994
I am glad that you asked.
Listen up, everybody!

507
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,513
In the last year, we have lost
seven clients to the big chains.

508
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:48,533
These gift baskets
are our ticket back into their lives.

509
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:51,889
We are going to show up
at these businesses unannounced,

510
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:55,398
- and we are going to win them back.
- With gift baskets.

511
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:57,031
With peanut brittle.

512
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:00,286
With macadamia nut cookies.

513
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,732
With chocolate turtles.

514
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:05,013
With raspberry jam.

515
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,303
And a little bit of fat and salt.

516
00:25:08,517 --> 00:25:10,676
Because you know what?
That's what people like.

517
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,664
Ever since I was a kid,

518
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,072
people have been telling me
that I can't do things.

519
00:25:15,232 --> 00:25:16,829
"You can't be on the team."

520
00:25:17,138 --> 00:25:18,884
"You can't move on to second grade."

521
00:25:19,044 --> 00:25:22,915
Well, now they're telling me
that I can't win back clients

522
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:25,379
using old fashioned business methods.

523
00:25:25,635 --> 00:25:27,085
We'll see about that.

524
00:25:28,474 --> 00:25:30,796
And FYI,
I eventually hated second grade.

525
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:32,987
And I was the biggest kid in class.

526
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:36,541
Okay, we're gonna split up into teams.

527
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,397
Jim, Phyllis;
Stanley, Dwight;

528
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:39,480
me, Andy.

529
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,046
I'm not driving with him.

530
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:43,027
- I'll go with you, Stanley.
- Or him.

531
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:46,056
- Why don't we just go by ourselves?
- Why don't we just go as teams

532
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:47,729
to demonstrate our teamsmenship.

533
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:49,922
This is stupid.

534
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,043
What-- okay.
That's not helpful, Phyllis.

535
00:25:52,203 --> 00:25:55,261
How is giving people gift baskets
going to get our clients back?

536
00:25:55,421 --> 00:26:00,134
Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis.
Gift baskets are...

537
00:26:01,514 --> 00:26:04,325
the essence of class and fanciness.

538
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:07,151
They are the ultimate present
that a person can receive.

539
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:08,273
What about cash?

540
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,364
Cash can buy whatever you want,
including a gift basket, so...

541
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,338
it's kind of the best gift ever.

542
00:26:13,498 --> 00:26:16,025
- What about a gift basket full of cash?
- Yes!

543
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:17,637
Cash basket!
Nice work, Tuna.

544
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:21,241
Fine, I'm just gonna go by myself,
and I am going to win them back

545
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,873
by myself.
Because this is important to me.

546
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:25,708
Michael, wait.

547
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:27,686
Let me go.

548
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:30,125
No, this is my quest.

549
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:32,814
Please let me go.

550
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,847
I need to win those clients back.

551
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:38,342
- Please.
- Fine.

552
00:26:38,978 --> 00:26:40,211
Then god speed.

553
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:42,435
To both of us.

554
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:44,678
Good luck, Michael.

555
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:47,266
We don't need luck.

556
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:48,454
Yeah.

557
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:51,020
But thank you,
that was really nice of you to say.

558
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,892
Business to business.
The old fashioned way.

559
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:56,326
No blackberries, no websites.

560
00:26:57,734 --> 00:27:01,802
I would like to see a website
deliver baskets of food to people.

561
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:04,653
Yes, I understand that, David.

562
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:07,142
I just felt
that if we were to downsize Kelly,

563
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:10,577
and then outsource customer service
to India, which a lot of companies...

564
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,488
Yes, no--
Yes, Kelly is indian.

565
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:15,897
I understand that's confusing.

566
00:27:17,472 --> 00:27:19,241
Hey, brah.
Been meaning to ask you,

567
00:27:19,401 --> 00:27:21,311
can we get some Red Bull
for these things?

568
00:27:21,471 --> 00:27:24,222
Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull.
Am I right?

569
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:25,522
Later, skater.

570
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:30,166
Sweet ride.

571
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:32,607
American made.
What happened to the sebring?

572
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,082
It is in the body shop.

573
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:38,298
I had to have the dent taken out
of the hood where I hit Meredith.

574
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,331
- That's a pain in the ass.
- I know.

575
00:27:40,646 --> 00:27:42,421
- So who's next?
- Larry Meyers.

576
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:45,101
Left us six months ago for Office Depot.

577
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:49,641
<i>Proceed to the highlighted route
then route guidance will begin.</i>

578
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,064
Why do you use that thing?

579
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:53,174
It lets them know
where you are at all times.

580
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:54,171
Who?

581
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:58,383
The government,
spy satellites, private detectives.

582
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,571
Ex-girlfriends.

583
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:13,622
Next night, I'm out at a bar, 2:00 AM.
I figure I'll get a sandwich.

584
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,948
'Cause you can get a sandwich any time
of the night. I run into Vince Vaughn.

585
00:28:17,753 --> 00:28:19,898
- No way.
- Literally.

586
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,344
Dude, you are so money.

587
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:25,855
But you dot even know it.
But you do.

588
00:28:27,627 --> 00:28:29,040
- Later, guys.
- Yeah...

589
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:31,271
- Later, dude.
- Later, man.

590
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:37,971
How awesome is Ryan now?

591
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,918
Yeah, he's definitely something.

592
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:43,941
- What does that mean?
- That whole lifestyle

593
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:45,811
his whole vibe?
You find that appealing?

594
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,421
Tuna!

595
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:54,832
He has a killer job.

596
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:56,190
He's rich.

597
00:28:56,577 --> 00:28:59,772
He smells like what I think
Pierce Brosnan probably smells like.

598
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:02,840
He wears really cool rich guy cloth.

599
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:05,843
And he can get any girl that he wants.

600
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:09,877
So, sorry, Tuna,
but if you don't know why that awesome,

601
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:11,536
then...

602
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,590
you need awesome lessons.

603
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:16,900
Tuna, check ya later.

604
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,477
'Cause he's so money
that he doesn't even know it.

605
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:23,358
Those things are heavy.

606
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,683
There's a lot of stuff in there.
We have...

607
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,472
macadamia nut cookies,

608
00:29:30,373 --> 00:29:32,058
the honey mustard pretzels.

609
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:34,906
Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?

610
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:36,742
You know we closed our account, right?

611
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,947
- Yes, we do.
- We're with Office Depot now.

612
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,432
- Yes.
- Yes, we know.

613
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:42,953
- But we just have not gotten over you.
- Well...

614
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:46,193
And we are dedicated to providing you
with the very best customer service.

615
00:29:46,353 --> 00:29:49,623
- This is true.
- The best personal business relation...

616
00:29:50,073 --> 00:29:52,432
We can if you ever decide
to come back to us.

617
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:55,207
Okay.
I don't think we're coming back.

618
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:57,660
- Please come back.
- Okay, you know what?

619
00:29:57,848 --> 00:29:59,364
Just enjoy the gift basket...

620
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:03,030
and remember
that we provide a personal touch.

621
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,506
Remember what we had, Larry?

622
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:06,739
I mean, really, it's about money.

623
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:08,589
Well, just enjoy the gift basket.

624
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:11,165
- Okay, than.
- All right.

625
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,855
I mean, their website's really easy
to use too. That's a big deal for us.

626
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:18,566
That guy was so st...

627
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,438
How can't they know
how much better we are?

628
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:24,625
I don't know. Sometimes people are just
impossible and make you miserable.

629
00:30:24,785 --> 00:30:25,689
That is true.

630
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:27,125
Like Angela in accounting.

631
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:28,614
Yes, she is nuts.

632
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,996
No, she's wonderful.

633
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:32,499
At accounting.

634
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:34,650
But she drives me crazy.

635
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,816
<i>Make the next right turn.</i>

636
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,295
How do they know?
How does this know where to turn?

637
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:41,678
That's very impressive.

638
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:43,725
Hey, Pam.

639
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:47,271
I haven't settled on a final design logo
yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity.

640
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:50,095
And I know you're into graphic design.
You wanna give it a shot?

641
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:52,801
- Maybe try and design the logo?
- Uh, totally.

642
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:54,902
Cool.
That would be great.

643
00:30:55,073 --> 00:30:57,562
Can you do a couple mock-ups
and I'll take a look?

644
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,485
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

645
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:00,894
- Cool.
- Okay.

646
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:09,182
Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock-ups

647
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,754
and then turn those into thumbnails.

648
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:15,622
Maybe do some, uh, splash frames.

649
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:18,561
I don't know what I'm talking about,
but I'm excited.

650
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:21,951
And the last guy says, no, Harry Body.

651
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:24,226
You know I have heard it before.

652
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,387
Well, it's still very good.

653
00:31:28,522 --> 00:31:30,926
I bet I know someone
who hasn't heard that joke.

654
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:32,886
Your daugther Emily.
How's she doing?

655
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:35,718
She's great.
Thanks for asking.

656
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:37,609
Great memory, by the way.

657
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:40,335
She gonna be, like, 11...
this winter?

658
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,240
They grow up so fast.

659
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,284
I have a few of my own
that I want someday.

660
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:49,561
I don't wanna take any more
of your time, you're a busy man.

661
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:52,241
The reason we have stopped by
is to drop you off

662
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:54,883
this elaborate bag of goodies.

663
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,258
And to ask you to reconsider.

664
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:58,720
Oh, okay.

665
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:01,266
Okay? Okay!
So you'll reconsider?

666
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:03,390
Okay, thanks for the goodies.

667
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,602
Is that all you have to say?

668
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:15,621
It looks delicious?
I don't know.

669
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:17,008
You don't know?

670
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:19,697
Look...

671
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:22,160
We want you back.

672
00:32:22,894 --> 00:32:24,239
Can you offer lower prices?

673
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,541
- Well, no.
- Then we're not coming back.

674
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:28,747
- He's not coming back. It's over.
- No, it's not.

675
00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:31,283
- No, he's right.
- Accept it, why would he come back?

676
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:33,911
Why would he come back?
I'll tell you, Dwight.

677
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:38,593
He would come back because we offer
a wide selection of products,

678
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:42,348
and you're not getting the same customer
service that you get with us, are you?

679
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:44,658
That's not gonna change his mind.
He's moving on.

680
00:32:44,818 --> 00:32:46,968
We had our chance and we killed it.

681
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,172
Look...

682
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:59,001
We're also coming out with a website...
soon.

683
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:00,867
It's a staf-the-art thing.

684
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:02,681
It'll be up and running.

685
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:07,911
It's gonna cut costs
and it will make ordering much easier.

686
00:33:08,193 --> 00:33:11,140
Well, okay.
Well, when it's up, i'll check it out

687
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,546
and if it really cuts costs,
maybe we'll come back.

688
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:17,220
Great.
The magic of the gift basket.

689
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:20,100
That I don't care about as much.
Let me know when the site's up.

690
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,304
Okay.

691
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:22,681
Good.

692
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:25,662
Don't let Emily have any of the almonds.
She's allergic.

693
00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:30,509
<i>Proceed straight.</i>

694
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,511
Well, we're 0 for 6.

695
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,465
Last chance is
the Elmhurst Country Club.

696
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:37,707
Other side of the lake
on the southeast side.

697
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:39,079
I don't get it.

698
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:40,542
I really don't get it.

699
00:33:40,744 --> 00:33:42,394
I thought this would work.

700
00:33:42,616 --> 00:33:45,016
I threw everything I had
at that guy, nothing.

701
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:47,331
That's how it goes sometimes, you know?

702
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:50,725
You lose everything,
and everything falls apart.

703
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,867
And eventually you die
and no one remembers you.

704
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:55,396
That is a very good point.

705
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:57,291
<i>Make a right turn.</i>

706
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,216
Wait, wait!
No, no.

707
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:00,892
It means bear right.

708
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,897
- Right there.
- No, it said right.

709
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:04,332
It said, take a right.

710
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:05,638
No, no, look.

711
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:10,675
It means go up to the right, bear right
over the bridge and hook up with 307.

712
00:34:11,104 --> 00:34:13,256
Maybe it's a short cut.
It said, go to the right.

713
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:14,612
It can't mean that.

714
00:34:14,772 --> 00:34:16,815
- It's a lake there!
- It knows where it's going!

715
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:19,722
- This is the lake!
- The machine knows. Stop yelling at me!

716
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:22,635
No, it's up there!
There's no road here!

717
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:27,146
Remain calm.
I have trained for this.

718
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,411
Okay.

719
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:29,903
Exit the window!

720
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:32,853
- Here we go.
- <i>Make a U-turn. If possible.</i>

721
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:34,805
Look out for nature!

722
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,321
Michael!

723
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:37,728
Are you okay?

724
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:39,164
Swim for it!

725
00:34:40,265 --> 00:34:41,255
I got you!

726
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:42,415
I got you!

727
00:34:45,328 --> 00:34:46,330
Michael!

728
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:49,353
Let go.
Let go off me!

729
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:53,323
I've got you!

730
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:54,916
I've got you!

731
00:34:57,492 --> 00:34:58,540
Come on!

732
00:35:00,353 --> 00:35:01,354
Come on!

733
00:35:24,979 --> 00:35:26,319
You sure you're okay?

734
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:27,479
Fine.

735
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:28,855
Good.

736
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:31,267
That is what's most important.

737
00:35:31,978 --> 00:35:33,873
Did you get the rental insurance?

738
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:37,693
'Cause that is pretty important too
at a time like this.

739
00:35:45,422 --> 00:35:47,667
What a disaster.
This whole thing.

740
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:50,417
I'll call a cab.

741
00:35:50,704 --> 00:35:52,811
These people just don't realize

742
00:35:52,971 --> 00:35:55,360
what a gift basket means.
They don't get it.

743
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:57,524
Look, still works.
Old fashioned cell phone.

744
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:58,685
Yeah.

745
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,193
What about that last guy, Aaron?
Is he a jerk...

746
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,633
I don't even know if I want it.

747
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:06,944
Their website, so easy.

748
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:10,796
Yeah, well, you can have
your technology, jackass.

749
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,879
- Look where it got us.
- Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton.

750
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:16,350
At the end of East Mountain Road.

751
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,862
- In the lake.
- Hang up.

752
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,505
You know what we're gonna do?
We're walking back.

753
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:24,258
We're walking back to that office.

754
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:27,684
And we are going to re-claim
our gift basket!

755
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:30,742
We're going to take
what's rightfully ours.

756
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:32,862
We're gonna take a stand, Dwight.

757
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:36,767
- We're gonna take a stand!
- Take a stand!

758
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:39,356
So plays on the infinity thing
without being obvious...

759
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:40,510
Yeah, definitely.

760
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:43,818
I'd love to do, like, a color version.
Just bring a little color...

761
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:45,082
I like it a lot.

762
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,125
It's clear and subtle at the same time.

763
00:36:47,285 --> 00:36:49,308
It's really good.
You've a real talent for this.

764
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,334
- Thanks.
- I'd love to talk to you about it more.

765
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:55,859
- That'd be great.
- Do you wanna go out to dinner tonight?

766
00:36:57,152 --> 00:36:59,292
- Oh, is it...
- Wear something nice.

767
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:00,865
- No.
- What?

768
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:04,156
- I just... wanted to have dinner.
- I'm sorry.

769
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:07,475
I'm dating Jim.

770
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,240
You're kidding.

771
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:15,492
We're together.

772
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,195
That's great.

773
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,383
That's awesome.

774
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:21,787
Yeah, great.

775
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:27,822
- So let me...
- Yeah.

776
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:30,171
- Let me look at these.
- Okay, great.

777
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:31,665
Great.

778
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:40,969
I guess he can't get

779
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:43,594
any girl he wants.

780
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:55,729
Do you forget something?
What happened to you guys?

781
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:56,983
Give it back.

782
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,137
The gift basket.
Give it back.

783
00:38:01,387 --> 00:38:03,104
- What is this?
- It's real simple.

784
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:07,230
If you don't appreciate what we do,
then give us back our basket.

785
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:09,018
Maybe you should leave.

786
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:11,192
Yeah, maybe we should.

787
00:38:11,844 --> 00:38:13,274
Maybe we should leave.
Come on,

788
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:14,976
let's leave.
But before we leave,

789
00:38:15,255 --> 00:38:19,996
my wet friend and I are gonna wait
for our cabs on your nice couches!

790
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:22,664
Can you call us a cab, please?
I'm gonna-- Oh, sorry!

791
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,892
- Look.
- My clothes are so wet.

792
00:38:25,217 --> 00:38:26,354
Nice leather.

793
00:38:27,176 --> 00:38:28,728
My shoes are so muddy!

794
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:31,273
All right, here you go.
Take it back!

795
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:33,354
- It's open.
- Yeah, it was mine.

796
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:34,835
What's missing?

797
00:38:35,822 --> 00:38:36,950
The turtles.

798
00:38:37,638 --> 00:38:38,856
Where are the turtles?

799
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,389
Come on.
Get out of here!

800
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:42,565
Where are the turtles?!

801
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,069
- Where are they?
- I've an announcement to make.

802
00:38:46,348 --> 00:38:49,290
We seem to be missing a box
of chocolate turtles with pecans.

803
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,969
And we will not be leaving the premise
until we obtain them.

804
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:55,680
Hand over the turtles now!

805
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,729
I ate them, okay?
I ate the turtles.

806
00:38:57,889 --> 00:38:58,889
They're gone!

807
00:39:12,275 --> 00:39:13,512
We'll bill you.

808
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:18,533
May I have your attention, please?

809
00:39:19,261 --> 00:39:23,588
This office will not be using
any new technology ever, starting now.

810
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:25,338
That is not correct.

811
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:28,654
Ryan thinks
that technology is the answer.

812
00:39:28,814 --> 00:39:31,542
Well, guess what?
I just drove my car into a lake.

813
00:39:32,127 --> 00:39:35,316
- You did what?
- I drove my car...

814
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,506
into a f*ing lake.

815
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:40,865
Why, you may ask, did do this?

816
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:43,713
Well...
because of a machine.

817
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:47,091
A machine told me
to drive into a lake.

818
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,110
And I did it.
I did it

819
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,778
because I trusted
Ryan's precious technology.

820
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:54,816
- And look where it got me.
- Into a lake.

821
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:56,165
Exactly.

822
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:57,855
Did you get any clients back?

823
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:00,464
Maybe.
Maybe not.

824
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:01,821
Time will tell.

825
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,135
But I will tell you one thing,
those gift baskets

826
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:07,921
never endanger anybody's lives.

827
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:13,248
Game, set, match.

828
00:40:15,187 --> 00:40:17,025
Point.
Scott.

829
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,941
Game over.

830
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:22,140
End of game.

831
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:36,223
Everyone always wants new things.

832
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:40,652
Everybody likes new inventions,
new technology.

833
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:43,599
People will never be
replaced by machines.

834
00:40:44,071 --> 00:40:48,205
In the end, life and business
are about human connections.

835
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:53,661
And computers are about
trying to murder you in a lake.

836
00:40:54,563 --> 00:40:56,413
And to me, the choice is easy.
