1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,831
All right Jim, your
quarterlies look very good.

2
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:38,113
How are things
going at the library?

3
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,297
Oh, I told you
I couldn’t close it, so…

4
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:43,743
So you’ve come to the
master for guidance?

5
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,062
Is this what you’re
saying, grasshopper?

6
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:48,782
Actually you called
me in here, but yeah. 

7
00:00:49,428 --> 00:00:51,715
All right, well let me
show you how it’s done.

8
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:54,537
Yes, I'd like to speak to
your office manager, please.

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,135
Yes, hello, this is Michael
Scott, I am the regional manager

10
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,040
of Dundler Mifflin
Paper Products.

11
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:03,224
Just wanted to talk to
you "manager-a-manager".

12
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:09,057
All right, done deal!
Thank you very much sir,

13
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,841
you’re a gentleman
and a scholar.

14
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:16,763
Oh, I’m sorry, OK,
I’m sorry, my mistake.

15
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:23,968
That was a woman I was talking
to... she had a very low voice.

16
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:26,063
Probably a smoker. So...

17
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:31,381
So that’s the
way it’s done.

18
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:34,798
I’ve been at Dundler
Mifflin for 12 years,

19
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:37,227
the last four as
regional manager

20
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:39,770
If you want to
come through here,

21
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:42,839
See, we have the
entire floor

22
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,410
So this is my kingdom,
as far as the eye can see.

23
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:48,106
Ah, this is our
receptionist, Pam.

24
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:51,049
Pam, Pam Pam! Pam Beesly.

25
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:53,444
Pam has been with us for…

26
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:55,586
for ever, right Pam?

27
00:01:55,947 --> 00:01:56,890
Well, I don’t know...

28
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:58,186
If you think
she’s cute now

29
00:01:58,237 --> 00:02:00,793
you should have seen her
a couple of years ago!

30
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:01,395
What?

31
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,683
Any messages?

32
00:02:05,064 --> 00:02:06,401
Yeah, just a fax

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,767
Pam, this is
from corporate.

34
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:11,424
How many times have I
told you that there’s

35
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:13,632
a special filing cabinet
for things from corporate?

36
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:14,270
You haven’t told me!

37
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:16,174
It’s called the
waste paper basket.

38
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:19,719
Look at that!

39
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:22,616
Look at that face!

40
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,424
People say I’m
the best boss.

41
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,798
They go, "God, we've never worked
in a place like this before,

42
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:31,944
you’re hilarious, and you
get the best out of us.”

43
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,646
I think that pretty
much sums it up

44
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:40,074
I found it at
Spencer Gifts.

45
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:02,882
My job is to
speak to clients

46
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,404
on the phone
about quantities

47
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:12,167
and type of copier paper.

48
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:15,661
You know, whether
we can supply to them

49
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,302
whether they can
pay for it and...

50
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,810
I’m boring myself just
talking about this.

51
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:37,760
I still love that
after seven years!

52
00:03:59,564 --> 00:03:59,884
What?

53
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:01,589
Nothing

54
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,994
Ok, all right.
See you later

55
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:08,146
All right, take care.

56
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:10,129
Back to work.

57
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:23,254
Corporate really doesn’t interfere
with me at all, Jan Levinson-Gould

58
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:24,604
Jan, hello!

59
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:28,223
I call her Hillary
Rodham Clinton, right?

60
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:29,969
Not to her face, because

61
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:34,231
not because I’m scared
of her, because I’m not...

62
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:35,492
but...

63
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:36,583
yeah.

64
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,421
All right, was there anything you
wanted to add to the agenda?

65
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,340
Me no get an agenda.

66
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:45,399
I’m sorry, what?

67
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:46,579
I didn’t get any agenda.

68
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:48,765
Well, I faxed one
over to you this morning.

69
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:52,824
Really? Cause I didn’t… did
we get a fax this morning?

70
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,828
Yeah, the one…

71
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:58,695
Why isn’t it in my hand?

72
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,485
Because a company runs on
efficiency of communication, right?

73
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:06,039
So what’s the problem
Pam, why I didn’t get it?

74
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:10,820
You put it in the garbage can
that was a special filing cabinet.

75
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:19,701
Yeah, that was a joke, that
was actually my brother's,

76
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,818
it was supposed to be with bills
and doesn’t work great with faxes.

77
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:24,482
Do you want to
look at mine?

78
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,716
Yeah. Thank you.

79
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,439
OK, since the last meeting,
Alan and the board have decided

80
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:33,151
that we can’t justify the Scranton
branch and the Stanford branch

81
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:34,507
Oh, ok…

82
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:35,715
No, Michael don’t panic

83
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:38,052
No no no no, this is good,
this is fine, excellent

84
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:39,600
Michael, listen,
don’t panic

85
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:42,605
- Although the alarm bells are going off...
- We haven’t made any decisions yet,

86
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:45,383
I’ve spoken to Joshua in Stanford
I’ve told him the same as you

87
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:48,680
and it’s up to either you or him to convince
me that your branch can incorporate the other

88
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:49,442
OK, no problem

89
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:51,513
This does, however, mean that
there is going to be downsizing

90
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,548
Me no wanna
hear that, Jan

91
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:56,386
because downsizing
is a bitch,

92
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:58,353
it is a real bitch,

93
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:01,549
and I wouldn’t wish
that on Josh’s men,

94
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:03,886
I certainly wouldn’t
wish it on my men,

95
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,574
or women - present 
company excluded... sorry.

96
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:09,994
is Josh concerned about
downsizing himself?

97
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:13,792
Not "downsizing himself", but is
he concerned about downsizing?

98
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:20,898
Question: How long
do we have to...

99
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,128
Oh, Todd Packer, terrific
rept, do you mind if I take it?

100
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,819
Go right ahead.

101
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:28,684
Pac man!

102
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,252
Hey, you big queen!

103
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,152
Oh, that’s
not... appropriate

104
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,601
Hey, is old Godzillary
coming in today?

105
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:36,086
I don’t know
what you mean

106
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:39,083
Look, I've been meaning
ask her one question

107
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:41,096
Does the carpet
match the drapes?

108
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:42,225
Oh my god!

109
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,494
That's horrifying! 
Horrible

110
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:52,071
Horrible person!

111
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,823
So do you think we can keep… a lid on this for
now? I don’t want to worry people unnecessarily.

112
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:02,452
No, absolutely. Under this regime,
it will not leave this office.

113
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:06,047
So what does downsizing
actually mean?

114
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:06,838
Well...

115
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:09,954
You guys gotta update your
resumes, just like I’m doing.

116
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,533
I bet it’s gonna
be me, probably.

117
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,254
Yeah, it’ll be you.

118
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:16,690
I have an important
question for you.

119
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:17,311
Yes?

120
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:20,645
Are you going to Angela's 
cat-party on Sunday?

121
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,450
Yeah, stop.
That’s ridiculous.

122
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:26,700
Am I gonna tell them? No I’m not going to
tell them, I don’t see the point of that.

123
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:30,097
As a doctor, you would not tell
a patient if they had cancer.

124
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:35,332
This is Mister Scott.
- Guilty, guilty as charged!


125
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:37,221
Ryan Howard, from
the temp agency

126
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:39,301
Deniqua sent me down
here to start today

127
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:41,776
Howard, like Moe
Howard, "Three Stooges"?

128
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:52,268
Right here, high five! Oh
Pam, that’s a guy thing, Pam.

129
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,571
I’m sort of a
student of comedy.

130
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,368
I’m Hitler, Adolf Hitler

131
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:12,628
I don't think it would be the
worst thing, if they let me go.

132
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:15,230
Because, then I might...

133
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:19,978
It’s just, I don't think it's many a
little girl's dream to be a receptionist.

134
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:21,851
I like to do
illustrations,

135
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:27,050
mostly water color,
a few oil pencil.

136
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,341
Jim thinks they’re good.

137
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:32,016
Dundler Mifflin,
this is Pam.

138
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,921
Sure. Uh, Mr. Davis, let
me call you right back.

139
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,280
Yeah, something just came up,
2 minutes. Thank you very much.

140
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:40,069
Dwight, what
are you doing?

141
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,494
- What?

142
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:41,574
- What are you doing?

143
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:43,753
Just clearing my desk,
I can’t concentrate.

144
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:44,863
- It's not on your desk.

145
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,637
- It’s overlapping.

146
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:47,262
It's all spilling
over the edge.

147
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,633
One word, two
syllables: demarcation.

148
00:08:59,065 --> 00:09:00,282
- You can't do that.

149
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,629
- Why not?

150
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:06,433
Safety violation, I could
fall and pierce an organ.

151
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:08,666
We'll see.

152
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:15,624
See, this is why the whole downsizing
thing just doesn't bother me.

153
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,110
Downsizing?

154
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:22,573
I have no problem with that. I have been
recommending downsizing since I first got here.

155
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,008
I even brought it
up in my interview.

156
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:27,945
I say, bring it on!

157
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:32,853
You just still have 8 messages from yesterday. 
- Relax, everything's under control.

158
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:36,727
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
that’s important, right.

159
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:40,432
Oh, this is so important,
I should run to answer it.

160
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,190
What?

161
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,502
Come on. Six Million
Dollar Man! Steve Austin!

162
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,177
Actually, that would be a good salary for
me, don’t you think? Six million dollars?

163
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:12,585
Memo to Jan: I
deserve a raise.

164
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:14,476
Don’t we all?

165
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:15,978
I’m sorry?

166
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,110
Nothing!

167
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:23,345
If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe
you should take it up with HR [Human Resources]

168
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:28,832
OK? Not today, OK, Pam?
Just... be professional.

169
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:37,552
I think I’m a role model here, I
think I garner people's respect.

170
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:43,112
Attention all Dundler Mifflin employees, please
we have a meeting in the conference room ASAP

171
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:48,053
People I respect, heroes
of mine, would be: Bob Hope,

172
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,796
Abraham Lincoln,
definitely,

173
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:58,330
Bono,

174
00:10:59,554 --> 00:11:04,118
and probably God
would be the fourth one.

175
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:12,988
And I just think all those people
really helped the world, in so many ways,

176
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:19,058
that it’s, it’s
really beyond words.

177
00:11:21,154 --> 00:11:22,968
It’s really uncalculable.

178
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,613
Now, I know there are some rumors out
there, and I just kind of want to see…

179
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:28,423
I’m Assistant Regional
Manager, I should know first.

180
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:29,828
Assistant to the
Regional Manager.

181
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,084
OK. Can you just
tell me, please?

182
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,006
Just tell me quietly.
Can you whisper it in my ear?

184
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:36,124
I'm just about
to tell everyone.

185
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,279
Please, OK.

186
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:38,246
Do you want me
to tell them?

187
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:40,096
You don’t know
what it is!

188
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:42,359
OK, you tell them,
with my permission.

189
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:43,430
I don’t need...

190
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:43,994
Permission granted. 
Go ahead.

191
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:49,728
Corporate has deemed it appropriate
to enforce an ultimatum upon me,

192
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:55,667
and Jan is thinking about downsizing
either the Stanford branch or this branch.

193
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:58,045
I heard they might be
closing this branch down,

194
00:11:58,242 --> 00:11:59,237
That's just...

195
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,289
That's just the rumor going around,
this is my first day, I don’t really know.

196
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,340
Yeah, but Michael, what
if they downsize here?

197
00:12:05,372 --> 00:12:06,616
Not gonna happen.

198
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,958
It could be out of
your hands, Michael.

199
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,995
It won't be out of
my hands, Stanley, OK?

200
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:11,867
I promise you that.

201
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,084
Can you promise that?

202
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:14,432
On his mother's grave.

203
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:23,154
Well, yeah, it is a promise, and frankly I’m a little
bit insulted that you have to keep asking about it.

204
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,035
It’s just that
we need to know.

205
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:29,638
Hold on a second, I think Pam
wanted to say something. Pam?

206
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,269
You had a look that you wanted
to ask a question, just then?

207
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,717
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say
that it could be this branch that gets the axe.

208
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,405
Are you sure about that?

209
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:50,352
Pam? Maybe you should stick to the ongoing
confidentiality agreement of meetings.

210
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,787
Pam, information
is power.

211
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:55,892
So you can't say for sure whether
it's gotta to be us or them.

212
00:12:55,917 --> 00:13:00,141
No, no, no, Stanley, no, you did
not see me in there with her.

213
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:08,075
I said, if corporate wants to come in here and
interfere, then they’re gonna have to go through me, right?

214
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,344
You know, you can go 
mess with Josh’s people,

215
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:12,166
but I’m the head
of this family,

216
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:15,857
and you ain’t gonna be
messing with my children.

217
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:28,410
If I left, what would I do with all
this useless information in my head?

218
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:32,357
You know... tonnage
price of manila folders?

219
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:36,858
Pam’s favorite flavor of
yoghurt, which is Mixed Berries.

220
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,437
Jim said Mixed Berries?

221
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,371
Yeah, he’s onto me.

222
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:53,522
Watch out for this guy!
Dwight Schrute in the building!

223
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,593
This is Ryan,
the new temp.

224
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:55,864
Nice to meet you.

225
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:57,424
Introduce yourself, be polite.

226
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,422
Dwight Schrute, Assistant
Regional Manager.

227
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,416
Assistant to the
Regional Manager.

228
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:06,150
So, Dwight, tell him about the kung-fu
and the car and everything.

229
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:11,293
Yeah, I got a '78 280Z, I bought it for 1200,
fixed it up, it's now worth three grand.

230
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:12,414
That is his profit!

231
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,800
New engine, suspension, I got it
re-sprayed, I’ve got some photos

232
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:18,990
Damn it!
Jim!

233
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:21,112
OK, hold on,

234
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:23,558
Judge is in session.
What is the problem here?

235
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:25,629
He put my stuff
in jello again.

236
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,274
That’s real
professional, thanks.

237
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,602
That's the third time and it wasn't
funny the first 2 times either, Jim

238
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:37,610
It’s ok here, but people sometimes
take advantage because it's so relaxed.

239
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:41,541
I’m a volunteer sheriff's
deputy on the weekends,
 
240
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,190
and you cannot
screw around there.

241
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:46,643
It's sort of one of the rules.

242
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:47,253
What is that?

243
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:48,258
That’s my stapler.

244
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:50,530
No no no, do
not take it out!

245
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:51,838
You have to eat
it out there.

246
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:53,932
Because there are starving
people in the world,

247
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,082
Which I hate, and it is
a waste of that kind of food.

248
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,127
OK, you know what?
You can be a witness.

249
00:14:58,142 --> 00:14:59,560
Can you reprimand
him please?

250
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:02,589
- How do you
know it was me?

251
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,666
- It's always you.

252
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:04,943
- Are you gonna
discipline him or not?

253
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:07,312
Ooh, discipline, kinky!

254
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,035
All right, here’s
the deal, you guys.

255
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:14,481
The thing about a practical joke, is that you have
to know when to start, as well as when to stop!

256
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:22,440
And yeah, Jim, now is the time to stop
putting Dwight’s personal effects into jello.

257
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:29,273
OK, Dwight, I’m sorry, because
I’ve always been your biggest *flan*

258
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:35,082
Nice! That’s the
way it is around here.

259
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:38,699
You should have put
him in custard-y!

260
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,524
Yes, new guy!

261
00:15:41,878 --> 00:15:43,404
He scores!

262
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:45,062
OK that’s great, I guess,

263
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:46,856
what I’m most
concerned with is...

264
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:48,756
damage to
company property.

265
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:50,383
That’s all.

266
00:15:54,678 --> 00:15:57,271
Pudding... putting...

267
00:15:57,664 --> 00:16:00,925
I’m trying to think of
another dessert to do.

268
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:05,309
Do you like going out at
the end of a week for a drink?

269
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:06,735
Yeah!

270
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:10,214
Well, that’s why we're all going out, so
we can have an end-of-the-week drink.

271
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:11,340
Well, then when
are we going out?

272
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,702
I don’t know,
tonight, hopefully.

273
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:14,369
OK, yeah.

274
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:17,757
Hey, man.

275
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:18,302
Hey!

276
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,131
What’s going on?

277
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,849
Hey baby!

278
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:24,310
Roy is my fiancé, we’ve
been engaged about...

279
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:29,149
about 3 years, and we were supposed
to get married in September,

280
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:32,222
but I think we’re gonna
get married in the spring

281
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:35,996
Do you mind if I go out
for a drink with these guys?

282
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:40,232
No, come on. Let’s get
out of here and go home.

283
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:43,813
OK, I'm gonna be a few minutes,

284
00:16:44,414 --> 00:16:47,738
It's only twenty past five, I’ve
still got to do my faxes.

285
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,622
You know what, you
should come with us,

286
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:56,818
because we're all going out and
it could be a good chance for you to

287
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,334
see what people are like outside
the office, I think it could be fun

288
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:04,140
No, it sounds good but
seriously we gotta get going

289
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,739
Yeah, yeah.

290
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:18,669
What's in the bag?

291
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:20,968
Just tell her I'll
talk to her later.

292
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:24,229
No, definitely, all right
dude, awesome, will do.

293
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:32,526
Do I think I’ll be
invited to the wedding?

294
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,533
So, have you
felt the vibe yet?

295
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,259
We work hard,
we play hard.

296
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:47,019
Sometimes we play hard when we
should be working hard, right?

297
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:53,112
I guess the atmosphere that I've
created here is that I am a friend first,

298
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,663
and a boss second.

299
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,601
Probably an
entertainer third.

300
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:58,380
Just a second!

301
00:17:58,973 --> 00:17:59,685
Right?

302
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:05,078
Oh, hey do you like the
Jamie Kennedy Experiment?

303
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:05,385
Yeah

304
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,066
Punk'd, and all
that kind of stuff?

305
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,648
You are going to be my accomplice,
just go along with it, OK?

306
00:18:10,678 --> 00:18:10,963
All right

307
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,377
Just follow my lead,
don’t pimp me all right?

308
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:14,291
Come in!

309
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:17,473
So corporate just said
that I don’t want to…

310
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:17,810
You got a fax.

311
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,863
Oh, thank you, Pam.

312
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,985
Pam? Can you come
in here for a sec?

313
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:25,792
Just have a seat, I was gonna
call you in anyway... You know Ryan?

314
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:30,724
As you know, there is
going to be downsizing

315
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:35,318
and you have made my
life so much easier,

316
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:39,792
in that I’m going to
have to let you go first

317
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:41,656
What? Why?

318
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:45,197
Why? Well, theft,
and stealing

319
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:46,438
Stealing?

320
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,261
What am I supposed
to have stolen?

321
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,942
Post-It notes.

322
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:53,221
Post-It notes...?

323
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,311
What are those worth,
like 50 cents?

324
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:59,052
You steal 1000 Post-It
notes at 50 cents apiece,

325
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:02,597
And, you know, you’ve
made a profit... margin.

326
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,495
You know... gonna run us
out of business, Pam.

327
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,862
- Are you serious?

328
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:09,207
- Yeah.

329
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:13,245
I can’t believe
this, I mean,

330
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:17,526
I have never even stolen as much as
a paper clip and now you're firing me.

331
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,444
And the best thing
about it is that

332
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:23,615
we are not gonna have to
give you any severance pay,

333
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:28,096
because that is
gross misconduct, and…

334
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:31,322
Just clean out your
desk. I’m sorry.

335
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,073
You’ve been X'd, punk!

336
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,165
Surprise! It’s a joke, we
were joking around, you see?

337
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:59,421
OK, he was in on it, he
was my accomplice, and

338
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,165
There was, it was kind of a
morale booster thing, and...

339
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:08,465
We were showing the new guy around,
kind of giving him the feel of the place, so…

340
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:11,719
God, you were, we
totally got you…

341
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:13,093
You’re a jerk!

342
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:16,636
Well, I don’t
know about that.

343
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:34,866
What is the most important
thing for a company?

344
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,967
Is it the cash flow?
Is it the inventory?

345
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:43,044
Nah-uh, it’s the people.

346
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,270
The people.

347
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:50,206
My proudest moment here was not
when I increased profits by 17%,

348
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,515
or when I cut expenses without
losing a single employee.

349
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:55,894
No, no, no, no.

350
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:58,942
It was a young
Guatemalan guy.

351
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:02,094
First job in the country,
barely spoke English,

352
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:04,340
Came to me and said:

353
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,034
"Mr. Scott,

354
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:11,895
would you be the
Godfather of my child?"

355
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:24,159
Didn't work out in the end. We
had to let him go. He sucked.

356
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,463
Hey.

357
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:33,555
Hey, how are you?

358
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:36,291
Good, I thought you were
going out for a drink with…

359
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,689
Oh, no, no, just
decided not to, uh...

360
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:41,640
How’s your headache?

361
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,367
It's better, thanks.

362
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:45,726
Good, good, that's great.

363
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:48,897
Are you...

364
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,664
Am I walking out?

365
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:51,497
Yes.

366
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:53,658
Yes. Do you wanna... ?

367
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:54,599
Yeah.

368
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:55,706
Great, let me just...

369
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,211
Oh, Roy.

370
00:21:58,213 --> 00:22:00,535
Yeah, listen, have
a nice weekend!

371
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:03,828
Yeah, definitely,
you too! Enjoy it.

372
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:19,118
You know what, just...
Come here.

373
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,498
WORLD'S BEST BOSS
