1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,425
She's the star of the play,
and she's my girlfriend.

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,553
I get to have sex with the star
of the play!

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:16,599
- People can hear you.
- I know!

4
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,401
She looks great, doesn't she?

5
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:32,241
That is one good-looking man.

6
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:38,413
Is it just me, or can you actually
see his abs through his overcoat?

7
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,375
So, you been doing this long?

8
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:47,464
No. You're my first.
Put the money on the table.

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,303
That's nice.

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,349
Dude!

11
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,190
- Is that an expensive blouse?
- If you want it to be.

12
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,655
Here's your girlfriend's button.

13
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,701
The One with Rachel's Crush

14
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,877
Do you still have your
old dresses from high school?

15
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,546
I think I have some. Why?

16
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,425
Maternity clothes are so expensive.

17
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:20,098
Rach, I made a pile of your stuff.
If you could just...

18
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,809
...throw your purses at it.

19
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,105
Bloomingdale's eliminated
my department.

20
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,773
Are you out of a job?

21
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:32,694
They stuck me in Personal Shopping,
which is a huge step down.

22
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:33,988
What is that?

23
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:39,535
Where you walk around with rich people
and tell them what to buy?

24
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,205
That sounds great!

25
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:51,379
We switched apartments. You can't eat
our food. That gravy train has ended.

26
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,091
There's gravy?

27
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,344
In the big apartment,
you deal with people coming over.

28
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:03,016
That fridge has to be stocked.
That's your apartment now.

29
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:09,481
- What are you doing?
- I left a donut up here.

30
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,280
How was Kathy's play?

31
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,994
Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex
with a real good-looking guy.

32
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,955
It was like somebody wrote down
my worst nightmare...

33
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,834
...and then charged me $32 to see it.

34
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,336
That's a good idea for a business.

35
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:35,466
I'm screwed.
They'll be hot and heavy on stage...

36
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:39,470
...then go to their parties,
and he'll try to undermine me.

37
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,224
He'll be like, "Where's
your boyfriend Chester?"

38
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:48,269
She'll go, "It's Chandler."
He'll go, "Whatever!"

39
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,566
That is a good trick.

40
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,611
All right, look.
What am I going to do?

41
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,822
They're actors.
They're there to do a job.

42
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,324
It doesn't mean
they'll get together.

43
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,411
So it happened with
Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins.

44
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,247
That doesn't mean it'll happen
with them.

45
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,208
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

46
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,671
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

47
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,299
Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

48
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,259
They're not a couple.

49
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,805
I get the game now.

50
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,978
When they were doing it on stage,
was it like really hot?

51
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,356
So you're fine.

52
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,820
The rule is when two actors
are actually doing it off stage...

53
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,282
...then all the sexual tension is gone.

54
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:45,703
As long as it's hot on stage,
you got nothing to worry about.

55
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:50,082
When the heat goes away,
you're in trouble.

56
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:56,296
You've been to my plays.
Have I ever had chemistry on stage?

57
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,179
You going to see
the play with me tonight?

58
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:09,893
I don't know how comfortable I am, going
to see how hot the sex is between them.

59
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,977
I know...

60
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,814
No, I'm there.

61
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,568
- Want some pancakes?
- You made pancakes?

62
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,697
Grab a plate.

63
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,950
Stay right there.

64
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,330
Getting closer.

65
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,581
Don't worry...

66
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,709
...we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles and...

67
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,381
...jams, jellies and marmalades,
which I'm sure are the same thing.

68
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:43,844
We're watching the game here Saturday,
if people want to come over.

69
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,096
I wanted to have people over.

70
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,850
Yeah? Who's playing?

71
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,936
The players.

72
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:57,900
Somebody seems to be missing
being the hostess.

73
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,572
It's a relief, is what it is,
is what it is.

74
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,408
Pheebs, your plate.

75
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,166
I'm quitting.

76
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:19,338
I just helped an old woman put on
a thong, and she didn't even buy it.

77
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,964
I'm quitting.

78
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,676
I'm talking to my boss right now.

79
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,803
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

80
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,598
Call me when you get this message.

81
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,309
Mr. Waltham?
I need to talk to you.

82
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,145
A moment. I'm in the middle of a task.

83
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,274
And you have a customer.

84
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,945
I'm Joshua.

85
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,240
Rachel Greene.
What can I do for you?

86
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,869
I need a new wardrobe. My wife...
Well, my ex-wife...

87
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:55,332
I'm so sorry.

88
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,254
Anyway, she burned all my clothes.

89
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:05,384
I got away with this suit
and what turned out to be a skirt.

90
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,512
Well, at least that's a great suit.

91
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:13,850
It was no fun
at the dry cleaners in the skirt.

92
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:20,858
I need everything down to underwear.
If you're willing, I'm all yours.

93
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,735
You needed to speak to me?

94
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:27,239
No, no, that wasn't me.

95
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,953
Let's get started.
Let me show you my underwear.

96
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,833
Our selection of underwear.

97
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,128
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,382
- It's this way.
- This way? Sorry.

99
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,264
Right? There was
no chemistry between them.

100
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,726
Before, they had heat.
Now there's none.

101
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,062
You know what this means.
Joey told us.

102
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:04,068
Let's not jump to any conclusions.
There was some sexual chemistry.

103
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,988
It was like cousins having sex.

104
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:15,454
Here she comes. Don't say a word.
Just be cool. Don't be you.

105
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,082
Hey, you guys!

106
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,709
Thank you so much for coming again.

107
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,337
- Did you like it?
- Absolutely.

108
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:29,384
Wasn't Nick funny when
he couldn't get his match lit?

109
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,348
It's a good play, isn't it?

110
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,893
I loved the play.
You were great.

111
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,438
And Nick, ditto.

112
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,859
Clearly, you're having sex with him.

113
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,494
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?

114
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,706
It was obvious.
There was no chemistry between you.

115
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:05,254
You're accusing me of cheating,
and you're insulting my performance?

116
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:10,426
I can see how this could happen.
You're up there every night, kissing.

117
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,637
Acting. Chandler, this is my job.

118
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,474
I'm playing a part.
How can you not trust me?

119
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:22,229
You can understand,
given how we started.

120
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,648
I can't believe you'd
throw that in my face.

121
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,693
I don't even see you denying this.

122
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,989
I'll tell you what.
Call me when you grow up.

123
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,952
Don't expect that to happen
any time soon!

124
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,167
I have the best job
in the entire world!

125
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:49,131
The most adorable guy came over,
and I got to dress him up all day!

126
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,925
Rachel has a new doll!

127
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:55,471
I wish he was. I'd get a Rachel
doll and bump them together...

128
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,390
...and make kissing noises.

129
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,688
He's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized! Joshua.

130
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,656
What do I smell?

131
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:18,452
I don't know. It smells good.

132
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,876
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven.

133
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,420
Please have some.

134
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,091
I've been fiddling around,
making delicious treats.

135
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,593
The new "Playboy".

136
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,595
Just something I picked up.

137
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:41,600
Cookies and porn?
You're the best mom ever!

138
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:46,980
What?

139
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:52,278
Something Joshua said about
V-necks, but you had to be there.

140
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,655
How does Jason look in a V-neck?

141
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:59,118
- It's Joshua.
- Whatever.

142
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,038
Wait. Wait. This isn't take-out!

143
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,166
- Hate to eat and run.
- Please don't go!

144
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,960
I've got porn for you too.

145
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,714
I don't need it.

146
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,091
People are supposed
to hang out here.

147
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,134
Why? What's the big deal?

148
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,762
I'm the hostess.

149
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,806
Not those guys.
I'm always the hostess.

150
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:26,186
When I was little, the girls
brought their dollies to my tea party.

151
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,105
I served the best air.

152
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:33,527
Why make a big thing out of everyone
hanging out in the big apartment?

153
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,780
They took our apartment.
I wanted to punish them.

154
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,659
I'm done now. They've suffered enough.

155
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,454
You should have just
made them hang out here.

156
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,956
That's true.

157
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,000
This place will be 10 times
better than that place.

158
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,921
Are we going
to trash their place?

159
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,466
Steps!

160
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,761
Slut!

161
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,519
You'll all be very happy to hear
that Kathy's sleeping with that guy!

162
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,437
- What?
- You were right?

163
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:14,818
I confronted her,
and she didn't deny it.

164
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,905
I don't live here!

165
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,576
Wait, are you sure?

166
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,579
I may be drunk,
but I know what she said.

167
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:30,250
Then I went over
to Beefsteak Chewley's...

168
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,919
- Beefsteak Charlie's?
- Yes!

169
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,924
You and I
have always been...

170
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,985
- Do you need help?
- I got it.

171
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:00,280
I just feel bad. I never vacuum.

172
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:07,287
I was with Joshua for an hour today,
and he has not asked me out.

173
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:10,041
- It's so frustrating.
- Ask him out.

174
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,959
Totally. That's such a turn-on.

175
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,421
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?

176
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,716
That's the turn-on.

177
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:22,553
He just got a divorce.
He's probably nervous around women.

178
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,014
Just make the first move.

179
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:28,893
- I've never asked a guy out.
- You've never asked a guy out?

180
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,143
No, have you?

181
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:33,939
Thousands of times!

182
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,942
That doesn't make me
sound too good, does it?

183
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,444
I don't even know
how I would go about it.

184
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:43,324
What I do is, I look a woman
up and down and I say...

185
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:48,913
..."Hey. How you doing?"

186
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,583
Oh, please!

187
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,794
How you doing?

188
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:03,802
I'm going to do that.
I'm going to call and ask him out.

189
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,763
I can do that. Ask him out.

190
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:10,559
"How you doing?"

191
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,898
It's Rachel Greene, from Bloomingdale's.

192
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,986
I was just wondering if you...

193
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:28,369
...left your wallet
at the store today?

194
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,497
We found a wallet, and we...

195
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:35,668
The license? Oh, that is a good idea.

196
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:39,296
Well, let's see.
This license belongs to...

197
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:45,135
...belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.

198
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,811
Sorry to bother you at home.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

199
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:58,399
- You've done that 1,000 times?
- I've never done that.

200
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,985
I just got so nervous that he'd say no.

201
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:04,613
You got to give him something
he can't say no to.

202
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:08,658
Invite him to a Knicks game.
You're guaranteed he'll say yes.

203
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:13,539
- Really?
- Absolutely, and if not, can I go?

204
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,127
What the heck is that?

205
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,516
Did she call?

206
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,311
No. Sorry.

207
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,646
Maybe I should call her.

208
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,190
Forget her, man. You don't need her.

209
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,901
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.

210
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:46,237
Well, yeah, but you know,
what if I was wrong?

211
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,115
How might you be wrong?

212
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,243
What if she didn't actually
sleep with the guy?

213
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,995
Tell me she told you this.

214
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,415
She didn't have to.
I saw the play. There was no heat.

215
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,584
- Back me up.
- That's your basis?

216
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,586
That's not backing me up!

217
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:04,423
Look, you said,
with the offstage and the heat...

218
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:08,969
That was just a theory.
A lot of theories didn't pan out.

219
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:14,391
Lone gunman, communism, geometry.

220
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,186
Oh, my God!

221
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:22,816
"Would you like to go
to a basketball game with..."

222
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:28,196
"It's funny, basketball,
because I happen to have tickets..."

223
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,703
"Who likes the Knicks?"

224
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,582
What do you think?

225
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:44,129
Well, as a single woman,
who is available...

226
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:48,008
...I think you look great.

227
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,972
Oh, yeah, you look great.

228
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,353
This looks great.

229
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:01,730
So you like it?

230
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,233
I do. I love it.
In fact, I think I'll wear it home.

231
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:09,780
- Great.
- Thank you so much for all your help.

232
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,492
Well, I guess this is it.

233
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,826
Thanks.

234
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,830
I'll see you in the spring
for the bathing suits.

235
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,041
You don't want to do that now?

236
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,001
That's okay.

237
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,212
I'll see you around sometime.

238
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,256
Basketball!

239
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,134
Sorry?

240
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,679
I have two tickets
to the Knicks game tonight...

241
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,892
...just as a thank-you for this week.

242
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,186
That would be great!

243
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,521
- Really?
- That would be fantastic!

244
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:48,443
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks!

245
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:52,072
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Rachel.

246
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:55,158
Good morning.

247
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:08,172
I just wanted to come over
to say that I'm sorry.

248
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,175
I acted like the biggest idiot
in the world.

249
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:15,596
I can completely understand
why you were so upset.

250
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,557
I wish you'd called me.

251
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,518
Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.

252
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,104
I think this is a good thing.

253
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,232
We've had our first fight,
and now we can move on.

254
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:31,444
I know for me, but...

255
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,703
Nick's pants?

256
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:47,669
I think our second fight
is going to be a big one!

257
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,803
- For next time, what do you say?
- "I have an extra ticket."

258
00:18:56,053 --> 00:19:00,808
"An extra ticket."
Not "two tickets".

259
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:06,855
The first time you asked a guy out
he turned you down?

260
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,401
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game.

261
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:14,029
I got the date.
I'm just not on it.

262
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,326
Okay, it's ready.

263
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,535
Come on.

264
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:21,996
What's ready?

265
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,623
Just come.

266
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,879
Oh, my God!

267
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,006
This is beautiful!

268
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:37,678
Did you work for two days straight?

269
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,139
Pretty much.

270
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,600
What do you think of the floor?

271
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,977
I don't know.
Looks the same.

272
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,147
You used to have carpet.

273
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,650
I made snacks.

274
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,110
Please, just hang out.

275
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,781
I'm going to rest my eyes
for just a bit.

276
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,617
Do you want us to come back later?

277
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:04,121
No, no, no. Stay.
Just keep talking.

278
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:09,084
I'm always the hostess.

279
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,504
How'd it go?

280
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,130
- She wasn't sleeping with him.
- Good!

281
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,801
She is now.

282
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:24,015
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

283
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:28,103
You know a person, then they
turn around and sleep with Nick.

284
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:33,191
Nick and his rock-hard pecs
and his giant man-nipples.

285
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,654
I hate him.
And I hate her.

286
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:42,576
I don't hate her. I love her.
This is all my fault.

287
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,829
How? How is it your fault?

288
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,122
I should have called.

289
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:50,917
If I'd called her, she never
would have gone out with Nick.

290
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:57,341
They wouldn't have ended up in bed.
I threw her at his man-nipples!

291
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,801
This is not your fault.

292
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:06,183
Your fight does not
justify her sleeping with someone.

293
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:10,980
Well, if she thought
they were on a break...

294
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:22,491
One of your customers left
his billfold. A Joshua Burgen.

295
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:28,288
- Will you call him?
- Yes, I will. Absolutely.

296
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,719
Hello, Rachel.

297
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,847
Hi, Joshua.

298
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:48,809
- I left my wallet here on purpose.
- Really?

299
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,311
I just wanted to see you again.

300
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:53,773
Oh, I'm glad.

301
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:58,527
Rachel, I'd like to say
something to you.

302
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,906
How you doing?
