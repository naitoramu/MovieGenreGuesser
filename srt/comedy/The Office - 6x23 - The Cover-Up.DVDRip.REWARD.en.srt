00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:11,632
Hello, Dunder Mifflin.

4
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,144
No, no, no. No.

00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,874
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

6
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,576
I believe that every man,
woman, and child in this country

7
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,084
should learn how
to speak Spanish.

8
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:24,419
They are our neighbors to the south,
and this would be a healing thing

9
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,251
for all of North America.

10
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,861
And I am going on vacation
next week to Cancún.

(GREETING IN GERMAN)

17
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,272
I don't understand why Michael
is wasting his time with Spanish.

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,784
I have it on very good
authority that within 20 years,

19
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,286
everyone will be
speaking German.

20
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:57,781
Or a Chinese-German hybrid.

21

(CORRECTING IN SPANISH)

23
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:07,029
Michael's having a hard time
with the gender part of Spanish.

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,658
So, I told him
to mark everything

25
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,260
with the international
symbol for gender.

26
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,497
And...

27
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,241
I should have been
more specific.

28
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,776
Your office is full
of genitalia.

29
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,307
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

30
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,773
"That's what he says"?

31
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,078
Damn it.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

32
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,818
Ah, Angelo!

33
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:27,978
Angela.

34
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,947
Michael.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

(SCOFFS)

36
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:01,144
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing
and then you go into delivery guarantees.

37
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,713
You know, maybe there's an
opportunity for a joke there, like...

38
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,259
Like, "I just
delivered a baby.

39
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,251
"They didn't offer
me a guarantee."

40
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,525
Yeah. Maybe we don't
even need that.

41
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,693
Can you smell the power?
Halperts, power couple.

42
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,632
You know what? I should be
getting this client, Michael.

43
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,262
My numbers are better
than either of theirs.

44
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,274
I went with the people I thought
would put the best face on the company.

45
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,742
If you want people to put
the best face on something,

46
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,835
why would you
get two people

47
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,814
who probably have never cut the
face off of anything in their lives?

48
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:30,872
It's a good point.

49
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,251
This is our first
joint sales pitch.

50
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,809
I think we're gonna work
really well together.

51
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,755
Yeah. I think we have
complementary strengths.

52
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,813
We understand
each other.

53
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,723
We have good
give and take.

54
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,420
I give, he takes!

55
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,122
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

(EXCLAIMS)

57
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,466
Hi. Donna Newton.
Here to see Michael Scott.

58
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,705
Hey, Miss Newton. Hi.
I'm Jim. How are you?

59
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,177
Did somebody order
a hooker over here?

60
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,270
Stop that. Hi.

61
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,644
Hi. How are you?

62
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,750
There's this woman
I met a few weeks ago.

63
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:08,275
Her name is Donna. Manager
of a Sid and Dexter's.

64
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,455
And right now, we're in the
midst of a passionate love affair.

65
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,654
No, but she is coming by today,
maybe to buy some printers, so...

66
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,833
Right here, we have the wonder
twins, Jim and Pam Halpert.

67
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,529
They will be
assisting you today.

68
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,595
You look exactly alike.

69
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,106
No, we're
actually married.

70
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,436
We're not
brother and sister.

71
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,374
I have a sense about
these things. All right.

72
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:35,676
You have some ancestors
in common somewhere back.

73
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,543
I knew it. You should see their baby.

74
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:44,450
So, yes, laser printers are more
expensive, but they cost less to operate,

75
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,718
so it's a trade-off.

76
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,521
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

77
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,454
Little time sensitive. Do
you, Donna, by any chance

78
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,054
shop at Victoria's Secret?
What?

79
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,294
Because I keep getting
these magazines sent to me

80
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,866
via the address of the woman who
used to live in my condo before me.

81
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,201
None of this
is time sensitive.

82
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,708
Yes, the sale's on
now through May.

83
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,868
Oh, yeah, thank you.

84
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,343
Okay. I have more of them.

85
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,314
You would have weekly conference
calls with executives in corporate,

86
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,250
a two week training program at
the Yale School of Management.

87
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,085
Obviously you would be high on the
list for advancement opportunities.

88
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,214
Sounds all right.

89
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,451
What is this?

90
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,049
This is Print
In All Colors,

91
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,994
Sabre's minority
executive training program.

92
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,361
(SCOFFS) It doesn't just sound
"aite," it sounds amazing.

93
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,763
I didn't say "aite."

94
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,062
How do I apply?

95
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,727
You have to be a minority.

96
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,572
Glasses wearers,
cholera survivors,

97
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,871
geniuses, non-organic family
farmers. The list goes on and on.

98
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,376
You want me to keep going?
Those don't really count.

99
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,470
We're thinking more ethnic
and racial minorities.

100
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,742
Come here. Come here.

101
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,314
Ten seconds ago this guy
was driving a forklift, okay?

102
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:52,222
Now, all of a sudden, he's Cinderella of
the office? What are you guys thinking?

103
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,516
I like the sound of this.

104
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,562
Maybe one day I'll be
sitting in Michael's chair.

105
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,359
Wouldn't that be something?

106
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,333
<i>DWIGHT: One minority from this branch
is going to get into this program.</i>

107
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,559
Who would I prefer? Hmm.

108
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,698
The competent hardworking one
who does things his own way,

109
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:13,479
or the malleable simpleton who can
be bought for a few fashion magazines?

110
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,014
This is the second time that
you've sent me the wrong size.

111
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,482
I mean, I know what
a four should feel like.

112
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,041
I've been a four
my whole life.

113
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,418
You know what? You can go to hell,
all right? Thanks for nothing.

114
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,583
Oh, man.
White people, right?

115
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,717
I don't know
if she was white.

116
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,087
Well, you can kind of
tell from their voice.

117
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,255
Yeah.

118
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,596
I bet you get pulled over by the
cops a lot just because of your race.

119
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,500
Well, they say it's because of
texting, but maybe you're right.

120
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,597
I think you should consider applying for
the executive minority training program.

121
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,835
I never thought of myself
as an executive before.

122
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,810
I know, 'cause you
have no role models.

123
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,608
How many Indian CEOs
can you think of?

124
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,808
I can't think of
any CEOs, any race.

125
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,181
You could be
the Indian Bill Gates.

126
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,578
You could be
the Indian Ted Turner.

127
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,816
I could be
the Indian Julia Roberts.

128
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,559
That's not... She's...
Okay. Yes.

129
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:09,025
I took the liberty to scan a few things
earlier, and I want to show you...

130
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,663
There we go! Look at those
vivid colors. Look at my eyes.

131
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,670
Those are
Shrek-green eyes.

132
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:19,303
That is me again. I think this
displays the crisp, dazzling white.

133
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,841
And that would
be a display

134
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,040
of the crisp,
gorgeous black.

135
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,208
DONNA: Yeah.

136
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,544
It's subtle.
It's how it works.

137
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,783
<i>I show her an image
that turns her on,</i>

138
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,847
<i>and then she looks at me,
then she looks at the image,</i>

139
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,289
<i>then back at me,
then back at the image.</i>

140
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,328
<i>Soon she doesn't know what
is me, what is the image,</i>

141
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,421
she just knows
that she's turned on.

142
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,828
This is a place that I like to
go to be alone with my thoughts.

143
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,530
I've never taken
anybody there before.

144
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,696
Who took the photo?
Ryan.

145
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:48,798
Oh.

146
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,865
And that's it.

147
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,172
That's me.
That's who I am.

148
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,941
Not bad.

149
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,484
Oh, thanks.

150
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,519
You're not bad, either.

151
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,747
Thank you.

152
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,187
(CLEARING THROAT)

153
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,022
Oh, my God.

154
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,395
Jim, could you come
in here for a sec?

155
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,999
What was that printer
we were looking at?

156
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,938
You didn't see it, Pam.

157
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,632
She was giving me all sorts of signals
that she wanted me to make a move.

158
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,767
Shortbread?
No.

159
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,277
I'll have one.

160
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,779
Well, maybe you shouldn't
try to kiss people at work.

161
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,282
Oh, really, Jim?
What about Pam?

162
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,341
And you did a heck
of a lot more than kiss.

163
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,750
Maybe this could
be my Pam.

164
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,311
Okay, well,
all that is irrelevant...

165
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,414
Maybe Michael
has a point.

166
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:42,785
I mean, if she was really that
upset, she wouldn't still be here.

167
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,197
Was it professional? No.

168
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,694
But I work in the nightlife
industry. I get hit on all the time.

169
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,897
In my 20s,
it would've been annoying.

170
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,031
In my late 20s,
I find it really flattering.

171
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,776
Look, I know that
I screwed up in there.

172
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,539
I know that I probably
messed up your sale.

173
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,079
I just want to go
in and fix it.

174
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,672
What if I back out and you
finish the pitch with Jim?

175
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,841
What?

176
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,178
What was that?
Just let him flirt with her.

177
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,187
People meet each
other all sorts of ways.

178
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,190
Pam, you know he's not gonna get
anywhere and he's gonna blow our sale.

179
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,657
Who cares?
It's not that huge a sale.

180
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,820
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat
every sale like it was a huge sale.

181
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,263
Don't act like you understood
anything that guy said.

182
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,563
Good luck, wingman.

183
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,832
How has being
a minority affected you?

184
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,466
Well, there's a lot of
pressure from my parents

185
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,875
to settle down
and marry an Indian guy.

186
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,277
Oh, good. And you
resent this because...

187
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,977
Indian guys always wear their cell
phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.

188
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:43,715
No, no, no. That's not dorky. Look,
it's easily accessible. Boom. Like this.

189
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,581
911, hello. Scranton
Strangler's in the house.

190
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,286
Inside the house!

191
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,060
Just put it
in your pocket.

192
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,596
(CHATTERING)

193
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,862
Look at that. She's
totally flirting with him.

194
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,835
You don't know that. Some people
can't help oozing sexuality.

195
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,906
You ever notice you can
only ooze two things?

196
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,944
Sexuality and pus.
Man, I tell you.

197
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,811
She just crossed her
arms together. That's bad.

198
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:13,215
Maybe she's just pushing her breasts
together to make them look bigger.

199
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,949
Like that?

200
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,459
Is this the best
you can do right now?

201
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,926
For that printer, yes.

202
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,563
Unfortunately we don't
have a lot of flexibility.

203
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:29,397
Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used
to the restaurant business where,

204
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,198
if you're in charge then
you can always get discounts

205
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,465
for the people
that you like.

206
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,801
JIM: Yeah.

207
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,935
Maybe we can find
a little wiggle room, right?

208
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,034
What's that?

209
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,703
Maybe we can find some
wiggle room. (SIGHING)

210
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,940
I don't...
I don't think so.

211
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,879
I think we could.

212
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,447
I don't see how we could possibly sell
these for that little without losing money.

213
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,012
Delivery alone will cost...

214
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,318
Okay, well, sometimes,

215
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:57,590
sometimes it makes financial sense to
lose money, right? Like, for tax purposes.

216
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,924
Actually, I ran the numbers
on this, and in this case,

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,763
it makes more financial
sense to gain money.

218
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,859
Why don't you
run them again?

219
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,234
What if she's just flirting
with you to get a better price?

220
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,465
If she is,
it's working.

221
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,476
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick.
Ask her if she wants a mint.

222
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,812
If she says no, then
she is not interested.

223
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,712
She does not like him.

224
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,482
You can flirt with someone to get what
you want and also be attracted to them.

225
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,920
How do you think
we got together?

226
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,753
'Cause I stopped by your
desk, like, 15 times a day.

227
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,656
I was after your money.

228
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,921
Well, the joke was on you.

229
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,360
Yes, it was.

230
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,763
Can you stop
micromanaging?

231
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,663
I know how to do this.
You're yelling... Okay. Okay.

232
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,723
What are you guys doing?

233
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,530
This girl was really rude
to me at the mall,

234
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,504
so I created a fake IM account
from a hot guy at her high school,

235
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,006
and now I'm trying
to make her anorexic.

236
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,304
Tell her everyone in
homeroom thinks she's fat.

237
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,401
KELLY: That is so good.

238
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,571
You know, we really should keep
practicing for this interview.

239
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,114
Oh, that's okay.
Ryan coached me.

240
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,046
Ryan? What does he know?

241
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,176
It's easy. You just turn
every question around on them.

242
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,049
Do you think you're treated
differently because of your race?

243
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,783
Would you ask that same
question if I was white?

244
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,552
We're so in.
We?

245
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,392
When I become executive,
I'm gonna make Ryan manager.

246
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,294
And then the two of us
are cleaning house.

247
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,922
<i>DWIGHT: Kelly will be
even worse than Darryl.</i>

248
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,394
If you'd have told
me this morning

249
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:13,199
that today I'd be creating a monster
capable of my own destruction,

250
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:17,174
I'd have thought you were referring to the
bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.

251
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:22,244
"So, corporate approval of this contract
is contingent upon buyer and seller

252
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,147
"obtaining..."
Blah-de-blah-de-blah.

253
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,482
"Boilerplate, pound
of fish." Just kidding.

254
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,456
Do you like mints?
Yes.

255
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,355
I carry mints
with me sometimes.

256
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,620
Oh, I haven't
tried those.

257
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,718
Ever tried those?
No.

258
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:36,819
They're good.

259
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:37,920
You want one?

260
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,029
Sure.
It's like...

261
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:46,199
"Cool... Certified cool." I
like how they say "certified."

262
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,039
Like there's some
consortium of...

263
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,536
Michael!

264
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,772
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,381
I can't stop myself
from kissing her.

266
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,511
Yeah. Now you know how I feel
sitting next to those M&M's all day.

267
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,320
Well, why don't you
just move the M&M's?

268
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,822
Why don't you shut up?

269
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,020
Okay. Guys, guys, guys, just tell me it's
not totally insane to try one more time.

270
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,119
It is totally insane.

271
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,721
Michael, he's right. You
are turning into a stalker.

272
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,629
(SIGHING) Okay.
What do you think?

273
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,365
I think it's over, man.

274
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:17,794
Andy?

275
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,127
(GROANING)

276
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,264
Okay, some for,
some against.

277
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,364
Nobody's for.

278
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,499
Pam.
Hmm?

279
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,668
What do you think?

280
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,673
I think it's really,
really unlikely.

281
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,771
Okay.

282
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,440
Really unlikely.

283
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,741
But I can't say
that it's impossible.

284
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,012
What?

285
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,177
I'm not saying
she's in love with him,

286
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,587
but she could have
left a while ago.

287
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:42,058
Most printer sales are done
over the phone, Miss Boob Shirt.

288
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,821
I'm going
with Pam's group.

289
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,830
Wait. Michael.

290
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,364
Okay.
Michael. Michael.

291
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,393
No. Guys, guys, guys, guys,
just thank you for talking.

292
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,300
Wish me luck.
JIM: No.

293
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,474
<i>What sort of movie would Rudy
have been if he had just stopped</i>

294
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,978
and given up
after two rejections?

295
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,279
Would have been a lot shorter,
probably been a lot funnier,

296
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,617
but it would have ultimately
been a disappointment.

297
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:15,522
I still would have seen it,
but that's not the point.

298
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,795
Kelly is disqualified.
What?

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,991
You said the program
is not open to Caucasians.

300
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:26,902
Well, anthropologically,
she is Indian.

301
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,100
Indians migrated from the
Caucasus region of Europe.

302
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,509
Therefore, technically, she is
Caucasian. You're welcome, America.

303
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,069
Yeah, but she's
not white, though.

304
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,547
Well, obviously
she's brownish,

305
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,585
but come on. I mean,
Darryl is far more ethnic.

306
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,450
Darryl withdrew
his application.

307
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:47,356
The dates of the Yale program interfered
with his softball league, so he's gone.

308
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,687
I got my whole life
to be a minority executive.

309
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,425
I only have about a year
left in these knees, though.

310
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,499
So Kelly is
the only applicant.

311
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,559
Yeah, unless somebody
else applies today.

312
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,864
(GREETING IN HINDl)

313
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,568
Oh, dear God. Okay.

314
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,808
Don't make any decisions just
yet. Okay? I'll be right back.

315
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,542
Hello.

316
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,108
That's very nice. I
never noticed that before.

317
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,813
Sometimes my bangs cover it.

318
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:20,154
Yeah. I don't want to be offensive,
but may I ask you what that means?

319
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,750
I do find that offensive,
actually.

320
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,722
We should have your
contract done by Thursday.

321
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,158
Oh, great! Great. I will
look out for that stuff, then.

322
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,726
Okay.
And...

323
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,698
You know, I just wanted to say it was
really, really nice to do business with you.

324
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,642
Yeah. It was nice to do
business with you, too.

325
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,043
Thank you.

326
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,906
Did I get everything?

327
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,041
I don't know.

328
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,209
I think so.

329
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,343
Yeah, I think so.

330
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,179
Okay.

331
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,883
So... Oh! Donna?
DONNA: Yeah.

332
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,621
Do you need validation?
We don't validate.

333
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,855
No. It's just
in the lot, so...

334
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,056
Thank you so much.

335
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,862
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

336
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,495
Mmm.

337
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,896
Bye.

338
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,933
(CLEARING THROAT)
So, if you have...

339
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,911
If there's any other
questions that you have...

340
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,642
I don't have any
other questions.

341
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,917
I'm just gonna make
my way down to...

342
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,511
MICHAEL: Okay.
All right. Bye.

343
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,715
DONNA: Bye-bye.

344
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,087
Have a good elevator ride.

345
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,182
DONNA: Okay.

346
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,428
What's that out there?

347
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,968
Michael,
how did it go?

348
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,800
How would one of you feel if I told
you I could put you on a fast track

349
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,141
to an executive position
at this company?

350
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,237
Holy cow.
I'd be so happy.

351
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,880
I wasn't talking to you,
pale face.

352
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,781
I know. I meant
I'd be happy for them.

353
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:57,049
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet
train straight to middle management.

354
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,352
Dwight, I know
these programs.

355
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:03,521
Every color is important, because
together we make a rainbow.

356
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,686
Yes.

357
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,060
I'll slap you in the
face with a rainbow.

358
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,496
Mmm.

359
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:12,433
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar, you
are kind of a double minority.

360
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,363
Gay.

361
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,170
So, we at Sabre could really
benefit from your perspective.

362
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,472
Dwight, we know
Kelly applied.

363
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,215
We're not going to cross her, no
matter how good the program is.

364
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,648
I can protect
you from Kelly.

365
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,707
(SCOFFS)

366
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,446
Will you get out
of here? Seriously.

367
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:32,451
For hobbies, yoga,
belly dancing,

368
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,318
snake-charming, beds of
nails, I like lying...

369
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,888
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
This is Hidetosha Hacigawa.

370
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,695
He would like to apply for the Sabre
Minority Executive Training Program,

371
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,996
Print In All
Colors initiative.

372
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,400
Dwight, what
are you doing?

373
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,066
Helping heal America in a dramatic
fashion in the eleventh hour.

374
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,075
God, I hate you so much.

375
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,906
Caucasians.
Am I right?

376
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,473
Have a seat.
I'll translate.

377
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,071
Why? I don't
need translator...

378
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,743
You don't know
what you need, just...

379
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,446
Why don't you tell me
a little about yourself, Hide.

380
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,216
(SPEAKING ENGLISH)

381
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,686
(SIGHING)

382
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,841
Hey, Michael,
how you doing?

383
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,106
I don't know.
I don't know.

384
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,105
Can't really trust
my feelings anymore.

385
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,845
You know what, Michael? For what
it's worth, I was wrong, too.

386
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,477
I thought she was
interested in you.

387
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,717
She suckered you, too?
Was it the cleavage?

388
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,622
Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts. Yep.

389
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,286
Michael, you know,
it's easy to get fooled.

390
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:47,628
Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me
all the time. It's mostly harmless.

391
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,829
Usually I don't
let it go too far.

392
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,030
You know, when I tore
my scrote, I was...

393
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,203
I was seeing this really hot urologist
about it and thought she was into me,

394
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,543
but now I think she was just doing
a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO.

395
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,048
You know, she's touching
around down there.

396
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,778
It's easy to
get confused.

397
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,342
Michael, I think
Donna left this here.

398
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,514
Should I put it in the lost and found
for 14 days and then I can take it home?

399
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,648
God.

400
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,017
She left this here? Okay.

401
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,326
Maybe she wants me to return
this to her at her work.

402
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,593
What? No.
No.

403
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,656
KEVIN: No.

404
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,133
Yeah. This could
be a signal.

405
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,335
People don't just
take barrettes off.

406
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,669
It's not a signal.
It's just a coincidence.

407
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,934
No, it's not even
a coincidence.

408
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,236
It's just something
that happened.

409
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,470
Michael.
Well...

410
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,981
She doesn't want you to return the
barrette. She's not interested in you.

411
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,174
I know. I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

412
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,710
I know. You're right. Thank
you. Thanks, everybody.

413
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:45,916
(CLEARING THROAT)

414
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,015
No.

415
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:48,954
Michael!

416
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,586
(SIGHING)

417
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,131
Michael!

418
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,502
Oh, you're still here.
I have your baguette.

419
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,005
Everyone, it is my
pleasure to announce

420
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,311
our newest member of the Sabre
Minority Executive Training Program,

421
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,408
Kelly Rajanigandha Kapoor.

422
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,782
They're going to be pretty
pleased in Tallahassee

423
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,291
that I snagged
an Indian for the program.

424
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,521
She'll be the first.
The program's mostly black.

425
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,460
It's almost too black.

426
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,700
That didn't sound right.

427
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,828
And the best part is, is
that I get a business stipend

428
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,804
to buy all new clothes.
KEVIN: Awesome.

429
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,464
So you can totally buy
any of my old clothes

430
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,599
that I'm not gonna
need anymore.

431
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,767
Oh, my God,
thank you so much.

432
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,835
I love that denim jumpsuit
you have. How much?

433
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,772
Actually, I was thinking about clothes that
I was just going to give to Goodwill anyway.

434
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,579
Great.
Hey, kiddo.

435
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,845
Congratulations are in order.
You deserve it.

436
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,254
Thank you, Dwight.
Oh.

437
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,595
I'll never forget everything
that you've done for me.

438
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,393
Gosh. (LAUGHS)

439
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,898
Because I never
forget anything.

440
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,835
Just once I would like to be a puppet
master and have nothing go wrong.

441
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,602
Is that too much to ask?

442
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:15,212
You know what? Everybody told me that
you weren't interested. Everybody.

443
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,305
And I didn't believe them.

444
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,080
And they were right.

445
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,946
So, here's your barrette.

446
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,891
No, you were right.

447
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,861
Who?
You were right.

448
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,122
About what?

449
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,460
You were right.

450
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,198
I'm sorry.
No. No. No.

451
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,742
I'm...
Nope.

452
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,574
What happened?

453
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,448
Kelly got into the
minority training program.

454
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,819
Really? Oh, that's great.
That's such good news. I did it.

455
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,657
I kissed. We kissed.

456
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,785
Oh, Michael...

457
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,227
No, I'm serious.
The... This happened.

458
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:10,195
I went down to the parking lot and
I was... I returned her barrette.

459
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,431
We...

460
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,536
We did. Okay.
We did. We did.

461
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,835
You know what?
It doesn't matter,

462
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,541
because I know what happened,
and that is all that counts.

463
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,750
I did do it!

9999
