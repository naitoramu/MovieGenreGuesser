1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,046
Hey, Ross.

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:07,883
I'm so glad someone's here.
Could you zip me up?

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,054
- Sure.
- Thank you.

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,849
Can you believe no one
between my apartment and here...

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,184
...offered to do that for me?

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,894
People.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,773
So why are you so dressed up?

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,151
Mike's picking me up for a date.

9
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,278
How's that going?
Is it getting serious?

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,907
I don't know. I don't know.
I mean, I like him.

11
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:35,411
But am I ready to take
my Grade A loins off the meat market?

12
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,704
I'm not quite sure.

13
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:43,252
You know, I really admire
your whole dating attitude.

14
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,546
It's so healthy. I'm always like,
"Is this moving too fast?

15
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,299
Is this moving too slow?
Where's this going?"

16
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,469
I know.
You are a bit of a drama queen.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,516
You're so much better off. You just
go from guy to guy having fun...

18
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:01,979
...and not worrying that it
never turns into anything serious.

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,356
I wouldn't say "never."

20
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,817
You know, there is that guy.

21
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,528
Okay, well, what about...?

22
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,739
Okay, there's gotta be someone.

23
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:17,661
- There isn't! That's what I'm saying.
- Oh, my God, you're right!

24
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,457
I know. And yet, here you are,
all ready for the next date.

25
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,711
I can't believe I never
realized this before.

26
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:30,132
I'm in my 30s, and I've never been
in a long-term relationship.

27
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,093
Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?

28
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,766
There's nothing wrong with you.

29
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:44,271
I mean, you don't strike me as the type
of person that wants to get married.

30
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,815
I want to get married!

31
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,401
No, please...
Please don't cry because of me.

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:54,448
I don't know what I'm talking about,
okay? I've been divorced three times.

33
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,283
At least you've been married.

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,912
Oh, my God!
I want to trade lives with Ross?!

35
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,833
Phoebe.

36
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,961
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm excited about our date.

37
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:14,217
Mike, this is Ross Geller.
Ross, this is Mike...

38
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,389
- Sorry, I didn't catch that.
- Mike Hanigan.

39
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,307
- Ross Geller.
- Hey.

40
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,644
So are you sure you're ready to go?

41
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,438
How do I look?

42
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,526
- Do you have a compact in your purse?
- No.

43
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,612
You look great.

44
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,617
The One with the Sharks

47
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,573
- Hey, Joey.
- This girl won't turn around.

48
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,285
I can't tell if she's hot or not.
What do you think?

49
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,539
Joey, I am not going
to objectify women with you.

50
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,084
But if her face is
as nice as her ass...

51
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,462
- Mama!
- All right. Thanks.

52
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,257
- Have you talked to Chandler?
- He has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.

53
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,843
- How come?
- I don't know. He has to work.

54
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,888
There's some big rush on the...

55
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:49,104
Damn it. I'm gonna have to start
listening when he talks about his job.

56
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,608
Why don't you fly out there
and surprise him?

57
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,151
Maybe I will go.

58
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,574
We'll have a little second honeymoon
at the Tulsa Ramada.

59
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:06,330
You should bring your black see-through
teddy with the attached garters.

60
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,420
- How do you know I have one of those?
- Didn't until just now.

61
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,050
Hot. Not hot.

62
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,761
Hot!

63
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,596
Excuse me?

64
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,561
I said that I think you're hot.

65
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,813
And... now I'm embarrassed.

66
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,358
I thought you said "hi."

67
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,111
That would've been better.

68
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,489
I'll try that. Hi, I'm Joey.

69
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,907
I'm Hayley.

70
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:48,163
Look, I don't normally ask out women
that I meet in coffeehouses.

71
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,335
Gesundheit.

72
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,260
- But...
- I would love to go out with you.

73
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,346
Really? Great.

74
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,224
Did l...?
Did I actually ask you?

75
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,644
That's just where you were going.
I figured I'd help you out.

76
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:15,566
You don't seem like the kind of guy
who does this a lot?

77
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,654
You should see someone
about that cold.

78
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,782
If it gets much worse, you could die.

79
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,080
- So how'd the date go?
- Well, it was awful.

80
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,916
Every time I thought about
what you said, I cried.

81
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,877
- So he hasn't called?
- Would you call this girl:

82
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,256
"Thanks for... a lovely... evening"?

83
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,676
Now I feel terrible.
This is all my fault.

84
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,387
You know what you should
feel terrible about?

85
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,723
This could have been my serious guy.

86
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,393
He was sweet and smart and funny.

87
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,936
You know how hard it is
to meet a guy like that?

88
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,564
We are a rare breed.

89
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,279
What a great dinner.

90
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:06,617
Thanks again for letting me have that
last piece of cake at the restaurant.

91
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,996
You're welcome again.
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

92
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,791
- Can I get you anything?
- Do you have any cake?

93
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,091
<i>So this is going pretty good.</i>

94
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:25,510
<i>Dinner was nice.</i>
<i>We've got a lot in common.</i>

95
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,721
<i>Victoria 's Secret.</i>

96
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,681
<i>We even like the same books.</i>

97
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,770
<i>There's a scary painting.</i>

98
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,980
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

99
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,817
<i>I think I've been scared</i>
<i>by that painting before.</i>

100
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,738
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>This whole place looks familiar.</i>

101
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,032
<i>I have definitely been</i>
<i>in this apartment.</i>

102
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,035
<i>I know I've seen</i>
<i>this weird plant before.</i>

103
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,539
<i>It did that the last time!</i>

104
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,666
"Oh", "my God."
<i>I've gone out with this girl before.</i>

105
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,211
<i>Yeah! We had sex on this couch!</i>

106
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,089
"And then on that chair", "and..."
<i>No.</i>

107
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,133
"No", "we didn 't do it here..."

108
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:08,178
"... which is weird", "because it seems"
<i>like a perfectly good place.</i>

109
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,930
That's why.

110
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,359
Hey, Mike. Sorry to just drop by
like this. Can I come in?

111
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,986
Sure.

112
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,280
Who are you?

113
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,783
I'm Ross. Phoebe's friend
from the coffeehouse?

114
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,745
I really, really need to talk
to you about something.

115
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,122
Unless...

116
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,627
You're not gonna try
and get me to join a cult, are you?

117
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:44,423
No, it's just, you know,
you have that look.

118
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,676
Damn Supercuts!

119
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,181
- Well, what's up? Is Phoebe okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

120
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,601
Phoebe is great. But...

121
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,770
I'm an idiot, okay?

122
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:03,483
Right before you guys went out,
I accidentally got her all upset.

123
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,861
That's why she was weird.

124
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:11,450
Yes. I said something stupid about her
never having had a serious relationship.

125
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:15,663
But you should know, she is
so much fun. A wonderful person.

126
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,000
- Please, don't blow her off.
- I'm not gonna blow her off.

127
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,128
I just spoke to her.
We're going out tomorrow night.

128
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:28,383
I mean, I hope that's okay with you,
stranger from the coffeehouse.

129
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,845
Well, then, I didn't need
to bother you.

130
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:36,141
You or the four other
Mike Hanigans I bothered.

131
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,522
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Is that true what you said?

132
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,067
Phoebe's never had
a serious relationship?

133
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,320
Of course she has.

134
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,032
If she's never had
a serious relationship...

135
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,492
...do you think I'd go
around broadcasting it...

136
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:58,038
...like some kind
of unstoppable moron?

137
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:03,377
- But you did say it.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

138
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,214
And I will also say...

139
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,009
...what I'm about to say...

140
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,719
...vis-a-vis...

141
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,055
...the following.

142
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:22,020
Phoebe has never had
a serious relationship...

143
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,981
...since...

144
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,860
...her super-serious relationship...

145
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,278
...with...

146
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,988
...Vikram.

147
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,284
- Vikram?
- What? That's a real name.

148
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,170
Stop it!

149
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,257
Why couldn't they have
sent me to Texas?

150
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,219
Seven o'clock.

151
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,553
Maybe I'll hit the gym.

152
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,521
Who am I kidding?
Pay-per-view porn.

153
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,455
- Do not disturb! Do not disturb!
- Surprise!

154
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,334
- Monica?
- Is everything all right?

155
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,421
Yeah, everything's great.
I was just...

156
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,507
...watching some
regular television there.

157
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,884
What a pleasant surprise.

158
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,729
- I'm gonna go freshen up, okay?
- Okay, honey.

159
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,777
That was close.

160
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,741
- Hello.
"- Hey", "Rach", "it's me."

161
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:02,204
Okay, I just got to Chandler's room,
and I caught him...

162
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,415
...molesting himself.

163
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,335
That couldn't have been pretty.

164
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,629
But you know, guys do that.

165
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,298
Well, the weird part is...

166
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,926
...he was getting off...
to a shark-attack show!

167
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:21,015
- No!
- Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!

168
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,730
- While watching sharks?
- Yeah.

169
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,233
Are you sure that's what
he was doing?

170
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,320
You know how many times
I've seen him jump up like that?

171
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,488
Believe me, I know what he was doing.

172
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,034
Man! Sharks!

173
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,578
I always knew there was something
weird about that dude.

174
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,081
You promised to love him
no matter what.

175
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:50,419
"What" means, like, if he
gets a disease or kills someone.

176
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,589
Not if he gets his jollies to "Jaws."

177
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,676
You know what, honey?
Guys are just different.

178
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,429
They like things
that we can't understand.

179
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,932
I once dated this guy
who wanted to pretend...

180
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,268
...that he was an archeologist,
and I was this...

181
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:11,440
...naughty cavewoman
who he unfroze from a block of ice.

182
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,110
Are you talking about my brother?

183
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,446
I didn't disguise that very well, did I?

184
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,408
- Hey.
- Hi.

185
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:25,704
I went out with this girl last night.
Halfway through our date I realized...

186
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,498
...I already slept with her.

187
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,921
You've slept with all the women in N.Y.,
and now you're going around again?

188
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,589
That's not even the weird part.

189
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,927
- She didn't remember sleeping with me!
- You don't remember sleeping with her.

190
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,763
But she should remember sleeping
with me. I am very memorable!

191
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,892
- You guys know.
- How do we know?

192
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,271
- We've never slept with you.
- And whose fault is that?

193
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,941
What's the big deal?
You forgot, she forgot.

194
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,027
- Maybe you were having an off night.
- Hey!

195
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,491
I never have an off night. Okay?

196
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:06,036
Although, sometimes if I'm
a little bloated, I don't feel that sexy.

197
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,956
But even then, I'm better than most!

198
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,918
Honey, why don't you just let it go
and ask her out again?

199
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:16,046
You're both so slutty, you don't
remember who you slept with.

200
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,798
You're made for each other.

201
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,593
Interesting.

202
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:26,264
Well, I'll go out with her again
and I'll try to get past it.

203
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,100
No salt! Bloaty!

204
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,728
- Joey?
- What?

205
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,813
You don't think
sharks are sexy, do you?

206
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,732
No.

207
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,901
Wait a minute.
Wait, what was the Little Mermaid?

208
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,823
It's open!

209
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:48,829
- Hey.
- Mike called! We're going out again!

210
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,334
Quick thing.
I went to talk to Mike.

211
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,836
What?

212
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,463
What did you...?
What did you do, Ross?

213
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,675
Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.

214
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,262
I went over there, you know,
to tell him how...

215
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:09,016
How great you are. But...

216
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,894
Well, you know me.
Blah-blah-blah.

217
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,941
- And I ended up telling him that...
- What?

218
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,195
You had a six-year-long relationship...

219
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,489
...with a guy named Vikram.

220
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,202
What? Why?

221
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,996
Well, he seemed...

222
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:37,086
...to bum hard when I told him you'd
never been in a serious relationship.

223
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,258
If you hadn't just had a baby
with my best friend...

224
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,803
...I swear to Lucifer...

225
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,975
...a rabid dog would be feasting
on your danglers right now!

226
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,563
I think you'll feel differently
when you know...

227
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,065
...a little bit about Vikram.

228
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,651
Okay, he's a...

229
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,987
He's a kite designer.

230
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:09,201
And he used to date Oprah.

231
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,748
I'm not going along
with some lie you made up, Ross.

232
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,334
- I'm just gonna be honest with him.
- Good.

233
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,836
Just be honest with him.

234
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,505
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.
- No.

235
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:26,135
So I haven't been in a relationship
that lasted longer than a month.

236
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,762
Okay? I haven't had a real boyfriend.

237
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:33,559
If he can't handle it,
then he can leave. Which he will.

238
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,354
And, you know, that's okay.
So I'll just be alone forever.

239
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,274
You know, all right.
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

240
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,069
I'll go on walking tours
with widows and lesbians.

241
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,407
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

242
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:55,414
I'm trying to remember the last time
I opened a door and you weren't there.

243
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,211
Phoebe, are you okay?

244
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,258
Yeah. There's just...

245
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,762
There's something you should know.

246
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,808
Vikram just called.

247
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,063
So it was really a shock
after 25 years of marriage...

248
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,149
...my parents getting divorced.
I took it the hardest...

249
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,777
...because I was the youngest.
- Sure. Yeah.

250
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,529
How can you not remember me?

251
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,281
What?

252
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,408
How could you not remember
that we slept together?

253
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,578
- What? When?
- I don't know!

254
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,457
I really, really think
I would remember sleeping with you.

255
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:42,044
Come on, come on.
Search your brain, all right? It was...

256
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:45,840
...a certain amount of time ago.
I was here. You were here.

257
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,467
We had sex here, here, here...

258
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,553
Not there.

259
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,847
- Anything?
- No, it's not ringing any bells.

260
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,183
My God, woman!

261
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,228
How many people have you been with
not to remember this?

262
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,522
Hey, Hayley.
We really gotta fix that doorknob.

263
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,400
Joey?

264
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,032
I slept with you!

265
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,621
And you obviously remember me!
Hey, I still got it!

266
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,999
So we're good.

267
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,793
I'll let myself out.

268
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,547
And I said, "Okay, Vikram...

269
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:31,176
...you can't just call
every time you get lonely.

270
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,805
You gave up that right
when you slept with Rachel."

271
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,350
Rachel? I thought she just
had a baby with Ross.

272
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,477
Yeah, well...

273
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,479
Yeah.

274
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,649
But Emma's birth certificate
might say "Geller"...

275
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:49,028
...but her eyes say "Mukherjee."

276
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,200
That is so wrong.
And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?

277
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,286
I know. But he calls,
and my heart goes to him.

278
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:02,749
You know, that bastard is one
smooth-talking freelance kite designer.

279
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,212
I think there's somebody
better out there for you.

280
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:11,049
I mean, you know, I'm...
I'm not saying me, but...

281
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,427
Maybe... me.

282
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,975
And you don't have to worry about
glue-sniffing with me.

283
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,687
Although, I do smell
the occasional Magic Marker.

284
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,941
Yeah. Anyway, I just...

285
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,694
I think I can make you happy.

286
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,617
- Okay, I can't do this.
- What's wrong?

287
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,829
Well, there is no Vikram.
Ross made him up.

288
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,456
Because I...

289
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,543
I really never have been
in a long-term relationship.

290
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:50,255
I've never lived with a guy. I've never
even celebrated an anniversary.

291
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,215
So...

292
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,429
If that's too weird for you...

293
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,764
...and you want to leave,
I understand.

294
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:02,351
In fact, I'll close my eyes
to make it less awkward.

295
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,902
You kissed me.

296
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:17,658
- You don't think I'm a total freak?
- No.

297
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,492
Well...

298
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,870
Look, can I...?

299
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,082
Can I think you're a little weird
and also cool...

300
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,918
...for telling me the truth
and also want to kiss you?

301
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,296
I guess so.

302
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,923
Can I think it's cool
that you kissed me...

303
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,676
...and also want to kiss you again?

304
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:41,557
And be a little concerned
about the Magic Markers?

305
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,684
Definitely.

306
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,609
<i>This is Vikram.</i>

307
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,287
Hi, honey, I'm home.

308
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,247
Hi.

309
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:09,001
- How was your flight?
- It was great.

310
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,128
Why don't you sit down.

311
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,755
Get yourself comfortable.

312
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,590
Because I have a little...

313
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,009
...surprise for you.

314
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,722
Well, well, well.
It must be 5:00 in Tulsa...

315
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:25,726
...because it's "sex o'clock" in N.Y.C.!

316
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,815
Okay.
This is how much I love you.

317
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,985
<i>The great white...</i>

318
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,242
Honey?

319
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:45,871
Why am I watching
a bunch of sharks swimming around?

320
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,333
Is this...?
Is this not the good part?

321
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:53,920
Do you want me to fast-forward
to something... toothier?

322
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:58,342
No, I'm just not sure that you
got the right movie, that's all.

323
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,054
This is the only one
they had at our video store.

324
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:05,349
Though they did have something
called "Crocodile Killers."

325
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:08,310
Or does it always have to be sharks?

326
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,481
Does what always have to be sharks?

327
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,859
Look, we can do something else.

328
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:19,154
Do you want me to
get into the tub and... thrash?

329
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:24,326
- What's going on?
- It's okay. It's okay.

330
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,328
I still love you.

331
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:30,457
- Let me be a part of this.
- Let me be a part of this!

332
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,086
I saw what you were doing in Tulsa.

333
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:37,006
Angry sharks turn you on!

334
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,967
No, they don't.

335
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:44,764
Then why were you watching them
and giving yourself a treat?

336
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,642
Oh, my God! When you came in,
I switched the channel.

337
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:51,437
I was just watching regular porn.

338
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:53,730
Really?

339
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:58,193
Yes. Just some good, old-fashioned,
American, girl-on-girl action.

340
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,407
Can I tell you how happy
that makes me?

341
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,869
You are an amazing wife.

342
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:11,414
Really, you are amazing. You were
actually gonna do this for me?

343
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:15,878
Where do you find the strength
and the understanding for that?

344
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,923
I'm very, very drunk right now.

345
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:30,308
Ordinarily, I would talk to her,
but my confidence is shaken.

346
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,645
Did I sleep with her?
Did I not sleep with her?

347
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:38,817
Maybe this is a wake-up call. You know,
about your whole dating attitude.

348
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:43,989
You're in your 30s and you have
never been in a long-term relationship.

349
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,242
Here you go from woman to woman...

350
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,785
...meaningless experience
to meaningless experience.

351
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,622
Never even worrying that it doesn't
turn into something more serious.

352
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,917
You're right. I love my life!

353
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,466
I actually did sleep with her.

354
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:09,807
