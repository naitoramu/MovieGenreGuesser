3
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:15,076
- You got
anything particular in mind,

4
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:15,917
a sedan a wagon?

5
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:29,760
We got some that just came
in this morning, over here.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,126
- Honey, I don't
think we can afford this.

7
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:36,126
- We can finance anybody.

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,560
- These aren't the numbers
that we talked about.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,100
I would like to see the invoice.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,933
- Why?

11
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,230
It doesn't matter what
we paid for the car,

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,600
what matters is what you pay.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,150
Now, what's the closest
you'll come to this number?

14
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,890
Lance, you're killing me, I
won't make a dime on that.

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,050
- Why can't I see the invoice?

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,150
- What do you have, some
kind of invoice fetish?

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,740
- I know it's in that drawer over there.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,170
- It's not in that drawer over there.

19
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,660
- If I can see the invoice,
I just feel like then I would

20
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,493
know what's going on.

21
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:10,903
You know, but I don't know.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,230
- What color is this asshole?

23
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,500
- Don't start that shit,

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,450
will you just give me a pencil on this?

25
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,780
He wants to see the invoice.

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,570
- Tell him the inVoice is in the safe,

27
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,217
at the regional headquarters.

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,874
- This is higher than my first debt.

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,810
- This, did you look at this?

30
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,370
- Yeah, these things are expensive,

31
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,735
you got this kind of money?

32
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:08,850
- I wanna talk to the owner.

33
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,840
- You don't want to talk to
him, he's a fucking asshole.

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,060
I'll be honest with you, Lance.

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,770
I went too high, you went too low.

36
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,227
What do you say we meet
somewhere in the middle?

37
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,400
- I know math, that is
nowhere near the middle.

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,463
- I didn't say exactly the middle.

39
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,470
- Who do you keep going and talk to?

40
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,303
- My boss.

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,180
- Can I talk to him?

42
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,013
- No.

43
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,660
- The monthly payment, it seems high.

44
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,030
- You write down a number
that will make you happy,

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,460
I want to make you happy.

46
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,280
I want you to come back
three years from now

47
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,260
and buy another car.

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,700
- That's how much I can pay every month,

49
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,020
I mean, that would make me happy.

50
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,270
- Did you bump your head?

51
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,300
What's the closest you'll
come to this number?

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,600
- You keep asking me that

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,860
and I keep telling you higher numbers,

54
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,600
but then your number doesn't get lower.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,433
- Exactly.

56
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,940
- I thought we were negotiating,
but you're not. It does...

57
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,763
I feel like I'm negotiating,
but you're not negotiating.

58
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:28,340
Could I please go home now?

59
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,810
- You know what, Lance,

60
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,840
I don't even feel like
you're a customer anymore,

61
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,440
I feel like you're a friend now.

62
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,933
- Me too.

63
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:44,950
- Not bad.

64
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,820
- Fucking right.

65
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,030
- Now go tell him the floor
mats are an extra $100.

66
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,080
- Those are standard!

67
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,230
- He doesn't know that.

68
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,440
- You want to blow this
fucking deal over floor mats?

69
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,700
This guy's grinding me
for two fucking hours,

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,763
I get him to sign, you
gotta be shitting me!

71
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:03,763
- Do it.

72
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,350
You weak suck, you gave
away the floor mats.

73
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,807
- I'm not going to blow the
guy out over floor mats,

74
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,290
it was a deal breaker.

75
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,850
- Bullshit, that pussy was hooked.

76
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,250
Get out of my sight, you're fired.

77
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,970
- That was a home run, $2000 over sticker.

78
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,803
You can't fire me.

79
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,260
- You want to bet your commission?

80
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,773
- Fuck you, you bald prick!

81
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,330
Remember last year's company
picnic, I fucked your wife.

82
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,040
- Ex-wife.

83
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,970
- In your car.

84
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,934
- You cocksucking,
motherfucking, guinea asshole!

85
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:03,259
You half-baked, shitbag, wop fucker!

86
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,433
- Let's get started.

87
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,768
Okay, Everybody stand up.

88
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:18,770
Come on, stand up.

89
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,630
Put one hand in the
air as high as you can,

90
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,570
reach way up.

91
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,484
Eddie, get the fuck out of that chair.

92
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:26,150
- I've heard this shit.

93
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,740
- I don't give a fuck, these
meetings are for everybody.

94
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,232
Reach you old prick!

95
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,498
Where the fuck is Sean, keep reaching.

96
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,803
Do you like your job?

97
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,290
Scared the shit out of that white boy.

98
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,910
Watch, he'll be here in four minutes.

99
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,100
How long do you say, Eddie?

100
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,810
- Six.
- We'll, bet for lunch.

101
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,830
Okay, come on everybody.

102
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,840
Keep reaching, little bit higher, come on!

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,320
Now, are you all reaching
as high as you can?

104
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,153
- Yeah.

105
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,110
- Okay, I want everybody to try real hard

106
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,390
and reach just a little bit higher!

107
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,223
Come on!

108
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:01,760
Bobby, you weak suck, reach!

109
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,593
Higher!

110
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,563
Okay, great.

111
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,840
Now, you see guys, the
way when you thought

112
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,700
you couldn't do any better,

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,120
you couldn't reach just
a little bit higher.

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,470
If we all try just a little bit more,

115
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,802
we can sell 50 cars this weekend,

116
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:15,635
- Yeah.

117
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:16,468
- Are we all going to try?

118
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:17,380
- Yeah!

119
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,970
- All right, sit down.

120
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:21,690
Shamim, what are we?

121
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,523
- Whores.

122
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:23,590
- That's right.

123
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,820
We are fucking whores.

124
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,950
And we fuck, and we suck,
better than anybody else

125
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,090
and they are gonna pay us top dollar

126
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,640
'cause we are the best.

127
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,473
- Yeah!

128
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:37,871
- You don't believe that,
get the fuck outta here.

129
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:38,704
Because you're wasting your time,

130
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:40,090
you're wasting my time too.

131
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,530
My grandmother, the bitch is blind,

132
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,057
she can sell a car to somebody
who comes in and says,

133
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:44,305
"Give me that one."

134
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,400
All right.

135
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,953
Bobby, why are we here?

136
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,783
Bobby, why are we here?

137
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,530
- Why won't you come
down to the dealership?

138
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,090
Reggie said, he can give you a job.

139
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,400
We need to eat.

140
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,233
- I'm trying to.

141
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:04,523
- What do I have to do to
explain to you that we are broke?

142
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,363
- Bobby, why are we here?

143
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,460
- Why are we here?

144
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,386
- Why are you here, Deluca?

145
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:19,991
- To make money?

146
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,030
- Right!

147
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,733
Lots of money.

148
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,732
You want to make minimum
wage, get the fuck outta here.

149
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,332
Eddie, you owe me lunch

150
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,450
- Okay everybody, when Sean comes in,

151
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,690
I want everybody to say,
fuck you, Sean, Ready?

152
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,940
One, two, three.

153
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,290
- Fuck you Sean!

154
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,500
- All right, shut up.

155
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,580
Marco, when does the salesman's job start?

156
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,740
- 8:00 AM, Saturday boss.

157
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,694
- No, you piece of shit!

158
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:58,960
- Kiss ass.

159
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,863
- The salesman's job starts
when the customer says, no.

160
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:08,261
Would you like to take
this baby home today, sir?

161
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:10,670
- I don't know, I don't think so.

162
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,929
- Why?

163
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:14,000
- I have to check with my wife first.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,982
- Why?

165
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:17,343
I don't have to check with
my wife before I sell it.

166
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,320
Why, why, why, why?

167
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,210
No matter what they say, you ask why?

168
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,376
Who's going to be driving
this car the most?

169
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:29,492
- Me.

170
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,020
- You?

171
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,720
And the wife makes you
check with her first.

172
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,460
- She doesn't make me.

173
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,723
- I understand, you don't
want to get in trouble.

174
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,190
Come back after you get permission,

175
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,163
you can take a test drive.

176
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:43,500
- I don't need permission.

177
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,333
- Let's go.

178
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,767
Make them drive the car,
make them touch it, feel it,

179
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,800
smell it, get them excited.

180
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,333
When they're excited, they pay more.

181
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,588
What are you doing here so late?

182
00:08:58,421 --> 00:08:59,254
- We need the money.

183
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:00,610
- Didn't your hubby find a job?

184
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,530
- Nope, you have to be looking for a job

185
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,935
in order to find one.

186
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:05,360
- How about the insurance,
didn't you collect on that?

187
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,227
- My brilliant husband didn't
have coverage on the truck,

188
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:09,950
it was a total loss.

189
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,150
- When a customer makes
you an offer, you say,

190
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,237
sir, if I could sell you
this $32,000 car for $10,000,

191
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,540
would you take it?

192
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,820
When?

193
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,570
Right now.
- Right now.

194
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,400
- If he says, yes, you say, follow me.

195
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,350
You turn around, you go
straight into the office.

196
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,160
Don't turn back around,
because they'll stop.

197
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,867
They're like dogs, if
a dog is following you,

198
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,760
and you stop and turn
around, what do they do?

199
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,233
They stop, don't fucking stop!

200
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,500
- Mr. DeLuca,
this is Thomas Rollings

201
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,010
with Preferred Bank, I've
left, and I'm keeping track,

202
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,780
I've left 13 messages.

203
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,613
Isn't it time-

204
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:44,200
- You know, I remember the
good old days when it was safe

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,790
to answer my own phone.

206
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,250
- I remember when I could have
a conversation with my wife

207
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,350
without her breaking my balls.

208
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,840
- You know what I can't remember,

209
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,290
the last time my husband
brought home a paycheck.

210
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,000
- You know what your problem is,

211
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,930
you want me to take the
first job that comes along,

212
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,800
but I don't want a job, I want a career.

213
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,370
There's a difference.

214
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,550
You don't get rich working
for somebody else, Donna.

215
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,620
I know things are tight for us right now,

216
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,740
but when the right
opportunity comes along,

217
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,270
I will work my ass off to
get us out of this hole,

218
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,460
you know that.

219
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,110
My family is the most important
thing in the world to me.

220
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,527
- Good, because it's about to get bigger.

221
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,410
- Don't even joke about shit like that.

222
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,243
- Who's joking?

223
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:27,220
- You are!

224
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,053
You're just saying that,

225
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:29,590
'cause you know, if you were pregnant,

226
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,430
I would have to get a job, any job.

227
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,473
- Do you actually believe
that I would do that?

228
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:37,560
Has your brain just
completely rotted to shit?

229
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,423
Are you out of your fucking mind?

230
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:46,932
- I'm sorry.

231
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:48,365
- No, no, don't!

232
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:49,448
Bobby, don't.

233
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,070
I would like to stab you
in the neck right now,

234
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,743
you are such an asshole.

235
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:58,320
You don't have to stab in the
neck I know I'm an asshole,

236
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,153
I'm so sorry.

237
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,193
I'm sorry. I didn't know, I'm sorry.

238
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,653
I promise you, everything
will work out fine.

239
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,710
- What are we going to do?

240
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:24,067
- I guess we're going to sell some cars.

241
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,073
- Really?

242
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:29,419
- Why not.

243
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,600
- So now, you've got the
customer in your office, the box.

244
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,670
He's all excited, he
thinks he's going to get

245
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,980
a top of the line, limited
edition for $10,000.

246
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,970
Now you tear his fucking
head off. On the trade in,

247
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,980
let's say his car is worth $20,000,

248
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,090
you go back and you say,
sir, I have great news,

249
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:58,090
your car could be worth as much as $7,000.

250
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,450
Don't be afraid of these
assholes, they don't know!

251
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,520
You're a pro, you do this every day.

252
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,253
Why would I buy a car from you?

253
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,033
- Because...you love me,

254
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,863
I'm a nice guy, I'm funny.

255
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:17,990
- Yeah?

256
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,493
I like that, make me laugh you got a job.

257
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,507
- What's the best part of a
blowjob once you're married?

258
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:26,410
- I don't know. What?

259
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,000
- The five minutes of silence.

260
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,670
- Are you idiots paying attention!

261
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,140
A baby could understand this.

262
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,180
You write the sticker
price here in small numbers

263
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,850
to show that's a small number.

264
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,000
One third of that is your down payment.

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,070
Three times the first two
numbers of the purchase price

266
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,160
is about what the payments
per month will be.

267
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,320
With these numbers, you
got room everywhere.

268
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,597
Sir, if I can get you
a $7,000 for your car

269
00:13:09,597 --> 00:13:10,850
and you put $11,000 down,

270
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,920
and I get your payments
to only $990 a month,

271
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,440
we'd have a deal right now, right?

272
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,920
Then shut the fuck up.

273
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,353
The first one to speak, loses.

274
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,482
- Are you crazy?

275
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,020
- No matter what the customer says,

276
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,190
you go right to the
trade, always in control.

277
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,600
Sir, what if I can get
you $7,100 for your car,

278
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,480
then we'd have a deal, right?

279
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,130
How about 7,200?

280
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,390
Always nod, yes.

281
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,201
Keep nodding, all of a sudden
the asshole starts to nod.

282
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:16,160
Sir, did you know you are getting fucked?

283
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,037
Yes, I know Reggie.

284
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,763
Does it feel good?

285
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,165
Yes, it does Reggie.

286
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:30,389
Fuck these people up
the ass, they love it!

287
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,203
The next day when they
come out of the ether.

288
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:40,934
- What the fuck did I do?

289
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,420
What the fuck did I do?

290
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,420
- Honey, are you in there?

291
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,253
- I'm taking a shower.

292
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,620
- And they don't want to
admit they got fucked,

293
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,150
so they bring their friends to you.

294
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,080
Go ahead, give them the same deal.

295
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,280
Go ahead, fuck him too.

296
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,030
These assholes will
bring you more customers.

297
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:28,511
- How much money do you have?
- About $10.

298
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,770
Hey guys, how's it going?

299
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,100
- Hey, where you been, man?

300
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,860
- Yeah, you could have called.

301
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,328
- Yeah, I know, I'm really sorry about it.

302
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:42,520
I've been so busy, you know?

303
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,470
- How's the trucking business, partner?

304
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:47,480
- It's fine,

305
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,783
but listen, I've got some
other things going on

306
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,330
that I think you guys
are really going to love.

307
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,850
- All we'd love is for you to
make your payments on time,

308
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,520
and according to my
sundial, you're late, Nixon.

309
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,620
- Well, that's why I'm here,

310
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,270
I, uh, I need a little
bit of an extension.

311
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,103
Wait a minute, don't get me wrong here.

312
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:08,030
I mean, things are going great,

313
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,460
they're definitely getting better.

314
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,100
- Yeah, I bet they are.

315
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,403
- They are, check out the new ride.

316
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,990
- Very nice.

317
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,770
- Why should we give you an extension?

318
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,060
- So I can close a few deals,

319
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,642
a little breathing room, that's all.

320
00:16:26,642 --> 00:16:28,800
And I guarantee you, by
the end of this month,

321
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,510
I can be totally up to date.

322
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,860
Come on guys, is that cool?

323
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,640
- When he says yes to the trade,

324
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,060
go right to the down payment.

325
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,500
Is that $11,000 down payment
going to be cash or check?

326
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,860
You can't?

327
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,483
Well, what if I can get
them to go to $10,900?

328
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,760
Then we'd have a deal, right?

329
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,830
No?

330
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,160
Cross it out, big X.

331
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,810
How about $10,800, then
we'd have a deal, right?

332
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,965
No?

333
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:05,280
Big X.

334
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,820
Sir, normally the banks require one-third,

335
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,980
but if I can get them to take $10,750,

336
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,430
then we'd have a deal, right?

337
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,753
No?

338
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,580
Sir, what would it take
to make a deal right now?

339
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,270
- $5,000?

340
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,040
- Okay, $5,000 now, and
when will you bring us

341
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,377
the other $6,000?

342
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,010
- What do you mean?

343
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,603
- Oh, you mean, only $5000?

344
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,850
Well then your payment's gonna go up.

345
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,540
You're always in control,
go back to the trade.

346
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,640
If I can get you $7,250 for your trade,

347
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,217
you write me a check for $5,000

348
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:42,910
and I keep you payments
down to $990 a month,

349
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,610
we'd have a deal right now, right?

350
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,660
- No, the payment's too high.

351
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,003
- Well, let me ask you how to
this figure $990 can you come?

352
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,040
- Maybe $400, $500.

353
00:17:57,457 --> 00:17:58,290
- $500?

354
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:00,923
That's low.

355
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,917
I've never seen a deal
go down like this before,

356
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,590
but if I could do that for you,

357
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,563
would we have a deal, right now?

358
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,433
Okay.

359
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,465
Sign here.

360
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,823
I'm going to try for you, but
my boss is going to kill me.

361
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:28,713
Then you say, wish me luck.

362
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,633
The guy's shitting in his
pants, he's fucking shaking.

363
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,436
- I hope he can get it.

364
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:48,548
- So you bump this guy
up thousands of dollars,

365
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:51,020
then you come in and you get your closer.

366
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,960
We have these stars here for
a reason, they are the best.

367
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,130
But you have to do your job
before they can do theirs.

368
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,890
You sell the car, not
them, they close the deal.

369
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,800
When you pick up a girl, you
don't take off all her clothes,

370
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,457
get her into bed and then
call your friend, Tom and say,

371
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:09,127
"Okay, Tom, she's ready
now, you can fuck her."

372
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:15,050
No, no. You're fucking the
bitch, the closer comes in,

373
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,073
he puts his foot on your ass
and pushes you in deeper!

374
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,780
You have to sell the car,
you have to get a commitment.

375
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,850
Then one of my stars goes in,
switches the guy to a lease

376
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,353
and buries the motherfucker.

377
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:34,970
We are the best!

378
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,008
- Yeah!

379
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,105
- We make more money than anybody.

380
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:38,938
- Yeah!

381
00:19:38,938 --> 00:19:42,383
- We are fucking high gross!

382
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:44,017
- Yeah!

383
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,367
And this is going to be
our biggest month ever.

384
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:48,478
And to sweeten the pot,

385
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:53,513
a $10,000 bonus to the top man.

386
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,170
That's right, a 10 pounder to the pro.

387
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,303
Now next month, we've
got all new inventory.

388
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:02,495
So get rid of those
fucking sleds out there.

389
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,086
Come on, let's go kick some ass!

390
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:06,175
All right!

391
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:27,389
- Parts department,
please call the operator.

392
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:29,139
Parts department, call the operator.

393
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:37,381
Buddy Morra, to the service department.

394
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,703
Please. Your car is ready. Again.

395
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,368
- What?

396
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:51,147
- He doesn't speak a word of
Spanish, can you believe it?

397
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:53,090
A Mexican from LA.

398
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,049
- Coming in, car right there!

399
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,093
- Nice call, man.

400
00:20:57,093 --> 00:20:58,957
That's the owner, you think
you can sell him a car.

401
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,079
Eddie,
please dial the operator,

402
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,162
Eddie, dial the operator.

403
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,990
- Don't ever talk to Mr.
Carlton. He doesn't like it.

404
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,973
You'll get fired.

405
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:41,330
Reggie,
please see Mr. Carlton.

406
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,523
Reggie, see Mr. Carlton right now.

407
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:49,010
- What the fuck are you doing?

408
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,761
- You put it closer, closer,

409
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,763
and you see how much pain you can stand.

410
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:57,429
- You are sick.

411
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,380
Let's see how much pain
a cute tip can stand.

412
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,573
- Fuck you.

413
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,312
Sales, line one-

414
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,112
- Good afternoon, South Side Motors.

415
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,070
Sure we do, come on down.
And ask for JJ, okay?

416
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,290
That's spelled J-J.

417
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,380
Yeah, okay.

418
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,023
Well, I'll see you soon. Bye bye.

419
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,653
Hey Mo.

420
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:32,953
Mo. You ever catch a ladybug

421
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:35,623
and melt the wings off?

422
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,510
Then you pull all the legs off one side

423
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,513
and watch it run around in circles.

424
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,010
- You must be very sick to get pleasure

425
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,540
from killing something.

426
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,340
- No, no, no, no, you don't kill it.

427
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,217
Aren't you gonna ask
why you don't kill it?

428
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:56,147
because then it'll rain.

429
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:59,390
Randall, dial 6-4, please.

430
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,040
- You fucking Israelis don't know shit,

431
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,963
you people worship fucking cows.

432
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,817
What the fuck is that?

433
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,283
- Get the fuck out of that
chair, you motherfucker!

434
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,720
- Relax, cue tip, before I
pull one of your legs off.

435
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,670
- Back off JJ, take it easy, Mo.

436
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,400
- This is sub-human
doesn't know the difference

437
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,738
between Israel and Afghanistan.

438
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:21,736
- You're all just sand
niggers to me anyway.

439
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:25,336
- Fucking nut, we're on
the same team, moron.

440
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:26,436
Fuck!

441
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,613
- Are you crazy?

442
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:32,240
You never mess with a
fucking Afghan commando.

443
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,013
- Fuck that skinny
nigga, I'll swat his ass.

444
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,120
- I don't think so,
guy's a trained killer,

445
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,200
he'll kill you in the blink of an eye.

446
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,940
- My money's on JJ, he
was trained in Watts.

447
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,032
- I know that's right.

448
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:42,482
How much? $500?

449
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,123
- Punk ass nigga.

450
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,060
- Sales, line three please?

451
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,060
- Good afternoon, Southside

452
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:01,310
- Coming in.
- Coming in.

453
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,143
Damn!

454
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:03,700
Shit, you prick.

455
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,563
- I saw it first.

456
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:08,788
- Hi, I'm Marco.

457
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:10,788
- Oh, I forgot my purse.

458
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:15,273
- Look at her.

459
00:24:18,352 --> 00:24:19,485
She knows we're watching.

460
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:21,460
- I'm Marco, welcome to Southside.

461
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,608
- Nice to meet you, Marco.

462
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:25,057
I'm looking for something
to get around in,

463
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:26,315
something sporty.

464
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,993
- Oh mommy

465
00:24:30,728 --> 00:24:32,970
Cheryl Stanley
to service department.

466
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,868
- What do you think of
this new guy on your team?

467
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:36,890
- I think he's going to help
me kick your ass this month,

468
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,843
that's what I think.

469
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,637
- Bull shit. $20 says he
goes blank for the weekend.

470
00:24:41,637 --> 00:24:44,220
- $50 says he sells a
car today white bread.

471
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,353
Come on, Bubba, put up or shut up.

472
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:49,670
- I'm good for it.

473
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,150
- Yeah, and my dick
tastes like strawberries.

474
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,560
You good for it. Put up your money.

475
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,350
- Here you go, ma'am.

476
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,697
- No, you drive, I hate to drive.

477
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:02,272
Reggie, please dial the operator.

478
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,080
- Don't take your eyes off that entrance,

479
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,740
you see your car, you scream, coming in.

480
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,393
- Where?
- Up your ass, Sean.

481
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:13,895
Yell as loud as you can.

482
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:14,800
- Coming in!

483
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,000
I got it.

484
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,921
- Your ass you got it,
he beat you by a mile.

485
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:19,246
- Fuck you, Eddie. That's Sean's up.

486
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:20,660
Get a commitment, I'll bury the maggot.

487
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,704
Go!

488
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:22,537
- What the hell was that?

489
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:24,490
- What the hell did it look like, buddy?

490
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,001
You getting it in the booty Judy.

491
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:30,030
- That's not fucking fair man.

492
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,560
- Fuck all y'all, how about that?

493
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,420
Go on, boy.

494
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,300
- Hey, how you doing today?

495
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,133
- Hi.

496
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,310
- Welcome to Southside.

497
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,480
Can I help you with anything?

498
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,010
- Well, we just wanted to look.

499
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,954
- That's great, what
can I help you look at?

500
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:46,170
- You know what, we're really
just looking right now.

501
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,000
- Okay, but I tell you
what, if you need any help,

502
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,120
I'll be right over here, okay?

503
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,953
Okay.

504
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:01,786
Welcome to South Side,

505
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,120
My name is Shamim.

506
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,423
- I already have a
salesman, I spoke to Sean.

507
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,223
- Oh.

508
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,467
- Would you like to drive now?

509
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:16,303
- No, I'm fine.

510
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,093
Go up there.

511
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,518
- I think you'll like this model.

512
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,920
- I better like it,
you big fuckin' carrot.

513
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:35,477
Roscoe Topanga, your car is ready,

514
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:37,639
please pick up your car, sir.

515
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:38,985
- What are you doing?

516
00:26:38,985 --> 00:26:41,043
Why aren't you with the customers?

517
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:42,282
- They said they were just looking.

518
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:43,206
- Get the keys to that
car and get out there

519
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:44,039
and drive them.

520
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,197
- It's only the first
one they've looked at.

521
00:26:45,197 --> 00:26:47,033
- Get out there and drive them, now.

522
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,153
- Keys in here?

523
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:55,514
- I used to know kids like you in school.

524
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:56,570
Used to hold them by the legs

525
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,990
and clean the toilets
with their fucking heads.

526
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,585
- That's brilliant.

527
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,170
- You probably did your
homework before supper, huh?

528
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,160
- Can we just get to the garage, please?

529
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,170
- You're gonna get to the garage.

530
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,520
You'll get to the garage,
just shut the fuck up.

531
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,335
- I wonder if the airbag is standard.

532
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:13,785
- It better be at this price.

533
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,220
- Hey, this is a great car. Really.

534
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,910
Let's go for a drive.

535
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,930
- No thanks, we don't
want to waste your time.

536
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,360
- No, that's all right.

537
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,760
I have nothing better to do.

538
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,080
Listen, you don't have to buy the car.

539
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,330
I mean, come on, let's
go for a little drive.

540
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,943
It might help you decide,
you don't want the car.

541
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,733
Come on.

542
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,199
- All right.

543
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,220
- Pull up here and park.

544
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,203
Isn't this great?

545
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,580
- Yeah.

546
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,810
- What are you doing?

547
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:11,122
- I don't know what you're doing,

548
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,943
but I know what I'm doing.

549
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,026
Relax, honey.

550
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:19,020
I've been dreaming about doing this,

551
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,187
since my daddy bought me my first car.

552
00:28:32,537 --> 00:28:36,950
- Oh yeah, wasn't that great, huh?

553
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,783
Thank you.

554
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,723
- So Bobby, uh, what kind
of deal can we get on this?

555
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,520
- I don't know,

556
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,223
but I could find out.

557
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:51,883
Follow me.

558
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:25,093
Hey, okay.

559
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,620
Why don't the two of
you come into my office,

560
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,670
take a seat and I'll be back
in just a little bit, okay?

561
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,503
Please.

562
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:39,523
Eddie,

563
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:42,373
I think I got a deal.

564
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:46,610
- Take a credit out, worksheet.

565
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,170
It was great, I mean, I
said follow me, they did.

566
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,210
Fucking amazing, you know?

567
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,163
- Eddie, take the customers.

568
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,160
- He's fine.

569
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,010
- Eddie, work the fucking deal.

570
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,663
- There's no deal, he hasn't
even done a worksheet yet.

571
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,370
- You fill it out, ask them the questions.

572
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:12,393
- Go high on payment, high on
down payment, low on trade.

573
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,240
- I don't know if they have a trade.

574
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,503
- Then go real low.

575
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:18,802
- Okay.

576
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,040
- You're an asshole.

577
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,240
- He's got to learn.

578
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,323
- If he loses that deal,
you are fired you lazy fuck.

579
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,960
- How much?

580
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,793
- 10 bucks.

581
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,500
- If you'll come inside sir,
we can work out the numbers.

582
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,370
- Well, why don't you go inside

583
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,990
and get your boss's best price

584
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,370
and then come out here
and tell me what it is.

585
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,717
- Well, it doesn't work that way, sir.

586
00:30:57,717 --> 00:31:01,210
You see, I need you to come
inside and fill out the papers

587
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,210
or they will not believe you're serious.

588
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,133
- I'm serious, but I'm not coming inside.

589
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,255
- Are you going to buy this car, ma'am?

590
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:24,910
- I'll buy it, baby, keep going.

591
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,743
- You promise?
- Yes.

592
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:28,076
- You'll buy it today?
- Yes.

593
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,800
- Okay, do you have a trade in?

594
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,280
- No.

595
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,113
- Good.

596
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,340
All right.

597
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,340
Now, this is how much your car costs,

598
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,130
so your payments will be...

599
00:32:03,627 --> 00:32:05,550
I don't know, what do
you think they should be?

600
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,629
- Well, we're not paying
that much for the car, right?

601
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:11,940
- No, no, no, I'll get you
a good deal, don't worry.

602
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,003
But, what are you going to put down?

603
00:32:15,003 --> 00:32:16,673
- What do we have to put down.

604
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,983
- A lot?

605
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,890
I'll be right back.

606
00:32:40,195 --> 00:32:42,430
- This guy has no idea what he's doing.

607
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,370
- So maybe we'll get a
better deal. I like him.

608
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,037
He's not a salesman.

609
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:22,077
- Did you wack this shit?

610
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,833
- No.

611
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:24,700
- Yes you did, man.

612
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,870
It's okay, because that's how I started.

613
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,368
And that's how everybody fucking starts.

614
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,610
But I'm gonna tell you
this 'cause I like you,

615
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,633
Stay out of the fucking product.

616
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,843
- Okay.

617
00:33:42,362 --> 00:33:45,010
- What do you weigh these days, Sean?

618
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:45,843
- What?

619
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:46,680
- How much you weigh, man?

620
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:50,070
- I don't know, I guess about 160.

621
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,200
- Good, step on that.

622
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:00,669
Atta boy.

623
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,940
- This is the sticker price.

624
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,670
- If you cannot come inside, sir,

625
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,020
this is the best we can do.

626
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,170
- Maybe you don't comprende, Snowflake.

627
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,853
I will buy this car, but
I refuse come inside.

628
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,293
I'll be waiting,

629
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,563
right here.

630
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,280
- We have to stop at the
bank so I can get my money.

631
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,703
- Oh, okay.

632
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:50,102
Hey!

633
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,714
Where are you going?

634
00:34:53,714 --> 00:34:56,281
- You were great, honey.

635
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,072
- Fuck!

636
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,090
- I'll throw you an extra
$50 if you make this deal.

637
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,600
The guy's a lay down, I know it.

638
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,557
- I don't give a shit,

639
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:13,530
I'm not talking to this asshole anymore.

640
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,163
- You know why he won't come inside?

641
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:17,130
Beause he's afraid, Mo.

642
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,140
He's afraid of you. He's afraid of me.

643
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,590
He's afraid of every fucking thing here.

644
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,690
He's afraid of the fucking
porters, who wash the cars.

645
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,610
- I'm done talking to this piece of shit.

646
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,510
This has no respect.

647
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,147
- You don't want his
respect, you want his money.

648
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:35,570
You can't buy shit with respect.

649
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,410
How many of these jerks
come in here screaming,

650
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,240
I'm not buying anything
today, I'm just looking.

651
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,390
You think they're talking to you?

652
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,033
No, they're talking to themselves.

653
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:45,210
They've been fucked so many times,

654
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,910
they finally realized, they're easy.

655
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,770
Go bury this fuck.

656
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,340
- No, fuck him. I take another up.

657
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,870
Give it to someone else.

658
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,997
- I'll give you an extra
$100 you close this deal.

659
00:35:56,997 --> 00:35:57,830
- $150.

660
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,297
- Don't push your luck,

661
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:08,581
- Three porters to the showroom please,

662
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,615
three porters to the showroom.

663
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:11,448
- Show him this.

664
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,913
- Eddie, they're going to
shit when they see this.

665
00:36:14,913 --> 00:36:16,030
- Just show it to them.

666
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,958
- But they think that I'm--

667
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:17,791
- If you don't show it
to them I'm gonna tell JJ

668
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,150
what you said about his mother.

669
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,983
- I didn't say anything.

670
00:36:19,983 --> 00:36:20,989
- Will you get the fuck over there

671
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:22,043
and show them the numbers?

672
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,040
- I thought you liked us, Bob.

673
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,120
- Let's just sit here for a little while,

674
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,523
then I'll go back inside and
get you guys a discount, okay?

675
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,020
You like Vietnamese food?

676
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,547
- Have a seat, my friend.

677
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,390
I'm almost done with the figures

678
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,900
we have worked up for you.

679
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,000
Javier,
please dial 55, 55, please.

680
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,200
- What the hell is this?

681
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,083
- Your payments.

682
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,160
- Oh, this looks a little high.

683
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,340
- If you cannot afford this
car, thank you for stopping by.

684
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,260
- No, wait, wait.

685
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,043
It's not that I can't afford it,

686
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:51,494
well, I mean, can't I get a better deal?

687
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:56,040
- No, you have to go somewhere
else for a better deal.

688
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,873
- Are you kidding?

689
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:59,080
These are harder to find
than tits on a catfish.

690
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,600
Especially in this color.

691
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,153
- I know, that's too bad.

692
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,480
There was one other place

693
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,460
you could have gotten a better deal.

694
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,451
- Where?

695
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:09,583
- Inside.

696
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,560
- The 1.6 liter is $9,700,
but that's wholesale,

697
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,113
the retail is $12,100.

698
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,060
- Reggie, the guy says he'll take it

699
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,340
if we give him a full-size spare.

700
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,570
- Tell him they're $300,
we'll do it for $150.

701
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,870
- Okay.

702
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,703
- What happened?

703
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:30,027
- Nothing, the guy was a
total roach, there's no deal.

704
00:38:30,027 --> 00:38:32,013
- Then get the fuck back
out on the little line.

705
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:35,800
- He said it's too much.

706
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,220
- Eddie, go talk to these fucking mooches.

707
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,080
- No, I think I can do it,
it's just a little too high.

708
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,913
- What are they saying?

709
00:38:40,913 --> 00:38:41,953
- Eddie, right now!

710
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:47,410
- Introduce me. Don't say a word.

711
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,830
- Hey folks, this is my manager, Eddie.

712
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,060
Eddie, Mr. And Mrs. Lennox.

713
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,920
- Hello, pleasure to meet you.

714
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,162
Beautiful dress.

715
00:38:54,162 --> 00:38:54,995
- Thank you.

716
00:38:54,995 --> 00:38:58,388
So, you folks would like to
take this car home today, huh?

717
00:38:58,388 --> 00:39:00,380
- No, uh, we told Bobby
we were just looking.

718
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:04,840
- Well, let me ask you
a couple of questions.

719
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,780
- Do you like the car?

720
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,370
- Well--
- Yes we do.

721
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,360
- Then what's stopping you
from taking it home today?

722
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,193
- The price.

723
00:39:10,193 --> 00:39:13,133
- No, we haven't looked around very much.

724
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,360
- If the price was right,
would you take it home today?

725
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,193
- Yes.

726
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:20,130
- No, actually we want to
look around a little more.

727
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,680
- Okay, well let me see what I can do.

728
00:39:23,423 --> 00:39:24,256
Customer Jack Johnson

729
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:26,795
we found your yellow jacket.

730
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:30,785
Customer Jack Johnson we
found your yellow jacket.

731
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,923
- Would you get back in there
and talk to your customers.

732
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,420
- What are you doing?

733
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,500
- I like the car, I want it.

734
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,300
- Yeah, but you don't tell him that.

735
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,642
- I think they got mad at me.

736
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:55,160
- You're doing a good job,
honey, just get us a good deal.

737
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,563
- Eddie's a good guy,
he'll get you a good deal.

738
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,030
- You're gonna owe me $10
in about five minutes.

739
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,650
- Not if he doesn't close the deal.

740
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,600
Keep them in order.

741
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,020
- She had a knife, what could I do?

742
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:12,050
They won't believe that.

743
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:12,883
She drugged me.

744
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:17,910
There was a gang of bikers.

745
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,860
Call the cops, they kidnapped the lady.

746
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,270
- All right, here we go.

747
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:33,580
Now, on a four-year purchase,
this is your down payment.

748
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,310
And your payment of 48
months is this right here.

749
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,250
- Yeah, but what are we
actually paying for the car?

750
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,460
- Do you have your original worksheet?

751
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,293
- Right here.

752
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,470
- These numbers reflect the
sticker price of the car,

753
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,820
as you can see, these
new ones are a lot lower.

754
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,240
Money can only come from one place.

755
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,180
- I don't know, it's still a little more

756
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,900
than we were planning on.

757
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,400
- Have you considered leasing?

758
00:41:04,356 --> 00:41:06,310
Well, this is what a four
year lease looks like

759
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,143
for the same vehicle.

760
00:41:07,143 --> 00:41:10,020
- Oh, now that's more like it.

761
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,513
- No, that's still a little too high.

762
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,733
- Well, that's the best I can do.

763
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:25,610
I'll tell you what, let
me talk to my boss, okay?

764
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,870
You folks excuse us a minute?

765
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,870
Bobby, come with me.

766
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,190
- I want this car and
that's only $30 a month more

767
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,430
than we thought we could spend.

768
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,760
- Will you stop?

769
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,063
I know what I'm doing.

770
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,600
- There's no deal.

771
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:50,900
The wife wants it.
Husband's got to pay for it.

772
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,290
He's gonna grind me, this guy.

773
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,920
- You owe me ten bucks, you weak suck.

774
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,070
- Me, I'm a weak suck?

775
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:55,903
It's his deal.

776
00:41:55,903 --> 00:41:57,094
- You trained him.

777
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:58,210
- Yeah, and I trained him good too.

778
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,810
- Then how come there's no deal.

779
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,420
- Another $10, you close
the deal, we're even.

780
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,410
- How about $25 he
closes the deal himself?

781
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,387
- Fuck you, Eddie, I don't
want to lose this deal.

782
00:42:09,387 --> 00:42:10,403
- $50 bucks?

783
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,150
How much?

784
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:16,717
- Okay, a C note. But only
if he closes the deal.

785
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:19,280
- $100 if he closes it,
plus the original ten.

786
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,690
- Done.

787
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,970
- Show him this, shake
his hand, the car is sold.

788
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,725
- You didn't show him the counter.

789
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:28,612
- That was better than pussy.

790
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,933
- What the hell are you
laughing at, green pea?

791
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,373
- Closed JJ's lay down.

792
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,323
All cash deal.

793
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,820
- Maybe if I disappear for a week

794
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,120
I can say I was kidnapped.

795
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,800
- Hello, Mrs. Deluca.

796
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,020
Did you happen to know
that you are married

797
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,767
to a very talented salesman?

798
00:43:57,767 --> 00:43:58,760
- You sold a car?

799
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,170
- I sold a car.

800
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,873
- Honey, that's wonderful.

801
00:44:04,118 --> 00:44:08,470
- With the money I made on
this one deal, we can pay rent.

802
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,377
Baby, I'm going to be great at this.

803
00:44:11,377 --> 00:44:13,683
- I'm going to be great
when you get home tonight.

804
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,740
- I have to work late.

805
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,973
- That's okay, it gives
me more time to get ready.

806
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,800
Now go out there and sell another one.

807
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,800
- Okay

808
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,820
I'm going.
- Go.

809
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,980
I'll see you at home.

810
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,160
- One more thing.
- What?

811
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,200
- Hey guys, what would
you call the Flintstones

812
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,150
if they were black?

813
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,505
Niggers.

814
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,050
- Fuck you, you racist cock sucker.

815
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,100
- I'm not a racist, I hate everybody.

816
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,386
- You clan loving, Aryan
nation, militia member,

817
00:44:54,386 --> 00:44:56,803
skinhead, white motherfucker.

818
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,670
No offense.

819
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,620
- Non taken.

820
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,020
- One day there will be
no more racism on earth.

821
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,375
- Yeah, right after the aliens attack.

822
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:08,130
And then we'll all hate green people.

823
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,300
- I can't believe I'm working
for that fucking asshole.

824
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,260
- Why don't you quit?

825
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,930
- I did twice.

826
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:14,920
- Why are you still here?

827
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,610
- Money, baby, money.

828
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,460
This is one high-gross store,

829
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,623
Do you think anywhere you go to sell cars

830
00:45:19,623 --> 00:45:21,540
they fucking rape people like this?

831
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,970
I once made $2,700 on one fucking car.

832
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,820
That is downright, motherfucking,

833
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,670
legalized robbery, my friend.

834
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,503
- Look!

835
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,756
- What's up, sexy?

836
00:45:37,756 --> 00:45:40,613
- Where the fuck have you been?

837
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:41,600
Where's the fucking car?

838
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,840
You realize how many people came in

839
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,867
we could have sold that car too?

840
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:45,150
- Can we talk inside?

841
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,870
- Fuck you, asshole,
where's the fucking car?

842
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,337
- The lady stole it.

843
00:45:49,337 --> 00:45:50,650
- What lady?

844
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,103
- You let some bitch steal the car?

845
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:54,180
- Well, we were...

846
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,783
- You were what?

847
00:45:55,783 --> 00:45:57,850
- Well, we had sex and she--

848
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,000
- You fucked the bitch?

849
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,163
- Well, yeah.

850
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,213
- Marco finally got laid.

851
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:09,563
Did she swallow?

852
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,630
He got a blow job, too!

853
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,993
You are in deep fucking
shit, you stupid asshole.

854
00:46:28,274 --> 00:46:29,107
- Hey there, partner.

855
00:46:29,107 --> 00:46:29,940
- Hey, Eddie.

856
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,500
- Good deal you made today.

857
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,681
- Thanks man, thanks.

858
00:46:33,681 --> 00:46:34,985
- I'm thinkin' maybe I wanna learn more

859
00:46:34,985 --> 00:46:36,240
about this business, you know.

860
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,253
- In this business you don't
need to know a fucking thing.

861
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:41,726
You just have to have the balls to do it.

862
00:46:41,726 --> 00:46:43,580
- Is it really that easy?

863
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,413
- You shitting me.

864
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,920
Half the sales force
can't even speak English.

865
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,690
That's the beauty of
it. Anybody can do it.

866
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:54,410
Look at Mohammad. Brother
barely escapes the Russian army,

867
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,180
he's running through miles of ambushes,

868
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,240
shooting down helicopters
with stinger missiles,

869
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,690
ends up here selling cars.

870
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:01,380
- How does he do it, I mean,
how does he make so much

871
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,260
fucking money here?

872
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,870
- He works his fucking
ass off, man, that's how.

873
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,190
He's trying to raise
enough cash to go back

874
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,070
and get his sister, he left her behind.

875
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,950
- He's a good guy, Mo,
you know, I like him.

876
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:11,783
- Fuck him!

877
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,050
Fuck them all, fuck them
before they fuck you,

878
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,483
and believe me, they will.

879
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,630
- Come on man, it isn't that bad, is it?

880
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,070
- Let me tell you some green pea,

881
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:27,420
there is no room for loyalty
in this whacked out business.

882
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,300
You make your money and to
hell with everybody else.

883
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,810
That deal Eddie closed for you,

884
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,070
we buried that fuck.

885
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,490
He won't even know it
until he tries to get out

886
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:36,630
three or four years from now.

887
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,520
And you, you could've make
at least another half point

888
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,353
on the interest.

889
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:41,760
- We made enough on the deal.

890
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,593
- What?

891
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:45,410
What did you say?

892
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,960
Did you say enough?

893
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,550
Is that like when you're
getting your dick sucked

894
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,353
and right before you cum
you say, "That's enough!"

895
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:56,980
- Never! It's never enough!

896
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,820
I want to blow my load all over the place

897
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,163
and when I'm done, I want
to do it all over again!

898
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:17,393
- Let me ask you something, Eddie.

899
00:48:18,745 --> 00:48:20,695
Do you ever feel bad for
any of your customers?

900
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,713
- Fuck 'em.

901
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,410
Let's go home, man.

902
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:40,592
- Hi.

903
00:48:42,459 --> 00:48:44,009
- I can't believe you still up.

904
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:02,538
You know,

905
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,470
I've been thinking a lot about this job.

906
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,170
Maybe I've been too nice to people,

907
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,213
people I should have stepped on a little.

908
00:49:14,213 --> 00:49:17,030
You know, it would've put me
in a much better position.

909
00:49:18,573 --> 00:49:22,840
But I didn't, because I'm a nice guy.

910
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,510
And every single time it's come right back

911
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,593
and bitten me on the ass.

912
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,023
- How'd you like to bite this ass?

913
00:49:43,516 --> 00:49:45,016
- God, I love you.

914
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,380
- Marco, good news.

915
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,390
The cops found the car and
busted your girlfriend.

916
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,440
The bitch is in jail.

917
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,223
- Are you going to visit in jail, Marco?

918
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,020
- Hey, maybe you can get laid again.

919
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,330
- Better make sure you
go to a woman's jail.

920
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,163
- Why?

921
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:31,393
You can get laid at a
men's jail too, right?

922
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:33,363
- Where's Sean, I'm gonna
kill that Irish fuck.

923
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,230
- How did they find the car?

924
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:37,350
- Oh, this is a good one,
she's a degenerate gambler.

925
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,300
Took the car to Vegas. Guess what?

926
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,521
The bitch won.

927
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,270
- What fucking time are
my meeting's asshole?

928
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:44,720
- I got a note from my doctor.

929
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,439
- Removed moth from right ear?

930
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,940
You had a bug living in your head?

931
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,860
- It crawled in there,
what was I supposed to do?

932
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,410
- Go sit next to Marco,
that's my new genius squad.

933
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,740
- Okay, We gotta pick up the pace.

934
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,934
You guys should be doing a lot better,

935
00:51:05,934 --> 00:51:07,150
you're letting too many customers walk.

936
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,740
I wanna hear some of
their excuses, come on,

937
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,573
try and stump me.

938
00:51:09,573 --> 00:51:11,370
I got an answer for anything.

939
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,203
Come on!

940
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:13,070
- I'm just looking.

941
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,780
- I'm just selling. You
can't really look at a car

942
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,220
unless you drive it. Next.

943
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,010
- I think I can get a
better deal somewhere else.

944
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,940
- Sir, we all pay the same for the cars,

945
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,250
nobody can give you a better deal.

946
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,400
Come INSIDE and I'll show you.

947
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,770
- This is the first place I've been to.

948
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,650
- Then you're lucky you came
to the best place first.

949
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,010
- I have to see what kind of interest rate

950
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,280
my credit union can give me.

951
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,520
- We have a book that lists
all the credit unions.

952
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,820
I can tell you what your
rate and payments will be.

953
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,080
Come on, give me a tough one!

954
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,590
- I have to check with my wife.

955
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:37,423
- What's the phone number?

956
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:38,350
We'll call her right now.

957
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,900
- I have to look at a
couple other cars first.

958
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,733
- Why?

959
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:42,930
Consumer Reports, Car and Driver, AAA,

960
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,400
they've all looked at
the other cars for you,

961
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,720
they say this one's the best.

962
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,465
- I want to look at a Ford.

963
00:51:47,465 --> 00:51:49,900
- Okay, sir, come on.

964
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,530
Drag the fucking guy with you.

965
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:52,680
Where are we going?

966
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,620
To the Ford dealer down
the street asshole.

967
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,390
Come on, we'll compare them side by side.

968
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,810
- I don't have a good credit.

969
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,630
- We can finance anybody.

970
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,760
- I just declared
bankruptcy two weeks ago.

971
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,841
- Then what the fuck are you doing here?

972
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,320
- Okay, you get the idea.

973
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,000
Let's sell some metal, I want credit apps,

974
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,690
I want full write-ups, I want commitments.

975
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,882
I'm buying lunch for the
guy with the first deal.

976
00:52:16,882 --> 00:52:17,899
Let's go!

977
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:22,568
- Let's go kick some ass, baby.

978
00:52:26,072 --> 00:52:27,113
- I want to show you something.

979
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,210
- So that's where he got the new car.

980
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,583
- He's playing with us.

981
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,983
- This is my sister. Her name is Farah,

982
00:52:37,146 --> 00:52:38,980
but I call her Farah June,
when you like somebody

983
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,130
you say June like Bobby, Bobby June.

984
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,420
I've saved almost enough
to bring her over here,

985
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,970
I should have never left her there.

986
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,990
- I'm sure you're do it, Mo.
I mean, you're the top man

987
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,825
this month. So far.

988
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,100
But you better watch out, partner,

989
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,450
cause I'm coming right up behind you,

990
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,983
you know what I'm saying?

991
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,543
- Coming in. Thunderbird.

992
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,500
Welcome to South Side, I am Mohammed--

993
00:53:09,628 --> 00:53:11,628
Welcome to--
- Yeah, we have a salesman.

994
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:16,933
- You lied to us, Nixon.

995
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:18,839
- I uh...

996
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:21,422
- Bobby,
call on line one please

997
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,573
- There you go, again,
setting off the lie detector.

998
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,790
- I didn't say anything.

999
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,870
- That's the amazing
thing about this machine,

1000
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,070
it can tell if you even think a lie.

1001
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,367
- Where's our fucking money?

1002
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:37,292
- I have it.

1003
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,600
All right, I don't have it now,

1004
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,263
but I can make the payments.

1005
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,460
- If you only pay the vig,
you'll never get out from under.

1006
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,633
And now that we know we can't
trust you, we want it all.

1007
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,223
- I can get it.

1008
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,827
- This finger is going to start breaking.

1009
00:53:56,827 --> 00:53:57,690
- Shit!

1010
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,505
I can get it, I can get it.

1011
00:54:00,505 --> 00:54:02,383
- Let's go for a walk.

1012
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,444
- You think I'm bullshitting you guys?

1013
00:54:12,444 --> 00:54:14,740
I was working hard, I was making money,

1014
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,020
things were going better

1015
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,170
than I thought they would, you know?

1016
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,720
I even had a house picked out.

1017
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,802
- Larry Brezner, please
come to the parts department.

1018
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,760
- Sometimes I even slept in
the truck to get early pickups.

1019
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,050
I was living on coffee and fucking donuts.

1020
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,200
It was the coffee that screwed me.

1021
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,040
- Coffee?

1022
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,197
- Yeah, you know, you're drinking so much

1023
00:54:34,197 --> 00:54:37,527
and you don't want to driving.
I was pissing in a big cup,

1024
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:40,400
and I hit a pothole, piss
went all over the place

1025
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,048
and I smashed into another car.

1026
00:54:43,868 --> 00:54:45,260
- Do you hear this?

1027
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,416
He pissed all over himself.

1028
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:49,760
- I don't care what's already happened,

1029
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,663
I just want to know what's gonna happen.

1030
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,230
- Okay, at the rate I'm selling cars,

1031
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,700
if I can make this bonus,
which I will make this bonus,

1032
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,340
I can pay you guys $20,000

1033
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,550
at the end of the month, guaranteed.

1034
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,789
That'll bring me up to
date, what do you say?

1035
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:07,473
- $20,000, on the 30th,

1036
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,681
We'll think about it.

1037
00:55:20,883 --> 00:55:23,353
- Give it to me.

1038
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,810
Come on, what's my name?

1039
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,204
Talk to me.
- JJ

1040
00:55:27,204 --> 00:55:28,037
Talk to me, huh?

1041
00:55:28,037 --> 00:55:29,979
What's my name?

1042
00:55:29,979 --> 00:55:30,812
Talk to me, huh?

1043
00:55:30,812 --> 00:55:32,143
Come on, give it to me, baby.

1044
00:55:35,192 --> 00:55:36,875
Oh fuck, someone's coming.

1045
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,133
- How did JJ pass me?

1046
00:56:15,088 --> 00:56:17,230
He can't even close a screen door.

1047
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:20,260
- Must have soaked that
deal late last night.

1048
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,470
- Okay, sit down.

1049
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,853
Let's get started.

1050
00:56:25,746 --> 00:56:27,171
That was our white trash Irishman

1051
00:56:27,171 --> 00:56:28,940
calling in from jail again.

1052
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:31,540
He's the only salesman I
know who calls in arrested.

1053
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,480
- What happened?

1054
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,570
- Cops pulled him over
doing 75 in a 35 zone.

1055
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:39,653
Found a couple of grams
of coke in his glove box.

1056
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,680
Got to get rid of that fucking idiot.

1057
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:47,400
Okay, let's get started.

1058
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,673
I want to talk about how to
really put somebody together.

1059
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,983
It takes faith. you have to believe.

1060
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:57,570
You have to be a believer.

1061
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,590
JJ, I can heal you.

1062
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,590
You are now white!

1063
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,418
- Fuck off,

1064
00:57:06,418 --> 00:57:08,773
Baby-New-Year-lookin' motherfucker!

1065
00:57:08,773 --> 00:57:10,620
- All right, okay.

1066
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,800
Remember this, people love
to talk about themselves.

1067
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,040
Use that.

1068
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,870
If they have children, tell
them how safe this car is.

1069
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:22,590
If it's a single guy, tell him
how much power this car has.

1070
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,371
And that this car will
get his dick sucked,

1071
00:57:25,204 --> 00:57:27,410
Any idea the customer has, you love it.

1072
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,573
If they hate somebody, you hate them too.

1073
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,720
You guys are the best,
you have to believe that.

1074
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,280
If you don't believe it, fake it.

1075
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,800
Fake it 'till you make it.

1076
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,883
Now, these numbers,
they don't mean a thing.

1077
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:48,010
Guy at the bottom can go
from zero to hero in a day.

1078
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,650
Look at Deluca. The guy never
sold fucking cars in his life,

1079
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,290
he's in the top four.

1080
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:56,290
Go a little crazy, be creative.

1081
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,540
We used to take the trade-in
keys, throw them on the roof.

1082
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:02,590
Sir, you are not leaving
today without buying a car.

1083
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,130
We used to drive the trades out back,

1084
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:06,310
put the bumper up against a
tree, burn out the clutch.

1085
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:09,090
Sir, where the fuck are you going?

1086
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,540
Your car is broken.

1087
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:15,030
We could fix it or you could
use the money as a down payment

1088
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,880
for something new.

1089
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,530
Go crazy! Sell some fucking cars, go!

1090
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:21,363
- Yeah!

1091
00:58:24,012 --> 00:58:26,611
- Come on, man, chill out, JJ.

1092
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:28,337
Come on, let's make some money, buddy.

1093
00:58:33,379 --> 00:58:34,870
- It's me.

1094
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:36,460
We got a little problem.

1095
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,220
- Mr. Garcia, let me ask you.

1096
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,930
If I could get you
$1,000 for your used car,

1097
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:44,560
you'd give me a check for $4,000,

1098
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,797
making your monthly payments
$460 per month, right?

1099
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:51,003
- Come on.

1100
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:53,870
- What's so funny?

1101
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,520
- The price is too much.

1102
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,180
- Okay, let's take the trade.

1103
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,650
If I could get them to give
you $1,100 for the trade

1104
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:01,780
then we'd have a deal, right?

1105
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,580
- I really personally
like the Moonlight blue,

1106
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,129
but you know, you can
make up your own mind.

1107
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,076
Mohammed line seven please,

1108
00:59:08,076 --> 00:59:09,580
Mohamed, line seven.

1109
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,693
- Excuse me, please.

1110
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,760
Yes, this is Mohammad,
who is speaking, please?

1111
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,323
- I'm going to go real
low on the down, $3,900.

1112
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,420
- No.

1113
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,563
- Okay, $3,800,

1114
00:59:32,057 --> 00:59:33,520
$3,750?

1115
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:38,520
- Sir, this is a very
good price. You agree?

1116
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:43,600
- Yes.
- Hi. - Hi.

1117
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,570
- Okay, so you will take it at this price?

1118
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:48,403
- Yessa.

1119
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:52,150
Discounta, yes?

1120
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:56,233
- No, no, I've already given
you the discount, remember?

1121
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,670
- I'm sorry, my bad.

1122
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,350
Yes.

1123
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:12,743
- so we have a deal then?

1124
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,233
- No.

1125
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,873
Bigger discount.

1126
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,320
- Son of a bitch!

1127
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,180
- Man, is he pissed.

1128
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,580
- Thank goodness for Pat Morita

1129
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,180
- I think his head's gonna explode.

1130
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:39,135
Oh man, you are good.

1131
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:46,830
Look, I think if we can get
him to come down another $500

1132
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:48,483
we'll take it.
- Yeah.

1133
01:00:48,483 --> 01:00:49,316
- Okay.

1134
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,263
- Okay, great.

1135
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,400
Sign here. I'm not saying I can do this.

1136
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,750
But I like you, so I'm
going to give it a shot.

1137
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,880
By the way, have you considered leasing?

1138
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,120
- Can we go $325 for 36 months?

1139
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,400
- Done deal, shake his hand.

1140
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,500
- Okay boss, I got him.

1141
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,197
Give me a lease, $800 for the trade,

1142
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:12,263
$3,750 down, $450 a month.

1143
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,623
- Good job, Bobby. You
are one sick individual.

1144
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,560
- See, that is control.

1145
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,770
- That is total control,
you have to be fearless.

1146
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:25,520
If this guy ever took the
time to add up the numbers,

1147
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,183
he'd find out he's paying
almost twice the sticker price

1148
01:01:28,183 --> 01:01:29,539
and he is fucking thrilled.

1149
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:35,710
- Yo, Mo, I just made an
unbelievable deal, man.

1150
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:38,350
It was one of the biggest
commissions this month.

1151
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:39,758
Yeah!

1152
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,040
- She's gone Bobby.

1153
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,433
- Who, your customer, who's gone?

1154
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,870
- My sister, Farah.

1155
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:55,923
She's dead,

1156
01:01:57,397 --> 01:01:59,060
- Oh, Mo.

1157
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,270
Oh man, Mo, I'm so sorry, man.

1158
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:06,590
- It's my fault, I should have
never left her there, Bobby.

1159
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:07,423
It's my fault.

1160
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:15,800
- No, Mo, you can't do that to yourself.

1161
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,493
It's not your fault, you
couldn't have done anything.

1162
01:02:23,557 --> 01:02:24,390
Oh, Mo.

1163
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:45,700
- Partner.
- Shit!

1164
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,267
You scared the piss out of me.

1165
01:02:48,267 --> 01:02:50,610
- I knew we should have
brought a big gulp.

1166
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:52,660
- You know, partner, we've been thinking.

1167
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,820
Your chances of paying us
off aren't looking too good

1168
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:56,304
right now.

1169
01:02:56,304 --> 01:02:57,137
- Now listen to me,

1170
01:02:57,137 --> 01:02:58,250
I'm being totally straight with you guys.

1171
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,490
I have a really good chance
of nailing this bonus.

1172
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:03,470
- No, you listen. We
already gave you a chance,

1173
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:04,510
and you know what?

1174
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:06,090
Most people only get one.

1175
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,484
- We want the combination.

1176
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:09,050
Pumpkin seed?

1177
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:11,150
- No. What combination?

1178
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:13,050
- Don't fuck with me when I'm thirsty!

1179
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:15,900
- The safe.

1180
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,923
I saw money going in the safe.

1181
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,123
- How am I supposed to get that?

1182
01:03:20,123 --> 01:03:21,573
- Just get the fucking thing!

1183
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:25,860
- Bobby, does your girl
like pumpkin seeds?

1184
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,808
- You motherfucker.

1185
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:33,923
- Did that hurt?

1186
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,780
Looks like it really hurt.

1187
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:41,690
He hasn't done that to me in
a long time, but when he did,

1188
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,900
I remember it really hurt.

1189
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,353
By tomorrow partner.

1190
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,940
- Oh, come on, I told you guys,

1191
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,593
I told you I will have the
money by the end of the month.

1192
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:03,240
What does that mean?

1193
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,690
I don't owe THAT money
anymore, what do you mean?

1194
01:04:14,774 --> 01:04:17,713
Okay, just give me a couple of days.

1195
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:19,660
No, I said I'll do it.

1196
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:22,010
I just need a little time, I gotta go.

1197
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:23,920
I've gotta go, I've got customers.

1198
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,870
I'll call you back.

1199
01:04:26,307 --> 01:04:27,693
Mr. Garcia, hello.

1200
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,680
Can I help you with something? Sir?

1201
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,323
- We went to our credit union.

1202
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:38,143
They explained to me
that if I buy this car,

1203
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:40,923
I cannot afford to feed my family.

1204
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,223
Please, Mr. Deluca, can we give it back?

1205
01:04:53,821 --> 01:04:55,360
- Oh, no.

1206
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,993
- Mr DeLuca, please.

1207
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,533
Could you please take it back.

1208
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,610
- Mr. Garcia, I'm sorry.

1209
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,860
I don't think I can help.

1210
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:27,950
Let me see what I can do.

1211
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,900
Hey Reggie,

1212
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,260
these people came in yesterday,

1213
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:42,260
um, and uh, I want to help them out.

1214
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,410
I mean, they, really can't afford this.

1215
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:47,370
We overdid it. And the car
is going to be in repo anyway

1216
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:48,220
if they go bankrupt.

1217
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:52,500
So, what do you say we cut 'em some slack?

1218
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,333
- Let me see it.

1219
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,346
Is this is your name here?

1220
01:06:13,346 --> 01:06:14,193
- Yes, sir.

1221
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:17,600
- You're an owner, get
the fuck outta here.

1222
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,280
- Sorry Mr. Garcia, I really tried.

1223
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,523
I am so sorry.

1224
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,930
- Another day of dealing with idiots

1225
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:05,546
who want a $10,000 discount.

1226
01:07:06,437 --> 01:07:08,110
If somebody else tells me
how they hate car salesmen,

1227
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:09,720
I swear, I'm going to snap.

1228
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,413
- I met a guy yesterday,
who would only buy a car

1229
01:07:11,413 --> 01:07:13,864
that was built on a Wednesday.

1230
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:14,814
What a fucking retard.

1231
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:18,783
- You know what, I can't
handle the shit anymore!

1232
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:24,670
Reggie's right, we're a
bunch of fucking whores.

1233
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:29,670
A bunch of uneducated, arrogant,
goddamn, fucking whores.

1234
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,080
How can you blame these poor bastards?

1235
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,570
Every single person that
walks into this place

1236
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:38,320
has been raped by a car salesman.

1237
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,170
And they know beyond a shadow of a doubt,

1238
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:42,623
it's going to happen again.

1239
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:46,810
Do you want to know why I'm here?

1240
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:49,920
I'm here because I tried to
make something of my life

1241
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,103
and I failed, but at
least I gave it a shot.

1242
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:57,150
Javier, if you weren't selling cars,

1243
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:59,320
you'd either be washing
them or stealing them.

1244
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:03,110
Shamim, you think you're
better than everybody else?

1245
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,590
Let me tell you something,
the cars you're selling

1246
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:08,600
are worth more than the
hometown you grew up in.

1247
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,280
You see these people, they
don't earn their money

1248
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,373
by fucking other people out of it.

1249
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,980
And all they want to do is
put a little food on the table

1250
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,140
for their children.

1251
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,927
Maybe send them to a
decent school or something.

1252
01:08:20,927 --> 01:08:25,160
And then, we come along and
take them for everything we can.

1253
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,750
And you know what's
worse, we're so good at it

1254
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:28,880
that when we're done,

1255
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,383
most of them think we're
heroes for doing it.

1256
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,550
If you're going to
steal from these people,

1257
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:39,370
at least show them just
a little bit of respect.

1258
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:42,413
Let's not insult them
any more than we have to.

1259
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:55,150
- I think the green pea
aint no green pea no more.

1260
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:57,263
Are we taking advantage of people?

1261
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,373
Let us take a look.

1262
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:05,210
Your job is to sell a car
for as much as you can.

1263
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:07,100
The customer's job is to buy the car

1264
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,040
for as little as possible.

1265
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,860
Why should you feel guilty
about being better at your job

1266
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,647
than somebody else is at theirs?

1267
01:09:16,209 --> 01:09:18,010
You know, if I went with a
customer to get a deal on the car

1268
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:20,020
and I told them we were
going to fuck the salesman,

1269
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,513
he would love it.

1270
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,590
If he makes a good deal, he
takes money out of your pocket.

1271
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:28,090
If you make a good deal,
you take money out of his.

1272
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:30,310
What's the difference?

1273
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:31,620
Now, if somebody buys a car

1274
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:35,670
and he leaves thinking he got
screwed, then he is an idiot.

1275
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,950
The buyer has all the control.

1276
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:41,750
He can get up and leave at any time.

1277
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:46,020
He does not own that car until
he drives it off the lot.

1278
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,090
Not when he signs the papers,

1279
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:52,643
he does not own that car
until he takes delivery.

1280
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,530
So who has the control, huh?

1281
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:57,980
If he got fucked, he fucked himself.

1282
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,360
It's that simple.

1283
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:05,180
Be proud of what you do. Be the best

1284
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:08,463
And never, never apologize for it.

1285
01:10:13,806 --> 01:10:15,610
- I'm thinking of quitting, Mo.

1286
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,893
- No, you can be a great salesman.

1287
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,770
Don't let Reggie ruin you.

1288
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:22,590
Make the deals you can live with.

1289
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:26,920
- When I'm gone, Bobby
June, you'll become top man.

1290
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,460
- Where are you going?

1291
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:31,720
- Afghanistan. I have to get the assholes

1292
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,706
that killed my sister.

1293
01:10:33,706 --> 01:10:34,539
- What are you talking about, Mo?

1294
01:10:34,539 --> 01:10:36,530
You can't go back there.

1295
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:37,660
They'll never let you out.

1296
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,503
- I don't care.

1297
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:44,890
You're a good man, but
don't stay here too long.

1298
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:46,461
They'll take it away from you

1299
01:10:46,461 --> 01:10:48,111
- Reggie, line 12.

1300
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,273
- Yeah.

1301
01:10:53,273 --> 01:10:54,710
- Are we on schedule?

1302
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:56,103
- The car just came in.

1303
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:00,200
No, the idiot's still in lock up.

1304
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,210
No bail yet, I'll unload
it myself tonight.

1305
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:06,236
- You fucking better.

1306
01:11:18,299 --> 01:11:19,900
- It must've been a family member.

1307
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,893
- Fuck you.

1308
01:11:20,893 --> 01:11:22,110
- Hey fuck me,

1309
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,350
Randall sold the car.

1310
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:24,183
- Leave me alone.

1311
01:11:24,183 --> 01:11:25,400
- Did your Uncle Joe make parole?

1312
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,830
- Shut up.
- No, this is good.

1313
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:28,500
Randall sold a car.

1314
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:33,690
- Randall to the
men's room. Customer waiting.

1315
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:37,590
- Shut up, Eddie.

1316
01:11:43,377 --> 01:11:44,920
- You got it?

1317
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,047
- Yeah, I got it.

1318
01:11:49,908 --> 01:11:50,741
- Good.

1319
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:56,220
I want to buy me a car.

1320
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,968
Now, dick head.

1321
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,120
- Three cash deals, not bad.

1322
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:09,093
- Looking at all this money
just makes you want to cry.

1323
01:12:11,588 --> 01:12:13,220
- Donna!

1324
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,053
We gotta go.

1325
01:12:14,053 --> 01:12:15,620
We gotta to go right now before...

1326
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,285
I'll explain later, we
don't have much time.

1327
01:12:17,285 --> 01:12:18,200
- Wait a minute.

1328
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,900
Bobby, what are you talking about?

1329
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,480
- Hey, Nixon.

1330
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,817
We've been waiting for you to get home.

1331
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:26,473
- May we come in?

1332
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:31,070
- Everett, why don't you
tie up Bobby's lovely wife.

1333
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,820
And you put these on.

1334
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:48,373
- Hey, Reg!

1335
01:12:49,973 --> 01:12:51,190
What would you call the Flintstones

1336
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:52,980
if somebody shot their nuts off?

1337
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:53,813
- Yeah, what would you call them?

1338
01:12:53,813 --> 01:12:54,760
What would you call them!

1339
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,833
Wouldn't be nigga, would it?

1340
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,790
- You're not so humorous tonight, Reggie.

1341
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:04,863
Come on white boy, tell me a joke.

1342
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:09,810
Hey, I wonder, is killing
the general manager

1343
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:11,476
grounds for dismissal?

1344
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,850
- Wait, I can cut you in.

1345
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:21,485
Long term, a shipment every week.

1346
01:13:22,318 --> 01:13:24,163
I'm loving this shit, man!

1347
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,200
I can't believe you're still
trying to put me together, man.

1348
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,473
The balls on you! Damn Reggie.

1349
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:34,500
I tell you what, I'll make you a deal.

1350
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,420
You tell me one of your
very funny nigger jokes,

1351
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,510
one that I haven't heard before

1352
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:42,840
and I'll let your pale ass
live for three more minutes.

1353
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,240
You got three seconds to
start joking, white boy.

1354
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,043
Now!

1355
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:58,720
- St. Peter is at his gate,
when three black guys walk up.

1356
01:13:59,627 --> 01:14:01,293
- Nuh-uh. Uh-uh.

1357
01:14:01,293 --> 01:14:05,280
- Three niggers, walk up.

1358
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,850
St. Peter runs back to God and says,

1359
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:10,030
there's three niggers at
the gate, what should I do?

1360
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:13,350
God says there's no racism
here, go back and welcome them.

1361
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:14,410
After a few minutes,

1362
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:17,430
St. Peter runs back
and says, they're gone.

1363
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:20,993
God says, "Who, the niggers?"

1364
01:14:20,993 --> 01:14:24,175
Saint Peter says, "No, the Gates"

1365
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,700
- That wasn't funny, Reggie.

1366
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:33,840
You don't seem to understand

1367
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,590
when something isn't funny, do you?

1368
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:37,913
Give me another one.

1369
01:14:37,913 --> 01:14:39,020
Come on, just give me another one.

1370
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,204
Come on, Reggie.

1371
01:14:40,204 --> 01:14:41,460
Let's go!

1372
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,570
- A woman tells a police sketch artist,

1373
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:47,590
she was mugged by a
blue-eyed, blonde-haired,

1374
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:49,200
well-dressed man.

1375
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:53,570
The sketch artist draws a
picture of a black--a nigger.

1376
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,263
The woman says, that's him.

1377
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,637
- Hey, I got one, two niggers-

1378
01:15:00,637 --> 01:15:03,720
- Would you shut the fuck up!

1379
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:04,553
- Man, fuck.

1380
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:11,967
- Kill his ass.

1381
01:15:13,237 --> 01:15:14,587
- Somebody's coming.

1382
01:15:23,702 --> 01:15:28,702
Shit!

1383
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:31,480
- It's over there.

1384
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:45,630
- Relax, Nixon.

1385
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:47,230
We'll be out of here in no time.

1386
01:15:49,309 --> 01:15:50,142
- Fuck!

1387
01:15:50,142 --> 01:15:50,975
- Try it again.

1388
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,810
What's wrong with those numbers?

1389
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:56,080
- Motherfucker!

1390
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,810
- Talk fast.

1391
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:03,264
- I didn't have enough
time again to get them.

1392
01:16:03,264 --> 01:16:04,220
- He screwed us!

1393
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:06,940
- No, give me a chance
to find the combination.

1394
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:07,773
I'm sure it's in here .

1395
01:16:07,773 --> 01:16:10,461
The old man, he don't remember anything.

1396
01:16:10,461 --> 01:16:11,870
I can find them.

1397
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:18,493
- You got 60 seconds.

1398
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:22,660
- Just kill him and get
the fuck out of here!

1399
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,660
- In less than a minute.

1400
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,333
- Time's up.

1401
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,820
- This asshole doesn't read books.

1402
01:16:58,820 --> 01:16:59,693
Wait, wait!

1403
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,200
This must be it.

1404
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,546
- Then do it.

1405
01:17:18,293 --> 01:17:20,671
- That's a little distracting.

1406
01:17:20,671 --> 01:17:21,754
- Just do it.

1407
01:17:36,259 --> 01:17:37,920
- That's it. Let's waste him.

1408
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,745
- Sorry, Bobby, it's just business.

1409
01:17:39,745 --> 01:17:40,620
- Hey!

1410
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,810
Let's toss those guns up
on the desk first boys!

1411
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:43,643
- Who the fuck are you?

1412
01:17:43,643 --> 01:17:46,560
- You toss them guns or
you'll never find out.

1413
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,537
Now!

1414
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:50,537
- Let's go motherfuckers!
- Move it!

1415
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:53,684
- Get the fuck over there bitch.

1416
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:03,253
I guess I win the bonus.

1417
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:09,070
Let's kill these motherfuckers.

1418
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:10,810
Sorry, Bobby, nothing personal.

1419
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:12,280
- Why are you doing this, JJ?

1420
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,930
- Because man, we've been
here all night, I'm tired,

1421
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:16,630
and a nigga just wants to go home.

1422
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:18,723
Do it.

1423
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:32,007
- About fucking time!

1424
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:33,807
- We had to go looking for you.

1425
01:18:41,882 --> 01:18:43,520
- Who are the spectators?

1426
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,640
Soon to be dead witnesses.

1427
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,640
- Sorry, Bobby.

1428
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,570
- Listen, Reggie, let's
talk about this shit, man.

1429
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:49,573
Come on, please.

1430
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,650
- You are so beyond fucked,

1431
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:55,063
you couldn't catch a bus back to fucked.

1432
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,160
We gotta weigh this shit out.

1433
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,742
Kill 'em so we can get outta here.

1434
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:02,902
- What the fuck is going on?

1435
01:19:02,902 --> 01:19:04,330
- Don't move.

1436
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,163
- Christ, Mo.

1437
01:19:05,163 --> 01:19:05,996
What the hell are you doing here?

1438
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:07,533
- Are we expecting anybody else?

1439
01:19:07,533 --> 01:19:09,420
- What is this Reggie?

1440
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,515
- Mo, stand over there.

1441
01:19:11,515 --> 01:19:12,885
- Now!

1442
01:19:12,885 --> 01:19:15,385
- You think I'm scared of you?

1443
01:20:00,117 --> 01:20:02,450
- You all right, Bobby June?

1444
01:20:04,389 --> 01:20:05,306
- I'm fine.

1445
01:20:06,571 --> 01:20:08,488
Mo?

1446
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:10,692
Fuck.

1447
01:20:10,692 --> 01:20:13,261
- Looks like you win
the bonus, Bobby June.

1448
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:15,094
- Fuck the bonus, man.

1449
01:20:31,073 --> 01:20:34,020
- What do you call three dead drug dealers

1450
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:38,723
and five dead low lives
in a car dealership?

1451
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:41,083
A good start.

1452
01:20:45,478 --> 01:20:47,610
- You look pretty bad there, Reggie.

1453
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:51,643
- Fucking JJ, I was
starting to like him too.

1454
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,420
I'll tell you something, kid,

1455
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,853
don't ever get shot, hurts like hell.

1456
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:15,070
- Oh wow, Bobby, look at all the people.

1457
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:16,410
- Just go to work like normal.

1458
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:17,910
Everything will be fine, okay?

1459
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:21,280
We work here, officer.

1460
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,830
- Okay, go ahead.
- Thank you.

1461
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:27,053
Hey Eddie, what happened?

1462
01:22:28,813 --> 01:22:31,920
- Reggie fucked himself
good last night. JJ too.

1463
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,120
Stupid assholes were
selling more than cars.

1464
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,080
I can't believe they
were working together,

1465
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,030
Sure had me fooled.

1466
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,963
Mohammed too. They're all dead.

1467
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,170
This place wasn't a car dealership,

1468
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:46,513
it was a goddamn pharmacy.

1469
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:51,557
- So, you didn't notice
anything out of the ordinary?

1470
01:22:51,557 --> 01:22:53,600
- No, everything seemed
pretty normal when I left,

1471
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,113
I think it was about 10 o'clock.

1472
01:22:58,860 --> 01:22:59,693
That's it?

1473
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,513
- That's it.

1474
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:07,110
- You like this car?

1475
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:08,910
- Yeah. V8?

1476
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:11,740
- Yeah, it's a V8. You
should take it for a drive.

1477
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,727
- Nah.

1478
01:23:12,727 --> 01:23:14,130
- Yeah, you should take it for a drive.

1479
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:16,310
Check out the front here,
right up here in front.

1480
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:18,650
There's even a holder for your donuts.

1481
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:19,843
- Get the fuck outta here.

1482
01:23:26,003 --> 01:23:27,230
- You okay?

1483
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:28,063
- Yeah.

1484
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,883
- Do you still love me?

1485
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:36,480
- Unfortunately.

1486
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:41,050
- Enough to pull the invoice for this car?

1487
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:44,313
- You want to show the
invoice to a customer?

1488
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:46,173
- Why not?

1489
01:23:46,173 --> 01:23:47,006
He asked.

1490
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:51,540
- What would Reggie say?

1491
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,890
- Oh, nothing. I'm sure right about now,

1492
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:55,440
he's probably trying to fuck the devil out

1493
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,540
of an air conditioner.

1494
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,560
- Thanks a lot, Bobby.

1495
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,050
- Have a good one, detective.

1496
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:08,823
- Take it easy.
- You too partner.

1497
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,660
- How much did I make on that deal, Eddie?

1498
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:20,220
- Not a whole lot. A double maybe.

1499
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,460
- Good.

1500
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:24,224
- You got a $10,000 bonus coming, though.

1501
01:24:24,224 --> 01:24:26,290
- This is one crazy
fucking business, Eddie.

1502
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:27,243
- Hey, partner.

1503
01:24:27,243 --> 01:24:28,682
I know it's your first
month but don't worry,

1504
01:24:28,682 --> 01:24:30,382
they're not all as crazy as this.

1505
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,685
- Reggie dial one, please.

1506
01:24:33,685 --> 01:24:37,045
Uh, Reggie -- cancel that.
