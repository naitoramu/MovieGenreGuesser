1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,922
This one's rare.
This one's medium. Go!

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,133
Hey, Phoebe!
How was dinner?!

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:12,555
Dinner was good! Just saying hi!
Now I'm gonna go!

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,350
- Well, hello there.
- Hi.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,186
I didn't see this on the menu.

6
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,605
This is Tim, my new sous chef.

7
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,692
- So you're Monica's boss?
- No, she's my boss.

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,780
- "Sous" is French for "under."
- I "sous-stand."

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,034
Tim, I need a caesar salad.
And could you get me the pesto?

10
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,954
- You made pesto?
- Yes, I did.

11
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,248
Would you say your pesto
is the best-o?

12
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,836
I don't know.
I would say it's pretty good-o.

13
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,424
I still need the salad.

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,718
- Great necklace.
- I made it.

15
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:55,514
- You are so talented.
- Well, it's no pesto.

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,309
Let's just cut to the chase.
You're both single.

17
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,396
He gets off at 11.
Call her.

18
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:07,943
I'll give him your number if I could
just get a caesar salad!

19
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:13,866
I did not yell.
I am not putting a dollar in the jar.

20
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,534

23
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,953
- Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
- You know me, sir.

24
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,499
How can I get
around the computer network...

25
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:07,878
...so I can access
the really good Internet porn?

26
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,255
You're a joker, Bing.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,343
What's funny about that?

28
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:19,264
- Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
- Where do you wanna go?

29
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,475
I think you know.

30
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,227
- The Hard Rock Cafe?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,481
- Again?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,529
- I'm telling you, I like the food.
- You like the "Purple Rain" display.

33
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,575
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Toby. Have a good night.

34
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:43,455
- Did that guy just call you Toby?
- Yeah, he thinks that's my name.

35
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:48,586
- Why don't you correct him?
- It's been way too long now.

36
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,089
The first time, I didn't say anything.

37
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,759
The next time he said,
"Toby, want a doughnut?"

38
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,762
And I wanted the doughnut.

39
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,391
Five years later, the doughnut's gone
and I'm still Toby.

40
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:07,771
- Chandler, you have to tell him.
- That would be so awkward.

41
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,274
We don't work together.
He's on the sixth floor.

42
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,403
So he calls me Toby once in a while.

43
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,322
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.

44
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:22,286
Muriel.
Why would he call you Muriel?

45
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,167
Oh, my God.

46
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,338
Chandler "M." Bing.

47
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:38,385
It's not just an "M."
Your middle name is Muriel!

48
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,305
It is a family name.

49
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:45,308
Chandler Muriel Bing.

50
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:50,064
Your parents never even
gave you a chance, did they?

51
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,569
Drake, I've discovered the reason
for your memory loss.

52
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,738
Your brain transplant
wasn't successful.

53
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,825
Your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.

54
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,203
Is it serious?

55
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:08,207
Not if we extract tissue
from the original body...

56
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:13,045
...and synthesize antibodies
to stop you from rejecting the brain.

57
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,882
That sounds simple enough.
Let's just do that.

58
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,927
We would, but when we went
to exhume Jessica's body...

59
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,430
...it was gone.

60
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,103
Cut.
Very nice, people.

61
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,480
I'll change and we can go.

62
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:36,234
- What happened to Jessica's body?
- You'll have to see it on TV.

63
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,488
- You don't know, do you?
- Couldn't care less.

64
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,659
- Good scene, man.
- You too.

65
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,081
What? You weren't in it.

66
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,252
Kash, this is my friend Rachel.
Rachel, Kash.

67
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,340
- Hi.
- Why haven't I seen you here before?

68
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:04,513
Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.
He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.

69
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,015
Which I'm not.
I'm not.

70
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:12,562
Although, I do know your favorite
ice cream flavor is butter pecan.

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,234
And your dog's name is Wally.

72
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,779
- Look, I'm just stroking your arm.
- Let's go!

73
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,990
Bye, Kash.
Say hi to Wally.

74
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,414
- Monica.
- Hi.

75
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:35,627
I had the best time
with Tim last night. He is so sweet.

76
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,506
I can't wait
to get "sous-neath" him.

77
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,467
- I have to fire him.
- Why?

78
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:46,055
He's terrible.
He's slow. He burns things.

79
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,974
He lit my pastry chef on fire.

80
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,478
He was nervous.
You can be intimidating.

81
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,523
And your pastry chef can stand
to be taken down a peg.

82
00:05:56,732 --> 00:06:00,444
Well, now she has no eyebrows.
Mission accomplished.

83
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,947
But Monica, he loves his job so much.

84
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,910
Can't you just give him
another chance, please?

85
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,748
All right. But if he lights
someone else on fire, he's gone.

86
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,127
That's fair. Thank you so much.

87
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,297
Looks like he got you
a little bit too.

88
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,551
I paid to have this done.

89
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,930
Love it!

90
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:35,020
Hey. You know,
Kash really liked you.

91
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,355
He thought you were charming.

92
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,610
- I thought I was an idiot.
- I'm with you.

93
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:48,158
- He asked if you'd go out with him.
- I think I'm gonna throw up a little.

94
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,494
- What did you say?
- "No."

95
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,537
What?

96
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:57,960
I figured since you're pregnant,
you're not gonna be seeing people.

97
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:03,590
First of all, Kash Ford?
Not people.

98
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,385
Did you tell him I was pregnant?

99
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:12,390
No. I didn't know if you told people.
This was when Kash was still "people."

100
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,394
- Good. Just have him call me.
- I don't think that's...

101
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:21,316
Go do it or I'll come back
to that set. I'll meet more actors.

102
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,738
- Hey, Bob.
- How's my pal Toby doing today?

103
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,867
If I see him, I'll ask.

104
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,456
Was that Bob from six
you were just talking to?

105
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,417
- Yeah.
- You know him?

106
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,086
We're on a semi-first-name basis.

107
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:46,133
- What about adding him to our team?
- Bob?

108
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:52,306
Working here with us? Every day?
I don't know if he has what it takes.

109
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:56,351
- They love him down on six.
- But this is 11.

110
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:59,730
It's almost twice as hard up here.

111
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,859
- Okay, Bob will stay put.
- I think it's best, sir.

112
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:11,158
We do need to find somebody. I've got
a stack of documents this high.

113
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,787
Just toss them in the shredder
and claim you never got them.

114
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,957
That's a good one, Bing.

115
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:24,046
What does a guy have to do
to be taken seriously around here?

116
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:32,638
I gave him another chance,
but Tim has got to go.

117
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,391
I called the chef
who recommended him to me.

118
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,937
He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"

119
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,940
- But don't fire him today.
- Why?

120
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:47,069
- Because I'm dumping him today.
- You said he was sweet.

121
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:51,114
He's too sweet.
He calls me all the time.

122
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,910
"Did you get home okay?"
"Was your shower okay?"

123
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,164
- Don't pick up the phone.
- Then he comes over!

124
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,416
"I was worried."
Be a man!

125
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,003
So I can't fire him?

126
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,464
And dump him the same day?
He'll kill himself.

127
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:14,180
- Go out with him for another week.
- Are you kidding? I'll kill myself.

128
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,683
Then he'll just have to deal with it.

129
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:24,148
Okay. But who's gonna go first?
Whoever goes second is the bitch.

130
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,526
- What?
- Fire a guy that's just been dumped?

131
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:31,363
Bitch!
And dump a guy that's just been fired?

132
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,490
Blond bitch!

133
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:38,162
I wanted to do this days ago,
so I think I should go first.

134
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,748
All right, that makes sense.

135
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,002
But screw you! I'm going first!

136
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,717
Toby, you got a sec?

137
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:56,889
I wanted to get transferred up here,
but it's not gonna happen.

138
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:01,477
Apparently somebody thinks
I'm not "11 th-floor material."

139
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,856
Say, who the hell is this Chandler?

140
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,820
What's the best excuse for why
I'm not drinking?

141
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,031
"I'm a recovering alcoholic,"
"I'm a Mormon"...

142
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:19,620
...or "I got so hammered last night
I'm still a little drunk"?

143
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,916
What do you want to do tonight?

144
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:28,211
There's a powerful Ukrainian film
playing. Interested?

145
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,799
No. But I'll go see
a normal-person movie with you.

146
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,137
- Rach, you wanna come?
- I can't. I've got a date.

147
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,016
- A date?
- Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?

148
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:46,021
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird.
It's regular.

149
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:50,400
It's mundane.
It's actually a little dull.

150
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,529
It's no Ukrainian film.

151
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,906
Earrings!

152
00:10:56,615 --> 00:11:02,371
- She's got a date? With who?
- I set her up with this actor.

153
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:07,292
- You set her up?
- No.

154
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,754
- What were you thinking?
- That it was okay...

155
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,882
...because you two haven't dated
in years.

156
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:19,471
I'm worried about my baby.
Whoever she dates, my baby dates.

157
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:25,936
- Where is this "actor" taking them?
- Hey! I'm an "actor" too.

158
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:30,816
They're taking the ferry
to a place on Staten Island.

159
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:37,197
My baby's going on a ferry? Do you
have any idea how dangerous those are?

160
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:41,535
Aren't we talking about
those big boats that go really slow?

161
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:47,666
Why not just jump out of an airplane
or burn each other with matches?

162
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,340
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Kash. Ross, this is Kash.

163
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,928
Hey, I hear you're going
on a ferry tonight.

164
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,514
Bit of a daredevil, are we?

165
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,643
Do you guys think this is too slutty?
Hi, Kash.

166
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:11,607
- Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?
- Yeah. See you guys later.

167
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:16,612
Have a great time, you guys.
And yes, it is too slutty!

168
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:31,668
I'm glad you called.
I feel like I'm always calling you.

169
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,880
What's up?
Is everything okay with Phoebe?

170
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,593
It will be in a minute.

171
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:44,556
- Tim, you're a really great guy.
- That's because I'm with you.

172
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,230
It's just, I'm in a place in my life
right now where...

173
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,443
So sorry. "This just in."

174
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,281
It's the restaurant.
Monica needs me.

175
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:04,159
No, she doesn't! I know what that is.
You can stay.

176
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,287
I'll miss you too, Pheebs.

177
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:12,293
And I will be holding you right here.

178
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:24,179
What movie do you wanna see?
And not one I have to read.

179
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,473
I get that from books.

180
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,978
- Books?
- Okay, car magazines, cereal boxes...

181
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,604
...but it's enough!

182
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:38,027
Let's not see a movie.
We'll just stay here and hang.

183
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:44,616
- Just wait for Rachel to come back?
- Hey, if that's what you wanna do.

184
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,369
Dude, what is going on?

185
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,914
- I have to find out how it went.
- Why?

186
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:56,419
- He could be my baby's stepfather.
- One date and they're getting married?

187
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,006
He's not you!

188
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,010
I can't believe she's dating!

189
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,598
- What did you think she was gonna do?
- I don't know.

190
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:12,519
- I can't believe this is happening.
- What do you mean?

191
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:17,149
I thought when I had another kid,
it'd be different.

192
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:23,447
I love Ben. But every time
I drop him off at Carol and Susan's...

193
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,533
...it breaks my heart a little.

194
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:31,539
I've always had this picture
of me and my next wife in bed...

195
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:37,628
...my kid comes running in, leaps up
on the bed and we all read the paper.

196
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:41,131
Maybe fight over the science section.

197
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:48,013
- That's nice. You can still have that.
- No. Rachel's out with some guy.

198
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,183
My baby went with her.

199
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,355
If anything, that picture
keeps moving further away.

200
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,483
Hey, can I ask you something?

201
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:05,989
In this picture of you and your wife,
is your wife Rachel?

202
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,285
It used to be.

203
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,872
Now she doesn't really have a face.

204
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,376
Smokin' body, though.

205
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:24,049
Good call. But the face, Ross,
the face isn't Rachel.

206
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:28,345
No. But how much easier would it be
if it were?

207
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,680
That's not what she wants.

208
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,935
I know. And I can't force myself
to fall in love with her.

209
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,480
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.

210
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,567
It won't be what you thought.
But no matter what...

211
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:47,489
...there's gonna be
a brand-new little baby. Your baby.

212
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,201
Who cares what the picture looks like?

213
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,499
Let's you and me go out
and have some fun.

214
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,377
Whatever you want. Come on.

215
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:05,591
- We can catch that Ukrainian film.
- No, I said fun.

216
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,344
- Hey, Toby?
- Hey, Bobby.

217
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,473
It's Bob, actually.

218
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:17,895
You work up here. Where's
Chandler Bing's office?

219
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,857
Yeah, it's right...

220
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,861
Right there.
Let me ask you, why?

221
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:30,198
I wanna talk to that bastard,
see what his problem is.

222
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm the reason you didn't get the job.

223
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,330
- Toby, don't.
- Bob.

224
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:42,127
Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover
for him.

225
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:46,715
Anything you say will just get me
more upset with Chandler.

226
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:50,302
That puts me
in a difficult position.

227
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,308
- Is everything okay?
- That depends.

228
00:16:56,558 --> 00:17:00,562
- How are you and Phoebe?
- Great. Thanks for introducing us.

229
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:05,859
My pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

230
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,112
- Phoebe!
- Monica!

231
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,407
- You're fired!
- I'm breaking up with you!

232
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,617
I'm breaking up with you.

233
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,038
- You're fired.
- Why?

234
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:22,460
I'm sorry. I'm not ready
for a relationship right now.

235
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:27,047
I'm sorry too.
But I like things done a certain way.

236
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:32,636
- The chemistry's just not right.
- The chemistry thing for us too.

237
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:37,975
Wow. Okay.

238
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:45,482
I realize I came on a little strong.
It's because I think you're amazing.

239
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:51,947
I wanna tell you how much I appreciate
you giving me an opportunity.

240
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:55,700
You're the most talented chef
I've ever worked for.

241
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,204
Anyway...

242
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,754
- Tim, wait.
- Yeah?

243
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:12,801
I spoke too quickly. There's
a learning curve with this job.

244
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,679
Maybe we could try it again.

245
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,474
Thank you so much.
I know I can be better.

246
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,523
And Tim, I just want to say
good luck here.

247
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,907
- Hello.
- Hi.

248
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,493
How was the date?

249
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:43,248
I'm alone and I just bought $ 15 worth
of candy bars. What do you think?

250
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:47,878
- What happened?
- I told him I was pregnant.

251
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:52,883
- He didn't take it so well?
- Well, better than you.

252
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,303
- But still not what you want.
- Oh?

253
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:00,140
Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
Then he said:

254
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,394
"I hear those hemorrhoids
are a bitch."

255
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,605
- He sounds swell.
- Doesn't he?

256
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:12,028
You want a little cheering up?
Sit down.

257
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,615
Guess whose middle name is Muriel?

258
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:24,957
Chandler M. Bing.
Oh, my God.

259
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,838
- I'm sorry about your date.
- It's all right.

260
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:35,509
I guess I'm just done
with the dating thing.

261
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,222
Just one more thing in my life
that's completely different.

262
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:44,351
- This is hard.
- Yeah, I know.

263
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:52,400
On the other hand, in seven months
you're gonna have something...

264
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:58,532
...that you're gonna love more than
any guy you've ever gone out with.

265
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,660
Just wait.

266
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,333
Wait until the first time
your baby grabs your finger.

267
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,002
You have no idea.

268
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,964
Thanks, sweetie.

269
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:23,598
- You wanna grab some coffee?
- No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.

270
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:28,562
- I thought I cheered you up.
- You did. There are 20 in here.

271
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,898
- Good night.
- Good night.

272
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:43,035
Ross? Hey, it's Mona.
From the wedding.

273
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,871
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

274
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:51,126
- How are you?
- I'm good, except you owe me a dance.

275
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:57,215
That's right. Well, would you be
interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?

276
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,303
Oh, you're serious. Sure.

277
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,432
Great. Well...

278
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:11,229
- I think I need another cup of coffee.
- Sure, let me get it for you.

279
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:28,997
Bob?

280
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,666
Bob!

281
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:38,048
- What the hell are you doing?
- This is Chandler's office.

282
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,343
Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!

283
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:54,690
