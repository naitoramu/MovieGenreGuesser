Why can't it
just be the two of us?

It is. This is a

I didn't see my father for
the first two years of my life.

I thought my mother was my father
and my wet nurse was my mother.

a common mistake.

hear your ideas.

I mean, did you guys
know that Liquid Paper,

128
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,918
that wasn't invented
by some fancy engineer.

129
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,720
No, that was created
by a lowly typist.

Oh, Jo, I have an idea
for suntan lotion soap.

You know, it doesn't
have to be an invention.

I have a question.

Oscar, homosexual accountant.

134
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,864
In the training manual,
it says that

135
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,840
there's a minority executive
training program in Tallahassee.

136

I am so proud of Sabre's
Print In All Colors initiative.

Any Sabre employee of color
is welcome to apply, okay?

138
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,441

139
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,043
Darryl. Mellow, soulful,
smart for warehouse.

140
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,554
Okay, hush now.
Okay.

141
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,989
The Sabre shipping method
could be more efficient.

142
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,256
Combining inventory systems
makes sense on paper,

143
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,229
but printers and paper
ship differently.

144
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,766
It would be faster
to deliver them separately

145
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,301
instead of waiting
on everything to come in.

146
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,893
But you wouldn't need
more trucks? I mean...

147
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,906
Not at all. There's a
way it can be scheduled.

Yeah.

Take Jim's old office.

160
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,362
Oh, I set my stuff
up in there.

161
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,162
So, just give me a few minutes
to clean it out for you.

162
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,634
Yeah. I want to
hear more from you.

163
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,727
Absolutely.

164

All right.
Yeah, thank you.

00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,065
Okay. Any questions?
Anything on anybody's mind?

ain't that far away.

172

Well, I'm heading
down there.

173

Well, anytime, now.
So, who...

174
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,656
How about
July 4th weekend?

175
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,829
Oh, honey,
you didn't buy a ticket.

I did.

177

Oh, honey,
I am not home very often,

178

and me and my relatives,
they take up the guest house.

179
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,141
I think you should
check with my office

180
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,439
before you book
any dates, okay?

181

You know what? In the
spirit of full disclosure,

182
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,510
I have actually reserved
a bunch of different seats

183
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,744
on a bunch
of different flights,

184
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,809
but there are a couple flights
that only have two tickets left,

185
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:08,876
so I think we should
pull the trigger...

186
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,149

Hello?
Hey, Jo, it's Jim Halpert.

7:30 with a very important client,
