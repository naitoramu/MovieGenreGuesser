1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you still on hold?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was supposed to call my dad back
two hours ago.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call him as soon as you get a chance.
He's at Flimbees.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's Flimbees?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the word I use when
I can't remember the real thing.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. That's what they want me to do.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My warranty expires tomorrow.
If I don't get through. . .

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .they won't fix my crappy,
broken phone for free!

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We cannot let them win!
It's us versus them!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gotta double-check for tickets
tonight. Who got what?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have one.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My boyfriend.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have a boyfriend now.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two it is. How about you?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I also need two.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really? Who's number two?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose Number Two? One of the more
difficult games sewer workers play.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, it's just this person.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like a date-type person?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, kind of.
It's this woman from work.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope that won't be too weird.
Will it, Rach?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all. I was actually
gonna bring someone myself.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you said one ticket.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I meant me plus one.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All right. I'll see you tonight.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Bye-bye.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye-bye.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I need a date!

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, hey! You guys are finally
gonna get to meet Kate!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I borrowed your cologne.
I hope she likes it.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?
She's seeing somebody.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Bottle next to the shaving cream.
-Worm medicine for the duck.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The One With the Screamer

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Here you go. You can wear this.
-Thanks.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm setting the phone down.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm still here.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just don't go anywhere.
I'm still here.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't switch or anything, because
I'm right here. Just one sec.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One sec. One second!

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait! One second! Just. . . .

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? Monica, I'm scared!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honey, that's a sleeve.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we also have a speakerphone.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please stay on the line.
Your call is important to us.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta hang up.
We'll be late.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were gonna have me hang up.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you take a duck and a chick
to the theater?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course not.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just wanted them to hear it
from somebody else.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, hi, how are you?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Looks like we're the first ones here.
-Looks that way.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First ones here!

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin.
Cailin--

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And break!

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I'll join you.
-I'll get our seats.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, this is. . .

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .awkward.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, because Rachel and I
used to go out.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then this is awkward.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-So what do you. . .?
-I think we're here.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you may be in our seats.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I don't think so.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Could we take a look at your ticket?
-Sure.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-1 3" . . . .

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, well, I thought that--

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You thought? Well, that didn't
really work out for you. Idiot!

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you, a moron?
It says, "D-1 3" ! Okay?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're surrounded by even numbers!
Does that give you a clue?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-The usher told me--
-The usher must be right!

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With all his training!

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get out!

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here!

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Hey, man, you want the aisle?
-No, I'm good.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-There he is!
-There's our star!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were great!

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So? What'd you think?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Almost as good as the play with
the two naked girls on the seesaw.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I wasn't in that.
-I know.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you to meet everybody.
Everybody, this is Kate.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sweetheart!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's the girl you like.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tell you, this guy
Rachel is with is crazy.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He viciously screamed at total
strangers. I think he's bad news.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait a minute. You don't like
the guy Rachel's dating?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, that's odd.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is
Kate's understudy, Lauren.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ran into you in the hallway
in your building.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was right after I slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So how'd you guys meet?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The short version is, I pursued
her for a couple of months.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then I gave her a check for $20,000
and she was mine.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the long version, I dump him
for telling people the short version.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do you do?

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do they have representation?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They weren't in the play.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're not actors.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What a shame!

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With her face and her chest,
I could really put something together.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could I borrow it?

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi. Remember me?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line
for the bathroom. . .

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .and someone just cut.
I think he's gonna snap.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna go.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go? Why?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know. Could be
because I don't feel like. . .

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .waiting all night for a guy
who may or may not scream.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He definitely will scream.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodbye.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here we go, people!

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
"Boxing Day.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Lucille Lortel Theatre. . . .

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joey Tribbiani gives
an uneven performance.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst
thing in this production. "

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered
portrayal is laughable. "

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here it is! "The direction. . .

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .by Marshall Townend is. . . . "

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, boys and girls.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've ruined my life.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please stuff your talentless faces. . .

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .with my mother's crab cakes!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me!

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does anyone mind if I save this?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Is the play over?
-Where were you?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were "the next caller" hours ago.
You must be going crazy.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've kept myself busy.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in
her room and her stuff in your room.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You okay?

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fabulous.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Drama critics, they're nothing but
people who couldn't make it as actors.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-You know what to do?
-Become a drama critic.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I am hurt!

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A plague. . .

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .on both your houses!

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, he dumped me tonight
after he read my review.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, classy.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I sure know how to pick them.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I gave up a part
on a soap for this?

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gave up a job too.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Really? What?
-Declawing cats.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, tell you what,
let me walk you home.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn
every copy of The Times and The Post.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Why The Post?
-You didn't see The Post?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-No. You?
-No. Why?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You really think these newspapers
are just jealous of me?

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Absolutely. You're talented
and you're good-looking.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're sweet and cute.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know. That's why they trashed me.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Wait. Wait a minute.
-What?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't get you.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, first you hate me.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then you sleep with me.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then you want nothing to do with me.
Now you want me again?

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You never went out
with an actress before?

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kate, do you even like me?

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Of course I do.
-So how come you blew me off?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-How come you were with him?
-I don't know.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just do this.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I always have to pick, like,
the smartest guy. . .

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .or the most talented guy.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why can't I just
pick someone like you?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what I mean.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just so. . . .

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so. . .

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
: : :so: : : :

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here we go.
Let's get your feet up there.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sweet dreams.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna put this can right here
in case you have to hurl.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please stay on the line.
Your call is very important to us.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been up for 24 hours.
Go to sleep.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This isn't healthy.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, no, I'm fine.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you know why?
Because of all the riboflavin.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you have that on last night?

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I stayed at Kate's
but nothing happened.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, where were you?

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so, so sorry.
I am definitely gonna see your play.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, your play is very important
to us. Thank you for your patience.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your play is the next play
I'm gonna see.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd it go with Kate?

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was great!

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I walked her home, and it was
amazing how much we connected.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then she passed out.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But then she woke up.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we stayed up all night talking.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now we're crazy about each other!

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You had "the night" !

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When two people realize
their feelings for each other. . .

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .and they talk for hours and learn
all about the other person.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Did you learn about her family?
-Two brothers. One died!

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is from the woman at the bar.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry. She thought
you were somebody else.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-What time is it?
-One.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
7: 1 5.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Watch doesn't work.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, I wasn't gonna
say anything to you, but. . . .

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All right, I don't think
you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't?

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.
I think you should stay away from him.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or maybe I should stay away
from all men.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not just because I'm jealous.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, the guy actually screamed
at this couple sitting in our seats.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, and at the end of the play. . .

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .he got up, and he just started,
like, banging his hands together.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't want to believe me,
that's fine.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're kidding.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one believe me.
I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Sorry, Tommy.
-What's in the cup?

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is in the cup?

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, it's coffee.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Iced coffee?
Tell me it's iced coffee.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-It's hot--
-Hot coffee!

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You idiot! You gonna spill
hot coffee all over me, huh?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you? Just a big, stupid
doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your favorite thing
about summertime?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Going to the beach
when it stays light real late.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your favorite thing
about summer?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know. Probably the smell
of freshly cut grass.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's a good one.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry! Sorry I'm late! My duck and
my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We held the curtain for you.
Let's go!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
vic! Where have you been, baby?

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Kate?

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She got a job in L.A.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been waiting up all night
for you. Where have you been?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where have you been, vic?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go to the window. I wanna run down
to the truck and show you something.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you got down there, vic?

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you got under that tarp?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When is she leaving?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tonight. What are you doing?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming up!

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Use ours across the hall
because she. . .

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .has problems.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, Tommy.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I almost spilled this
hot coffee on you.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, but you didn't.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, but. . .

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .it's hot.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you stop it?
It's getting really old.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe no one believes me.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do. I believe you.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You do?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. But I also believed her
when she said I was next.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey there, little fella.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gross!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Idiot!

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
"Oh, look at me! I'm so cute!
I'm a little chick who's disgusting! "

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you quacking about?

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dumb Donald Dodo!

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Step away from the duck.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess we're not going out anymore.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Man!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joey, I'm so glad I caught you.
I couldn't find you before.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's all this about L.A.?

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They still want me
for General Hospital.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But. . .

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .what about us?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Last night was wonderful.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can't stay here just for you.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So stay for the museums.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-I'm sorry.
-Joey, on-stage!

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least stay till the end
of the play.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go to the airport with you.
I want to say goodbye.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you, vic?

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Flight's in an hour.
I gotta go.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
vic?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-vic!
-In a minute!

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So this is it, victor?

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. I guess it is.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen. . .

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say
it quick because this is killing me.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One thing you gotta know
is that I will never forget you.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you got things
you have to do now.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And so do l.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And so. . .

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .I'm gonna get on
this spaceship. . .

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7
in search of alternative fuels.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when I return
200 years from now. . .

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .you'll be long gone. . .

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .but I won't have aged at all.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you tell your great,
great granddaughter. . .

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .to look me up.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because, Adrianne. . .

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .baby. . .

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .I'm gonna want to meet her.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So long, vic!

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been two days.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I know.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good thing it's one of those
801 numbers, right?

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Phoebe, 800 is toll free.
801 is Utah.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It has to be 800 because all those
big companies have 800 numbers.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Every. . . .

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, every big Utah-based company
has one.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will pay you back.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yet she's still not
hanging up the phone.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Hang up!
-Hang up the phone!

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fine! Fine!

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I think I broke it.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that's all right.
Here's the number where you can call.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wouldn't it be cool if our duck
and our chick had a baby?

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We could call it Chuck.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or Dick.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen, I need a favor.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was in the shower,
and as I was. . .

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .cleansing myself, I felt something.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. I mean, like,
a thing on my body.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, what was it?

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of in a place that's not. . . .

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys. . .

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .could help me out.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, you guys!
It's no big deal!

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, what is it?
ls it a mole?

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it--?
What, a pimple?

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, it's. . .

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .fancier than a pimple.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Ross, just go see a doc--
-Guys, what's--?

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, it's definite.
Two more weeks of winter.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, right.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The One With Ross' Thing

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Good deal.
-These are my friends.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
People? This is vince.
vince, the people.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
vince is a fireman.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you ever rescued anyone
from a burning building?

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ninety-eight hot saves.
Highest on the force.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If Joey and I play with matches,
we could get you up to an even 1 00.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fire safety is not a joke, son.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right. I know.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, I gotta go.
I'm on call tonight.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you Saturday.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's cute, Pheebs.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you just started dating
that teacher.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, Jason?

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're seeing each other tonight.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, Pheebs?

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know, this kind of, like,
oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So do they know about each other?

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does a dog's lips move
when he reads?

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, no, they don't know.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, guys.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Well?
-How'd it go at the doctor's?

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said there's definitely
nothing to worry about. It's benign.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-What is it?
-He couldn't even tell me.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said it was just
some sort of "skin abnormality. "

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The worse thing is, he said,
being unable to identify it. . .

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .he was reluctant to remove it.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should go to my guy.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because when I went in there
with my third nipple. . .

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .he just lopped it right off.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I guess I'm lucky.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, not as lucky as people
who are born with two nipples.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least they knew what yours was.
You know? Yours had a name.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe they'll name yours after you.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know?
They'd call it "The Ross. "

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then people would be, like,
"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, that'd be cool.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pete's breaking up with me.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just checked my messages.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said that when he gets back,
"We need to talk. "

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-And?
-Well, that's it.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
People never say, "We need to talk,"
unless it's something bad.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That doesn't necessarily mean
he's breaking up with you.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe he just cheated on you.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't get rich doing it,
but I gotta say, it's cool. . .

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .knowing you're making
a difference in a kid's life.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That is so great.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, my God!

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd better call
the fire department.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, we don't need a fireman.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We need, like, a good mechanic.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here they come!
We gotta get out of here!

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait. Why?

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I wanted to see a fireman,
I'd date one.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's all it is.
A third nipple.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know? Just your
run-of-the-mill third nipple.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take your shirt off.
Let's see what we're dealing with.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,
slice-it-right-off third nipple.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, that's not a third nipple.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First of all, it's on your ass.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then what is it?

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait a minute. Hold it.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Jansen, come in here.
-I'm with Hamilton!

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's good with weird things.
Bring him in too.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what? lf he's gonna break up
with me, maybe I won't water them.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he's gonna break up with you,
maybe Joey and I should do it. . .

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .if you know what I mean.

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or. . .

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .we could go and pee on them.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't take it, you know.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm afraid one of them
will catch me with the other.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's making me crazy!

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you break up
with one of them?

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened to playing the field?

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't feel like playing anymore.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So pick one of them.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which one do you like more?

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
vince is great, you know?
Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's just so burly,
so very burly.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, good. So there you go.
Go with vince.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Jason's really sensitive.

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sensitive is important.
Pick him.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, sure.
Go with the sissy.

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jason is not a sissy.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I meant Chandler.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know, I have dinner plans.

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much for coming
on such a short notice.

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been
practicing medicine for 23 years. . .

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .and I'm stumped.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, this is the den.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All right, check this out.
Lights!

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All right, less lights!
Bad lights!

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lights, go away!

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See? You just need the right command.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the dimmer switch.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the video phone.

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you shouldn't be here.
So don't touch anything.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IKEA, this is comfortable!

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This place is amazing!

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen.
-I know.

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the nicest kitchen.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The refrigerator
told me to have a great day.

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Joey, put that down.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, my God, that's Pete.
Get out!

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How the hell do you answer
a video phone?

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess that's how.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Monica, how's it going?

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, it's good. It's good.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just here, watering the plants.

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't forget that ficus
there by Rachel.

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chandler's on the couch!

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see him. You guys
are the worst hiders, ever.

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Hi.
-How you doing?

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The other day when you said
you needed to talk. . .

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .just so I know,
is it good news or bad news?

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's good news.
It's definitely good news.

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold on a second,
I have another call.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's it going?

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's still me.

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got picture-in-picture here.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Monica? You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I'll see you soon.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Okay. I love you.
-I love you.

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We love you too!

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, it's good news.
It's good news.

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-What do you think the good news is?
-Look at this!

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wrote a check for $50,000
to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design. "

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry. What do you think
the good news is?

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, my!

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta get Mom on the phone!
Call Mom! Call Mom!

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And that's Pete's mom.

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have to make it a theme wedding.
And the theme could be:

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
"Look How Much Money We've Got! "

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, you could put money
in the invitations.

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could have, like,
little-money place settings.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you could start
with a money salad.

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, it'll be dry,
but people will like it.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you stop?

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't know if he'll propose.

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But this is Pete.
He's not like other people.

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On your first date, you went to Rome.

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For most guys, that's like
a third or fourth date kind of thing.

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, if that's what it is,
then it's crazy.

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Monica's right.
We're talking about marriage here.

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can't just rush into this.

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you know?
You married a lesbian!

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gotta go.
I have to break up with vince.

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you're going with the teacher?

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I like vince a lot, you know?
But Jason is so sensitive.

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the long run, I think
sensitive is better than having. . .

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .a really, really, really nice body.

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jason. Definitely Jason.

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Wish me luck!
-Good luck!

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, my God!

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry.

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was imagining what it'd be like
to catch the money bouquet.

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me. Is vince here?

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, sure.

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't know you guys
actually used those.

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what's up?

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This isn't gonna be easy.

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good deal.

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, it's okay.

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just that I thought
we had something pretty special here.

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt like you were someone
I could finally open up to.

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's so much in me
I haven't shared with you yet.

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My God!
I didn't know you were so--

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry. I can't talk.

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait! Wait! Wait!

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you wanna take care of that thing,
go see my herbal guy.

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks. But I wanna remove it,
not make it savory.

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When girls sleep with guys
with weird things on their body. . .

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .they tell their friends about it.

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me that.

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, don't be mad at me,
but I couldn't resist.

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bride's Magazines?

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you said you'd say no
if he asked you. . .

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .but how great would you look
walking down the aisle. . .

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .in this Donna Karan?

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You so would!

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should get that anyway.

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, for clubbing.

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It is so weird.

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know what I said.
But this morning. . .

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .I was lying in bed, imagining
what it'd be like to say yes.

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know it's a little sudden,
and it's rushed. . .

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .and it's not like me to do
something like this.

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it doesn't mean I can't.
Right?

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I know that
we want the same things.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when I thought
about saying yes. . .

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .it made me really happy.

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, my God!

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need more pie.

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mon, if you do get married,
can I bring two guests?

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't break up with that fireman?

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That was my way of telling you.

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, it turns out
he's incredibly sensitive.

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He keeps a journal and he paints.

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He even showed me charcoal drawings
that he drew of me.

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd prefer watercolors, but he has
easy access to a lot of charcoal.

578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So will you dump Jason?

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, because I have to break up
with someone.

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So Jason is sensitive.
But now, so is vince.

581
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Plus, vince has the body.
You know?

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So. . . .

583
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's really just about the math.

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on in.

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You sounded serious on the phone.

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is anything wrong?

587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You must be Ross.

588
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I am Guru Saj.

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never
been to a guru before, so. . . .

590
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, relax.

591
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it makes you feel any better,
I've attended. . .

592
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .fine medical schools
in Central America.

593
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, let's take a look
at this skin abnormality of yours.

594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, have a seat.

595
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As I suspected, it's a kundus.

596
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's a "kundus"?

597
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know.
What's a kundus with you?

598
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please lie down.

599
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got a salve that
ought to shrink that right up.

600
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess it's worth a try.

601
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure. We should see results--

602
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Clearly not the way to go!

603
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? What?

604
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We appear to have angered it.

605
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We? We angered it?

606
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I see the problem.

607
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm afraid we're gonna
have to use a much stronger tool.

608
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love.

609
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, God!

610
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There is absolutely no way
this is gonna come off. . .

611
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .unless you start to. . . .

612
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

613
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, it's gone.

614
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's that?

615
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got caught in my watch.

616
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lights.

617
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Romantic lights.

618
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nice.

619
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So there was this thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

620
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, right. I'd completely
forgot about that.

621
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

622
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I look at my life. . .

623
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .and I feel like I've conquered
the business world.

624
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I feel like I've conquered
the intellectual world.

625
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now I have the most
beautiful woman in the world.

626
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But there's one thing missing.

627
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's that?

628
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's time for me to conquer
the physical world.

629
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanna become. . .

630
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

631
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wanna what?

632
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanna be
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

633
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the most intense
physical competition in the world.

634
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's banned in 49 states.

635
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you talking about?

636
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me. . .

637
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .Jeet Kune Do
and Brazilian streetfighting.

638
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I even had my own
octagon training ring designed.

639
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I suppose you used
a ring designer for that.

640
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you there,
in the front row, when I win.

641
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you close enough
to smell the blood.

642
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

643
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My parents will be so happy.

644
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Crazy underwear
Creeping up my butt

645
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Crazy underwear
Always in a rut

646
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Crazy underwear

647
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is he doing here?

648
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All right, just keep playing.

649
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get through this.
You'll be fine.

650
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, thank you.

651
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And as always, no one talk to me
after the show.

652
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was passing by
and saw you were playing.

653
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is cool, seeing you up there.

654
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's going on here?
Who's this guy?

655
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know! He just started
kissing me. Get him, vince!

656
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

657
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been dating both of you.

658
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And it's been really horrible,
because it's been. . .

659
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .a lot of fun for me.

660
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I like you both. . .

661
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .and I didn't know how to choose.

662
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.
I'm a terrible person.

663
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Relax. It's okay.
I mean. . . .

664
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We never said this was exclusive.

665
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neither did we.
So give yourself a break.

666
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

667
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We haven't been going out that long.

668
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, we haven't even
slept together yet.

669
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You haven't?

670
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have?

671
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, this is none of my business.

672
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe this!
You slept with him?

673
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I made you
a candlelight dinner in the park.

674
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

675
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That could've been really awkward.

676
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You made him a candlelight dinner
in the park?

677
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, but I can do that for you.
I'm gonna do that for you.

678
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe
I went out with somebody. . .

679
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .who'd have an open flame
in the middle of a wooded area!

680
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's gonna be all right.

681
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Dick?

682
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

683
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a duck, right?
Because otherwise. . .

684
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
. . .this is way out of my league.

685
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got a really bad cough,
and our vet can't stop it.

686
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is there something you can do?

687
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me see.

688
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think you could get him
to eat a bat?

689
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,890
Do you think there's a town
in Missouri or someplace. . .

690
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,460
. . .called Sample?

691
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,450
And as you' re driving into the town,
there's a sign and it says:

692
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,610
"You' re in Sample. "

693
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,650
-How did it go with Pete?
-Tell us.

694
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,050
You' re not gonna believe this.
So I go--

695
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,210
I' m sorry. Excuse us.

696
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,090
-It's a little crowded. Do you mind?
-Could you skooch?

697
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,130
Move over just a little bit.

698
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,730
Keep on skooching.

699
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,610
So, guys, listen.
I go over there and, you know, I' m--

700
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,730
Why? What is wrong with me?

701
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,730
-What's the matter?
-Tim. . .

702
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,650
. . .I have a feeling. . .

703
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,450
. . .my wife is sleeping
with her gynecologist.

704
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,290
How do you know?

705
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,020
-He's got access.
-I know.

706
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,490
It's a feeling you get.

707
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,850
Like when you' re in
somebody else's bowling shoes?

708
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,050
That's the one.

709
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,890
-So you went to Pete's.
-What happened?

710
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,330
Why is this happening to me?

711
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,090
Maybe it's my wound.

712
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,330
Forget it.

713
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,530
It's not healed yet?

714
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,100
It's oozing!

715
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,890
Would you pass the cream?
There's the cream.

716
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,460
Thank you very much.

717
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,250
Tomas, this is gonna be hard,
but I wanted it to come from me.

718
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,050
-What is it?
-I've been sleeping with your wife.

719
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,290
You' re the gynecologist?

720
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,130
I' m trying to have
a private conversation.

721
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,580
Can I have a napkin?
Could you please hand me a napkin?

722
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,090
Just give me the thing, all right?

723
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,330
Enough!

724
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,850
And you are no longer my friend!

725
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,970
We are finished! Nada! No more!

726
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,090
You are a bastard for doing that!

727
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,740
Stay away from me!

728
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,490
Come back!

729
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,260
So what were you gonna tell us?

730
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,330
I have no idea.

731
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,610
The One With
the Ultimate Fighting Champion

732
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,890
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

733
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,890
What was the big news
Pete wanted to tell you?

734
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,250
Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?

735
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,250
Oh, keep your name.
Don't take his name.

736
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,570
He didn't ask me to marry him.

737
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,090
Then definitely don't take his name!

738
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,850
He wanted to tell me he's going
to compete in some Ultimate. . .

739
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,780
. . .Fighting Competition thingy.

740
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,250
-Pete?
-Why? What is it?

741
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,970
I don't know exactly.
It's sort of like wrestling.

742
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,050
But without the costumes.

743
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,330
And it's not fake.
It's totally brutal.

744
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,620
It's two guys in the ring and
the rules are, "There are no rules" !

745
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,890
You can bite and pull
people's hair and stuff?

746
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,250
Anything goes except eye-gouging
and fish-hooking.

747
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,810
-What's fish-hooking?
-What's fish-hook--

748
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,170
Thanks. That would have been
hard to describe.

749
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,970
What is that taste?

750
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,050
My hands are totally clean.
I just gave the duck a bath.

751
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,220
Thanks for the warm welcome.

752
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,700
It's good to have you guys on my team.
I come to play. I hope you do too.

753
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,290
Let's go out there and get them!
And remember:

754
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,970
There is no "I" in "team. "

755
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,050
Yes, but there's two in "martini. "
So, everybody, back to my office.

756
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,740
You! Chuckles. What's your name?

757
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,970
It's Bing, sir.
I' m sorry. I was just. . . .

758
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,450
No, no. I heard what you said.
Funny. I like funny.

759
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,490
This team's about hard work,
but it's also about having fun.

760
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,650
Good to have you aboard, Bing!

761
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,010
That's right. Ryder.

762
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,970
Winona Ryder for six.

763
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,410
Thank you.

764
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,810
Yeah. We have the reservations.

765
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,450
All right, buddy! Way to go!

766
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,340
Dude, what are you doing?

767
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,170
Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my
butt, and acting like it's no big deal.

768
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,860
What'd you do about it?

769
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,700
I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to be the guy. . .

770
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,660
. . .who has a problem with his boss
slapping his bottom.

771
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,650
I gotta tell you, I think it's okay
to be that guy.

772
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,060
Maybe it's that jock thing.

773
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,850
You know, how football players
pat each other after touchdowns.

774
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,090
You know, I don't understand guys.

775
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,650
I mean, I would never congratulate
Monica on a great stew. . .

776
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,010
. . .by, you know, grabbing her boob.

777
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,890
I know. For a really great stew,
you'd just. . .

778
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,860
. . .stick your head in between them.

779
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,850
Can we please go eat?

780
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,060
-Yeah, what are we getting?
-Anything but stew.

781
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,370
So from now on, don't give
your boss a chance to get you.

782
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,260
Don't turn your back to him.

783
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,290
Or you could teach him
a lesson, you know?

784
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,930
What you do is rub something that
smells really bad on your butt, right?

785
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,370
Then, when he goes to smack you,
his hand will smell.

786
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,530
Now, what could you rub on your butt
that would smell bad?

787
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,330
What if Joey was President?

788
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,940
Can I ask you something?

789
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,290
Okay, you can totally say no. . .

790
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,380
. . .but would it be okay with you
if I set Ross up on a date?

791
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,330
With who?

792
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,300
My friend Bonnie.
She always thought Ross was cute. . .

793
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,050
. . .and she asked if I could set it up.

794
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,850
-But if that's not cool. . . .
-Which one is Bonnie?

795
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,450
You remember her from
my birthday party?

796
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,730
Average height. . .

797
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,090
. . .medium build, bald. . . .

798
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,170
That's fine.

799
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,850
Great! Okay! Good for you!
All right!

800
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,980
You are iron! You are steel!

801
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,050
Let me ask you, how come when I call
your computer support line. . .

802
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,250
. . .I have to wait an hour and a half?

803
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,850
We' re adding operators all the time.
Could we concentrate on my training?

804
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,330
It's just hard when I know
I have e-mail I can't get.

805
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,050
Hi, honey.

806
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,330
On the table. On the table, please.

807
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,850
So listen, my friends were
telling me a little bit about. . .

808
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,780
. . .this Ultimate Fighting thing.

809
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,890
It sounds really dangerous.

810
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,100
I don't want you to get hurt
because I kind of like you.

811
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,570
I don't want to get hurt either.
I' m being smart about this.

812
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,700
See these guys? They' re
the best trainers in the world.

813
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,660
And Hoshi here used to be
a paid assassin.

814
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,890
A house painter!
He used to be a house painter!

815
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,060
-Promise me you'll be careful.
-I promise.

816
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,140
Are we still on for tonight?
Good. Because. . .

817
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,980
. . .maybe we could have
a little workout of our own.

818
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,860
No boom-boom before big fight!

819
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,930
How about just a boom?

820
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,650
That was depressing.
I just bought a pretzel. . .

821
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,850
. . .from one of the kids from Fame.

822
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,610
Ready to go to the movies?
Oh, this is Bonnie!

823
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,930
This is Bonnie?

824
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,050
This is Bonnie? You' re Bonnie?

825
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,060
I can show you an l.D. if you want.

826
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,140
Oh, no. You look a lot different
than the last time I saw you.

827
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,130
Oh, yeah. Well, I just
started wearing bras again.

828
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,570
Oh, that must be it.

829
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,250
Have fun tonight.

830
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,610
Thanks. You too.

831
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,290
You said she was bald.

832
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,260
She was bald. She's not now.

833
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,050
How could you not tell me
she has hair?

834
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,050
I don't know.
I hardly ever say that about people.

835
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,050
Oh, well this is just perfect!

836
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,530
Well, I' m sorry.
I thought you said it was okay.

837
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,060
I said it was okay when I thought
she was some weird bald chick.

838
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,690
That girl has got hair
all over her head!

839
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,050
-Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
-Does she have a bad personality?

840
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,250
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

841
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,530
Bing!

842
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,490
Read your CompuTek proposal.
Real home run.

843
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,500
Barely got you that time.
Get over here!

844
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,130
Come on.

845
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,250
Oh, yeah! Good one.

846
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,930
That was a good one.
Keep at it, team!

847
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,100
-What is with him?
-"With him"?

848
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,650
You' re his favorite.
You' re his guy!

849
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,210
We never get smacked.

850
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,730
That's not true.
He smacked you once.

851
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,970
Not on purpose.
He ricocheted off you and got me.

852
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,180
I' m telling you,
I need some smacks.

853
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,570
I got a kid starting Dartmouth.

854
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,460
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth?
Dartmouth sucks!

855
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,090
-You go to Dartmouth?
-No, sir.

856
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,820
There you go!

857
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,450
God, Ross! What is that?

858
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,260
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

859
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,420
I saved 30 cents.
Plus, I get to keep the cup.

860
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,890
From New York City, New York. . .

861
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,100
. . .appearing in his Ultimate
Fighting Championship debut. . .

862
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,930
. . .he's known for his
confrontational business style!

863
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,370
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing. . .

864
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,970
. . .Pete Becker!

865
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,730
I love you, Pete!

866
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,540
And his opponent,
from Huntington Beach, California. . .

867
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,370
. . .he's a 300-pound
streetfighter. . .

868
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,170
. . .Tank Abbott!

869
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,290
Pete?

870
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,330
Pete?

871
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,850
-That guy's pretty huge.
-Don't worry.

872
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,450
I'll use his strength
and weight against him.

873
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,770
Well, then that guy is in serious,
serious trouble.

874
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,380
You go get him. Let's go!

875
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,300
Here we go, gentlemen.

876
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,810
Are you ready?

877
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,250
Are you ready?
Then let's get it on!

878
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,730
It's me.

879
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,260
Monica.

880
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,450
Can I just tell you how proud
I am of you?

881
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,490
It would be nice after hearing
20,000 people chant, "You suck! "

882
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,570
I thought you were nuts at first. . .

883
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,300
. . .but you did it.

884
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,570
Now you can just look back at this
with no regrets.

885
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,170
Look back?

886
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,730
You' re not gonna keep going?

887
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,650
Let me ask you a question:
Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

888
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,300
Well, no. But--

889
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,690
I' m not gonna stop until I' m
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

890
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,370
That guy stood on your neck
until you passed out.

891
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,780
Let me tell you a story.

892
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,770
When I set out to create MOSS 865,
do you think it happened overnight?

893
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,250
No. There was MOSS 1
that burned down my dad's garage.

894
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,250
There was MOSS 2 that would only
schedule appointments in January.

895
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,690
And 862 others that I learned from.

896
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,530
Just like I learned from this fight,
never to let a guy stand on my neck.

897
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,930
You didn't know that already?

898
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,290
Look, I' m gonna get better.

899
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,090
Okay? I promise you.

900
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,930
Just get a lot better.

901
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,660
Fast.

902
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,770
One other thing.

903
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,570
Hoshi thinks you being ringside
may have affected my concentration.

904
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,410
That was the problem.

905
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,490
-How long until Pete's fight?
-About five minutes.

906
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,380
They' re interviewing his opponent.

907
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,530
Apparently, he trains by going to lran
and pulling the arms off thieves.

908
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,930
-Hot dog?
-Four, please.

909
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,060
I' m really nervous.

910
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,970
Thank you.

911
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,130
So how did it go with Bonnie?

912
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,370
Oh, I gotta tell you,
I wasn't expecting to like her at all.

913
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,450
I actually wasn't expecting
to like anyone right now.

914
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,610
But she's really terrific.

915
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,770
It's too bad.

916
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,450
No, I' m saying I liked her.

917
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,530
There are other fish in the sea.

918
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,850
I think she's great, okay?
We' re going out again.

919
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,490
I hear you. Are you capable
of talking about anything else?

920
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,210
Which one's my turkey burger?

921
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,610
The one next to my foot.
Sorry.

922
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,690
-Fight's starting!
-We'll be right in.

923
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,650
So did your boss try
to slap you again today?

924
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,260
Nine times.

925
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,620
I had to put on lotion.

926
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,500
But it'll be okay.
Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.

927
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,530
And if all goes as planned,
my butt will be smack-free.

928
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,330
Fight's over!

929
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
Excuse me, Doug?

930
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,370
Hey there, sports fan!

931
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,090
Bing! You got those numbers for me?

932
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,130
No. I didn't do them.

933
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,170
You forgot?

934
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,770
No, I just didn't do them.

935
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,570
Instead, I hung out with some
friends and had a couple of beers.

936
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,380
So I certainly don't
deserve praise. verbal. . .

937
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,130
. . .or otherwise.

938
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,700
I got tanked myself last night.
Pretty dicey drive home.

939
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,290
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.

940
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,330
That's okay. You' re still
my number-one guy! Bing!

941
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,420
Doug!

942
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,580
I' m a little bit uncomfortable with
the way that you express yourself.

943
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,250
Is it the swearing?
ls it the constant swearing?

944
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,290
Because I gotta tell you, if it is,
you can just kiss my ass!

945
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,890
It's not about the swearing.
It's more about. . .

946
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,490
. . .the way that you occasionally. . .

947
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,090
. . .concentrate your enthusiasm. . .

948
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,780
. . .on my buttocks.

949
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,940
Don't get me wrong.
I appreciate the sentiment.

950
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,810
It's just that I have a rather
sensitive posterior.

951
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,730
And besides, it's making
all the other guys jealous.

952
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,770
Well, say no more. You know,
it takes guts to bring this up.

953
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,890
Bing, you' re okay.

954
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,170
Would you rather live in the
shirt pocket of a sweaty giant. . .

955
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,810
. . .or inside his shower drain?

956
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,930
Oh, my God.

957
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,450
Look. It's Ross and that girl.

958
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,970
Look at that! It's a line of ants!
They' re working as a team!

959
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,860
Right. Oh, yeah. It looks
like Ross is breaking up with her.

960
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,500
I hope he lets her down easy.

961
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,570
Look at that! They are not
breaking up! Look at them!

962
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,700
You know what that is?
A second date, that's what that is.

963
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,530
Look, she just put her hand
on his thigh.

964
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,250
That's nothing.
She's very sexually aggressive.

965
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,490
Oh, God!

966
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,330
It's your fault. Now he loves her.
He'll marry her. It's all your fault.

967
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,450
You said it was okay.

968
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,730
You said she was bald!

969
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,370
Was! Was, was, was!

970
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,450
We can't let it happen. We have to do
something. We have to break them up.

971
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,740
Just go in there and shave her head!
You owe me one bald girl!

972
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,220
Okay, first of all, breathe.

973
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,690
Second of all, I don't get it.

974
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,980
Aren't you the one that decided
you didn't want to be with Ross?

975
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,850
Well, isn't he your friend?
Don't you want him to be happy?

976
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,010
So?

977
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,410
It's just, you know, I didn't
expect him to be this happy so soon.

978
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,690
-Oh, no.
-What?

979
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,970
We killed them all!

980
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,290
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's a precaution.

981
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,930
I' m not supposed to move my spine.

982
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,130
Please tell me you' re stopping now.

983
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,140
I' m fine. I'd fight tonight
if they'd let me.

984
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,250
Now, see this circle
I' m marking off here?

985
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,370
This is my Zone of Terror.

986
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,250
You are insane!
You've got to give this up!

987
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,260
I can't until I' m
the Ultimate Fighter.

988
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,570
I will do it.

989
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,890
The day will come when children will
argue over who will win a fight. . .

990
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,970
. . .me or Superman.

991
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,660
Not that I could beat Superman,
but kids are stupid.

992
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,050
Just sit down.

993
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,050
Please listen to me.

994
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,050
You are terrible at this, okay? You
are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.

995
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,450
Ever!

996
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,700
I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline
fracture in my right forearm. . .

997
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,900
. . .and a severely bruised Adam's
apple, but that really hurt.

998
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,450
Well, then, you know what?

999
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,410
I care about you too much to watch you
hurt yourself like this.

1000
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,170
So if you have to do this,
you'll have to do it without me.

1001
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,490
If you' re asking me to quit. . .

1002
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,460
. . .then you' re asking me
to be someone I' m not.

1003
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,140
I've got to do this.

1004
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,050
Then I've gotta go.

1005
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,730
Bye.

1006
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,770
Could you leave a note?
I' m on painkillers. . .

1007
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,050
. . .and I might not
remember this tomorrow.

1008
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,090
So, in conclusion, the lines
all go up, so I' m happy.

1009
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,170
Great job, team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.

1010
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,700
Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

1011
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,050
Goldberg, you maniac!

1012
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,770
I love you!

1013
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,580
-Couldn't have done it without you.
-Thank you, sir.

1014
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,050
Oh, excuse me.

1015
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,850
I forgot my briefcase, you know,
by accident.

1016
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,450
Of course, you did. Forgot
something else too, you bastard!

1017
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,050
Well, what about you?

1018
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,650
You' re not feeling left out, are you?

1019
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,450
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

1020
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,770
Everybody else got one,
and you want one too. Don't you?

1021
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,210
Yes, I do.

1022
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,530
Now, get on out of here, you!

1023
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,260
Pete Becker circles the ring.

1024
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,850
Looks like he's just trying
to feel him out.

1025
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,490
Bruiser is charging!

1026
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,300
Run, you crazy, rich freak!

1027
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,130
I can't watch this.

1028
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,940
Check it out! Pete's winning!

1029
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,250
Really?

1030
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,740
Bruiser has Becker on the canvas
and is going for his favorite area!

1031
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,250
Wait! lf that's his favorite area,
why is he being so mean to it?

1032
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,090
This is ironic.

1033
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,900
Your last boyfriend, Richard,
didn't want to have kids.

1034
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,650
And from the looks of it,
now Pete can't.

1035
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,520
So your first sexual experience
was with a woman?

1036
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,840
I was 1 5.
It was my best friend, Ruth.

1037
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,360
And we got drunk on that hard cider.

1038
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,250
And then suddenly,
we were making out.

1039
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,240
Tell it again.

1040
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,600
Seriously.

1041
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,070
Can that woman talk
about anything else but sex?

1042
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,240
Yeah, sure. Earlier she was
talking about geography.

1043
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,440
She was listing the countries
she's done it in.

1044
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,080
I think we all
learned something.

1045
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,760
Hey, you guys! Look what I found!

1046
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,880
That's my mom's writing. Look.

1047
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,840
"Me and Frank and Phoebe,
graduation, 1 965. "

1048
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,320
-Do you know what that means?
-That you're actually 50?

1049
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,690
That's not "me" Phoebe.
That's her pal, Phoebe.

1050
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,200
According to her yearbook,
they were BFF.

1051
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,000
Best Friends Forever.

1052
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,960
That's great!

1053
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,200
I know! She probably has all kinds
of stories about my parents.

1054
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,080
She might know where my dad is.

1055
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,280
I looked her up.
She lives by the beach.

1056
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,560
Maybe this weekend we can
go there.

1057
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,760
-Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.
-That's too bad.

1058
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,000
Big fat bummer.

1059
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,840
So tomorrow we'll drive out
to Montauk.

1060
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,920
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

1061
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,400
The One At the Beach

1062
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,600
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

1063
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,040
Would you look at them?

1064
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,160
I'm never gonna find
a boyfriend again.

1065
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,640
I'm gonna die an old maid.

1066
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,040
You're not gonna die an old maid.

1067
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,710
Maybe an old spinster cook.

1068
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,280
-Thanks.
-Besides, worse comes to worse. . .

1069
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,240
. . .I'll be your boyfriend.

1070
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,440
Yeah, right.

1071
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,320
Why is that so funny?

1072
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,480
You made a joke, right?

1073
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,210
So I laughed.

1074
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,160
A little too hard.

1075
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,280
Am I not boyfriend material?

1076
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,000
You're Chandler.

1077
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,240
You know. Chandler!

1078
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,600
Okay, so we've established
my name, and hit me.

1079
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,080
But say we weren't friends.
Say it's a blind date.

1080
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,680
I show up at your door and I'm,
like, "Hey, nice to meet you. "

1081
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,040
I'd probably be scared of a guy
using a fake voice.

1082
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,920
Oh, good. You bought food.

1083
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,040
No, just my luggage.

1084
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,360
I am having the best karma this week.

1085
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,480
I find this woman
who knew my parents. . .

1086
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,640
. . .and then my client
gives me his beach house.

1087
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,490
What about that bike
messenger you hit?

1088
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,000
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

1089
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,840
Hey, check out the hat!

1090
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,920
Wait a minute, I know that hat.

1091
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,090
I was taken aboard that hat.

1092
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,520
They did experiments on me.

1093
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,050
I can't have children!

1094
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,440
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

1095
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,840
Ross gave it to me.

1096
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,160
I think she looks good.

1097
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,760
Did he buy it for you. . .

1098
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,520
. . .or win it for you?

1099
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,280
Excuse me,
my fashion-impaired friends. . .

1100
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,440
. . .I'm here to tell you
hats are back.

1101
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,240
And this time, they've ganged up
and formed one giant super-hat.

1102
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,160
Go, go, go!

1103
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,480
Now everybody wants to be
under the hat!

1104
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,480
What's with all this sand?

1105
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,160
Bob said there might be flood damage.

1106
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,520
Either that or he has
a really big cat.

1107
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,160
It's kind of an unusual house.

1108
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:51,040
It has three beautiful bedrooms
and no baths.

1109
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,240
But, you know, the ocean
is right there.

1110
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,040
Knock, knock, knock.

1111
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,360
Hang on.
Come in, come in.

1112
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,520
Think about it and call me back.

1113
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,480
Are you Phoebe Abbott?

1114
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,800
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott!
I'm your best friend's daughter!

1115
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,350
You're lrwin's daughter?

1116
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,280
I mean your old best friend.
Here.

1117
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,840
-Lily? From high school? Remember?
-Oh, God, Lily. Yes.

1118
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,000
Of course I remember Lily.

1119
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,720
Then you must be--

1120
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,290
Phoebe, Phoebe.

1121
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,120
She named me after you, I guess.

1122
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,090
Wow. Well.
Look, there's Frank!

1123
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,880
Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!

1124
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,240
That's my dad. That's Frank!

1125
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,840
I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.

1126
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,680
Take it easy.
If you want, there's cookies.

1127
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,650
Or sangria! I could make sangria!

1128
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,800
Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

1129
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,000
Anyway, I've been
looking for my father.

1130
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,440
-Have you heard from him or seen him?
-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

1131
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,840
I lost track of everybody
after high school.

1132
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,040
Well, so tell me everything
about my parents. Everything.

1133
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,280
Oh, well, you know,
we were always together.

1134
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,840
-The other kids had a nickname for us.
-What was it?

1135
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,480
The Three Losers.

1136
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,650
Oh, poor Lily.

1137
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,640
I heard what happened. That must
have been just terrible for you. . .

1138
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,680
. . .Iosing your mother that way.

1139
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,480
Yeah, no, it was great.

1140
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,120
You know what a really good
rainy-day game is?

1141
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,040
I mean, naked game.

1142
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,840
We should play strip poker.

1143
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,240
Are you crazy?

1144
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,200
Come on. When you go away,
you have to play. It's, like, a law.

1145
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,160
-All done.
-Thank you.

1146
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,120
Okay. Who's next?

1147
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,950
No way!

1148
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:07,160
Come on, please. I'm bored.
You let me do it once before.

1149
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,440
Well, if that's the rule
this weekend. . . .

1150
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,120
-Get away.
-Take it like a man. Come on!

1151
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,000
Big bullies!

1152
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,640
How are we doing?

1153
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,440
Bored and bored.

1154
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,880
You know what naked card game's
never boring?

1155
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,840
So what's Phoebe like?

1156
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,240
I'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like?

1157
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,080
No, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?

1158
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,890
I think she knows where my dad is!

1159
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,960
Cool!

1160
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,000
Where is he?

1161
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,040
She was pretending she hasn't
heard from him. . .

1162
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,280
. . .but I found this picture.

1163
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,840
Isn't this what he would
look like now?

1164
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,440
Totally familiar.

1165
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,080
Why would she lie to you?

1166
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,440
We're having dinner tomorrow.
Maybe she'll tell me then.

1167
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,880
Maybe she just wanted
to give him time. . .

1168
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,040
. . .to buy me presents.
I don't know.

1169
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,040
So you're all bored?

1170
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,360
I'll close my eyes and point
to someone. Whoever it is. . .

1171
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,840
. . .has to think of something
fun to do. And we have to do it.

1172
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,800
Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

1173
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,520
You know, we could just do this!

1174
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,720
We all have to play strip poker?

1175
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,440
Strip Happy Days Game?

1176
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,360
I couldn't find cards, so it was this
or Strip Bag-Of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.

1177
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,360
Done.

1178
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:05,040
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points. "

1179
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,720
Get five points, you get to make
someone take off one item of clothing.

1180
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,430
It hasn't happened yet,
but we're very excited.

1181
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,720
Okay, come on.

1182
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,160
Daddy needs a new electromagnetic
microscope for Prehistoric Forensics.

1183
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:29,520
"Take Pinky Tuscadero up
to lnspiration Point.

1184
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,840
Collect three cool points. " Yeah!

1185
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,680
Which gives me five.

1186
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,570
And let's see, who is gonna lose
their clothes?

1187
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,000
I think I pick our strip poker
sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

1188
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,680
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

1189
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,440
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points. "

1190
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,440
Which means I have five and
that means I get Joey's boxers.

1191
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,040
Fine. Gang up on me.

1192
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,930
I got you all,
right where I want you.

1193
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,080
Come on! Take them off!

1194
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,840
Actually, it's kind of cold.

1195
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,400
What if I keep them on and
give you a peek at the good stuff?

1196
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,880
I'm gonna make more margaritas.

1197
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,960
What are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?

1198
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,400
I'm just making margaritas.

1199
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,200
Think I'll help her out.

1200
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,110
What is going on here?

1201
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,240
What?

1202
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,840
You're painting his toenails.
Chasing him around the room.

1203
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,040
Monica, please.

1204
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,240
He's totally flirting with you too.

1205
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,550
He is, isn't he?

1206
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:48,090
I don't know. Maybe it's just
being here at the beach together. . .

1207
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,730
. . .but it's like something--

1208
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,000
Hi, Bonnie.

1209
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,850
My boss let me off early,
so I took the train.

1210
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,320
What are you guys doing?

1211
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,960
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

1212
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,520
Cool! I'll catch up!

1213
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,320
So you still don't think. . .

1214
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,240
. . .I'm boyfriend material?

1215
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,280
I saw you checking me out
during the game last night.

1216
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,640
You didn't even take off your pants.

1217
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,720
Lucky for you.

1218
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,200
-What?
-I don't know.

1219
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,720
Well, is everybody else having
just the best time?

1220
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,160
Joey's asleep.

1221
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,840
He passed out. We put sand
around him to keep him warm.

1222
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,080
Well, I assume the happy couple
isn't up yet?

1223
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,520
Did you guys hear them last night?

1224
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,960
I don't know what they were doing,
but sea turtles came up to the house.

1225
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,440
Good morning.

1226
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,650
-How'd you sleep?
-Great.

1227
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:12,680
Like a log.

1228
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,200
Us too.

1229
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,240
I'm going for a walk.

1230
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,480
Good morning.
Nice breasts by the way.

1231
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,440
Hey, what happened to you?

1232
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,920
Oh, nothing. I just felt like
hanging out and reading.

1233
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,570
The water was so great. We jumped
off this pier and my suit came off.

1234
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,440
Sorry I missed that.

1235
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,720
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

1236
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,240
I brought back half the beach
in my hair.

1237
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,480
It was easier when I shaved my head.

1238
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,240
You know, I gotta tell you. . .

1239
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,280
. . .I just loved your look
when you were bald.

1240
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,120
Really?

1241
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,490
I think about shaving it
again sometimes.

1242
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,160
Really?

1243
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,800
You definitely should do that.

1244
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,840
You know what? I should do it!

1245
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,680
You know what? Thank you.
You are so cool.

1246
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,720
Oh, stop. Go on.

1247
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,640
-Now go shave that head.
-All right.

1248
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,050
What's the matter?

1249
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,890
She canceled.
My namesake canceled on me.

1250
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,440
She claims she had to go out of town.
She's avoiding me.

1251
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:50,040
She doesn't want to tell me
where my father is. She knows!

1252
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,320
Pheebs, that sucks.

1253
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,240
Well, don't
"Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

1254
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,640
-Where are you going?
-She's out of town.

1255
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,480
Something in her house
will tell me where he is.

1256
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,840
Some people call that
"breaking and entering. "

1257
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,640
Well, are any of those people here?

1258
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:12,200
Look, I'll do something nice, okay?

1259
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,440
I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

1260
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,320
Hey, everybody!

1261
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,080
Look what you did!

1262
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,960
You wanna touch it?

1263
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,120
No, but it's great.

1264
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,880
Come on, touch it.

1265
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,920
You can feel all the bones
in your skull.

1266
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:51,360
I was having a little chat
with Bonnie, and guess what?

1267
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,720
She brought up who was
behind the head-shaving idea.

1268
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,640
And now, who was it?
Oh, that's right. It was you!

1269
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,280
That was her idea.

1270
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,200
I just gave her a nudge.

1271
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,640
She said you gave her the razor.

1272
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,240
So anyone up for a midnight dip?

1273
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,480
-No, I'm good.
-No, thanks.

1274
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,640
-Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
-Okay, have fun.

1275
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,040
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.

1276
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,880
You can see the moonlight
bouncing off her head!

1277
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,680
What were you thinking?

1278
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,080
I don't know.

1279
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,920
You balded my girlfriend!

1280
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,120
All right.

1281
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,320
Do you think it's easy for me
to see you with somebody else?

1282
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,480
You're the one who ended it!

1283
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,560
Because I was mad at you!
Not because I stopped loving you!

1284
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,840
You still love me?

1285
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,240
You still love me.

1286
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,280
Yeah, so?

1287
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,520
You love me.

1288
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,040
What does this mean?

1289
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,890
I mean, do you want
to get back together?

1290
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,880
No! Maybe!

1291
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,210
I don't know.

1292
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:16,040
I still can't forgive you
for what you did.

1293
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,360
But sometimes when I'm with you,
I just feel so. . . .

1294
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,800
What?

1295
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,440
I just feel. . . .

1296
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,520
-I just--
-What?

1297
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:28,800
I feel--

1298
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,680
No! I don't care!

1299
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,810
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker
with you for practice!

1300
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,080
But I made cards!

1301
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,080
Good night.

1302
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,600
I'm going upstairs.

1303
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,840
-Good night.
-Good night.

1304
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,840
Wanna play strip poker
for practice?

1305
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,760
My ass!

1306
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,890
Oh, it's me! It's me!

1307
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,000
-I didn't wanna make any noise!
-Then don't break in!

1308
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,200
-I'm sorry!
-What are you doing here?

1309
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:11,240
I came to fill your ice cube tray.

1310
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,320
What?

1311
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,280
Okay, look.

1312
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:23,470
I took this picture from your fridge.
I know that this is my father.

1313
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,920
This is Frank Buffay, and you were
standing next to him!

1314
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,760
I deserve to know where I came from.

1315
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,040
So if you can help me find my father,
then you should.

1316
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,360
Otherwise, you're just mean.

1317
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,760
So just tell me the truth.

1318
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,280
All right.

1319
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,970
The man in that picture
is Chuck Mangione.

1320
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,440
My father is Chuck Mangione?

1321
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,560
That's just Chuck Mangione.

1322
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,040
I sold him a house last year.

1323
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,130
And I'm very sorry, but I really don't
know where your father is.

1324
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,040
And that's the truth.

1325
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,880
But you're right.

1326
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,840
I think a person should know
where they come from.

1327
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,400
Which is why l. . . .

1328
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,560
I'm your mother.

1329
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,640
I wanted to tell you
yesterday, but I just. . .

1330
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,600
. . .felt all floopy, and. . . .

1331
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,760
You guys are getting back together.

1332
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,160
She doesn't even know what she wants.

1333
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,320
Rachel's still mad at me.

1334
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,680
Then you gotta back away.
You don't need that kind of hurt.

1335
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,520
Take it from a guy who's. . .

1336
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,880
. . .never had a long-term relationship.

1337
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:55,160
I know, but I really want to go
up there and finish that kiss.

1338
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,680
The water is great.
You should go in.

1339
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,240
No, thanks. I just had an M&M.

1340
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,360
Well, good night.

1341
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,560
Good night.

1342
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,880
Don't be too long.

1343
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,480
Okey-dokey.

1344
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,240
There is not one hair on that head.

1345
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,880
It'll grow back, right?
And she's really fun, and she's cool.

1346
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,880
And I'm finally moving on.

1347
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,640
Getting over Rachel was so--

1348
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,840
I'm finally feeling sane.
And if I go up there. . .

1349
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,640
. . .and I kiss her. . . .

1350
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,640
God, I want to kiss her!

1351
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:35,160
And it doesn't work out. Do I wanna
put myself through that again?

1352
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:36,680
Let me get this straight.

1353
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:41,560
If you go with Bonnie, you do the
smart, healthy thing and move on.

1354
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:45,120
Right? And if you go with Rachel,
Bonnie's free tonight?

1355
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:09,960
Hi there.

1356
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,960
That's that weird voice again.

1357
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,430
Let me try it again.

1358
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,240
You'll wanna date this next guy,
I swear!

1359
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,920
Hi, I'm Dorf!

1360
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,840
Your date for the evening.

1361
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,400
Oh, come on. Dorf on dating?
That's good stuff!
