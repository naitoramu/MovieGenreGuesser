1
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:14,784
You should get one of these.

2
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,100
No, thank you.

3
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:18,420
Do you even know what this is ?

4
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:22,030
It is a fitness orb. And it has
completely changed my life

5
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:27,498
Forget everything you thought
you knew about ab workouts.

6
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:28,658
Done.

7
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:31,514
This ab workout is specifically designed,

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,019
to strenghthen your core.

9
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:35,297
- Sorry.
- That's alright.

10
00:00:36,476 --> 00:00:37,870
Numerous health benefits.

11
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:42,156
Strengthens your back.

12
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:44,220
Better performance in sports.

13
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:46,846
More enjoyable sex.

14
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,170
You are not having sex.

15
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,431
Plus, improves your reflexes.

16
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:56,631
See, I would've caught that.

17
00:00:56,736 --> 00:00:57,371
Okay, you know what ?

18
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:58,562
How much is that ?

19
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:00,611
It's only 25 bucks.

20
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:03,622
Okay.

21
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,142

22
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:48,600
Pam, could I see you in my office ?

23
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:53,371
It's performance review day,
company wide.

24
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:54,601
Last year,

25
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:59,393
my performance review started with Michael
asking me what my hopes and dreams were.

26
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:04,463
And it ended with him telling me
he could bench press 190 pounds.

27
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:07,381
So I don't really know what to expect.

28
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,433
- Pam, you're trustworthy. And a woman.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:11,001
Oh no.

30
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:14,371
And I want you to listen to
a voice mail from my boss.

31
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:18,531
Micheal, it's Jan. I guess I missed you.

32
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:21,900
I'll, be there this afternoon
for performance reviews.

33
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,713
I hope it's understood, that will be
our only topic of discussion.

34
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:27,353
See you soon.

35
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:29,270
First impressions ?

36
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:32,470
Just off the top,

37
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:35,023
I think she'll be here this afternoon.

38
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,722
My boss is coming in today.

39
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:38,503
The lovely Jan Levinson-Gould.

40
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:41,233
Well, no Gould. The Gould has been.

41
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,683
Divorce

42
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,630
The awkward part is that
this is the first time,

43
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:48,753
we'll be seeing each other since...

44
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:50,860
Well...

45
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:54,990
it was really nothing. We just sort
of got caught up in the moment.

46
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:57,890
The vulnerable devorcee,

47
00:02:58,248 --> 00:03:02,170
gives herself to the understanding
with rugged good looks office manager.

48
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,692
Just, uh, she didn't want it to
continue for some reason

49
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:11,363
We both didn't, I didn't want, we
both didn't want it to continue.

50
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:13,591
It was not professional.

51
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:17,431
hen people say it, something's
mutual, it never is.

52
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:19,613
But this was mutual.

53
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:22,332
I guess I missed you.

54
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:25,030
I guess I missed you.

55
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,582
So she misses me.

56
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:29,611
She missed you.

57
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:33,021
But then she goes on to say,

58
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:35,360
"That will be our only
topic of our discussion."

59
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,500
That doesn't mean anything.
Those are just words.

60
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,321
I have one idea of what it means.

61
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:40,601
Okay, yeah, what ? What ?

62
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:42,760
Well, I don't think you're going
to be very happy with this.

63
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,142
Oh great.

64
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:47,781
Alrigh, well, now I'm in a terrible mood.

65
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,290
Let's do your performance review.

66
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:52,771
Because she's conflicted.

67
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,992
She has to be professional.

68
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:57,541
But she's fighting feelings for you.

69
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:00,662
Why, that's great news.

70
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:01,823
That-that,

71
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:04,033
then why would, why
would I not like that ?

72
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:06,892
Just cause that you work together.

73
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:09,251
- And it might be awkward.
- Wow, wow.

74
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,021
Alright,  let's listen to that again.

75
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:14,901
<i>Michael, it's Jan. 
I guess I miss you.</i>

76
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,281
Listen, Jim.

77
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:21,813
Here's a little tip for your
performance review.

78
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,582
Tell Micheal,

79
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:27,561
that we should be stocking more of
the double tabbed manilla file folders.

80
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:29,633
We don't have double
tabbed manilla file folders.

81
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:30,612
- Oh yes we do.
- No we don't.

82
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:31,672
Yeah, it's a new product.

83
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:34,043
So you should just suggest that to him.

84
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:35,853
And then he'll be sure
to give you a raise.

85
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,020
Well, I'm not asking for a raise.

86
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:41,540
I'm gonna actually be
asking for a pay decrease.

87
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:43,911
That is so stupid.

88
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,951
What if he gives it to you ?

89
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,310
Then I win.

90
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,673
You know what, I am going to zone
you out for the rest of today.

91
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:52,970
I need to stay focused.

92
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,032
And I don't have to see you
tomorrow or Sunday.

93
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,612
please don't call me and we'll see
how things go on Monday.

94
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:01,831
Stupid.

95
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:03,983
Wait, wait, one thing.

96
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:07,140
By tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right ?

97
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,921
Today is Thursday.
But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.

98
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:16,862
And that's what I'll be 
working on this afternoon.

99
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:21,242
Sometimes women say more in their
pauses than they say in thier words.

100
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:23,013
- Really ?
- Oh yes.

101
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:24,531
Let's listen to it again.

102
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:27,563
And this time, really
listen to the pauses.

103
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:30,533
Stanley, that's freakin' brilliant.
How do you know that ?

104
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:32,790
Did you learn that on the streets ?

105
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:34,663
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

106
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:36,450
I did learn it on the streets.

107
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:38,471
On the ghetto, in fact.

108
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:40,342
No kidding.

109
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:42,611
It's all about my bonus.

110
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:47,133
-  Michael and Jan definitely made out.
- Oh !

111
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,071
Maybe more.

112
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,713
Also it is Thursday, but
Dwight thinks it's Friday.

113
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:55,142
- So, keep that going.
- Yay !

114
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:02,150
Good work Stanley.
Great performance review.

115
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,030
For Stanley in the house everybody.

116
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:06,950
Angela, it's your turn.

117
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,193
Actually look forward to
performance review.

118
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,010
I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.

119
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:14,180
And I enjoyed that quite a bit.

120
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:16,633
I really enjoy being judged.

121
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:21,521
I believe I hold up very well
to even severe scrutiny.

122
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:22,501
Michael.

123
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,130
- Yeah.
- Jan's on the phone for you.

124
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:27,962
Angela, you were totally
satisfactory this year.

125
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:30,980
Interesting,

126
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,832
Jan is calling me. 
Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all.

127
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:35,831
Yeah.

128
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:37,013
<i>- Michael.</i>
- Jan !

129
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,382
To what do I owe this pleasure ?

130
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:41,610
<i>I am returning your many calls.</i>

131
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,553
Well, hello to you too.

132
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,061
I was just...

133
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:50,140
I just wanted to get some closure
on what transpired between us,

134
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:53,801
At the meeting we had I
in the parking lot of the Chili's.

135
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,680
<i>No.</i>

136
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:00,412
<i>No.  We-we won't be
discussing that, Michael.</i>

137
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:03,153
<i>The only things I want to talk about
during your performance review,</i>

138
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,163
<i>are your concrete ideas
to improve your branch.</i>

139
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,882
Well, surely this,

140
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:12,191
because of what ...

141
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:15,630
happened, uh, at our meeting
in the parking lot of the Chili's.

142
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:18,080
<i>Review is anything but
a formality, Michael.</i>

143
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:22,250
And, uh, I expec you to forget
anything that you think may,

144
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:26,296
have happened between us and exhibit
completely professional behavior.

145
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,310
I'm thinking about you.

146
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:31,726
That is an example of completely
unprofessional behavior.

147
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,482
I don't see how that's unprofessional.

148
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:35,831
<i>- Michael.
- Yeah.</i>

149
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:37,320
<i>- Are the cameras
in there with you ? </i>

150
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:38,293
<i>- In your office ?
- No</i>

151
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,812
They are not.

152
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:43,262
Yes they are.

153
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,290
That's my girlfriend.

154
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:51,703
I heard they made out and had sex.

155
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,611
I heard they just made out. That's it.

156
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:58,233
Well, I heard they made out...

157
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,850
- And had sex.
- Don't talk about it.

158
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:06,321
Office romances are nobody's
business but the people involved.

159
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,473
Romances ?

160
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,421
Pam, I have ideas on
a daily basis, I know I do.

161
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:19,251
I have a clear memory of
telling people my ideas.

162
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:22,762
is there any chance that you
wrote any of my ideas down ?

163
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,372
in a folder, like an idea folder ?

164
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:26,140
Sorry.

165
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,390
How about the suggestion box ?

166
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,760
There's tons of ideas in there.

167
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:35,793
- What suggestion box ?
- The suggestion box that I put out.

168
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:38,501
And people could put in
suggestions anonymously.

169
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:40,912
- Maybe there's prizes ?
- Oh yeah.

170
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,813
Oh yeah. I think I remember that
from back when I first started.

171
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:46,171
Why don't you find it and
then tell people to get theirs-

172
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:47,923
Never mind, I'll tell them.

173
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:49,210
Hello, everybody.

174
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:51,171
Yeah, ah, attention, please.

175
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,263
Jan Levinson's coming very soon.

176
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:56,683
And so we're going to have our
weekly suggestion box meeting.

177
00:08:57,347 --> 00:09:00,871
So you can all get in your
constructive compliments ASAP.

178
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,192
Don't you mean constructive criticism ?

179
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,680
- What did I say ?
- You said constructive compliments.

180
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:06,611
That doesn't make any sense.

181
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:09,173
Well, Kelly. That was neither
constructive nor a compliment.

182
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:11,893
o maybe you should stop
criticizing my English.

183
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,383
And start making some suggestions.

184
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:15,540
Okay ?

185
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:18,681
Dan, this is Jim, it is about 11:15.

186
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:21,001
and I wanted to know what
you were up to tomorrow,

187
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:24,630
which is the 15th and that is a...

188
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:25,620
Saturday.

189
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:29,701
Saturday, so just let me know what you're
doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch.

190
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,703
Okay, talk to you soon.

191
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:40,652
- Okay, bye-bye.

192
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:42,373
Would you please tell
Michael that I'm here.

193
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:43,301
Sure.

194
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:44,652
Hi, Jan.

195
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,081
- How are you ?
- Hi Micheal, I'm good. How are you ?

196
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:47,701
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

197
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:48,612
Okay.

198
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,191
Okay, why don't we
just step into my off ?

199
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:54,681
- We're to go in here.
- Can we please go into your office ?

200
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:57,171
Yep, right after you.

201
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:59,252
Apres vous.

202
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:08,430
I got...

203
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:10,910
- Thank you.
- It's nice to see you.

204
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:13,131
- Nice to see you too Michael.
- Really ?

205
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,000
Not like that.

206
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:19,893
You know, Michael, I think I need to
make something clear right off the top.

207
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:24,060
I'm not going to discuss anything with
you other than Dunder Mifflin business.

208
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:24,963
- Alright.
- Period.

209
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:25,651
Yep.

210
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,982
- Do we understand each other ?
- Absolutely.

211
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,781
I'm a little confused because
first it's all like kissey, kissey.

212
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,692
And then it's like all regret.
Because, oh, I regret that.

213
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,343
But wait, I'm still going to call you.

214
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:38,893
But-but we're just going
to talk business.

215
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:42,440
And I may come down there and
fire you if you don't do your job.

216
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:45,412
But what were we talking
about when we first kissed ?

217
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:46,700
Business.

218
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:49,420
So are you still in the middle of
performance reviews then ?

219
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:49,803
No, no, no.

220
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,893
I finished all of that. I'm very fast.
I'm not too fast.

221
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,450
Not like wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

222
00:10:56,178 --> 00:10:58,081
But I do say thank you, ma'am.

223
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:00,410
But I'm not like, wham, bam.

224
00:11:00,716 --> 00:11:02,873
Not that there's anything
wrong with wham, bam.

225
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,922
If it's consensual.

226
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:08,871
We're talking about office stuff.

227
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:12,313
- Can I ask you a question ?
-  No.

228
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,432
This is a business question.

229
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,162
It is nothing personal, I promise.

230
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:17,731
Fine.

231
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:20,510
Are you wearing a new perfume today ?

232
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:23,532
How is that a business question ?

233
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,380
Well, you're wearing it at the office.

234
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:26,713
A nd...

235
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:27,370
it,

236
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:30,291
I'm sorry, no offense,
but it's really sexy.

237
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:32,293
Please don't smell me Michael.

238
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,330
- Hey Jim.
- Hey, how's it going ?

239
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:40,320
Oh, my God, did you see
The Apprentice last night ?

240
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:42,140
Of course, it's on every Thursday night.

241
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:43,270
So how can I miss it ?

242
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:44,643
Can you believe who Trump fired ?

243
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:46,213
- No, that was unbelievable.
- Who ?

244
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:48,402
- Who was it? Who did he fire ?
- You didn't see it?

245
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:51,910
No. I went out and got drunk with
my laser tag team last night.

246
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:52,990
Crap!

247
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,883
I never go out on a Thursday night.

248
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:57,302
What the hell was I thinking ?

249
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,980
I don't understand...

250
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:01,921
Hold on, sorry.

251
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:03,270
Yes, Pam.

252
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,883
Michael, it's time for the
suggestion box meeting.

253
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:08,392
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I wish you wouldn't interrupt.

254
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:12,153
You told me to buzz you about the
suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.

255
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:14,613
I did not, not use those words.

256
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:17,271
I'd like to sit in on that meeting.
Is it happening right now ?

257
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,443
No, it's in like, 10 minutes.


258
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,441
Everyone's waiting in 
the conference room.

259
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,312
Great, very good.

260
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:29,302
Why are we here ?

261
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:31,482
Because I value your opinions.

262
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:34,710
Now I know a lot of you don't think
that I read your suggestions.

263
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:35,301
But I do.

264
00:12:35,357 --> 00:12:37,683
I just sift through them every week.

265
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:40,612
And I really look and scrutinize,

266
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,381
to see what you guys are writing.

267
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:46,443
So let's just, uh, read some
of these suckers, okay ?

268
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:48,412
Alright. Number one.

269
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,581
"What should we do to prepare for Y2K ?"

270
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:52,710
"What should we do to prepare for Y2K ?"

271
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,110
I thought you read these every week ?

272
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:56,570
Well, obviously, this one
got stuck in the box.

273
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,430
- That happens occasionally.
- It happens occasionally.

274
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,003
And, so...

275
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,800
One down. Next suggestion.

276
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,960
"We need a better outreach for
employees fighting depression."

277
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,450
Okay, alright, enought with the jokes.

278
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:13,971
Nobody in here is suffering
from depression.

279
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,763
That sounds serious Michael.

280
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:18,120
Well, yeah. Who wrote it ?

281
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:19,881
- Tom ? 
- Tom. Then it is a joke.

282
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,872
Because there is nobody
in here named Tom.

283
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,801
Tom ? He worked in accounting
up until about a year ago.

284
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:28,282
Tom.

285
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:32,701
Oh, that guy. That guy was weird.

286
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:35,643
- Alright, next suggestion.
- Next suggestion.

287
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,590
Argh, badoo badoo.

288
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:40,490
"You need to do something
about your B.O."

289
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:42,690
You need to do something about your B.O.

290
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:46,391
Now,  I don't know who
this suggestion is meant for.

291
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,552
But it's more of a personal suggestion,

292
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:50,723
And it's not an office suggestion.

293
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:53,201
And far be it from me to use this
as a platform to embarass anybody.

294
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:56,603
Aren't the suggestions meant for you ?

295
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:58,423
Well, Toby.

296
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:03,230
If by me you are inferring
that I have B.O.,

297
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:06,901
hen I would say that that is
a very poor choice of words.

298
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:10,932
Micheal, he wasn't inferring, he
was implying. You were inferring.

299
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:12,411
Was I, Creed ?

300
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,631
Okay, well, you know what I am implying,

301
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:18,281
is that when we're on
an elevator together,

302
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:20,261
I should maybe take the stairs,

303
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,370
because talk about stank.

304
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:24,882
Not that I would ever say
something like that in public,

305
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:26,601
and I never have, and I never will,

306
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:29,183
just think it's something that we
should all be aware of.

307
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:30,702
okay ?

308
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:33,871
Now that we've learned this,
let's continue.

309
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:37,790
See, this is good. We're learning,
and we're figuring some stuff out.

310
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:40,200
"You need to do something
about your coffee breath."

311
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,240
- You need to do something about
- Shut up, shut up, shut up,

312
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:44,470
Okay, I don't think you
people are grasping,

313
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:47,720
the concept of the suggestion box.

314
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:50,552
Sometimes you talk to us real close.

315
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,842
Yeah? Is that hard for you ?

316
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:53,700
Alright, well...

317
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:55,681
- Well, when you have coffee breath, it's hard
- I'll work on that, okay.

318
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:57,613
Okay. Let's keep, let's keep going.

319
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:02,283
What do we have here ? We have..

320
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:05,033
Somebody's piece of gum.

321
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,211
Somebody put a piece
of gum in there.

322
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,873
This is not a-a garbage can.

323
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:10,250
This is the future of our company.

324
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:12,681
This is not a place for gum, okay ?

325
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,121
I don't want to have to
read these tomorrow...

326
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,262
Yeah, who wants to
come in on a Saturday ?

327
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,030
Yeah. What ?

328
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:22,222
- Alright. Next suggestion.
-  Next suggestion.

329
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,310
"Don't sl-" Okay, that's blank.

330
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,352
"Don't sleep with your boss ?"

331
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:33,161
Do you think this is referring
to you boning Jan ?

332
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,641
- I can't, I can't. Alright, please sit down
- I don't understand why you're so upset.

333
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,491
I'm going to sit over here,
you're going to sit over there.

334
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:40,251
Let me ask you this.

335
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:41,222
Please sit yourself down.

336
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:43,560
- Let me ask you something.
- What, Michael ?

337
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,882
Where did you get your outfit ?

338
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:50,501
You’re going to give me this raise.

339
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,673
I deserve this raise.

340
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:54,970
Yes ! Yes ! Yes !

341
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:00,961
The least you can do is keep my
salary consistent with inflation !

342
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,821
Yes! Why are you going to
give me this raise ?!

343
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,682
Why ?!

344
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,570
Because, I’m awesome !

345
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:13,973
I am awesome !

346
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:16,600
I just don't understand,

347
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:18,682
why you have to pretend
like nothing happened.

348
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:20,671
Because nothing did Michael.

349
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:24,020
It, I'm not going to say
anything more about it.

350
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:25,600
And I would advise that you do the same.

351
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,461
Look.
Michael ?

352
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:29,221
- Oh my God.
- I'm sorry, am I interrupting.

353
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:31,073
Oh God. Were you guys making out ?

354
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:32,662
No, Dwight. Come in.

355
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,331
- Great.
- What do you want, Dwight ?

356
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:36,760
I am ready for my performance review.

357
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:40,041
Okay. Great. Your performance
has been adaquate.

358
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,152
You may leave. Good-bye. 

359
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:45,551
Is this how you've been conducting
all the reviews, Michael ?

360
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,062
You want to talk now ? Good.
Okay, Dwight, leave.

361
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,550
Oh, wait. I would like
to discuss my raise.

362
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:53,010
Why on earth would we give you a raise ?

363
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:54,703
That is an excellent question.

364
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:56,432
Thank you for asking.

365
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,570
Let me bring up one word.
Dedication.

366
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:05,380
I  have never, been late.

367
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:06,692
Also,

368
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:09,823
I have never missed a day due to illness.

369
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,103
Even when I had walking pneumonia.

370
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,751
I even come in on holidays.

371
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:17,000
You do ? How do you get in ?

372
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:18,742
I have a copy of your key.

373
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,360
- That's a serious offense.
- That is a serious offense.

374
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:23,021
Very serious.

375
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:24,953
As is toying with a man's heart.

376
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:26,823
Oh, Michael, for God sakes.

377
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:29,782
I'd also further like to talk
about my merits in the workplace.

378
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:31,603
Okay, third wheel,
why don't you do that ?

379
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:34,890
For instance, the time brought in
deer jerky for the whole office.

380
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:36,803
That was deer ? Gross.

381
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:38,692
- Oh, god, Did not
- You liked it.

382
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:40,202
- Jan, have you ever had deer?
- No

383
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,851
It's a delicacy. And, you know
what, it's an aphrodisiac.

384
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:46,223
So when we're done here, you guys
could go over to the Antler Lodge,

385
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,701
sample some deer, and
talk about my raise.

386
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:49,152
What do you say Jan?

387
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:51,900
Okay. Here's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to step outside,

388
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,412
collect my thoughts, and I will
return in about 10 minutes.

389
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,463
- Okay, you just, clear your head.
- Thank you Dwight.

390
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,152
I know it's your job.
I know you have to ask.

391
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,753
but I promise you, I'm not going
to discuss it with him.

392
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,710
I'm certainly not going
to discuss it with you.

393
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:07,722
Do you have a light?

394
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:11,781
And in conclusion, I think Lex Luther
said it best, when he said,

395
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:17,153
"Dad, you have no idea,
what, I'm capable of."

396
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:19,133
- That's from Superman ?
- Smallville.

397
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:24,273
And that, is why I feel,
I deserve this raise.

398
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:30,420
Do you think Michael and Jan actually...

399
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:33,533
I don't really want to picture it,
but thank you, Pam.

400
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,050
How do you come back from that ?

401
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:38,523
You don't

402
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:40,702
I don't think, come all the
way back, you know?

403
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,252
Especially working together.

404
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,442
No, I mean, doing that with Michael.

405
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:47,320
How do you come back from that,
as a human being ?

406
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:49,593
Oh, yeah. No. I don't think you can.

407
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,231
I'm heading back to New York.

408
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:56,113
Allan and I will conduct your performance
review over the phone tomorrow.

409
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:57,641
- Okay, good ?
- Wait, wait, wait... No, no, no.

410
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:59,823
Come, I just, I just want to know why.

411
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,080
Michael, now is not the
time or the place.

412
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:04,792
Okay. So you're saying that there is,

413
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:05,760
- a different or place...
- No.

414
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:06,692
- that we can have this discssion.
- I am saying...

415
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,602
We are never gonna
have this conversation.

416
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:11,382
Well, okay. Never as in
never, ever, ever ?

417
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:13,922
<i>Or never as in there's no chance?</i>

418
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,861
<i>Never for me always
means never, ever, ever.</i>

419
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:19,011
From the horse's mouth,

420
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,103
- what is the deal-io ?
- You know Michael.

421
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:21,891
- Am I too short ?
- Michael !

422
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:23,361
It has nothing to do
with your looks, okay ?

423
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,590
It's your, it's your personality.

424
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,282
I mean you're obnoxious, and rude.

425
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:30,750
And-and-and stupid.

426
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:32,673
And you do have coffee
breath by the way.

427
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:35,510
And-and, I don't agree about the B.O.

428
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:38,522
But you are very, very, inconsiderate.

429
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:41,073
- Really ?
- Really. You're-you're-you're...

430
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:45,091
- You're a great guy, okay ?
- I appreciate that, thank you.

431
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:46,670
You were very sweet.

432
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:49,232
And you stayed up with
me and talked to me,

433
00:19:49,997 --> 00:19:51,753
and cried with me and I appreciate that.

434
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:53,612
No, i wasn't, I wasn't crying.

435
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:57,052
But I am just not in the place right now
where I'm looking for a relationship.

436
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:59,232
So, we can still work together,

437
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:01,412
We can still be friends, but...

438
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:04,620
Okay ?

439
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:08,760
So my looks have nothing to do with it.

440
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:18,611
Jan is not in a place where she feels,
she can have a relationship right now.

441
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,583
And it doesn't matter
how great a guy I am.

442
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,041
And that is all I needed. I'm good.

443
00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:27,323
I can go home now.

444
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:38,451
Hey !

445
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,903
It's 12:20. Where the hell is Dwight?

446
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,181
No idea.

447
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,013
Never missed a day my ass.

448
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:57,823
I'm here ! I'm here!

449
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:01,702
I'm here ! It's okay !



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
