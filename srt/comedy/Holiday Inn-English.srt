1
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:40,041
Happy holiday

2
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,152
- Merry Christmas, bud.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas to you.

3
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,326
Okay. Hi, Chief.

4
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,498
Come in.

5
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,546
Hello, honey.

6
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,921
Well, this is our last
night in show business.

7
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,799
Some feeling, huh?

8
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,299
Some feeling.

9
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,009
I got the ring and the license.

10
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,720
- Honey, we're ready.
- Oh.

11
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,098
Say, there's a hook
leftover at the top here.

12
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,307
Should that be?

13
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,027
Never mind, I'll take care of it.

14
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,942
- Jim?
- Huh?

15
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,778
Well, I think that tie's terrible.

16
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,364
Well, who cares?
Tomorrow I'm a farmer.

17
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,532
You'd better go change it.

18
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,701
Listen, honey, when you're
flipping those twinkle toes

19
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,452
who's gonna be looking at my tie?

20
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,287
You only have five minutes. Hurry.

21
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,665
Okay, I'm on my way.

22
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,680
What'd he say?

23
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,348
I didn't tell him.

24
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,100
Why not? We love each other.

25
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,893
You wanna continue dancing.

26
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,813
I know, but he gets a look.

27
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,648
Oh, he's always had that look.

28
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,442
It doesn't mean anything emotionally.

29
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,235
It has something to
do with his liver.

30
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,028
Simply tell him you
had made a mistake.

31
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,281
You don't wanna give up your
career and live on a farm.

32
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,783
But he's already bought the farm.

33
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,958
And the license, and the ring.

34
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,997
Oh, I can't tell him.

35
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,250
All right, I will.
Right after our number.

36
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,377
Listen, darling, don't weaken.

37
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,837
Think of our life together.

38
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,214
Think of diamonds, of sables,

39
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,883
of your own little penthouse.

40
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,676
Is that a promise?

41
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,012
Well, just think about
them for the time being.

42
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,181
Ready, Miss Dixon.

43
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,599
Well, thank you.

44
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,434
Say, this thing didn't come out even.

45
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,905
Oh, I'll fix it. We have to hurry.

46
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,482
I love you.

47
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,030
I love you...

48
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,235
and Jim.

49
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:42,364
I love Jim, too. But after all,
I mean, let's not be too chummy.

50
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,184
Here she comes down the street

51
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,269
My, oh my, ain't she sweet?

52
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,272
Why, here comes my hot toddy

53
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,900
Over my dead body

54
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:24,448
I'll capture her heart singing

55
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,328
Just wait until she gets
a load of my dancing

56
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:36,335
Just wait till I start singing

57
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,756
I'll take her strolling down
the road with my dancing

58
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,509
I can't go wrong, a tender song

59
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,761
And she'll discover my charms

60
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,389
Some fancy taps and she'll collapse

61
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,100
And fall right into my arms

62
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:57,940
I'll capture her heart singing

63
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,109
Oh, no, you haven't a chance

64
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,988
When I go into my dance

65
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:14,832
I'll take you through life singing

66
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:30,523
I'll make you my wife dancing

67
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,274
If you could dance instead of sing

68
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,651
I'd learn to love you somehow

69
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,987
If you could sing instead of dance

70
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,948
I'd take you home with me now

71
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,298
The way you sing don't mean a thing

72
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,759
You'd better stick to your dance

73
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,303
And as for you, your dance won't do

74
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,139
You'll have to sing for romance

75
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,060
I'll capture her heart...

76
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,279
- Singing
- Dancing

77
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,902
Not much of a Christmas
present for you, is it?

78
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,863
I mean, both of us
walking out on you.

79
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,449
Don't worry about me, kid.
I'll do all right.

80
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,909
Whata chum.

81
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,578
Can't you see what we're
walking out on? The grind.

82
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,415
365 days a year.

83
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,250
When's the last time
you had as day off?

84
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,960
I don't know. Maybe last year?

85
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,586
Do you ever hear of Thanksgiving

86
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,047
or Labor Day or the Fourth of July?

87
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,133
- Vaguely.
- You know what they are, don't you?

88
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,676
They're holidays.

89
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,761
Days of rest. There's lots of 'em.

90
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,179
They mark 'em in red on the calendar

91
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,389
so you can't miss 'em.

92
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,100
What happens in show business
when a holiday comes along?

93
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,477
You give an extra performance.

94
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,729
Not for me, brother.

95
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,314
Lila and I are going up to
that farm in Connecticut

96
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,534
and we're gonna live by the calendar.

97
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,946
- Say, Jim?
- Mmm?

98
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,655
There's something you should know.

99
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,408
Oh, I know, Ted. I feel
the same way about you.

100
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,286
You know, we've had
our ups and our downs

101
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,996
and we fought a little over the women

102
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,247
we swiped from each other, but...

103
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,791
- I know, but...
- Sorry, Jimmy boy, but that's life.

104
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,668
Ted, if I'm not the best
manager in the business

105
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,795
I'll eat a garage mechanic's shirt.

106
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,505
Fifteen weeks at the Park Club,

107
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,174
sight unseen, for you and Lila.

108
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:14,771
$200 a week more than you were
getting with the farmer thrown in.

109
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,185
What's the matter?

110
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,516
I haven't told him.

111
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,310
- You haven't told him?
- You haven't told him?

112
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,896
Haven't told me what? What...
What's this? What's the news?

113
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,315
Well, don't be upset, Jim, dear.

114
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,942
It isn't that I don't love you. I do.

115
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,194
I love everybody,

116
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,697
but when Ted explained how
much he loved me and...

117
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,326
All at once, we both realized
that we belong together.

118
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,495
The two of us, dedicating our lives

119
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,580
to making people happy with our feet.

120
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,165
The two of you, huh?

121
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,335
Dedicating your lives to making
people happy with your feet.

122
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,338
That's sweet.

123
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,298
Well, I guess that kick I just
got was a good start, huh?

124
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,592
Sorry, Jimmy boy, but that's life.

125
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,260
Yeah, it's best that you
found out now, Jim.

126
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,012
You wouldn't wanna make Lila unhappy.

127
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,140
Oh, no. No, I... I wouldn't
want to make Lila unhappy.

128
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,644
Not now, now that I really know her.

129
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,148
What a narrow squeak that was.

130
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,191
What do you mean by that?

131
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,527
Oh, nothing. Nothing, honey.

132
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,986
I'm just happy that you're happy.

133
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,657
That little speech sounds like the
crack of a confederate money.

134
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,202
Well, kids, I'm still gonna
rejoin the human race.

135
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,413
I hope you get a lot of work,
holidays included,

136
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:27,134
dance yourselves into
beautiful nervous breakdowns.

137
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,546
You ever want to look me up,
you know where to find me,

138
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,967
Midville, Connecticut,
under a large shady tree,

139
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,186
just being lazy.

140
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:43,481
Lazy, I want to be lazy

141
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:48,188
I long to be out in the sun

142
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,733
With no work to be done

143
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,862
Under that awning

144
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:58,699
They call the sky

145
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,953
Stretching and yawning

146
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,373
And let the world go drifting by

147
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,500
I want to peep

148
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,335
Through the deep

149
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,130
Tangled wildwood

150
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:17,217
Counting sheep till I sleep

151
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,437
Like a child would

152
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,850
With a great big valise full

153
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,895
Of books to read where it's peaceful

154
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,607
While I'm killing time

155
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:35,829
Being lazy

156
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,872
So Lazy Acres was a snare
and a delusion, huh?

157
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, brother, there's the
hardest work in the world.

158
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,336
Maybe you'd be happier
back in town, Jim.

159
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,380
Of course, if you get that
agricultural urge again,

160
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,006
you can always raise a geranium.

161
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,425
Oh, no. Wait till you hear.

162
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,386
I think I've dreamed up the
greatest idea I ever had.

163
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,679
And you've had some pips.

164
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,972
Oh, but this can't miss.

165
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,267
I'm turning the farm into
an inn, but what an inn.

166
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,146
Here, read up, brother.

167
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,027
"Holiday Inn, Midville Connecticut."

168
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,864
- Open holidays only?
- Mmm-hmm.

169
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,116
Say, how many of those are there?

170
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,034
There's about 15.

171
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,787
That gives me 350 days
a year to kick around in.

172
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,247
He would think of that.

173
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,166
Did you get your discharge
papers from that sanitarium?

174
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,919
Oh, don't you worry,
this is gonna work.

175
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,338
I'm having auditions out
at the farm every day.

176
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,548
Say, if you run into any talent

177
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,757
that's willing to work for
a share of the table,

178
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,925
will you send them out?

179
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,552
Sure, soon as I get back.

180
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,137
I'm flying down to
Miami Beach tonight

181
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,556
to set an engagement
for Ted and Lila.

182
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,765
Lila.

183
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,267
You forgot to order the flowers.

184
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,477
Now, don't get excited, there's
a flower shop out at the airport.

185
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,188
I guarantee to have orchids in her
dressing room before her first number.

186
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,565
Oh, boy, you better.

187
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,609
As I remember, this kid even
expects presents on Father's Day.

188
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,819
Yeah.

189
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,114
Well, good luck, Jim.
So long, Ted. Have a nice trip.

190
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,868
I mean, yeah, thanks, I will.

191
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,911
That reminds me,
I forgot to give him a little

192
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,747
Christmas remembrance
I brought along.

193
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,216
Got one here for each of you.

194
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,424
Say, this is swell.

195
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,920
What is it?

196
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,547
It's homemade peach preserves.

197
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,050
I put them up myself, just before
I went into the sanitarium.

198
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:07,637
Boy, do I go for those.
Why, they're great on...

199
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,930
Or even plain.

200
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,099
They're non-fattening, too.

201
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,810
Well, it's a long trip back to
the farm, I think I'll get along.

202
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,312
Will you say hello to Lila for me?

203
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,772
But you gotta wait and catch the act.

204
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,277
We got some new routines
and then after the show...

205
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,832
I don't think they like
this nightclub air.

206
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,754
Wait. Wait. You better
wait for Lila's.

207
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,097
I think Danny's was the loudest.

208
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,145
Well, different tone.

209
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,938
Dawn patrol, huh?

210
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,152
Hello! Am I too late?

211
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,326
You would have been
in another minute.

212
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,873
Danny Reed.

213
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,997
Listen, I have to wait on that man.

214
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,083
- But...
- I'll work five nights for you. Anything.

215
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,962
Just leave me alone
and don't butt in.

216
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,340
What would you like?

217
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,134
Orchids, the finest you've got.

218
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,176
Corsage?

219
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,845
No. No. A dozen.

220
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,556
Loose, looking like they don't care.

221
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,682
All right.

222
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,726
There, "Lila, love, Ted."

223
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,645
Have them delivered
to Miss Lila Dixon

224
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,897
at the Club Pierre
before 11:00 tonight.

225
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,775
Oh, I'm sorry, but our delivery
truck is on its last trip

226
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,904
and won't be back until after 11:00.

227
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,197
How about a messenger boy?

228
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,367
Oh, it's impossible to guarantee
delivery this late on Christmas Eve.

229
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,370
But to help you out, I'll take them.

230
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,497
Oh, there you are.

231
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,124
A dozen orchids, please.

232
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,542
Lady, you're a lifesaver.

233
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,879
Here. Here's $5. Take your boyfriend
out and show him a good time.

234
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,840
Oh, thank you, but let's
consider this a personal favor.

235
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,009
Well, I can't leave town
indebted to a stranger.

236
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,844
Would you like to see the
floor show at the club tonight?

237
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,012
Oh, I'd like to very much, but...

238
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,431
All right, now you just
give this card to Francois

239
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,685
and he'll seat you at
the entertainer's table.

240
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,478
Why, you're Mr. Reed.

241
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,604
Uh-oh.

242
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,607
I'm Linda Mason. Well,
this is just a part-time job.

243
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,067
Actually, I sing and dance.
Mr. Reed, I want...

244
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,653
I know. I know, you've studied
dancing since you were a little child.

245
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,656
You spent long weary hours in every
theatrical agency in Broadway.

246
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,409
But just now I happen to
be catching a plane to...

247
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,620
Of course, once you
told me I was no good,

248
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,623
I could probably get a job at a
bargain basement and like it.

249
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,250
Now look, honestly,
as soon as I get...

250
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:47,088
Oh, of course. Sure, you worked
hard, you want a chance.

251
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,965
So what? So I'm gonna give it to you.

252
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,133
- A job?
- Uh-huh.

253
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,593
A friend of mine is opening a place

254
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,220
in Connecticut, Holiday Inn.

255
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,763
You take that card
out there tomorrow,

256
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,516
tell him I sent you
and you'll be all set.

257
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,518
Mr. Reed, how could
I possibly thank you?

258
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,444
Don't. Just deliver those orchids
and let me catch my plane.

259
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,706
This table's reserved for the band.

260
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,542
Excuse me!

261
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,761
Fussy, isn't he?

262
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,554
I think I'll have
a bowl of coffee, huh?

263
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,186
- And the lady?
- Coffee.

264
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,448
We seem to be on the
40-cent tour here.

265
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,950
It is embarrassing.

266
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,201
I'm Jim Hardy.

267
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,874
Linda Mason.

268
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,831
Got a friend in the show?

269
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,916
Well, I'm here at
Mr. Reed's invitation.

270
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,794
Oh, Danny.

271
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,170
Then you know Ted Hanover.

272
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,089
What?

273
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,632
Yes, naturally.

274
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,842
Oh, my.

275
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,177
He's quite a man with
the ladies, that Ted.

276
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:20,056
Well, after all, he's a
very attractive man.

277
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,182
Do you know him?

278
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,059
Oh, yes. Yes.

279
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,894
Matter of fact,
I've been considering Ted

280
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,730
and his partner for my new club.

281
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,189
Oh, you have a place.

282
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,774
Oh, yes. Yes.

283
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,360
I don't know, though.
His act might not go

284
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,863
so well at a place as large as mine.

285
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,072
Oh.

286
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,575
Well, I've found that the size
of a place doesn't matter,

287
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,244
if one has sufficient personality.

288
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,705
That's what you found, huh?

289
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,300
You in show business?

290
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,209
I'm Linda Mason.

291
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,259
Oh, Linda Mason.

292
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,820
I could dance nightly

293
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,448
Just holding you tightly

294
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,951
My sweet

295
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,953
I could keep right on

296
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:28,254
Because you're so light on your feet

297
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,386
You're easy to dance with

298
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,925
There is no doubt in

299
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:42,182
The way we stand out in the crowd

300
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,058
Though it's called dancing

301
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:50,110
To me it's romancing out loud

302
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:55,786
You're easy to dance with

303
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,904
Loving you the way I do

304
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,241
Makes you easy to dance with

305
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:05,042
That is why I'm always
right on the beat

306
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,748
All those charms in one man's arms

307
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,835
Make you easy to dance with

308
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:16,057
I can hardly keep my mind on my feet

309
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,509
Let's dance forever

310
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,472
Come on, say we'll never be through

311
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:29,854
It's so easy to dance with you

312
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:51,505
You're easy to dance with

313
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:12,522
You're easy to dance with

314
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:46,435
It's so easy to dance with you

315
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:50,225
It's so easy to dance

316
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:54,020
It's so easy to dance

317
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,398
With you

318
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,320
That was wonderful.

319
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,780
Oh, it's a great act,
isn't it? Here they come.

320
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,449
- Who?
- Ted and Lila.

321
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,952
Hey, what's the matter?

322
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,662
- Hello, Lila.
- Jimmy boy.

323
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,121
- How are you?
- I'm so glad to see you.

324
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,206
It's good to see you.

325
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,749
I thought you were alone, Jim.

326
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,251
Who's your friend,
and what's her hurry?

327
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,545
Don't ask me, she's your friend.

328
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,712
- Mine?
- Yeah.

329
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,673
What is she afraid of? Facing me?

330
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,799
Darling, I swear, I never...

331
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,883
"Darling, I swear."

332
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,926
You lie...

333
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,679
You're on.

334
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,830
So this is Holiday Inn.

335
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,291
Yeah. Will be if it ever opens up.

336
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,917
Well, why shouldn't it open?

337
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,085
Well, I ain't one to talk,

338
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,795
but you could probably
buy a half interest

339
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,839
in this place for a barrel of apples.

340
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,095
Next train for New York's at
7:43, if I can flag her down.

341
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,852
Say, I'm looking for a job.
Where's the boss?

342
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:19,072
Right here, I'll be down in a second.

343
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,529
So, you're the big shot

344
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,156
that didn't know whether
Hanover and Dixon

345
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,741
were good enough for your place.

346
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:33,161
Well, that wasn't exactly hay
you were throwing, either.

347
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,871
"I'm Linda Mason."

348
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,206
Merry Christmas.

349
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,167
All right, you're a
fake and I'm a phony.

350
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,543
And we're both soaked.

351
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,420
- Are you hurt?
- I'll check later.

352
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,797
Come on, let's get out of
this before you catch cold.

353
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,595
All right. Ooh.

354
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,636
Well, here's what cooks.

355
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,184
Oh.

356
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,933
Well, this is darling.

357
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,768
Was it as large as this
when it was a farmhouse?

358
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,437
Yeah, it was built by a fellow
who felt cramped in New York.

359
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,272
He finally ran out of lumber, though.

360
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,523
Oh, Mamie.

361
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,241
Coming.

362
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,407
Is your names Mamie?

363
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,575
- No.
- No.

364
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,124
Get back in the kitchen.

365
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,167
My, my. What's happened?

366
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,835
Oh, we had a little accident.

367
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,921
- Mamie, this is Miss Linda Mason.
- How do you do?

368
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,464
Please to know you, Miss Linda.

369
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,674
And these are her children.

370
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,717
That's Daphne, and that's Vanderbilt.

371
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,811
How do you do?

372
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,888
Mamie, will you take Miss
Mason up to the guest room

373
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,390
and change her into
anything that'll fit her

374
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,891
while we get her clothes dry, huh?

375
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,143
Sure thing, Mr. Jimmy.
Come on, honey.

376
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:43,399
I'll see about getting the
fire ready in the living room.

377
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,402
Is your names Miss Linda?

378
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,280
- No.
- No.

379
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:02,166
I don't know, it sounds like
something you dream about at night

380
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,377
and it would be wonderful,

381
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,713
then you'd wake up in the morning
and realize it couldn't work.

382
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,716
Oh, it'll work, if I can sell
the idea to some performers.

383
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,759
They seem to think
that profit sharing

384
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,761
means taking bows on
an empty stomach.

385
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,888
So that's why you're
not open tonight.

386
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,057
Well, I'm also, sort of, particular

387
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,606
about the kind of
talent I'm gonna use.

388
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,937
Fifteen holidays a year.

389
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,147
Mmm-hmm.

390
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,773
You're a lazy fellow.

391
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,400
No, not especially.

392
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,694
Just have my own ideas about living.

393
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:33,698
My father was like you.
Just a man with a family.

394
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,035
Never amounted to much, didn't care.

395
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,453
But as long as he was alive

396
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:41,247
we always had plenty to eat
and clothes to keep us warm.

397
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,999
- Were you happy?
- Yes.

398
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,212
Then your father was a very
successful man. Hope I can do as well.

399
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,965
Say, I came out here for
a job. Could you use me?

400
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,884
Well, I might find a spot for you

401
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,260
in my first show. What can you do?

402
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,471
I sing a little and dance.

403
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,057
Couldn't guarantee
any salary at first,

404
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,184
right now I've got the
ledger and an iron lung.

405
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,811
I don't care if you pay off in
eggs, just give me a chance.

406
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,313
Well, let's see what you can do.

407
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,731
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

408
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,649
You know, I've written
special music for each holiday.

409
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,153
This sort of gives me a chance to
keep a little promise I made to myself.

410
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,280
I said I was gonna sing
this song at the inn tonight.

411
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm dreaming

412
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,959
Of a white Christmas

413
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,382
Just like the ones I used to know

414
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:37,595
Where the treetops glisten

415
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,891
And children listen

416
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:49,367
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

417
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:54,654
I'm dreaming

418
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:59,535
Of a white Christmas

419
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:06,916
With every Christmas card I write

420
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:14,392
May your days be merry and bright

421
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:24,392
And may all your Christmases

422
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:28,568
Be white

423
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:35,194
I'm dreaming

424
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:39,699
Of a white Christmas

425
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,992
Just like...

426
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,537
Just like the ones I used to know

427
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,039
Where the treetops glisten.

428
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,668
Where the treetops glisten

429
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,878
And children listen.

430
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:56,007
And children listen

431
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,342
To hear

432
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:04,065
Sleigh bells in the snow

433
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:13,608
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

434
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:20,996
With every Christmas card I write

435
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:28,247
May your days be merry

436
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:33,754
And bright

437
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,925
And may all your

438
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:42,637
Christmases

439
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:49,942
Be white

440
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:44,407
Happy holiday

441
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:48,077
Happy holiday

442
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:52,248
While the merry bells keep ringing

443
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,918
May your every wish come true

444
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:03,217
Happy holiday

445
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:07,179
May the calendar keep bringing

446
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,605
Happy holidays to you

447
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,146
If you're burdened down with trouble

448
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,523
If your nerves are wearing thin

449
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,859
Park your load down the road

450
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,695
And come to Holiday Inn

451
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:25,364
If the traffic noise affects you

452
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,616
Like a squeaky violin

453
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,077
Kick your cares down the stairs

454
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,538
And come to Holiday Inn

455
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,416
If you can't find somebody who

456
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,543
Would set your heart a-whirl

457
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,254
Get in your car and motor to

458
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,923
The home of boy meets girl

459
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,760
If you're laid-up with a breakdown

460
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,595
Throw away your vitamin

461
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,013
Don't get worse

462
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,348
Grab your nurse

463
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,100
And come to Holiday Inn

464
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:59,950
Happy holiday

465
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,779
May the calendar keep bringing

466
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,950
Happy holidays to you

467
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,455
Happy New Year, Ted.

468
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,813
No!

469
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,687
Francois, have you seen Mr. Hanover?

470
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,814
Twice, sir.

471
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:40,898
What happened?

472
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,191
The first time, sir,

473
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,527
he came from his dressing room
with a telegram in his hand.

474
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,530
He ordered Scotch and soda,
a bottle of each.

475
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,073
I know, I know. What then?

476
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,658
The second time he came
from his dressing room

477
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,035
he asked which way is Connecticut.

478
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,745
- Connecticut?
- Connecticut.

479
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,832
He said he has a friend there
who knows about women, too.

480
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,708
Why didn't you stop him?

481
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,627
How could I stop him,
sir, when I don't know

482
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,631
which way is Connecticut.

483
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,842
Who said Holiday Inn wouldn't work?

484
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,803
Well, we're gonna divvy up a stack
of important money tonight, huh?

485
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,054
Man, man.

486
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,223
I've got a landlady who's gonna
ask for your autographed picture.

487
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,349
No.

488
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,143
Everybody get something?

489
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,478
All right, come on, now.

490
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,688
Go to bed, now, it's getting late.

491
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,907
- Good night.
- Good night.

492
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,488
Look, it's almost time.

493
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,824
Say, it's practically
straight up, isn't it?

494
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,618
One minute to midnight

495
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,954
One minute to go

496
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,331
One minute to say good-bye

497
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,918
Before we say hello

498
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,713
Let's start the new year right

499
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,048
Twelve o'clock tonight

500
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,551
When they dim the light

501
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,180
Let's begin

502
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:58,267
Kissing the old year out

503
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,770
Kissing the new year in

504
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,648
Let's watch the old year die

505
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,942
With a fond good-bye

506
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,403
And our hopes as high

507
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,656
As a kite

508
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,493
How can our love go wrong if

509
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:20,414
We start the new year right?

510
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,626
That's it. That's midnight.

511
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,002
I'll see you out on
the floor, all right?

512
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,255
All right.

513
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,425
Come on, everybody. Happy New Year.

514
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,519
Happy holiday.

515
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,399
Happy New Year.

516
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,661
I forgot my check.

517
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,915
You won't need that, but I
think you'll need your coat.

518
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,126
Happy New Year.

519
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,924
Same to you.

520
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,714
You got to dance.
Oh, you got to dance.

521
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,675
Come on, you got to...

522
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,879
Why, Mr. Hanover.

523
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,167
Mr. Hanover.

524
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,294
That's Mr. Hanover.

525
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,670
Wait a minute, I got to go.

526
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,338
Oh, no, I don't want Ted Hanover,

527
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,840
I want you. This is New Years, kid.

528
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,388
I know.

529
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,194
Ted!

530
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,739
He wasn't drunk, it's a gag.

531
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,031
What happened?

532
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,241
Ted Hanover with his new partner.

533
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,617
They were great.

534
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,335
New partner?

535
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,627
You better get back.

536
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,713
Well, I am sorry, if I'd
have known how he was...

537
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:41,809
Oh, he'll be all right in a week
or 10 days. You better hurry.

538
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,063
Ted!

539
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,027
Ted!

540
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,771
Ted!

541
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,364
Oh.

542
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:56,857
How is he?

543
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,150
He's out cold.

544
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:01,871
Hot or cold, he can keep his
dancing shoes in my office.

545
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,405
Did you hear that applause?

546
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,531
Yeah, it went pretty good.

547
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,409
And I was worried
about his losing Lila.

548
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,911
- Losing Lila?
- Yeah.

549
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,163
Yeah, she eloped tonight
with some Texan from Texas,

550
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,749
with Ted's engagement
ring on her finger.

551
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,000
But who cares?

552
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,879
You lose one girl,
you find another. That's life.

553
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,798
That's good, huh?

554
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,258
Here we go again.

555
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,567
Come in.

556
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,565
- Good morning, Ted.
- Oh. Good morning.

557
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,660
Got a little head?

558
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,570
Where am I?

559
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,072
You're at Holiday Inn.

560
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,907
Well, how did I get here?
Who brought me?

561
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:50,160
You were clinging to the
undercarriage of a jeep, I think.

562
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,755
Here, have a slug out of the mug.

563
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,008
- You mean you don't remember anything?
- Uh...

564
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,714
Let's see. I had a wire from Lila

565
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,382
telling me she's going to marry
some millionaire or something.

566
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,676
- I remember that all right.
- Mmm-hmm.

567
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,094
Then I had a drink.

568
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,596
A drink?

569
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,978
Boy, you were fractured.

570
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:15,019
And then I decided I had
to talk to my old pal, Jim.

571
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,187
You don't remember anything else?

572
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,531
No. That's all, except that

573
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,442
I must have been killed on the
way out here or something.

574
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,278
You really come up empty, huh?

575
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,281
Too bad about Lila.

576
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,323
I think you're better
off doing a single.

577
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,658
You're a born soloist, you know.

578
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,326
Oh, no, no, Jim, I've
got to have a partner.

579
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,536
And when I find her...

580
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,912
Yeah, I know,
you'll fall in love with her.

581
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,956
- You haven't missed yet.
- Happy New Year!

582
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,583
Oh, don't do that.

583
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,210
Why didn't you tell me?

584
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,213
Letting me beat my brains out
worrying about his losing Lila

585
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,716
and all the time, he's got
this girl on the leash.

586
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,718
What girl?

587
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,344
Boy, you must have been high.

588
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,888
Doing a complete dance routine

589
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,437
with your new partner and you...

590
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,351
You don't know who she is?

591
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,145
I danced with a new partner?

592
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,813
When? Where?

593
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,066
Here. Last night.

594
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,906
Think, Ted. Remember?

595
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,156
Wait a minute. I remember.

596
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,830
I got here just about midnight.

597
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,707
There was a girl.

598
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,622
We danced.

599
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,000
What she look like?

600
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,930
I... I don't know. All I
saw was a vague outline.

601
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,926
Can't you remember
anything about her?

602
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,760
I remember dancing with her.

603
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,011
If I ever dance with her again,

604
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,930
I'd probably recognize her.

605
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,266
Great, that takes care of
everything but finding her.

606
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,226
You were here, why ask
me how she looked?

607
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,729
I only saw her from
the back. She was...

608
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,397
About this...

609
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,150
She had a...

610
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,443
If I ever saw her from the
back again, I'd recognize her.

611
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,986
Well, that's fine.

612
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,237
After I've danced with her,

613
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,323
I'll just turn her
around for your okay.

614
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,451
This should be a cinch.

615
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,995
You saw her, describe her.

616
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:01,333
Who, me? Well, I wasn't
watching very closely.

617
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,711
She was a medium...
Medium-built sort of a girl,

618
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,422
with a medium face. She had
a nice evening gown on

619
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,049
with a belt in the back.

620
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,301
See, she was built just
like a girl friend of mine.

621
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,137
A girl you don't know but her
name was Consuela Stupkis.

622
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,765
She used to play the pinball machine
a lot down at the corner drugstore.

623
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,768
I remember one time she was
high man. Three weeks in a row.

624
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,604
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

625
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,732
That's nothing at all,
happy to do it.

626
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,609
See, I got a hunch, fellas.

627
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,112
I've got a hunch we're going
to find this girl eventually.

628
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,781
And when we do we'll be
glad we waited for her.

629
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:37,077
Listen, I'm not interested in getting
any other partner, understand?

630
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,878
A chance meeting
in the night. Destiny.

631
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,749
She'll be back.

632
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,844
Here's where we will find
her on the next holiday.

633
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,138
- Here?
- Here.

634
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,884
I've got to go turn the roast.

635
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,316
Now don't worry, we'll find her.

636
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,106
If I see her from the back again,
I'll recognize her.

637
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,827
It's kind of a roundabout way
to go at it, but let's try it.

638
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,171
Are you decent?

639
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,049
Yes, come in.

640
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:15,842
What's that?

641
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,219
Well, I thought it over

642
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,846
and I believe that our number'll
go a little better in blackface.

643
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,182
Oh. I thought we were
going to do it like this.

644
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:25,402
Well, that's before...
Before I thought it over.

645
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,854
- I look terrible in the stuff.
- No.

646
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,523
I don't even know how to put it on.

647
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,441
I'll put it on for you.

648
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,115
I broke in as a bootblack, you know.

649
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,079
Here we go.

650
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,198
Oh.

651
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,991
For a month and a half
I've been dreaming

652
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,244
of how pretty I was
going to look tonight.

653
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:45,622
Well, here's my punishment
for thinking so well of myself.

654
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,083
Oh, you'll have plenty
of times to be pretty.

655
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,835
I was just going to
ask you if you'd like

656
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,586
to be in the rest of
the shows out here.

657
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,259
You were?

658
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,595
- Will you?
- Will I?

659
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,219
Fifteen nights a year Cinderella
steps into her pumpkin coach

660
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,893
and becomes queen of Holiday Inn.

661
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,600
Well, what's the matter?

662
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,561
I wish I didn't have to work
all the other days in the year

663
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:10,147
to make these few possible.

664
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,822
Maybe a little later on
when we start doing better

665
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,736
you could stay out here all the time.

666
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,405
Did you hear what you just said?

667
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,374
Yeah.

668
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,118
Was it a proposal?

669
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,872
It will be when I get a
few bucks in the bank.

670
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,166
You're a strange duck.

671
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,251
You don't even give me
a chance to say darling

672
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:33,587
and throw my arms around you.

673
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,381
Better save that till
you see the bankbook.

674
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,761
Well, I guess I'm sort of engaged.

675
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,868
Say, what is this? A daisy chain?

676
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:12,005
Well, we were just looking for
the back of a girl we don't know.

677
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:44,324
Upon a February morn

678
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,701
A tiny baby boy was born

679
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,000
Abraham

680
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:52,462
Abraham

681
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,669
When he growed up, this tiny babe

682
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,546
Folks all called him Honest Abe

683
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,594
Abraham

684
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,477
Abraham

685
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:07,222
In 1860, he became

686
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,141
The sixteenth president

687
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,978
And now he's in the hall of fame

688
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:16,356
A most respected gent

689
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,067
That's why we celebrate

690
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,861
This blessed February date

691
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,285
Abraham

692
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,242
Abraham

693
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,960
When black folks lived in slavery

694
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:40,046
Who was it set the darkie free?

695
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,423
Abraham

696
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:42,966
That's right, child.

697
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,635
Abraham

698
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,680
When troubles come
down from the shelf

699
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,891
Who's heart was bigger than hisself?

700
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,727
Abraham

701
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:54,853
Yeah, ma'am!

702
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,652
Abraham

703
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,734
The country's going to the dogs

704
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,737
They shouted loud and strong

705
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,698
Then from a cabin made out of logs

706
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:09,743
The right man came along

707
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,662
And that is why we celebrate

708
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,665
This blessed February date

709
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:21,889
Abraham

710
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,637
The U.S.A.'s united thanks

711
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,722
Yeah

712
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,974
To one whose name was Nancy Hanks

713
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,142
Tell me!

714
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:39,564
Abraham

715
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,649
She gave this land the finest son

716
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,859
That's what she did.

717
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,111
Who ever went to Washington

718
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,279
Who dat?

719
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,615
Abraham

720
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,369
Abraham

721
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,412
When someone told him General Grant

722
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,248
Was drinking every night

723
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,210
He answered, "Go see if you can't

724
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,430
"Get all my generals tight"

725
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,466
That's why we celebrate

726
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,470
This blessed February date

727
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,055
Abraham

728
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,393
Abraham

729
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,235
Abraham

730
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,081
Good night.

731
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,382
I give up. She's not here tonight.

732
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,793
You wait here, I'll go up
and see if Jim's seen her.

733
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,545
Gus is waiting to take
you to the station.

734
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:47,175
Remember now, day after tomorrow,
St. Valentine's Day.

735
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,136
Someone's coming, we better
use the other stairway.

736
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,560
- Who is it?
- Bill-collector.

737
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,786
- Good night.
- Good night, Jim.

738
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,698
You better get inside before you
catch cold. You haven't got a coat.

739
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,667
- Well, I...
- Go on.

740
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,247
I don't need a coat now.

741
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,752
Hey, Ted. Did you find the girl?

742
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,422
This is terrible, I wish we could
recognize her from the front.

743
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:28,715
I feel like a wolf.

744
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,308
Why, Ted.

745
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,406
Ted!

746
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,442
- She's here!
- Who?

747
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:48,776
- I saw her!
- This way.

748
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,903
Let go of my coat.

749
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,113
This way, shortcut,
shortcut. Come on.

750
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,740
Giddyap.

751
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,414
It's locked, it's never
been locked before.

752
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,883
Let's try the other stairwell.

753
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,293
Let go of me, let go.

754
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:06,966
Go ahead.

755
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,344
Well, we've lost her again.

756
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,638
Did you get a look at
her face this time?

757
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:19,390
No, we're still working
from the rear.

758
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,684
How do you know it was her?
After all, she had an overcoat on.

759
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,937
I don't care if she had...

760
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,231
How do you know she
had an overcoat on?

761
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,816
Well, she... If she didn't,

762
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,151
look for a girl with pneumonia.

763
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,824
Come on. Let's get inside.

764
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,115
Say, Jim, when's your next show?

765
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,540
Next show? St. Valentine's
Day, I think.

766
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,412
- Day after tomorrow, huh?
- Is it?

767
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,456
That's our break.
We'll get here bright and early

768
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,624
and stay until we find her.

769
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,792
We'll make an announcement

770
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,168
asking her to identify herself.

771
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,087
- We won't miss next time.
- No.

772
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,297
Say, fellas, how did
you like the show?

773
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:55,510
Well, we were so busy we didn't
see much of it, Jim. Why?

774
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:58,012
I thought the people seemed
to like the blackface routine.

775
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,222
Yeah, they did.

776
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,557
Don't you think a blackface number

777
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,725
on St. Valentine's
Day would be novel?

778
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,978
- A what?
- It's no good, eh?

779
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,396
Just an idea I had.

780
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,772
Well, good-bye.

781
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,982
- Good-bye, Ted.
- So long, Jim.

782
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,609
Bye, Dan.

783
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,163
- Hey, lady.
- Yes.

784
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,166
You know we open in an hour.
You haven't even had a rehearsal.

785
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,884
Coming.

786
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,088
Oh, very smart.

787
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,091
You'll have to talk Gus into
buying a horseless carriage.

788
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,210
I spend half my life between
here and the station.

789
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:42,228
I think Gus will have to face the
machine age sooner or later, won't he?

790
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,101
Did you escape those
bill-collectors the other night?

791
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,269
Bill-collectors?

792
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,021
Oh, yes, temporarily.
Say, that reminds me,

793
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,355
I have a surprise for you downstairs.

794
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,566
Well, thanks. What reminds you?

795
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,777
Nothing, it's just... I mean,
I want you to remember the surprise

796
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,488
when those doggone
bill-collectors move in.

797
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,538
You sound sweet,
but you don't make sense.

798
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,416
The inn is so romantic looking.

799
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,511
Nice? I posed for
those cupids myself.

800
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,588
Hello, boys.

801
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,798
Hi. How are you?

802
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,842
Paid-up cards here tonight.

803
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,719
Where's the surprise?

804
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,770
Aha! Right here, a little
home cooking I whipped up.

805
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,728
Beautiful.

806
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,276
"Be Careful, It's My Heart."

807
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,362
And I ain't kidding, either.

808
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,989
I wrote this just for you, honey.

809
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:53,675
Be careful, it's my heart

810
00:52:54,713 --> 00:53:00,561
It's not my watch you're
holding, it's my heart

811
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:05,264
It's not the note I sent you

812
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:09,065
That you quickly burned

813
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,188
It's not the book I lent you

814
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,733
That you never returned

815
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:22,617
Remember, it's my heart

816
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:29,708
The heart with which
so willingly I part

817
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:33,918
It's yours to take, to keep or break

818
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:37,547
But please, before you start

819
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:43,396
Be careful, it's my heart

820
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:03,449
Be careful, it's my heart

821
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:10,335
It's not my watch you're
holding, it's my heart

822
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,794
It's not the note I sent you

823
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:18,755
That you quickly burned

824
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:22,260
It's not the book I lent you

825
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:26,851
That you never returned

826
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:33,612
Remember, it's my heart

827
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:42,111
The heart with which
so willingly I part

828
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:46,073
It's yours to take, to keep or break

829
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:50,745
But please, before you start

830
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:56,878
Be careful, it's my heart

831
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,162
I'm sorry, Jim, I couldn't resist it.

832
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,415
Wonderful, she's prefect,
light as a feather.

833
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,916
You found her, Jim. You're a pal.

834
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,001
Yeah.

835
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,294
Young lady, do you realize

836
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,045
that we've been searching
for you for weeks?

837
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,389
- For me?
- Yes, ever since...

838
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,050
The girl in the flower shop.

839
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,760
Yes, Mr. Reed.

840
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,721
Where have you been working
since New Year's Eve?

841
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,439
Here.

842
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,850
Would you mind letting
me in on your secret?

843
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,101
Oh, it's no secret.

844
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,228
Ted Hanover is looking for
a new dancing partner

845
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,479
and we've decided
to give you the job.

846
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,772
Oh, here now. Wait, just a minute.

847
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,190
Oh, no hard feelings, Jim,

848
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,276
I don't blame you for trying.
She is wonderful.

849
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:46,819
I feel as if I've
known her for months.

850
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,863
Oh. Same old feeling, huh?

851
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,490
Let's see, Washington's
Birthday is the next show.

852
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,243
That will give us a week of rehearsals.
We can open the act here.

853
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,621
I'll take care of the invitations.
Strictly formal.

854
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,247
I'll get all the newspaper
boys from New York.

855
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,416
Now hold everything. This is my inn,

856
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,543
and I am not running it for
a bunch of stuffed shirts.

857
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,295
What would you like,
the dungaree set?

858
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,964
Well, that would be better than the
bunch of chowder heads you drag in.

859
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,466
Maybe I can't use the act.

860
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,343
Not use Ted Hanover?

861
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:12,562
Well, the show is pretty well set.

862
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,263
You're in, but he's out.

863
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,350
But you could change the show
for a special occasion like this.

864
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,186
Of course he could. He's just
trying to hide his gratitude.

865
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,438
Jim, you better think
up a number for us.

866
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,232
Well, just what do
you visualize, Ziggy?

867
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,485
Ah, let's see.

868
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:31,197
For Washington's birthday I see,
sort of, a romantic costume thing.

869
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,282
- Naturally.
- Something that just reeks

870
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,368
- with grace and charm, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

871
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,746
I think the music should
be sweet and gentle to...

872
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:42,877
Well, to create the mood, each time
I take her into my arms and kiss her.

873
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,460
That's it.

874
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:48,056
Don't you think it's getting
a little stuffy in here?

875
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,808
I could say that you're homely

876
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,477
Just as homely as pie

877
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,397
But this is Washington's birthday

878
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,525
And I've got to say you're beautiful

879
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,237
'Cause I can't tell a lie

880
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:56,198
I could say that you're stupid

881
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,160
Nothing up in your crown

882
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:02,079
But this is Washington's birthday

883
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,497
And the truthful he

884
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,999
Of the cherry tree

885
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,753
Would look down on me and frown

886
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:14,341
I could say that I hate you if I try

887
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,428
But I've got to say I love you

888
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:20,598
'Cause it's February
the twenty-second

889
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,444
And I can't tell a lie

890
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,928
Hit it.

891
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,148
Come in.

892
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,856
Well, honey, in spite of what
good old Jim tried to do to us,

893
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,983
your future starts as of tonight.

894
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,069
Now where would you
like to go from here?

895
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,445
- From here?
- Yes.

896
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,698
New York, Havana, Rio? We have
our pick of engagements, you know.

897
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,201
But I can't be your partner
if you leave the inn.

898
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:31,330
Of course you can. There's no reason
for you to remain buried here.

899
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,540
There's a very good reason.

900
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:37,086
I promised to be in Jim's holiday
shows for the rest of the year.

901
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,337
Ah, but he tricked you into that

902
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:39,964
while he was hiding you from me.

903
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:42,934
No matter how he
did it, I've promised.

904
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:46,929
Besides, well,
we're going to be married.

905
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:50,349
Married? Now wait a minute,
let's be fair.

906
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:51,725
He didn't give me a chance.

907
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,978
After all, I love you, too.

908
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,188
Linda, from the very first
moment we danced together,

909
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,149
I knew you were to be
the one girl in my life.

910
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,698
You didn't even know my name.

911
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:04,989
Please. All right,
forget about me, then.

912
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,283
Forget about Jim, think of yourself.

913
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,576
Here's your chance to do
the one thing you like best.

914
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,796
Not only for 15 days
a year, but always.

915
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,043
Sorry, but I promised.

916
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,685
Well?

917
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,891
I guess I should apologize for
hooking up your number, huh?

918
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:37,147
Oh, forget it. I'm the one
that should apologize to you.

919
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,315
Here I've been trying to
take Linda away from you

920
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,108
not knowing you two
were going to be married.

921
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,781
Married?

922
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:46,160
Yeah, aren't you?

923
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:48,825
Yes, sure.

924
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,290
I mean, naturally,
we're sort of engaged.

925
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:53,913
Oh.

926
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:58,672
Well, anyway, I've decided to
bow out of here. Linda's all yours.

927
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,462
Well, you're a pretty game
guy to take it this way.

928
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:05,049
Well, it's happened so often I'm
getting used to it, that's all.

929
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,216
Good-bye, kid.

930
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,509
A lot of luck, Ted.

931
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,262
Thanks.

932
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,103
How are we doing?

933
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,731
Two minutes ago, I would have
sold my chances for a tired dime.

934
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:23,233
But when a man is surprised to
hear that he's going to be married,

935
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:26,111
brother, that's when I go to
work with a clear conscience.

936
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,410
- Everything's good, huh?
- Everything is perfect.

937
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,617
In your Easter bonnet

938
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,921
With all the frills upon it

939
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:20,457
You'll be the grandest lady

940
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:24,753
In the Easter parade

941
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,674
I'll be all in clover

942
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:32,302
And when they look you over

943
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:35,597
I'll be the proudest fellow

944
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:39,435
In the Easter parade

945
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:43,110
On the Avenue

946
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:46,868
Fifth Avenue

947
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:50,988
The photographers will snap us

948
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:54,158
And you'll find that you're

949
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,912
In the rotogravure

950
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:02,042
Oh, I could write a sonnet

951
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:06,879
About your Easter bonnet

952
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,466
And of the girl I'm taking

953
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:14,303
To the Easter parade

954
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:18,399
On the Avenue

955
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:22,236
Fifth Avenue

956
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:26,565
The photographers will snap us

957
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:30,070
And you'll find that you're

958
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,614
In the rotogravure

959
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:39,167
Oh, I could write a sonnet

960
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:43,373
About your Easter bonnet

961
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:47,211
And of the girl I'm taking

962
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:53,765
To the Easter parade

963
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,396
Hello!

964
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,016
I didn't exactly expect
the welcome mat,

965
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,235
but I thought somebody
might say hello.

966
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,853
- Hello.
- Thanks.

967
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:08,023
What brings you here on this
bright and uninviting day?

968
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,323
I've discovered something,
my friends, about life.

969
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,778
Meaning what?

970
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:15,447
Well, I don't want success,

971
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:19,117
I want the true happiness you
people have found here at the inn.

972
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,786
You're not gonna stay in the inn?

973
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,996
Not just stay, I want to
be part of your shows,

974
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,623
help you in your work,

975
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,797
share your simple pleasures.

976
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,336
I asked you once not
to interfere, Ted.

977
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:32,548
Please believe me, I am a tired,
lonely and unhappy man.

978
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:36,677
But I could be happy here, helping
the two people I like the best.

979
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:37,803
Will you take me in?

980
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:38,887
My motherly intuition

981
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,806
tells me to throw him out.

982
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:43,225
Well, at least give him
the benefit of the doubt.

983
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,185
I've given him plenty of doubt.

984
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:48,940
Are you kidding with that "sharing
life's simple pleasures"?

985
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,941
May I go inside with you?

986
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:52,659
Why, of course.

987
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,945
My... My trunks will
arrive this afternoon.

988
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,072
What do I do?
Move in the broom closet?

989
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,700
Jim, that's no way to talk to
a man who's here to help you.

990
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,410
The world doesn't change.

991
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,204
A gentle smile often breeds
a kick in the pants.

992
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:07,504
But for your sake,
Linda, I'll be big.

993
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,937
I'll give you a tip about
these things, Gus.

994
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,981
They'll go up and back,
but not sideways.

995
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:33,025
Yeah, well, I keep forgetting

996
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:35,110
this blind thing can't
see where it's going.

997
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,822
Yeah, well, unload the rest of
this stuff in the back, huh?

998
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,665
Hey! What did you do,
get up before breakfast?

999
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,375
Why, every morning.
I trust you slept well.

1000
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,668
When I found out how late you got in,

1001
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,587
I told Mamie to let you sleep.

1002
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:55,589
- Life on a farm!
- Can't beat it, huh?

1003
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,049
Jim, you've made me very happy!

1004
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,300
That's fine.

1005
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,218
Now, how about you making me happy?

1006
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,387
You sound like a landlord
with eviction papers.

1007
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:04,431
Oh. This is good news,
Lila's back in New York.

1008
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,475
I got a letter from her yesterday.

1009
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,934
What happened to her millionaire?

1010
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,394
Slight mistake there.

1011
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,230
He didn't own millions, he owed them.

1012
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:16,360
Poor girl, always straying to greener
pastures and finding spinach.

1013
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:17,569
Say, she was wondering if you'd

1014
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,613
be interested in taking
her back as a partner.

1015
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,073
I think it'd be a great idea.

1016
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,866
Naturally, you would.

1017
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,035
But I like it here
with you and Linda.

1018
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:27,538
Yes, and we love having you, too.

1019
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,875
Uh, when are you leaving?

1020
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,597
- Why didn't you say something?
- You look so silly.

1021
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,474
- Where's Jim?
- Inside.

1022
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:49,935
Good. I've fixed it. Here's the news

1023
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,104
in one luscious word: Hollywood!

1024
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,898
Now, I told you, I'm not leaving
here until Linda goes with me.

1025
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,275
But this is the setup you needed
to get her away from Jim.

1026
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,985
Now, there are going to be two
Hollywood men here tonight

1027
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,112
to see the show.

1028
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,446
One's an important director.

1029
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,782
If they like your dancing,
you and Linda

1030
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:06,243
will be on a westbound
train tomorrow.

1031
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,537
We better find out
if Linda's interested.

1032
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,123
We let her know when there's a
contract staring her in the face.

1033
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,208
- Look...
- Now I know you're in love with the girl

1034
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,001
but forget her until we
get her away from here.

1035
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,795
This is no time to be honest.

1036
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:17,963
Well, what should I do?

1037
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,173
All we have to do is to convince Jim

1038
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,801
that he'd be a heel if he stood
in the way of a chance like this.

1039
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,805
Oh, that'll be easy,
like peeling a turtle.

1040
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,189
Mamie says these go up here!

1041
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,943
Yes, set them right down.

1042
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:44,281
Say, Gus, how would you
like to earn a slow $10?

1043
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:47,159
Well, I don't care
how slow, but sure.

1044
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,244
It's sure, all right,
here's the wrinkle,

1045
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,996
I want you to go down to the station

1046
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,206
pick up a party and
start for Holiday Inn

1047
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,292
but never get here.
Could you handle that?

1048
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,668
Wouldn't be surprised!

1049
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:59,296
Hello, long distance.

1050
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:01,423
That's what I want you
to do with Linda Mason.

1051
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,800
Miss Mason? Our friend?

1052
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:06,178
You're not supposed
to understand it, Gus.

1053
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:10,015
For that kind of money you ought to
be able to go by way of Medicine Hat.

1054
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:12,644
Hello, yeah. Just a minute.

1055
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:18,398
Long distance, I want
to get Parkway Hotel,

1056
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,402
New York City, Miss Lila Dixon.

1057
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,343
Didn't Linda say she'd be
here for final rehearsal?

1058
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:50,269
Oh, relax, our audiences
aren't professional critics.

1059
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,823
Gus, you made a wrong turn.

1060
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:09,541
Shortcut.

1061
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,621
Gus!

1062
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,544
Shortcut, another shortcut.

1063
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,518
How could you possibly expect
to drive through this?

1064
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,363
Well, I never had no
trouble with a horse.

1065
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,859
Oh, you'd better carry me to shore,

1066
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,610
and I'll walk back to the highway.

1067
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:48,822
Well, I think you'd be better
off waiting right here.

1068
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:51,917
Gus, will you please do as I say?

1069
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,707
Oh, all right.

1070
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,127
- The other way.
- Huh?

1071
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:06,223
Turn around. Gus, turn around!

1072
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,138
Oh!

1073
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,224
Gus!

1074
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:16,808
- My hat!
- You pushed me.

1075
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,481
Get my hat!

1076
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,318
I swear the show will
start any minute now.

1077
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,612
You said that an hour ago.

1078
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:32,617
Yeah, but this time
I'm sincere. Excuse me.

1079
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,349
Who started the show?

1080
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,683
I did. You're on.

1081
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,018
But what about Ted's partner?

1082
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:02,729
You've kept this crowd waiting long
enough, he can go on without her.

1083
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,606
Have you gone nuts?
I've rehearsed a double dance.

1084
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:09,736
Let's say it with firecrackers
and banners held high

1085
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:15,325
Let's have a real old-fashioned
noisy Fourth of July

1086
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:17,869
Let's say it with firecrackers

1087
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,121
They'll jump at up North

1088
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:25,502
Let's have the kind we used
to call a glorious Fourth

1089
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:28,088
Let's salute our native land

1090
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,466
Roman candles in each hand

1091
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:33,176
While a Yankee Doodle band

1092
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,762
Gets hotter than a firecracker

1093
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:38,390
Don't need any long speeches

1094
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,642
Or shouts of "Hooray!"

1095
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:45,944
No words can say as much
as firecrackers can say

1096
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:56,241
Freedom! Freedom!

1097
01:14:56,242 --> 01:15:00,829
Here comes the Freedom Man

1098
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,581
On this day of independence

1099
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,042
On this Independence Day

1100
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:11,715
Listen to an American
troubadour from the U. S.A.

1101
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:16,761
I'm singing a song of freedom

1102
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:22,814
For all people who cry out to be free

1103
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,354
Free to sail the seven seas

1104
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,232
Free to worship as we please

1105
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,359
If the birds up in the trees

1106
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,610
Can be free

1107
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,988
Why can't we?

1108
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:40,326
I'm bringing a song of freedom

1109
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:46,332
To all people wherever they may be

1110
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,377
Free to speak and free to hear

1111
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,338
Free from want and free from fear

1112
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:54,549
Sons of freedom far and near

1113
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,759
Who agree

1114
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,719
Sing with me

1115
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:03,725
That all God's people shall be free

1116
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:09,022
I'm singing a song of freedom

1117
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:15,320
For all people who cry out to be free

1118
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:18,490
Free to sail the seven seas

1119
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:21,159
Free to worship as we please

1120
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,411
If the birds up in the trees

1121
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,496
Can be free

1122
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,498
Why can't we?

1123
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:31,753
I'm bringing a song of freedom

1124
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:36,976
To all people wherever they may be

1125
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:40,595
Free to speak and free to hear

1126
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,306
Free from want and free from fear

1127
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:45,809
Sons of freedom far and near

1128
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:46,935
Who agree

1129
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:48,603
Sing with me

1130
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:52,273
That all God's people shall be free

1131
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:56,369
That all God's people shall be free

1132
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:10,917
Will you give me a lift?

1133
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:12,920
Sure, hop in.

1134
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:22,847
Aren't you Ted Hanover's
former dancing partner?

1135
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:27,559
Yes, although I wouldn't
exactly say former.

1136
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,812
I'm dancing with him
at the inn tonight.

1137
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:34,274
But I... Doesn't he
have a new partner?

1138
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:36,151
Oh, she won't be there tonight.

1139
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,404
I didn't know that!

1140
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,321
I work at the inn.

1141
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,948
Oh?

1142
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,242
Waitress?

1143
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:46,120
Yes.

1144
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:51,126
I know your boss, Jim Hardy,
quite well. Quite well.

1145
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,961
Then he's responsible for
your rejoining Mr. Hanover.

1146
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:56,379
Uh-huh.

1147
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,548
By the way, if I were you,
I'd look my prettiest tonight

1148
01:17:58,549 --> 01:17:59,841
when I'm waiting on tables.

1149
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,593
Jim says there will be a
couple of men from Hollywood

1150
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:03,596
to consider Ted and me for pictures.

1151
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,264
And Mr. Hanover's other partner

1152
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:08,558
will be missing this chance
to go to Hollywood.

1153
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:10,602
Yes, although she can't
be very talented

1154
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,645
or they wouldn't be
working at the inn.

1155
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:15,524
Ted and I played
only the best places.

1156
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,236
Listen, you're late
for the show already,

1157
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,613
if you'd care to let me drive

1158
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:25,084
I know a shortcut that'll get
us there 15 minutes sooner.

1159
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:32,081
There's a farmhouse near here

1160
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:33,583
and I'll have us towed out
in a couple of minutes.

1161
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:34,918
Oh, for the love of mud, hurry!

1162
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:36,377
Wait right here!

1163
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,255
What else can I do?

1164
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,722
- You're on now.
- But Linda isn't here yet.

1165
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,015
You've got to save the pieces,

1166
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:50,141
keep those men interested now

1167
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,309
and do a number with Linda later.

1168
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:52,435
What can I do?

1169
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,395
Well, fake something.

1170
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,773
Fake something, okay.

1171
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:04,113
There's your cue.

1172
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,282
Don't fail me, keep them flying.

1173
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:08,080
I'll keep them flying.

1174
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,518
Linda! What happened to you?

1175
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,316
A bad job of sabotage.

1176
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,070
Excuse me!

1177
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,903
Well, Jim, you deliberately kept me

1178
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,905
from working at the inn
tonight, didn't you?

1179
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,574
- Yeah.
- You knew there would be men here

1180
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:37,326
from Hollywood who might
offer me a chance in pictures.

1181
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,704
You've decided I shouldn't
have that opportunity.

1182
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:42,165
Not even the opportunity to refuse.

1183
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,791
I was afraid the offer might

1184
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,918
be too important for
you to turn down.

1185
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,379
The point is you don't trust
me to make my own decisions

1186
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,340
because they might interfere
with your own selfish plans.

1187
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:54,427
I've had about enough of that, Jim.

1188
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:56,429
Ted, Linda!

1189
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,347
Mr. Parker, Mr. Dunbar,

1190
01:22:58,348 --> 01:22:59,557
I want you to meet the
greatest dance team

1191
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:01,434
in show business, Hanover and Mason.

1192
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:03,060
And the owner Jim Hardy.

1193
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:05,480
Glad to know you, Hardy.
Nice little place you've got here.

1194
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:06,731
Gentlemen, even though
you haven't seen

1195
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,524
Miss Mason dance, I can assure you...

1196
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,151
Hardy, Hollywood is always interested

1197
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:12,361
in new ideas and we
think this is a honey.

1198
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,864
Frankly, we'd like to do a picture
based on the Holiday Inn.

1199
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:17,825
The idea behind it, how it works,
the special holiday songs.

1200
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,161
Of course, it's purely a speculative
thing, far from foolproof

1201
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,954
and we can't afford to pay too much.

1202
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:23,664
You don't have to
start talking it down

1203
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,750
because the idea is not for sale.

1204
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:27,335
Well, maybe I haven't
explained enough.

1205
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:30,713
We expect to use Mr. Hanover
and his partner in the picture.

1206
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,548
Well, I don't know
how the others feel

1207
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:35,259
but I'd like to keep this little
setup just the way it is.

1208
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,594
Jim, would you be decent just once

1209
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,638
and let somebody else
around here have a chance?

1210
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,348
Wait a minute, Danny, after
all, the place belongs to him

1211
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,225
he can do as he wants.

1212
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:44,810
I guess it was just
too good to last, huh?

1213
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:46,771
A simple little layout,
where we could do our best

1214
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:50,116
at the work we know without
having any illusions of glory.

1215
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:54,487
I can see now that I'm the only
one who could be happy here.

1216
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,322
Go ahead, take the idea,
take the music,

1217
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:58,115
take Linda, take the
whole darn thing.

1218
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,450
But what about you? We'll need you

1219
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:01,327
in Hollywood to write
the rest of the music.

1220
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,287
Oh, no, I work right here.

1221
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:05,373
I'll send you the music
when it's written.

1222
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:08,297
And don't bother me before, huh?

1223
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,463
Guess maybe I was
a little selfish, huh?

1224
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:15,217
Is that the deal you wanted or
should I have thrown in my shirt?

1225
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,263
Chummy sort of a fellow, isn't he?

1226
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:23,766
Listen, Linda, if you
really want to stay here...

1227
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:27,186
Don't talk that way. This is the
chance you wanted, isn't it?

1228
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:30,941
Of course. Boy, are we happy!

1229
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:10,933
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Jim.

1230
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:13,686
Same to you, Mamie. And staff.

1231
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:16,272
Didn't I tell you children
to stay in the kitchen?

1232
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:19,697
Those wings ain't going
to fly away. Now shoo!

1233
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:23,362
Everything's ready and hot, Mr. Jim.

1234
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,160
Thank you, Mamie.

1235
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:49,138
I've got plenty to be thankful for

1236
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:50,723
Are you kidding?

1237
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:54,226
I haven't got a great big yacht

1238
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:57,354
To sail from shore to shore

1239
01:27:57,355 --> 01:28:01,484
Still I've got plenty
to be thankful for

1240
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:03,319
You're loaded, Dan.

1241
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:07,531
I've got plenty to be thankful for

1242
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:08,866
Like what?

1243
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,576
No private car

1244
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:11,869
No caviar

1245
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:15,374
No carpet on my floor

1246
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:19,794
Still I've got plenty
to be thankful for

1247
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:21,295
You know you're better off than I am.

1248
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,506
I've got eyes to see with

1249
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:24,715
You need glasses.

1250
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,509
Ears to hear with

1251
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:27,676
Or fly with.

1252
01:28:27,677 --> 01:28:29,053
Arms to hug with

1253
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:30,638
Lips to kiss with

1254
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,681
Someone to adore

1255
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:33,849
You're a little flat, too.

1256
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:39,104
How could anybody ask for more?

1257
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:42,107
My needs are small I buy them all

1258
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:45,486
At the five and ten cent store

1259
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:46,695
Sing it!

1260
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:47,863
Sing it pretty.

1261
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:50,617
Oh, I've got plenty
to be thankful for

1262
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:57,499
Why, you ain't ate a bite.

1263
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,000
I'm pouting, Mamie.

1264
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,126
Who is this?

1265
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,586
That's Mr. Jones.

1266
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:05,714
Jonesey! I'm sorry,
I knew him too well.

1267
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,508
But you got to eat.

1268
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:11,262
The trouble ain't with that
turkey, Mr. Jim, it's you!

1269
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:14,139
I feel all right.
I'm riding high, Mamie.

1270
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,433
Well, why you close
the inn and sit around

1271
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:18,477
like a jellyfish with the misery?

1272
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:20,646
'Cause a slicker stole your gal

1273
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:23,741
and you ain't got fight
enough to get her back.

1274
01:29:25,402 --> 01:29:26,777
Excuse me, Mr. Jim.

1275
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,612
I tried to keep her here!

1276
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,573
What kind of keeping is that?

1277
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:33,701
Nothing but tricks.
If you went to Hollywood

1278
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,953
and told Miss Linda how
much you loves her,

1279
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:38,289
and misses her, and told her that

1280
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:40,875
the way a lady likes to hear it told,

1281
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:46,505
I'll bet you she'd be the quickest
ex-movie star that ever exed.

1282
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:48,257
You're crazy, Mamie

1283
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:52,720
I'm crazy? I knows Miss Linda.

1284
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:56,181
I knows her like I knows my own kids.

1285
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:59,643
Why, she ain't the fancy
type no more than you are.

1286
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:03,355
What she wants is what
you got right here.

1287
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:07,443
But women has to have them
things told to them the right way.

1288
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:10,738
You could melt her heart
right down to butter,

1289
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:14,033
if you'd only turn on the heat.

1290
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:16,994
Mamie, you don't try
to take a fellow's gal

1291
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:19,668
away from him after
he's bought the ring.

1292
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:23,167
Or as I recall, do you?

1293
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:25,419
Now you're talking!

1294
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,380
Oh, sure, women has to be
told things the right way.

1295
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,053
Yes, sir!

1296
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:46,565
At last, the night I've been
dreaming about actually here.

1297
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:48,067
This is still my wedding, you know.

1298
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:49,526
You make me feel like a kibitzer.

1299
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,529
Now don't misunderstand me,
I'm happy because this marriage means

1300
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,115
that we can all settle
down and stop worrying.

1301
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,701
I wish I had your confidence
without your viewpoint.

1302
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,620
My fingers are crossed
until Linda and I

1303
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,205
are on that plane bound for Yuma.

1304
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:02,873
Now what's worrying you?

1305
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:05,084
I don't know, except I've been
this close to marriage before

1306
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:06,377
only to wake up next morning

1307
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,462
and find myself with no
bride and a hangover.

1308
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,965
Look, the girl said yes,
the picture finishes tonight,

1309
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:13,050
there's a judge waiting in Yuma.

1310
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:14,176
Come in!

1311
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:15,636
Everything is all set and ready.

1312
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:18,639
What could possibly happen to...

1313
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,813
Hi, fellows!

1314
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:26,188
Jim, what brought you here?

1315
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:28,362
Train. Chug chug chug chug.

1316
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,442
The wedding, when is it?

1317
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:32,695
- Wedding?
- Yeah.

1318
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:34,947
Well, we hadn't set any exact time.

1319
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:36,407
Have you seen Linda?

1320
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,867
No, no, not yet. But, say,
I saw your director,

1321
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:40,995
he told me he was shooting
the finale tonight,

1322
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:43,123
thought I'd like to see
how you make pictures.

1323
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:46,083
He wouldn't... You wouldn't
like what they're doing tonight.

1324
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:47,251
Why not?

1325
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:48,836
Oh, no, that's dull, technical stuff.

1326
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,130
Well, I'm a dull,
technical sort of a fellow.

1327
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:53,716
Perhaps if you'd wait
and see Linda tomorrow.

1328
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:56,719
Oh, no, I want to see the finish.

1329
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,222
The success of you and Linda
means a lot to me, pal.

1330
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,976
Say, why don't you be yourself.
What are you up to?

1331
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:07,479
Well, I'm a son of a gun.
This is a beautiful hunk of welcome

1332
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,981
for a guy who comes coast to coast

1333
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:11,984
just to wish you a merry
Christmas and a happy wedding.

1334
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:14,820
You remember how I suspected you

1335
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:17,415
when you came to live at
the inn on Easter morning?

1336
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:19,033
Silly, wasn't it?

1337
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:20,242
Now I know he's up to something.

1338
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:21,660
Oh, wait a minute
now let's not be unfair.

1339
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:22,745
No?

1340
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:25,330
No, we're treating Jim
like a poor country cousin.

1341
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:26,790
- He doesn't mean any harm!
- No!

1342
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,625
No, he just wants to see Linda.

1343
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:31,045
So let's show him Linda.

1344
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:32,921
Goodwill on earth toward men.

1345
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:35,516
This... Where we going? What's this?

1346
01:32:36,843 --> 01:32:39,219
Hey, Ted! What is this?

1347
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,929
I was afraid you'd gone crazy.

1348
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:45,105
I'll keep him in here till
you get Linda on that plane.

1349
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:48,062
I better hurry and get my clothes on.

1350
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,563
Yeah, in the meantime
I'll go down to the set

1351
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,023
and see how near ready they are.

1352
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:52,816
Wait a minute,
my clothes are in there.

1353
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,526
Merry Christmas!

1354
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:56,445
Jim, pal! Wait!

1355
01:32:56,446 --> 01:32:58,744
Stop! We were only fooling!

1356
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:03,336
Only you could think
of a thing like that.

1357
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:11,001
Who you calling?

1358
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:13,971
Nobody, the operator's gone.

1359
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:48,289
Take it easy. Don't break your neck.

1360
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:56,672
It's one of the most authentic
reproduction jobs we've ever done.

1361
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:57,881
Is it?

1362
01:33:57,882 --> 01:33:59,299
And all worked out
from those photographs

1363
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,884
we took of your place in Connecticut.

1364
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,887
Uh-huh.

1365
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:07,396
Well, Mamie and the kids ought to
see this. They'd never believe it!

1366
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:09,309
Anything wrong?

1367
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:12,020
Well, that Christmas tree's
a little out of place.

1368
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:15,649
I'd guess nobody would
notice that but me or Linda.

1369
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,484
We're going to start rolling
in a couple of minutes.

1370
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:18,902
Come along with me where
you can see everything.

1371
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:20,445
No, I'll just sort of
stay in the background.

1372
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:21,947
I don't want to get in your way.

1373
01:34:21,948 --> 01:34:23,657
Well, suit yourself.
I'll see you later.

1374
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:25,455
Right.

1375
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:46,263
All right, darling,
we're going to follow you

1376
01:34:46,264 --> 01:34:48,098
on the boom from here inside the inn.

1377
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,726
And when you get in the
other set, do your song.

1378
01:34:50,727 --> 01:34:52,603
Let's see, I think you have the mood,

1379
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:54,479
your Hollywood success was empty,

1380
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:58,154
you've lost the one man you love.
You know, the usual hope.

1381
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:01,528
Just make me cry and you
can get to that wedding.

1382
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:02,863
All ready for rehearsal!

1383
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:04,907
Please! Let's shoot it.

1384
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:07,706
Okay, it's a take!

1385
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:14,291
All right, everybody,
quiet on the stage, it's a take.

1386
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:17,252
Close them up. Come on, over there,

1387
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:20,006
quiet down, let's get
settled, everybody.

1388
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:26,178
Come on, everybody, let's get
settled now. This is the picture.

1389
01:35:28,097 --> 01:35:29,689
Hit the snow!

1390
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,606
All right, roll 'em!

1391
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,652
Sorry, Mr. Hanover,
but when the red light's on

1392
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:43,779
you couldn't get in even
if you owned the studio.

1393
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:45,155
Oh, but, pop, this is important.

1394
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:46,490
I know, so is the light.

1395
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:48,709
Hit the playback. Music!

1396
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:54,749
All right, action!

1397
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:21,803
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

1398
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:27,850
Just like the ones I used to know

1399
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:34,557
Where the treetops glisten

1400
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:38,894
And children listen

1401
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:45,323
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

1402
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:53,625
...dreaming of a white

1403
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:56,286
Christmas

1404
01:37:57,372 --> 01:38:02,878
With every Christmas card I write

1405
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:11,678
May your days be merry and bright

1406
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:16,394
Jim!

1407
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,566
Cut it! Cut it!

1408
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:20,353
That's it!

1409
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,608
All right, gentlemen!

1410
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:29,653
How could he get that
far in five minutes?

1411
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:31,863
The lady must have been willing.

1412
01:38:31,864 --> 01:38:34,742
But the world can't do this to us.

1413
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:54,302
Here she comes down the street

1414
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:56,680
I'll admit my defeat

1415
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:59,433
I've won my hot toddy

1416
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:01,685
Over my scarred body

1417
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:08,233
I knew that I'd win singing

1418
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:12,113
But wait until she gets
a load of your dancing

1419
01:39:12,989 --> 01:39:19,087
We'll stay at the inn singing

1420
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:23,170
All by myself I'll have
to stick to my dancing

1421
01:39:26,169 --> 01:39:28,753
Oh, no, my friend, I'm here to end

1422
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:31,298
Your dancing trouble and strife

1423
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:34,050
This will be fun, Miss Hit-and-Run

1424
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:36,803
Has come back into my life

1425
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,722
We'll stay at the inn...

1426
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:40,515
We'll have to begin...

1427
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:41,766
Singing!

1428
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:43,985
Dancing!

1429
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:54,946
We've each other to cling to

1430
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:56,948
You'll be easy to sing to

1431
01:39:56,949 --> 01:40:01,703
And you're easy to dance with

1432
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:07,542
So let the old year die
with a fond good-bye

1433
01:40:07,543 --> 01:40:12,924
And our hopes as high as a kite

1434
