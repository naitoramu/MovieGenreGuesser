1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,421
Hey, I got you a present!

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,007
Oh, my, where did you hide it?

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,927
I ordered it for your wedding
and it's finally here!

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,680
You didn't have to get us anything...

5
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,767
I love it! It's huge! Let's open it!

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:23,482
- It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!
- Oh, my God!

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,775
I didn't know where to put it.

8
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:29,738
- We can put it in the guest bedroom.
- Yeah, okay.

9
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,327
I kind of like it here.

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,704
Do you like it?

11
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,875
I practically spent my
entire childhood at the arcade.

12
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,419
- This was my second favorite.
- What's your first?

13
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,173
- I don't remember the name.
- Well, what did it do?

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:53,512
You'd put a quarter in,
pull some handles and win a candy bar.

15
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,014
A vending machine?

16
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,977
Don't feel bad for me.
I won every time!

17
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,729

20
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,018
I'm so glad you guys are here.

21
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,813
Guess what happened
in the paleontology department.

22
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,776
Do you think he saw us,
or can we still slip out?

23
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,197
Professor Newman, the department head,
is retiring, so...

24
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:58,452
- They made you head of the department!
- I'm teaching his advanced class!

25
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,497
Why didn't I get head
of the department?

26
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:08,253
Hey, Rach, I got a big date.
Do you know a good restaurant?

27
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:13,550
Paul's Cafe. It's got great food
and it's really romantic.

28
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,094
Great, thanks.

29
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,806
Then take her to the
Four Seasons for drinks.

30
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,768
Or go downtown
and listen to some jazz.

31
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,520
Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!

32
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,358
You sure are naming
a lot of ways to postpone sex.

33
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:34,613
I miss dating. Dressing up,
going to a fancy restaurant.

34
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:39,743
I won't be able to do that for so long.
And it's so much fun.

35
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,581
Not that sitting around
worrying about giving birth isn't fun.

36
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,753
Hey, you know what?
Why don't I take you out?

37
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,048
You don't want to date
a pregnant lady.

38
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,051
Yes, I do. We're gonna
have a good time.

39
00:02:56,301 --> 00:03:00,764
I'll take your mind off of childbirth,
and C-sections...

40
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,267
...and baby heads stretching out...

41
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,102
Okay, I'll go with you.

42
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,771
- It will be fun.
- All right.

43
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,857
No, no! Yes!

44
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,860
Would you look at that.

45
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,363
I knocked off all your top scores.
How sad.

46
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,823
Okay, I'm next.

47
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,410
Don't start another game.
I'm next! Phoebe?

48
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,581
Sorry, I couldn't hear you
over all the winning.

49
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,460
- Phoebe's hogging the game.
- It's a stupid game.

50
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,630
You think it's stupid because
you suck.

51
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,799
I don't suck. It sucks.

52
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,260
You suck.

53
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,599
If this game is gonna cause problems,
I should keep it.

54
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,644
No, I love it. It is a great present.

55
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,982
Why don't you go home and wait
for the "Thank You" card?

56
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:57,488
- Why do you want to play this game?
- It doesn't spit out a Clark Bar.

57
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,366
Okay. Phoebe, that's it.
Out of the chair.

58
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,251
Joey, could you get that?

59
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,308
I thought you were in your room.

60
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:29,937
I'm picking you up for our date.
For you.

61
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,025
Lilies. They're my favorite.
Thank you.

62
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,236
And a brownie.

63
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,699
Well, half a brownie.

64
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,076
Actually, it's just a bag.

65
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:49,080
It's a long walk from the flower shop
and I felt faint, so...

66
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:54,294
This is so great! I actually feel
like I'm on a real date.

67
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:59,675
But I have morning sickness and
I have on underwear that goes up to...

68
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,427
...there.

69
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,429
Hey, come on. This is a real date.

70
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,057
So nice place you got here.

71
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,437
Foosball. Pizza box.

72
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,608
Oh, a subscription to "Playboy."
My kind of woman.

73
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,818
That's my roommate's.

74
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,780
I'd like to meet him.
He sounds like a standup guy.

75
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,201
He's protective of me,
so you'd better watch yourself.

76
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,246
Your roommate, is he good-looking?

77
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,543
Must be tough to keep your hands
off him.

78
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,920
I'm pretty sure he's gay.

79
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,092
No! No, he's not! Why are you trying
to ruin the game?

80
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,598
Which brings us back
to Greely's Theory of Dominance.

81
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,808
That's it for today.

82
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,479
Does anyone know where
the Freeman Building is?

83
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,981
It's the new building on Avenue A.

84
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,236
That's across town.
I'm teaching there in 10 minutes.

85
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,613
Dude, that's not gonna happen.

86
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,492
Move it! Move it!

87
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,204
Hey! I'm the teacher!

88
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,511
Hello.

89
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,852
Sorry I'm a little late.
Whoa, a lot late.

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,815
Well, let me start
by introducing myself.

91
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,442
I'm Professor Geller.

92
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,862
So to sum up...

93
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:48,075
...I'm Professor Geller.
Good job today.

94
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,664
- What comes with the filet mignon?
- Steamed vegetables.

95
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,837
Instead of the vegetables...

96
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:04,341
...is there any way that I could
substitute the...

97
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,718
...three-pound lobster?

98
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,472
You know what? Bring her both.

99
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,058
And I'll have the same.

100
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:17,313
Wow, this is shaping up
to be a pretty good date.

101
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:20,608
I almost forgot.
I didn't pay you the rent.

102
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,027
No roommate stuff. It's a date.

103
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:27,907
Wow, so I get to see what
Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.

104
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,407
Have any moves?

105
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:34,037
No, I'm just myself,
and if they don't like me for...

106
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,584
I'm sorry, I couldn't even
get through that.

107
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,963
I knew it. Tell me your moves.

108
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,798
All right.

109
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,258
Well...

110
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:51,304
I start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.

111
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,933
Oh, my God. And that works?

112
00:07:55,184 --> 00:08:00,523
If you add, "This is embarrassing.
I just want to have a normal life."

113
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,192
You poor little famous man.

114
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:06,070
Okay, how about this one?

115
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,991
I was gonna wait until the end
of the night to kiss you...

116
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,121
...but you're just so beautiful,
I don't think I can.

117
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,122
Oh, my God!

118
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,420
Wow, that was fantastic!
I almost leaned in. Really.

119
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,798
So tell me one of your moves.

120
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,008
All right.

121
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,347
So where'd you grow up?

122
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,807
That's your move?

123
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,894
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.

124
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:43,023
- Come on, just answer the question.
- Queens.

125
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,651
Were you close to your parents?

126
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,112
- With my mom. Not so much my dad.
- Why not?

127
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,366
I don't know.
There's just this distance.

128
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:56,161
We both try to pretend it's not there,
but it is.

129
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,331
It's gotta be rough.

130
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,502
Yeah, it's really tough.
Sometimes I think...

131
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,587
Wow!

132
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,843
Nice move!

133
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,680
- "Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
- Thank you.

134
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,933
Now, excuse me.
I'm gonna use the restroom.

135
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:25,107
- Now you're watching me walk away.
- Yes, I am! So simple!

136
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:34,241
- You won't believe what I did today.
- Clearly not shower or shave.

137
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,827
I played this all day,
and now I rule.

138
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,456
They should change the name
to "Ms. Chandler."

139
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,503
Although, I hope they don't.

140
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:51,049
You stayed home and played Ms. Pac-Man
while I went to work like a chump?

141
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,180
I got the top ten scores. I erased
Phoebe off the board. High-five!

142
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,517
What is the matter with your hand?

143
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,480
I played for eight hours.

144
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,567
It'll loosen up. Check out the scores.

145
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,195
Also, look at the initials.
They're dirty words.

146
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:16,617
- Chandler, why would you do that?
- Because it's awesome.

147
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,410
You think it's clever?

148
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:23,749
They only give you three letters,
so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.

149
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:28,170
- This one's not dirty.
- Put it together with that one.

150
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,629
Oh.

151
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,760
If you don't clear this off,
you won't get one of those from me.

152
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,097
Ben's coming over.
This can't be there.

153
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:42,142
- He won't know what they mean.
- He's 7, not stupid.

154
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:46,730
- Have you talked to him lately?
- I'm gonna unplug it.

155
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:50,609
I'll have nothing to show for my day.
Like work.

156
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,569
No!

157
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,739
Hey, look! It's still there!

158
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:59,702
This thing must have some kind
of primitive ROM chip!

159
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,038
- You gotta beat your scores.
- With the claw?

160
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:06,667
Fine, I'll do it.
We gotta get this off.

161
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:10,838
Carol's still upset that
you taught him "Pull my finger."

162
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,799
Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!

163
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:22,933
- I am not gonna answer that.
- Oh, come on. Just pick one.

164
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,645
Between Monica, Phoebe,
Chandler and Ross...

165
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,439
...if you had to,
who would you punch?

166
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,276
We're friends.
I wouldn't punch any of them.

167
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,445
Chandler?

168
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,449
Yeah, but I don't know why.

169
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,786
- I'm having a wonderful time!
- Me too!

170
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,832
- This is the best date I ever had.
- I know!

171
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,710
I laughed so hard. Did you
see the wine come out my nose?

172
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,588
Joey, I think everybody saw it.

173
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:59,303
I never knew I could enjoy
the non-sex part of a date so much.

174
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:04,433
That's because you have never
been on a date with me before.

175
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,853
All right. Now don't judge me.

176
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:12,733
I normally wait till my date leaves,
but I'm ripping into the swan.

177
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,652
Okay, then you don't judge me.

178
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:19,365
I'm gonna suck on the cellophane
from that brownie.

179
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:32,962
So, what are Joey Tribbiani's
end-of-the-night moves?

180
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:39,051
Well, if I want the girl to kiss me...

181
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,721
...first, I make my lips
look irresistible.

182
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,181
How do you do it?

183
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:48,310
Now you can't tell anyone, but...

184
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:52,022
...I put on shiny lip balm.

185
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:57,778
- Oh, my God.
- Like a moth to a flame, I tell you.

186
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,698
- Okay, now you go.
- No, I don't want to tell you.

187
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,784
- Why not?
- It's embarrassing.

188
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,746
More embarrassing than
shiny raspberry lip balm?

189
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,541
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?

190
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,212
Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.

191
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:16,547
Okay.

192
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,841
All right, stand up.

193
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,596
Well, when we're at the door...

194
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:28,684
...I lightly press my lips
against his.

195
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:33,105
Then move into his body,
just for a second.

196
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,816
And then I make this sound:

197
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,533
It doesn't sound like anything,
but it works.

198
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,994
Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.

199
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:53,709
All right, I gotta go to bed.
I had such a wonderful time.

200
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,800
Me too.

201
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,022
You were 50 minutes late?
Did you crawl?

202
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,067
No, I ran, okay? It's really far.

203
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:22,530
When did people stop understanding
"Get out of my way"?

204
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,116
Why didn't you take a cab?

205
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:30,246
With the traffic and one-way streets,
it'd take me twice as long.

206
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:35,250
And I have class three times a week.
Who am I, Rockefeller?

207
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,420
You won't be able to keep doing this.

208
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,340
If I don't, they'll take the class
away from me.

209
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,636
And I put it in my family newsletter.

210
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:50,182
- Your what?
- You've seen it, "The Geller Yeller."

211
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,687
Right. Wow.

212
00:14:54,895 --> 00:15:00,025
I figured out a faster route.
I'm sure I can make it this time.

213
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:05,447
I just can't be afraid
to get a little bit hit by cars.

214
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,326
- Hey.
- Hi!

215
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,663
Remember when we talked about "Cujo"?

216
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:16,166
I can't believe you haven't seen "Cujo."

217
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,377
Relax, it isn't "Citizen Kane."

218
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,755
Have you ever sat through
"Citizen Kane"?

219
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:26,051
Yeah, it's really boring.
But it's, like, a big deal.

220
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,638
Anyway, I was thinking
about renting "Cujo."

221
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,224
Well, let's do it tonight.

222
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:36,061
- Don't you have that big date?
- Oh, right.

223
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,690
- Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

224
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,776
After our date, did you feel weird?

225
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:47,698
Oh, my God. You did too?
It freaked me out. What was that?

226
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:53,412
I don't know. I'm kind of thinking
it was the lobster.

227
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,460
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.

228
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:03,046
- I was up sick all night.
- Me too. All night.

229
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,966
Really? We didn't cross paths.

230
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:09,095
Yeah, well, that's because...

231
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,764
...I stayed in my room.

232
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,434
You don't want to look
in my hamper.

233
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,691
Okay, I got that.

234
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,901
I'll escape there.
I'll come back here.

235
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,863
All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man.

236
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,202
Well, you're just a little bitch,
aren't you?!

237
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,373
Hey, you guys?

238
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:41,043
I'm sorry that I was
hogging the game before.

239
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:47,550
Oh, my God! Your friends have
some unfortunate initials.

240
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,218
They're all Chandler.

241
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,720
Chandler couldn't get this good.

242
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,808
I did. But it came at a price.

243
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,187
Ben's coming, and he can't see this.

244
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,815
By age 7, kids have
already seen orgies.

245
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,530
Was it just me?

246
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,876
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!

247
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,592
Okay, why don't we all...

248
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,388
...open our books to page 23...

249
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,057
...where...

250
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,436
...where you will see...

251
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:47,400
...a bunch of red spots.

252
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:53,824
Okay, why don't you all start to read
while I...

253
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,545
Are you all right?
You seem a little distracted.

254
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:10,215
No, no, I'm fine. It's just...

255
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,510
Hey, can I ask you something?

256
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,638
Have you ever looked at someone
you know...

257
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:20,393
...and suddenly seen them
in a different way?

258
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,686
You mean like from behind?

259
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:30,611
Yeah. That's exactly it.

260
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:35,115
I saw this guy from behind,
and he seemed totally normal.

261
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:39,035
And then he turned around
and it was Stephen Baldwin!

262
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,207
So you know exactly what I mean.

263
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,711
Totally! Wow.

264
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,715
- Would you excuse me?
- Sure.

265
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,355
- Phoebe! You're on fire!
- I know!

266
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:07,898
You can do it!

267
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,108
- Don't touch me!
- Don't touch her!

268
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,611
Go left! Go right! Go right!

269
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,487
I can't! I can't!

270
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,908
No! You son of a...

271
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,715
Phoebe?!

272
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,969
Oh, hi, Ben.
No, don't look at the machine!

273
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,898
Thank God you're home!
I'm watching "Cujo."

274
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:54,737
- Alone?
- Yes! What is wrong with this dog?

275
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:59,074
Did you get to the part where Cujo
throws himself at the car?

276
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:03,204
No, seriously,
what's wrong with the dog?

277
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,914
Wait, what happened to your date?

278
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,500
Oh, it didn't work out.

279
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:13,422
- Want to watch the rest of the movie?
- Oh, okay. Yeah.

280
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,008
I never thought I'd say this...

281
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,510
...but I hope this dog dies.

282
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,682
What are you doing?
Sit here. Protect me.

283
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:27,103
Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?

284
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:41,324
- That's him, that's him! That's Cujo!
- I know.

285
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,912
It's gonna be okay.

286
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:50,501
Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now?
I can't watch.

287
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,798
How can you watch this?
Aren't you scared?

288
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,679
Terrified.

289
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,318
So is everybody here?
I got here a little early, myself.

290
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,569
Let us begin.

291
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:23,992
Now, the hadrosaurids have been
unearthed in two main locations.

292
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:27,871
Here...

293
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,915
...and...

294
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:31,875
...here.

295
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,629
Now, as for the hydrosaurs...

296
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,020
