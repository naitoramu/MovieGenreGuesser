00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:05,279
<i>Tonight, the Scranton Business Park
is having Casino Night.</i>

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:08,809
<i>And we are converting our warehouse
into a full-blown gambling hall.</i>

3
00:00:09,232 --> 00:00:11,217
<i>And I know it's illegal in
Pennsylvania,</i>

4
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:12,809
but, it's for charity.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,950
And I consider myself
a great philanderer.

6
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:18,683
It's just, nice to know
at the end of the day,

7
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,941
I can look in the mirror and say,
"Michael, because of you,"

8
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:26,375
"some little kid in the Congo
has a bellyful of rice this evening."

9
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:28,215
Just...

10
00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:30,335
makes you feel good.

11
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:42,297
Excuse me. How long is the wait
for a table for two ?

12
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:48,151
I would never, ever serve you.
Not in a million, billion years.

13
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:49,881
It's a nice tux.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,945
I know.  It belonged to
my grandfather.

15
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:55,605
He was buried in it.
So... family heirloom.

16
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:02,557
So, what's the deal ? We've gotta pay
for our own drinks ? That's lame.

17
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:05,091
Come on, it'll be fun.
And besides, I'm a roulette expert.

18
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:09,701
Impossible. Roulette is not a game
of skill. It is a game of chance.

19
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:12,966
- I can always kind of win at roulette.
- Oh, really ?

20
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,289
How would you do that ?

21
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,893
Mind control.

22
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:19,617
You can't be serious.

23
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:22,848
Are you serious ?

24
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,871
Ever since I as a little kid,
like eight or nine, I could...

25
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,206
sort of control things with my mind.

26
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:31,540
I don't believe you. Continue.

27
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:34,570
It was just little things, you know.
Like I could make something shake.

28
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:38,030
Or I could make a marble fall off the
counter. You know, just little things.

29
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:42,148
That's ridiculous. You know what ?

30
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:45,564
Why don't you move that coat rack ?

31
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:49,259
Excuse me, everyone!
Attention in the office, please!

32
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:52,285
Jim is about to prove
his telekinetic powers.

33
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,548
And he needs absolute silence.
Go ahead.

34
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:58,252
Okay, I'll try.

35
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:27,667
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,544

39
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,511
I try not to think of it
as lagging behind.

40
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,065
It's more of a David
and Goliath thing.

41
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:13,570
<i>Well, the fact of the matter is,</i>

42
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,406
<i>that your branch
is currently number four</i>

43
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:17,282
<i>of the five branches
that I oversee and...</i>

44
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:19,969
- Top 80%.
- <i>Michael...</i>

45
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:22,702
<i>You know that I'm very serious here.</i>

46
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:26,185
Jan, listen. I promise
I will kick it up a notch.

47
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:27,980
<i>What ?</i>

48
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,960
Emeril. Oh, actually,
while I have you...

49
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,790
Not that I have you
or have ever had you.

50
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:35,737
But, we're having our
Casino Night tonight,

51
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:38,975
and I think everyone would love
to see their fearless leader here.

52
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,544
<i>I thought that you were
their fearless leader ?</i>

53
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:46,398
I am, but your are the Eva Peron
to my Cesar Chavez.

54
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,255
- <i>I think you can handle it...</i>
- Oh, come on...

55
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:53,495
- <i>probably, Michael. </i>
- Come on! It'd be fun.

56
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:56,342
I can hear it in your voice.
You need a break.

57
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,720
<i>Goodbye, Michael.</i>

58
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,300
Jan and I understand each other.

59
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:05,103
The romance thing is sort of
on hold for the time being.

60
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,212
But we've remained good friends.
Good friends with privileges.

61
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,652
Not now. Someday.

62
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,827
Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is
to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.

63
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:19,370
- Again. We do that every year.
- Well, they need our money.

64
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:21,376
They don't have cookies
like the Girl Scouts.

65
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:24,269
It'd be nice to do something for
people who are actually suffering.

66
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:26,508
Well, Oscar, if you don't like it,

67
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:28,609
then you should concentrate
on winning.

68
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:33,474
Because the person at the end of the
evening with the highest chip count

69
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:37,861
will receive $500 to donate
to the charity of their choice.

70
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:41,617
And, they will get a mini fridge
compliments of Vance Refrigeration.

71
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:44,257
So, get your charities into Pam.

72
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,966
I, for example, am playing
for Comic Relief.

73
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:48,515
That doesn't exist anymore.

74
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:52,260
Comedy's very much alive,
as are homeless people.

75
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,242
No, they stopped making that show.

76
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:57,586
Well, then they need our money
more than ever.

77
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:00,436
You have to pick an approved,
nonprofit organization.

78
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,845
There's a great soup kitchen
in downtown Scranton.

79
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,862
Delicious pea soup on Thursdays.

80
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:06,962
I'll probably give the money to them.

81
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,202
Something with animals.

82
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,724
Or people.

83
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,269
Kobe Bryant has a foundation
and he is so hot.

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,202
And he gave his wife
the biggest diamond ring.

85
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:20,442
I know he didn't do it.

86
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,709
Maybe he did it.

87
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:26,865
We are giving money
that has been gambled.

88
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:29,808
Why don't we just deal drugs
or prostitute ourselves

89
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:31,780
and donate that money to charity ?

90
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:33,965
Oh, and another fun thing.

91
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,266
We, at the end of the night,
are going to give the check

92
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,067
to an actual group of Boy Scouts.
Right, Toby ? We're gonna...

93
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:43,914
Actually, I didn't think it was
appropriate to invite children

94
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:47,574
since it's, you know.
There's gambling and alcohol.

95
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:51,457
And it's in our dangerous warehouse.
And it's a school night.

96
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,361
And, you know, Hooters is catering.
You know. Is that enough ?

97
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:58,637
Should I keep going ?

98
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,419
Why are you the way that you are ?

99
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:07,337
Honestly, every time I try to do
something fun or exciting,

100
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:10,070
you make it not, that way.

101
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:17,195
I hate, so much about the things
that you choose to be.

102
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:25,069
Okay, you know what ? I will not
donate my winnings to Comic Relief.

103
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:26,629
Since, apparently, it doesn't exist.

104
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:30,078
I am going to donate to
Afghanistanis with AIDS.

105
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,400
Who ? I think you mean
the Aid to Afghanistan.

106
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:35,182
No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.

107
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,610
- Afghani.
- What ?

108
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:39,593
- Afghani.
- That's a dog.

109
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,033
- No, that's afghan.
- That's a shawl.

110
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,414
- Wait, canine AIDS ?
- No, humans with AIDS.

111
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:47,104
- Who has AIDS ?
- Guys, the Afghanistanannis.

112
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:49,743
Okay, you know what ? No, no.

113
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:54,165
AIDS is not funny.
Believe me, I have tried.

114
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,807
There are certain topics
that are off-limits to comedians.

115
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:00,892
JFK. AIDS. The Holocaust.

116
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:04,176
The Lincoln assassination
just recently became funny.

117
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:07,576
"I need to see this play like
I need a hole in the head."

118
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:11,540
And I hope to someday
live in a world

119
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:14,215
where a person could tell
a hilarious AIDS joke.

120
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:16,503
It's one of my dreams.

121
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:19,555
- What are you doing ?
- Oh, nothing.

122
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,297
"Till Death Do Us Rock."

123
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:25,221
They're wedding bands.

124
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:27,409
Roy was supposed to pick the band,

125
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,952
but he's concentrating more
on the bachelor party now.

126
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:31,915
Wait, wait, where are you going ?
I mean,

127
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:34,929
even if you don't hire a band,
you still have to watch the bands.

128
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:39,338
Pam, these are people who have
never given up on their dreams.

129
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:41,039
I have great respect for that.

130
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,253
And yes, they're all
probably very bad.

131
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:47,057
And that'll make me feel better
about not having dreams.

132
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,605
- There's a KISS cover band in here.
- Let's do it.

133
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,573
I'm pretty happy these days.

134
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:57,479
I'm getting married soon, and I'm
getting along with everybody at work.

135
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,061
Why did I talk to Jan
about transferring ?

136
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:04,641
<i>Well, you know...</i>

137
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,656
I have no future here.

138
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:13,113
I have already put down the deposit.

139
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,295
Do you understand how
a deposit works ?

140
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:18,838
Mike, I am not having fire eaters
in a paper warehouse.

141
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:21,157
It's Casino Night. Like Las Vegas.

142
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:22,940
There are fire eaters
all over the place.

143
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:25,450
- Except my warehouse.
- Well, actually, it's my warehouse.

144
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:27,340
Actually, it's owned
by Beekman Properties

145
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:30,275
and Dunder Mifflin is four years
into a seven-year lease.

146
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:32,328
Why are you here ?

147
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:35,412
When Darryl was coming, you said
you wanted me here for protection.

148
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,090
I said, not that.

149
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:43,711
We just have a lot of stuff down
there that could be stolen.

150
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:45,856
- That's ironic.
- What ?

151
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:48,073
That you are afraid.

152
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:50,701
Why ? 'Cause I'm from the hood ?

153
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:53,113
Dinkin' flicka.

154
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:55,788
Dinkin' flicka.

155
00:08:56,175 --> 00:09:01,477
I taught Mike some phrases to help
with his interracial conversations.

156
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:06,989
You know, stuff like "fleece it out,"
"going mach five," "dinkin flicka."

157
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:10,684
You know, things us Negroes say.

158
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:12,361
Gimme some.

159
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:19,934
Oh, yeah. I taught him
a handshake too.

160
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:45,716
I don't know how you're gonna decide.
They are all extremely good.

161
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:48,120
I think I should hire them all.
Do like Lollapalooza.

162
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:49,997
Have three stages. Yeah.

163
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,754
Your mom would love that.
She would.

164
00:09:53,898 --> 00:09:55,657
Now this band is called
Scrantonicity.

165
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:57,393
Let's take a look.

166
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:01,992
- Nice.
- Oh, wait! That's Kevin.

167
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,728
- On the drums.
- What ?

168
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:06,722
- On the drums! On the drums!
- Oh, my God! That's Kevin.

169
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,986
Great song, Kev.

170
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,408
Oh, my God.
He's the drummer and the singer.

171
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,464
We really don't do
a lot of weddings.

172
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:19,762
We actually don't play
in public very often.

173
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:23,540
We're all really hoping that
Pam's wedding works out.

174
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,089
This could be a turning point
for the band.

175
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:32,567
- Oh my...
- You haven't seen that since 1983.

176
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:35,359
That is amazing.

177
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,233
Okay, we have to sign him.
I'm gonna call the label...

178
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:39,570
No, no, no! Come back.

179
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,893
You're gonna lose him
to another wedding. Kev!

180
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,652
Jim is great.

181
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:46,878
Being with him just takes away
all the stress of planning my wedding.

182
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:51,913
Michael, Carol Stills for you.

183
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,564
- Who ?
- <i>Carol Stills.</i>

184
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:57,309
- Do I know a Carol Stills ?
- <i>Your realtor.</i>

185
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:59,366
Oh, yeah. Put her through.

186
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:03,308
Hey, Carol, how goes the real
estate biz ? Is it real good ?

187
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:05,208
Still me.

188
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,422
Sometimes I don't put Michael through
until he's already said something.

189
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:11,267
I look at it as a practice run
for him.

190
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,930
He usually does better
on the second attempt.

191
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,123
Carol, you're on with Michael.

192
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,634
- <i>Hello, Michael.</i>
- Hi, Carol. How you doing ?

193
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:22,306
<i>I'm great, I just needed one last
signature for your mortgage insurance.</i>

194
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:25,896
Oh, hey. No problemo.
Incidentally, I love the place.

195
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,010
<i>Oh, great.</i>

196
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:29,368
Great, had a little bit
of a weird smell. It's okay.

197
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:30,811
At Christmas, the tree helped.

198
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:34,576
<i>Oh, good. I'm glad.
Can I drop it over later ?</i>

199
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,910
Actually, I'm sort of hosting

200
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:40,371
this charity thing in our warehouse.
Casino night.

201
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:42,729
- <i>Oh, great.</i>
- Yeah. It'll be good.

202
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:45,638
You know what ?
Why don't you come by ?

203
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,198
Bring the papers. I'll sign 'em.

204
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,227
And then you can stay
and have a drink...

205
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,749
- <i>To the casino thing ?</i>
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

206
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,822
- What do you...
- <i>Um, what ?</i>

207
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:56,016
Oh, I'm sorry. Can you hold on ?

208
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,338
<i>Michael. Jan's on line two.</i>

209
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:00,004
Okay, put her through.

210
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,769
Jan Levinson, I presume ?

211
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,399
It's still me.

212
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,792
Jan, here's Michael.

213
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,962
- <i>Michael ?</i>
- Hey, Jan. How you doing ?

214
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,589
<i>You know, I...</i>

215
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,038
<i>I thought about it,
and you are right.</i>

216
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:18,548
- I am ?
- <i>I could use a little fun.</i>

217
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:21,527
<i>So I am going to drive up
for your Casino Night.</i>

218
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:25,955
<i>Incidentally, what is the charity ?</i>

219
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,293
AIDS.

220
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:31,246
<i>Okay then. I will...
I'll see you tonight.</i>

221
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:33,204
Okay, sounds great.

222
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:34,869
- <i>Bye-bye.</i>
- Bye.

223
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:39,749
Hello, Carol ?
Sorry about that. I just...

224
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:40,969
<i>No, problemo.</i>

225
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:42,757
Right.

226
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:45,561
- I...
- <i>To answer your question...</i>

227
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:48,786
- What ?
- <i>I'd love to go.</i>

228
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:52,540
<i>I have to get a sitter,
but that shouldn't be a problem.</i>

229
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:53,613
Problem, good.

230
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,182
-<i>And I'll bring the papers too.</i>
- Good. All right.

231
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:59,453
- Sounds great.
- <i>Well, I'll see you tonight.</i>

232
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,095
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

233
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:07,734
Two queens on Casino Night.

234
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:12,329
I am going to drop
a deuce on everybody.

235
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:22,400
Oh, my God!

236
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,279
<i>That's great.</i>

237
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,376
- Hey, Carol.
- Hi!

238
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:30,971
- You look great.
- Thanks.

239
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:33,294
Thank you for inviting me.
It looks so great in here.

240
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:34,479
Well. Just...

241
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:41,772
That's how we do it in the paper biz.
It's European.

242
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,121
- Michael.
- And... yes ?

243
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:44,435
Ah, Dwight!

244
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:52,268
Codename ReMax is here.
No sign of Lan Jevinson.

245
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:55,282
I'm Michael's wingman.
I've got his back.

246
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:58,937
Two dates.
He's got two dates tonight.

247
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:01,847
My job is to keep Jan
away from Carol.

248
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:04,146
And vice versa. Michael said,

249
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,547
"We must deceive them,
so as not to hurt them,"

250
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:10,773
"and in that way, we honor them."

251
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:16,708
Can I get you a drink ?
The food is from Hooters.

252
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,248
- A drink would be good.
- Okay.

253
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,468
<i>Oh, I steal things all the time.</i>

254
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,922
It's just something I do.

255
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:28,080
I stopped caring a long time ago.

256
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:31,693
You should see how many supplies
I've taken from this place.

257
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,614
Honestly... I love stealing things.

258
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,629
<i>I'm going to get a drink.
Do you need anything ?</i>

259
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:39,107
I'm fine. Thanks, sweetheart.

260
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:45,335
Billy, your nurse is hot.

261
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:46,931
That's my girlfriend.

262
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,971
Your nurse became
your girlfriend ? Sweet.

263
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:52,047
She was never my nurse.
I met her at Chili's.

264
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,490
She was my waitress.

265
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:56,645
Chili's is great.

266
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:10,197
Willkommen. Bienvenue.
And welcome to Monte Carlo.

267
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:12,786
Dwight!

268
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:16,117
I am no longer your boss.

269
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:18,698
Lady Fortune is your boss.

270
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:21,768
- Will Lady Fortune give me a raise ?
-Shut it, shut it, shut it.

271
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:24,079
Will Lady Fortune be your mistress ?

272
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:28,126
Only time will tell my friends.

273
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:33,375
Leave all your preconceived
notions about casinos at the door.

274
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:37,047
Old friends. New lovers.

275
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:41,481
And the disabled. Welcome all!

276
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:45,243
Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal.

277
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,487
Let's get it started.
Black-eyed crows.

278
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,373
Okay, the game is no-limit
Texas Hold 'Em.

279
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:53,215
Good luck, everybody.

280
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,719
That's at least four red chips
to you, sir.

281
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:06,197
All in.

282
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:09,034
<i>Bluffing is a key part of poker.</i>

283
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,919
Which is too bad because
I am not very good at bluffing.

284
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,262
Did you believe me ?

285
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:18,265
I'll call.

286
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:20,856
What are...

287
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,976
- That's insane.
- I have good cards.

288
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:27,038
Well, Toby, I went all in
on the first hand.

289
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,607
So doesn't that tell you that
I might have good cards too ?

290
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:31,886
So, don't be stupid.
Just take it back.

291
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,763
I'm sorry. He can't, sir.
He's gone all in.

292
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,652
All right, whatever.
Flip 'em.

293
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:42,877
You really scr...
you really screwed that up.

294
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,353
Way to go Toby.

295
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,567
I don't really play cards...
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

296
00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:51,100
It felt really good to take
money from Michael.

297
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:54,351
Gonna chase that feeling.

298
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:56,662
That's the normal question.

299
00:16:58,105 --> 00:16:59,641
I expect to do very well tonight.

300
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,421
I have an acute ability
to read people.

301
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,791
Jim, for instance, has a huge tell.

302
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:07,750
When he gets a good hand,
he coughs.

303
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,299
I will raise.

304
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:20,772
Thanks.

305
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:24,971
It's the weirdest thing.
Every time I cough, he folds.

306
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:29,289
- Wow, bad luck.
- Ah, yeah, whatever.

307
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,553
Hey, you know what ?
If luck weren't involved,

308
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,322
I would always be winning.

309
00:17:34,943 --> 00:17:36,743
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

310
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,722
- Michael ?
- Jan.

311
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:41,447
- Hi.
- Look, okay.

312
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,370
I think we're all adults here.

313
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:45,880
And it has always been
my understanding

314
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:47,781
that we have an open relationship.

315
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:50,405
What are... wait.
What are you talking about ?

316
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:52,411
What does that mean ?

317
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:56,400
After you said you weren't coming,
I invited Carol to come.

318
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:58,985
And I don't think that
I did anything wrong.

319
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,058
No, no you didn't.

320
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,674
- Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
- Hi.

321
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:08,087
- Does anyone want a drink ?
- No, I'm good.

322
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:20,144
- What ?
- Jan's here.

323
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:26,262
- Give me the dice.
- Come on, Dwight.

324
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,011
- Let's go.
- It's on you, baby.

325
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,836
Good evening, Dwight.
What is this ?

326
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,124
Evening, Angela. This is craps.

327
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:35,514
I need to roll an eight.
If I do, everyone wins.

328
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:37,567
Then roll an eight.

329
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:40,018
- Thank you Angela.
- Good luck, Dwight.

330
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:47,369
<i>That's good stuff.</i>

331
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:50,525
<i>Dwight, let's keep it going.
Let's keep it going.</i>

332
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,090
- <i>Let it ride. Let it all ride.</i>
- Gimme the dice.

333
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,313
- Yeah, right.
- "Yeah, right," what ?

334
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,803
What was this ?

335
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,392
- I have good cards.
- Really ?

336
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,914
And I'm going to take you all in.

337
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:16,587
I think you're bluffing.

338
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:29,050
Yeah, I think she's full of it.

339
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:33,692
Sorry. Straight.

340
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:36,672
Three nines.

341
00:19:37,563 --> 00:19:39,850
Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.

342
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:42,049
Thank you very much. It was fun.

343
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,721
Cosmopolitan, please.

344
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,266
Can I get a red wine ?

345
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:52,247
So two hours. That's a long drive.

346
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:56,810
Well, it's part of the job. You know,
keep an eye on things. So...

347
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,449
why not ?

348
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,320
So, how long have you
and Michael been, um...

349
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:13,657
Well, actually, I guess this would be
our first date, I guess.

350
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:17,266
Casino night in the warehouse.

351
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:18,603
Good sport.

352
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:20,234
Well, I'm having a nice time.

353
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:22,993
Oh, me too. Me too.

354
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:34,077
One beer, and one 7 and 7
with eight maraschino cherries,

355
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,260
sugar on the rim,
blended if you can.

356
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,201
So, that's still going on ?
You and Kelly ?

357
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:44,765
- <i>All right!</i>
- Point is four!

358
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,149
Shooter roll a four.

359
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,771
- Come on shooter! Come on shooter!
- Blow! Blow for luck.

360
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,590
Also you. Not playing favorites.

361
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,361
All right, here we go.

362
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:02,183
- Five.
- So close, so close.

363
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:03,574
Come on.

364
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:05,272
So, where are you staying, Radisson ?

365
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:06,726
- What ?
- Super 8 ?

366
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,806
- No, I...
- Motel 6 ?

367
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:09,764
- Best Western ?
- I..., I didn't, I don't...

368
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:12,616
Holiday Inn ?
The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre ?

369
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:15,068
- Are you staying with Michael ?
- All right!

370
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,494
I won the 2002, $2,500...

371
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,015
No-Limit Deuce
to Seven Draw Tournament

372
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:27,151
at the World Series
of Poker in Vegas.

373
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:31,468
So, yeah. I'm pretty good at poker.

374
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:36,251
All in.

375
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,612
Okay, let's do it.

376
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,726
Good luck, honey.

377
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:41,612
Oh, thank you Bobby, but it doesn't
matter. It's just fun to play.

378
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:44,992
- Three queens.
- Nice. Very nice.

379
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:46,962
- I have an Ace.
- No, that's a flush.

380
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:48,264
Oh man!

381
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:50,610
- I have a flush!
- Yes!

382
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:53,027
Look, I won.
Look, I have all the clovers.

383
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:54,730
You want to play again ?

384
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:55,939
I suck.

385
00:21:58,496 --> 00:21:59,938
She took you down, huh ?

386
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:02,578
I do not want to talk about it.

387
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,461
Hey, I saw your tape.

388
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:08,768
Your band, Scrantonicity.
You guys rock.

389
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:11,911
Yeah, you guys want
to play our wedding ?

390
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,110
Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay ?

391
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:18,948
Whatever.
I'm in charge of the music.

392
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:21,752
Dude, you will not be sorry.

393
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:25,115
Sweet. All right.

394
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:36,017
Smoke ?

395
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,613
No, thanks.

396
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,979
You, having fun ?

397
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,783
Fabulous time.

398
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,522
I drove two and a half hours
to get here.

399
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:54,073
- Yeah, we all really...
- Left work early, drove down here.

400
00:22:54,343 --> 00:22:57,203
And I am completely underdressed.

401
00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:59,842
I think you look great.

402
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:03,877
Why did I hook up with Michael ?

403
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:08,266
Yeah, why did you ?

404
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:12,113
It was very late, Jim. Very...

405
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,081
very late and...

406
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:17,905
Have you given any more
thought to the transfer ?

407
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,944
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

408
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,295
Have you told anyone ?

409
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,004
- No.
- Well, you should.

410
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:40,138
Excuse me. Big moment.

411
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:43,904
The, evening's chip leader
and winner

412
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:48,948
of this beautiful mini refrigerator
courtesy of Vance Refrigeration.

413
00:23:49,883 --> 00:23:51,912
Creed Bratton, Dunder-Mifflin.

414
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:58,939
Thanks, I never owned a refrigerator.

415
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,709
Sorry babe, I am just beat.

416
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:08,856
It's okay. I'll see you at home.

417
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:11,580
Okay. Hey, don't try to lose
too much money, all right ?

418
00:24:11,674 --> 00:24:14,466
- Okay.
- In case you still want a honeymoon.

419
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:18,395
Hey, Halpert!
Keep an eye on her, all right ?

420
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,178
Okay, will do.

421
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:22,157
- Bye.
- See you.

422
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,005
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it going ?

423
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:29,195
Good. Especially after I took
all your money in poker.

424
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:35,847
Can I talk to you about something ?

425
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,982
About when you wanna give me
more of your money ?

426
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,138
Did you wanna do that now ?
We can go inside.

427
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:42,460
I'm feeling kinda good tonight.

428
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:43,973
I was just, um...

429
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:49,837
I'm in love with you.

430
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,004
What ?

431
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:57,098
I'm really sorry if that's weird
for you to hear. But you needed to...

432
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:59,068
hear it.

433
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:03,574
Probably not good timing.
I know that, I just...

434
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,369
What are you doing ?

435
00:25:08,712 --> 00:25:10,460
What do you expect me
to say to that ?

436
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:14,917
I just needed you to know.

437
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,175
Once.

438
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:22,899
Well, I... I...

439
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:28,288
I can't ?

440
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:34,615
- You have no idea...
- Don't do that.

441
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:37,688
- what your friendship means to me.
- Come on.

442
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:41,219
I don't wanna do that.
I wanna be more than that.

443
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:43,952
I can't.

444
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:51,870
I'm really sorry
if you misinterpreted things.

445
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:56,689
It's probably my fault.

446
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:00,431
Not your fault.

447
00:26:01,381 --> 00:26:04,513
I'm sorry if I misinterpreted
that... our friendship.

448
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:16,402
- I'm leaving.
- Hey! Okay.

449
00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:18,971
So, I just wanted to congratulate
you on a fantastic evening.

450
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:20,613
- Did the company proud.
- Thank you.

451
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:23,006
And thanks for inviting me.
You were right, I needed it.

452
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,684
- So thanks.
- Okay. Thanks for coming.

453
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,548
Nice to meet you.
And you guys have a,

454
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:29,164
- have a good time together.
- Okay, talk to you Monday.

455
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,501
- Buh-bye.
- Goodnight.

456
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,985
- She's a good boss.
- She seems really nice.

457
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:36,463
Oh, she's great.

458
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:40,909
Love triangle drama.
All worked out in the end though.

459
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,692
The hero got the girl.

460
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:44,369
Who saw that coming ?

461
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:46,973
I did. And Jan is really
happy for me.

462
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:50,668
So actually the hero got two girls.
He got the girl that he works with,

463
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:53,589
and he got the girl
that he buys real estate from.

464
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:59,525
So, I've got my New York girl
