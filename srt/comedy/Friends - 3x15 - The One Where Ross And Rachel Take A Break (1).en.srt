1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,060
How much you give me to eat
this whole jar of olives?

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,540
I won't give you anything,
but you'll owe me $2.95.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,250
Done.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,260
I need an atlas!
I need an atlas!

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,420
Why? Do you have a report due?

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,700
I have a date
with diplomat I met. . .

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,260
. . .while I was giving free massages
outside the U.N.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,250
And I don't know where his country is.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,860
Let's start with
the free massages at the U.N.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,700
It's my new thing. I figure,
"Bodies at peace make peace. "

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,460
You might just get
the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,620
So what country is this guy from?

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,220
There's a "g" in there.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,660
Where's that?

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,260
In your atlas!

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,260
I don't have an atlas.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,100
But wait, I do have a globe.
Hold on.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,620
So what's this guy like?

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,500
Well, he's very. . .

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,060
. . .dashing, you know?

21
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,900
And very, very sophisticated.

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,700
And he doesn't speak English. . .

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,100
. . .but his translator says
he totally gets me.

24
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,860
Okay, here you go.

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,660
What is this?

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,660
It's a globe.

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,260
And a pencil sharpener.

28
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,980
Need anything copied?
I'm going to the Xerox place.

29
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,060
No, thanks.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,370
Just give me anything
I can make two of.

31
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,090
If you have nothing to copy,
why go there?

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,220
Are you just gonna gawk
at that girl. . .

33
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,490
. . .with the bellybutton ring again?

34
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,020
You wanna come?

35
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,930
The One Where
Ross and Rachel Take a Break

36
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,210
Czech Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,220
Come on, Chloe. Finish with
your customer first.

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,140
Come on, Chloe.
Come on, Chloe!

39
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,450
Can I help you?

40
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,700
We're having second thoughts
about our copying needs.

41
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,460
And we'll need more time
to think about it.

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,780
Chloe, switch with me. Some guys
have a crush on you.

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,060
Okay, that hurt us.

44
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,460
Hi, guys. I haven't seen you
since this morning.

45
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,340
Well. . .

46
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,050
. . .you know.

47
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,220
What are you doing tomorrow?

48
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,340
Both of us?

49
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,100
Maybe. Does that scare you?

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,500
Relax. Isaac's deejaying
at The Philly.

51
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,650
-You should come.
-We'll be there.

52
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,060
Great. I'll see you then.

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,860
All right! Rock on.

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,260
He says that walking with you makes
this strange city feel like home.

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,900
Me too. Although this city
is my home.

56
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,260
So that's dumb, what I said.
Don't tell him I said that.

57
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,660
You make something up.

58
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,460
Nice! Thank you.

59
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,460
This is me, here.

60
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,300
Your eyes are very pretty.

61
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,650
Thank you very much.

62
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,700
Oh, thank you.

63
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,540
He would like to kiss you.

64
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,450
You don't have to do that now.

65
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,740
No, no, not him!
No, you don't.

66
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,260
The moment's over.

67
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,460
There it is, right there.

68
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,100
It's small.

69
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,660
Yeah, but Sergei said
it took the Germans six weeks. . .

70
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,060
. . .to get all the way across it.

71
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,780
So you had fun?

72
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,060
Except for, you know,
when you're on a date. . .

73
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,020
. . .and you're getting along great. . .

74
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,860
. . .but the guy's translator
keeps getting in the way?

75
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,100
Is Rach in her room?

76
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,650
She's still at work,
but she said to call her.

77
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,900
Is she gonna cancel on me again?
How could she do this?

78
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,660
What about our anniversary?

79
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,450
This is the extent of my knowledge
on the subject.

80
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,730
"Call Rachel. "

81
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,130
What's that on the bottom?

82
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,050
That's my doodle of
a ladybug with a top hat.

83
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,260
She's fancy.

84
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,540
-Hey, honey.
-Oh, hi.

85
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,940
What's going on?

86
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Shipping had a disaster.
I've gotta get this order in.

87
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,620
I'm so sorry, but it looks like
I'll be here all night.

88
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,450
What? Well, how about
I come up there?

89
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,330
No, honey, please.
I just have too much to deal with.

90
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,770
Anyway, I'm going out
with Sergei again tonight, and. . . .

91
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,660
Could you be the translator's date. . .

92
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,660
. . .so that when we want to be alone. . .

93
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,860
. . .you two can split off?

94
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,900
You know, he's kind of cute.

95
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,780
Like, "really kind of cute"?

96
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,060
Or "kind of cute" Iike your friend
Spackle-Back Larry?

97
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,860
Don't call him that.

98
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,460
His name is Spackle-Back Harry.

99
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,980
Maybe we should get going.

100
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,900
What time did Chloe say
to get there?

101
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,180
-1 0:30.
-What time is it now?

102
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,050
4:30.

103
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,100
So we'll hang out.

104
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Remember when she brought up
that thing about the three of us?

105
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,700
Yes, vividly.

106
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,660
-She was kidding about that, right?
-Yeah, I think so.

107
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,100
Yeah, I think so.

108
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,660
God, it'd be weird if that situation
presented itself tonight.

109
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,460
Yeah, I mean. . .

110
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,060
. . .what would we do?

111
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,260
Dude, I don't know.

112
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,780
She was kidding.

113
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,250
She was. . . .

114
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,500
Just in case, we should have
some ground rules.

115
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,100
Yeah. For sure.

116
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,340
You probably want the first one to be,
"Never open your eyes. "

117
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,050
Because you don't
want to be doing something. . .

118
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,980
. . .and then look up, right?

119
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,370
And see something that
you don't want to be seeing.

120
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,050
Good call. Nice.

121
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,060
Hold it! Hold it!

122
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,060
What if my eyes are closed, and. . .

123
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,130
. . .and my hand is out there. . . .

124
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,970
Okay, eyes open at all times!

125
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,860
How do we decide where we. . .

126
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,970
. . .you know, each would. . .

127
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,260
. . .you know. . .

128
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,100
. . .be?

129
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,450
Right. Well, you know,
we could flip for it.

130
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,580
I guess. But like,
what's heads and what's tails?

131
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,260
If you don't know that,
I don't want to do this with you.

132
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,490
No, no. I am looking
at a purchase order here. . .

133
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,100
. . .that shows we
ordered the Riviera bikini. . .

134
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,340
. . .in a variety of sizes and colors--

135
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,050
What does it matter what I'm wearing?

136
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,700
Could I speak to your supervisor?
Thank you.

137
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,090
Hi.

138
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,700
My God!
What are you doing here?

139
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,580
Well, you said
you couldn't go out, so. . . .

140
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,900
You brought a picnic!
What a boyfriend.

141
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,060
That's it. On Monday, I start
wearing makeup.

142
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,900
Honey, this is very nice,
but I've got a crisis.

143
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
But I've got couscous!

144
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,330
Honey,
I know it's our anniversary. . .

145
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,850
. . .but I told you on the phone,
I don't have time to stop.

146
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,410
You don't have to stop.
I'm invisible. I'm not here.

147
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,180
Yeah, but I don't--

148
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,690
Who approved that order?

149
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Well, there is no Mark Robinson
in this office.

150
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,260
-Get Mark on the phone!
-I love Mark. Do you know him?

151
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,130
Let me check that
with what I've got.

152
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,700
See, 038 is not the number
for this store. 038 is Atlanta.

153
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,740
Pepper?

154
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,780
None for me.

155
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,090
Okay, sorry!

156
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,460
Sorry. As I was saying,
the store number is wrong.

157
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,860
And I'm sorry, but--

158
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,180
Oh, my God!

159
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,020
I have to call you back.
I've got Shemp in my office.

160
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,100
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

161
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,660
But somebody's off the phone!
How about a glass of wine. . .

162
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,660
. . .by the fire?
I can get it going again. . . .

163
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,180
You're not listening.
I don't have time to stop.

164
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,140
-You don't have 1 0 minutes?
-I don't have 1 0 minutes!

165
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,850
-Sophie, does she have 1 0 minutes?
-I told you, I don't!

166
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,300
Don't yell. This is
the most I've seen you all week.

167
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,500
Look, I cannot do this right now.
I've got a deadline!

168
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,500
Go home and we'll talk later.

169
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,500
-Yeah, but wait--!
-Goodbye!

170
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,220
Actually, that's our three-hole punch.

171
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,900
Hi.

172
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,700
Look, about what happened earlier--

173
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,330
I completely understand.
You were stressed.

174
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,580
I was gonna give you a chance
to apologize to me.

175
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,660
For letting you throw me
out of your office?

176
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,780
You had no right
coming down to my office.

177
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,460
You do not bring a picnic basket
to somebody's work. . .

178
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,620
. . .unless they're a park ranger!

179
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,450
Excuse me for wanting to be with
my girl on our anniversary.

180
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,060
Boy, what an ass am l!

181
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,060
But I told you
I didn't have the time!

182
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,980
Well, you never have the time.

183
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,490
I don't feel like I have
a girlfriend anymore.

184
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,460
Do you want me to quit my job. . .

185
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,090
. . .so you can feel like
you have a girlfriend?

186
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,810
It would nice if you'd realize
that it's just a job.

187
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,900
Just a job?

188
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,100
It's the first time in my life
I'm doing something I care about!

189
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,380
The first time
I'm doing something I'm good at!

190
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,980
If you don't get that--

191
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,330
I get that, and I'm happy for you.

192
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,580
But I'm tired of dating your answering
machine! I don't know what to do!

193
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,420
Well, neither do l!

194
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,460
Is this about Mark?

195
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,060
Oh, my God!

196
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,100
Okay, it's not.

197
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,580
Oh, my God!

198
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,900
I cannot keep having this same fight
over and over again.

199
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,660
You're making this too hard.

200
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,940
I'm making this too hard?
What should I do?

201
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,290
I don't know!
I don't know! Look. . .

202
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,660
. . .maybe we should just take a break!

203
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,300
Fine, you're right.
Let's take a break. Let's cool off.

204
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,260
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

205
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,860
A break from us.

206
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,660
--advances in collating
in the past five years.

207
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,250
We just got in an X-5000, you know?

208
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,220
The X-5000 makes an X-50
look like a T-71 .

209
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,460
It's the dinosaur guy!

210
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,300
-Hi, Ross!
-Hi, Chloe.

211
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,060
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

212
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,650
He's my hero. He'll want
to blow stuff up 400 percent.

213
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,060
We say we don't do that. He says,
"You gotta. " Know what? We did it.

214
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,980
Now anytime anybody wants 400,
we just say, "Let's Ross it! "

215
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,820
And that's the only color
that comes in.

216
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,300
Yo, Chloe! Do you have a quarter
for the condom machine?

217
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,130
What are you doing? I thought
tonight's your anniversary dinner.

218
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,060
A little change of plans.

219
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,250
We're gonna break up instead.

220
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,060
And I can speak a little French.

221
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,300
Why? What did I say?

222
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,980
Well, you just asked if I wanted
to go to bed with you tonight.

223
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,260
Oh, my God!

224
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,700
Knock, knock, knock.

225
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,260
Hi. Could you please tell Sergei
that I was fascinated. . .

226
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,540
. . .by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali said
in the Times?

227
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,580
You didn't say
"Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "

228
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,810
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

229
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,180
He says he was too.

230
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,530
Interesting.

231
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,500
So I was wondering--

232
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,850
Before you get all talky again. . .

233
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,010
. . .could you also please
tell Sergei. . .

234
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,650
. . .that I really like his suit.

235
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,740
He said, "Thank you.
You look pretty tonight.

236
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,900
Your hair, golden like the sun. "
So you're a chef?

237
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,850
I'm also thinking of opening up
my own restaurant.

238
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,060
Really?

239
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,300
Could I talk to you
behind my menu?

240
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,980
What are you doing?

241
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,420
Well, I was having a conversation.

242
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,060
Misha's so interested in you, Sergei
and I haven't been able to talk at all.

243
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,660
You want me to sit silently,
while you three converse?

244
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,460
That would be great.
Thank you.

245
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,460
Hi. It's Mark.

246
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,250
What? ls it my breath?

247
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,500
Sorry. I just thought
you were somebody else.

248
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,220
I was just gonna leave a message.
Isn't tonight your anniversary dinner?

249
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,900
Rach? Are you okay?

250
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,930
Yeah, I'm fine.

251
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,690
You wanna talk?
I can come over.

252
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,250
Really, no. Please.
That's okay.

253
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,700
All right. I'm coming over
with Chinese food.

254
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,300
I'm not hungry.

255
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,860
It's for me.

256
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,660
Bye.

257
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,380
-So what'll you do?
-What can I do?

258
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,850
One person wants to break up,
you break up.

259
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,290
No way. This is you guys.
Call her and work it out.

260
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,770
We just had this huge fight.
Don't I have to wait awhile?

261
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,060
It isn't like swimming after you eat.
Pick up the phone!

262
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,850
You know that
swimming thing is a myth.

263
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,860
Tell that to my Uncle Lenny.

264
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,060
Why? What happened to him?

265
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,460
Nothing. He just really
believes in that.

266
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,260
Then we got into this big fight--
It was awful.

267
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,330
I told him he treats me like
a park ranger, something. . . .

268
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,010
And then. . .

269
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,450
. . .I told him
I wanted to take a break.

270
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,060
I don't want to take a break.

271
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,860
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,050
Egg roll?

273
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,620
And then I called him and
he wasn't there.

274
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,340
He's probably just out.

275
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,460
Thank you, that's very helpful.
I'm glad you came over.

276
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,300
Hi, it's me.

277
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,890
Oh, I'm so glad you called.

278
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,970
Really?

279
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,420
This is crazy. Don't you think
we can work on this?

280
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,980
What do you want to drink?

281
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,220
Who's that?

282
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,860
Nobody?

283
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,300
Is it okay if I finish
the apple juice?

284
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,930
Is that Mark?

285
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,740
Honey, he just came over--

286
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,300
Yeah, got it!

287
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,100
Hey, Dinosaur Guy!
Look at you, so sad.

288
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,140
Come dance.

289
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,860
That's okay. Thanks.

290
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,580
You don't have to smile.
You just have to dance.

291
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,300
I don't feel like dancing.
I feel like having a drink, okay?

292
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,260
Two beers!

293
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,090
And the vet said it was time.

294
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,250
And so from half a world away. . .

295
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,060
. . .while my mother
held the phone to his ear. . .

296
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,260
. . .I said goodbye to my dog. . .

297
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,500
. . .in seven languages.

298
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,450
-Could I have a tissue?
-Oh, sure.

299
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,810
I just hope you don't accidentally. . .

300
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,460
. . .suck it up through your nose
and choke on it.

301
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,780
Sergei would like to apologize
for my behavior tonight.

302
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,340
Well, tell him, "Apology accepted. "

303
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,260
Unbelievable. For the first time in
years, someone wants to talk to me.

304
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,660
But do you think he would
let me enjoy that? No!

305
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,850
You silly diplomat.
Why don't you learn some English?

306
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,300
Excuse me, but isn't he paying
for your dinner?

307
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,380
The man's dog just died.

308
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,700
I have just resigned my post.

309
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,210
Will you accompany me
to the Rainbow Room?

310
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,100
I have diplomatic coupons.

311
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,650
It would be my pleasure.

312
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,410
My guy has coupons.

313
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,660
Your guy can't even say "coupons. "

314
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,540
Plate.

315
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,700
Plate! Yes! Plate!

316
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,260
See, we don't need them.

317
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,860
I like this song.

318
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,450
Well, you're practically
dancing, already.

319
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,850
Why don't you just do it over here?

320
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,100
What are you, married?

321
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,460
Because that's okay.

322
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,860
Oh, be home, be home, be home. . . .

323
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,460
You're not home.

324
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,210
Still no smile?

325
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,650
--Miss American Pie

326
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,530
Ameri-can.

327
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,500
It's a very hard language.

328
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,540
Let's do it again.
