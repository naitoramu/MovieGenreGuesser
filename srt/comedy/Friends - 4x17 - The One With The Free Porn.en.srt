1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,802
Oh, man!

2
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,974
- What's that?
- Treeger's snaking the shower drain.

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:19,729
What in the name of hell?

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,774
Maybe he found your flip-flop.

5
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,530
Is this porn?

6
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,074
I must have hit something
on the remote.

7
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,868
Do we pay for this?

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,412
We didn't even pay our cable bill.

9
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,332
Maybe this is how they punish us.

10
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,877
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.
Free phone sex.

11
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:48,923
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.

12
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,553
Hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.

13
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:59,101
Joey pressed something on the remote
and it just came on.

14
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:03,272
It happened to me once.
It was like finding money.

15
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,817
Finding money
with naked people on it!

16
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,611
But I made the mistake
of turning off the TV.

17
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:12,198
I never got it back again.

18
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,033
And I'm sad.

19
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,999
Why would he turn off the TV?

20
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,461
The One with the Free Porn

21
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:19,097
Do we really have to watch this
while we eat?

22
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:23,226
We don't know
what could make this go away.

23
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,439
So no one touches the remote,
and no one touches the TV.

24
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,319
And no one touches the air
around the TV.

25
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,283
Imagine a protective porn bubble,
if you will.

26
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:42,037
I'm at least going to mute it.

27
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,500
We still have porn.

28
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:55,467
What are you doing?
That's too heavy. Give it here.

29
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,386
Oh, God.

30
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:05,311
I'm too pregnant for lugging
around a stupid massage table.

31
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,980
I need a job with a smaller table.

32
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,107
Or a job without a table.

33
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,277
You mean, like a doctor?

34
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,947
You're blocking the porn!

35
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:24,788
That reminds me.
I have to see my ob-gyn today.

36
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,796
Emily just went to the airport.

37
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,548
Why didn't you take her?

38
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,591
Her uncle had planned to do it.

39
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:40,304
We said our goodbyes this morning.

40
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:46,143
You must feel horrible.
Hey, the guys have free porn.

41
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,858
Hey, cheer up.
You'll see her again, right?

42
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,776
I don't know.

43
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,196
When I brought it up, she said...

44
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,783
..."This is so fantastic.
Why talk about the future?"

45
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,870
- "Let's enjoy..."
- Don't do the accent.

46
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,289
You've got to see her again.

47
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,625
- Why do you care?
- Because!

48
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,087
You could live out my fantasy.

49
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,590
You had fantasies about Emily?

50
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,843
You know, the fantasy.

51
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:25,015
Meet a foreigner, fall madly in love
and spend your lives together.

52
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:30,645
Is that why you hung out
with that Ukrainian kid in school?

53
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:37,152
Yeah, plus his mom used to put
sour cream on everything.

54
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,279
Do you love her?

55
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,367
We said it would
only be two weeks.

56
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,785
You love her.

57
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,872
What is love, really?

58
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,874
I knew you loved her!

59
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,335
You go to the airport and tell her.

60
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,421
You'll probably catch her at the gate.

61
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,508
You'll call her name
and yell "I love you!"

62
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,010
She'll say "I love you too!"

63
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,389
Then you will have
the most amazing kiss.

64
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,725
Everyone at the gate will applaud.

65
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,104
I am a good kisser.

66
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:17,067
Then you two can sneak
into the cockpit.

67
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,569
Things will start to heat up.

68
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,949
And then a stewardess comes in...

69
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,619
I've been watching too much porn.

70
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,000
- Is that the heartbeat?
- That's it.

71
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,335
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,005
This is so cool!

73
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:42,593
Have we talked about multiple births?

74
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:48,307
Let's take care of this one. If I
get pregnant again, I have your card.

75
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:53,103
No, I'm getting
three separate heartbeats.

76
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,107
You guys were worried
I wouldn't even have one.

77
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,403
Doctors are wrong all the time.

78
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,323
Are you sure that there are three?

79
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:08,619
- Definitely.
- Oh, my God.

80
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:18,921
So in a few months, I'll have three
babies walking around inside me?

81
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:25,093
It'll be like one of those log rides
when they come shooting out.

82
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:28,806
Giving birth to three
is like giving birth to one.

83
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,725
What do you know?

84
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,238
How'd it go at the doctor's?

85
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:48,075
You know how, when you're
walking down the street...

86
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,994
...and you see three people in a row.

87
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:55,875
And you say "Oh, that's nice."

88
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,216
Good news!
You'll have three babies.

89
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,803
Three babies?

90
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,057
I've finally got my band!

91
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:17,562
We'll have a big family!
I always wanted a big family.

92
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:22,985
I'm so glad you're happy!
I was afraid you'd be freaked.

93
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,653
Why would we be freaked?

94
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:30,784
Because it's harder to raise them
and the added expense.

95
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,746
Right.

96
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:39,502
No, back to happy.
Back to happy!

97
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,672
It's going to be fine...

98
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,174
...because I teach home ec.

99
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:50,429
I can have 30 kids making
baby clothes all year long.

100
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:56,935
It'll be like my very own
little sweatshop.

101
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:02,941
I was thinking, ever since
you said we'd have triplets.

102
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:08,239
The best thing for me to do is
drop out of college and get a job.

103
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,074
No, you can't quit college.

104
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,161
You're in college?

105
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,206
Refrigerator college.

106
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,375
When we found out
we were having a baby...

107
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:25,005
...I figured I should have
a career, you know?

108
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,966
And I love refrigerators.

109
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,761
You can't give up on your dream!

110
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,806
No, it's okay.
We're going to have three kids.

111
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:38,143
And that's a different kind of dream.

112
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,730
Three kids and no money.

113
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,365
<i>This is the boarding call</i>
<i>for flight 009.</i>

114
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,868
What are you doing here?

115
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,830
I had to see you
before you took off.

116
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,710
You are so sweet.

117
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,506
That's a big candy bar.

118
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:12,178
I had the most amazing time with you.

119
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,054
Me too.

120
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:19,184
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>
<i>for flight 009.</i>

121
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,437
Well, that's me.

122
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,487
Here, have this.

123
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:35,158
I'm only allowed
one piece of carry-on.

124
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:42,750
Listen, I have to tell you something.

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,877
I've been thinking.

126
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,589
I'm just going to say it, okay?

127
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,966
I think...

128
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,344
...I love you.

129
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,065
Thank you.

130
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,450
It's no problem.

131
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,250
What is that song?

132
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:30,256
It's the theme
from "Good Will Humping".

133
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:35,719
You know who doesn't like
dirty movies? My boyfriend Joshua.

134
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,763
Yeah, right.

135
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:43,060
He said he prefers to leave
certain things to the imagination.

136
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,772
Did he also say that
the dialogue was corny?

137
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:50,943
And that he found it funny, not sexy?

138
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,031
Yeah, he likes porn.

139
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,325
Where you going?

140
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:03,371
To find out if he really
thinks models are too skinny.

141
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:05,999
How'd it go?

142
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,335
Frank has to quit college...

143
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,047
...because his super-fertile
sister's having three babies.

144
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:17,177
I need to make money fast.
I wanted to talk to you about an idea.

145
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,262
You work for a big company.

146
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,182
Insider trading.

147
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,852
What information can you give me?

148
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,521
They don't talk to us
about that stuff.

149
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:31,400
But I can get you free White-Out.

150
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,279
- Did you do what I said?
- I did.

151
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,489
What'd she say?

152
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,700
"Thank you."

153
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:45,247
You're totally welcome.
What'd she say?

154
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,666
She said, "Thank you."

155
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,252
I said, "I love you."

156
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:55,048
And she said, "Thank you."

157
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,843
Did you say you love her?

158
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:02,389
What were you trying
to get her to do?

159
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,849
What do I do?

160
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,852
You play hard-to-get.

161
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,689
She already lives in London.

162
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,443
So you go to Tokyo.

163
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,028
Forget it.

164
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,072
You told her you love her.
It's over.

165
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:23,494
It is not over!
You're over!

166
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,747
What?

167
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:30,584
You know.

168
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,340
Good one.

169
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,427
It's not over. She'll call
and tell you she loves you.

170
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,847
Her feelings were so strong
that it scared her.

171
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:48,643
Go home and wait for her call.
She could call from the plane.

172
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:53,148
But if she doesn't call,
it is definitely over!

173
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:58,236
Unless, eventually, I call her
to see what's going on...

174
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:02,533
...and she says she'll call me back,
but then she doesn't.

175
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,203
Then it's over!

176
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,331
Way to be strong!

177
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,427
Can we watch cartoons on your TV?

178
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,971
We need a porn break.

179
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:29,727
We spent two hours watching
<i>In and Out and In Again.</i>

180
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,021
Why don't you turn it off?

181
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:36,567
Then we'd be the guys
who turned off free porn.

182
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,862
Good, you're here!

183
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,363
What you got there?

184
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:46,034
This? I'm glad you asked.

185
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:54,167
Don't you hate to cut a tin can
with an ordinary steak knife?

186
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,005
I know what you're thinking.

187
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:01,592
Pregnant woman slays four?

188
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,053
Did they make you pay
for those knives?

189
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,681
You sure?

190
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:12,186
You won't make enough money
by selling knives.

191
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:16,523
I just need enough money
for the second part of my plan.

192
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:17,857
What's that?

193
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,486
My Saturn dealership.

194
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,545
How was your flight?

195
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,046
<i>It was dreadful.</i>

196
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:44,802
It was terrible how I acted
when you said those wonderful things.

197
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,889
No, that's all right.

198
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,058
I'm just glad you called.

199
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:56,438
<i>Ross, there's something</i>
<i>that I've got to tell you.</i>

200
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,651
There's someone else.

201
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:09,326
Does that mean the same thing
in England as it does in America?

202
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:14,373
She doesn't know who she wants.
Me or this "Colin" guy.

203
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:20,504
This isn't how it's supposed to go.
There can't be another guy.

204
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,757
Of course, there's another guy!

205
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:26,510
This is even more perfect.

206
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,470
You have to prove your love!

207
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,557
I'm not proving anything.
I'm done listening to you.

208
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,019
If I hadn't let you talk me
into this...

209
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,938
...I wouldn't have put my fist
through the wall.

210
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,731
You did that?

211
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:43,569
I missed and hit the door.

212
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:47,114
But it opened really hard.

213
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,410
You have to go to London.
You have to go fight for her.

214
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,203
That makes sense.

215
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,539
You said you loved her,
and she didn't say it back.

216
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:02,796
Then she told you about another guy.
Go to London. Scare her!

217
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,842
When Rachel was with Paolo,
what did you do?

218
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,136
I made fun of his accent.

219
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,514
You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight.

220
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:16,226
You want that to happen with Emily?

221
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,979
Go fight for her!
Go to London.

222
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,858
That could be you and Emily.

223
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:27,154
That but nicer.

224
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,489
Go to London!

225
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,950
Really?

226
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,038
Surprise her.
Don't let her go without a fight.

227
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,458
All right. I'm going to do it.

228
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,128
I'm going to London,
and I'll fight for her.

229
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,548
Okay. Good luck!

230
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:53,096
Can you pick me up one
of those Toblerone bars at the airport?

231
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:02,815
I did it!
I figured out a way to make money.

232
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,026
I'll open a massage place.
Frank will help me.

233
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:12,073
We'll work it around his schedule,
so he doesn't have to quit school.

234
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,368
But how can you afford it?

235
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:18,080
We were walking down the street,
and we saw your van.

236
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:22,209
- And we realized...
- I'm telling it!

237
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:26,922
People need transportation,
and they need massages to relax.

238
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,760
We can combine the two.
I give massages and Frank drives.

239
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,764
I'll bolt a table in the van,
and you know what I've got?

240
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:39,976
A place that no one
will get out of alive?

241
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:45,357
Think about it. It's a taxi that
people take when they need to relax.

242
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:49,069
It's a Relaxi-Taxi!

243
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,364
The name was my favorite part!

244
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,032
I came up with it.

245
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,911
You did not!

246
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:04,043
You came up with Relaxi-Cab.
That's not good.

247
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,258
Oh, my god! Are you in England?
Was Emily surprised?

248
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,468
No, she hasn't come home yet.

249
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:18,349
She hasn't been home all night.
She must be with the other guy.

250
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,061
I'm the stupid moron
who spent the night here.

251
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,396
When is the next flight out?

252
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,647
About four hours.

253
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:29,693
<i>Stay there for a while.</i>
<i>If she doesn't show up, come home.</i>

254
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,903
Tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.

255
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:36,033
Ask him if he likes it
better than Relaxi-Cab.

256
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:41,246
It's not Relaxi-Cab.
It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.

257
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,666
That is better.

258
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,592
Are we in London?

259
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,094
Why are you here?
You can't be here.

260
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,849
I've come to talk to Ross.

261
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,770
What?

262
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,274
Nothing.

263
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:09,775
I was going to call him...

264
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,986
You came to tell him you love him.
I knew it!

265
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:16,407
I was right!
I'm right, right?

266
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,577
I'd rather talk to him.

267
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,371
I've been to his apartment
and he's not there.

268
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:28,919
I need to talk to him.
Do you know where he is?

269
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,013
<i>Ross, are you there?</i>

270
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:46,520
<i>I don't know if you hear this,</i>
<i>but I'll talk anyway.</i>

271
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,898
I'm in the States
with your sister and friends.

272
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,902
It's all over with Colin.

273
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,780
<i>I came here to tell you that</i>
<i>and to tell you...</i>

274
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,118
<i>Yes, Joey, you can have</i>
<i>all the chocolate you want.</i>

275
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:09,292
I came here to tell you
that I love you.

276
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,711
I love you too!

277
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:14,506
I'll call you right now
from the phone booth.

278
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,093
You can't hear me.

279
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,679
I wish I knew if you'd heard me.

280
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:24,307
I suppose I've given
my neighbors a good laugh.

281
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:30,397
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,
bugger off. None of your business.

282
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,233
There's not much chance
you did hear that.

283
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,194
There's the call waiting...

284
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:40,074
...so I should go.

285
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,545
Ross, I love you.

286
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,925
Thank you.

287
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:10,563
There was this really hot teller
at the bank.

288
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:14,858
And she didn't ask me
to do it with her in the vault.

289
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,277
Same thing happened to me.

290
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:22,199
Pizza delivery girl comes over,
gives me the pizza and leaves!

291
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,702
No "Nice apartment,
bet the bedrooms are huge"?

292
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,747
Nothing!

293
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:32,250
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

294
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:36,088
I think you're right.

295
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,297
Ready?

296
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:41,385
One, two, three.

297
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,099
That's kind of nice.

298
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:50,686
That's kind of a relief.

299
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,986
You want to see
if we still have it?

300
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:04,325
- Free porn!
- We have free porn!
