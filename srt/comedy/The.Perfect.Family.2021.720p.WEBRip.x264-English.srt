1
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,708
Come on. Let's go, Pablo.

2
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,875
Come on, let's go, Pablo.

3
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,708
-You can do it, Pablo, you can.

4
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes.

5
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,458
Now, right now.

6
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,708
"Mom, you're not gonna believe it."

7
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,250
No, of course she won't believe it.
My God.

8
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,791
All right, Pablo, don't freak out.
This is nothing.

9
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,000
It's nothing.

10
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:28,000
"Mama, Mom, you know I'm a man."

11
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,000
"So I'm a man, and Sara, she's a woman."

12
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,250
"Sara's a woman."

13
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,541
"And you…"

14
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,958
"You'll wanna see me dead."

15
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,041
My goodness. No, no, fuck.

16
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,708
Man, now, Pablo, take it easy.

17
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:43,041
You're supposed to be an adult.
You are going to make it easy.

18
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,208
I look like an idiot.

19
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,875
Mama.

20
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,416
My day has gotten complicated.

21
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
No, I wanna meet up, I wanna hear.

22
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,416
Coffee tomorrow is perfect.

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,666
BEST DIRECTOR

24
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,000
Will you call her?

25
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay, great.

26
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:20,916
What?

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,875
Oh, Pablo's thing.

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,541
He wants to surprise us.

29
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,333
{\an8}That's right.

30
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,416
I don't know, darling,

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,666
but I have a feeling
he wants us to meet someone.

32
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,875
Hmm.

33
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,375
I don't know, maybe a lawyer
from his practice?

34
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,166
He's such a catch.

35
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,125
Yes.

36
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,166
Okay, I have to go.
I need to make another call.

37
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,833
Big kiss. I'll see you soon.

38
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,125
Trini!

39
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:02,000
Hi, good afternoon.
I'd like a car for Thursday.

40
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,166
All day.

41
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,125
For five women,
the wives of important scientists,

42
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,666
including a Nobel winner.

43
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,166
Oh, and a non-smoking driver.

44
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,416
Of course, I don't imagine
he'll be smoking inside the car,

45
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,041
{\an8}but if he's a smoker, you notice.

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,416
{\an8}Okay, yes, five women.

47
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,708
Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,750
Right, yes.

49
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,625
Uh… I like the red one.

50
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,875
No, not you, that's for my husband.

51
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,541
He's a scientist, yes.

52
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,291
Let's go with the first car
you mentioned, it's bigger.

53
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,833
Okay, I'll email you.

54
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,083
Thank you.

55
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,333
{\an8}Another check mark done.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,083
{\an8}Ernesto, come here.

57
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,375
Always so many tucks.

58
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,833
I'm a fan of the Windsor.

59
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:07,958
Right.

60
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,125
-Pablo.

61
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,416
{\an8}Come on, come on.

62
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,666
Come.

63
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,958
Pastry box.

64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,875
-Thanks, Trini.
-Thank you, Trini.

65
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,958
Don't smoke.

66
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,500
Darling.

67
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,791
Ah!

68
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,250
Oh, all that stubble, my dear.

69
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,875
Mama, Pa, um…

70
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,750
I said it was casual.

71
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,625
Yes, casual.

72
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,583
-All yours.

73
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,041
Honey, are you ever going
to tell us the surprise?

74
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,875
The surprise is that…

75
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,958
I'm taking you to Sara's.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,958
-Who?
-Sara.

77
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,333
You met her already,
a couple of weeks ago, remember?

78
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,000
You know your mother,

79
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,708
remembers everything
except your girlfriends.

80
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,375
I call it selective memory.

81
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,041
I call it a mother's love.

82
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,375
Are we still technically in Madrid?

83
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,583
Sure, of course we are, Mom.

84
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,958
There's nothing I recognize.

85
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,416
Would you press the safety lock?

86
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,666
Sing something.

87
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,875
Damn, check out that car.

88
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,708
I want a car like that.

89
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,083
Better lock it or we'll steal it.

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,625
I've never been this far south before.

91
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,416
Good thing I brought my vest along.

92
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,208
-Here it is.

93
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,916
Is that stuff still around?

94
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,083
Oh, my God, it's the Pink Panther.

95
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,166
She looks like a Barbie.

96
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,500
Mom, you're gonna love it.

97
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,916
Good afternoon.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And you'll like her family too.

99
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,291
Everyone is very nice.

100
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,458
Let me out.

101
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,375
He's become a member of the family.

102
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,583
Handsome fucker now.

103
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,250
And you can tell he likes you.

104
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:26,541
His name is Sandunguero…
for reggaeton, which we love.

105
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,666
Sorry for the mess, but I just got
off work and this is how they left it.

106
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,166
Holy shit, Mom.

107
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,875
What's up, Mikey?
Give us a hug, my man.

108
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,791
Hey, what's up, Mikey?

109
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,375
Miguel. Nice to meet you.

110
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,958
-Miguel, Miguel.
-Miguel.

111
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,833
Well…

112
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,750
excuse me.

113
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,750
Excuse me too.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,291
How come it took so long
to get the families together?

115
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,666
I've been looking forward
to meeting my mother-in-law.

116
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,375
Honey, help me with the coffee.

117
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,000
-She called me her mother.
-Settle down.

118
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,500
What the hell?
A warning would have helped.

119
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,208
You never said they were posh.

120
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,083
Okay, Mom, I'm sorry.
She's just a housewife.

121
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,208
A housewife?

122
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,666
Perhaps she cooks, but no way
she's ever scrubbed a toilet in her life.

123
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,791
They seem like they're
normal people, Mom.

124
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,916
So keep it together.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,958
Normal people?

126
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,875
Keep it together?

127
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,208
It must be the shit being an astrologer.

128
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,083
Maybe it is, but I'm an astronomer.

129
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,708
Oh, that's cool.

130
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,458
We have stuff in common, me and you.
Seriously. I'm a DJ in "Space."

131
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,500
Here, Toni DJ.
It's pretty dope. Here, listen.

132
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,750
-He's such a joker.

133
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,041
-This boy is a joker.
-Yes.

134
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,500
Not bad, yeah?

135
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,833
We get really into Christmas too.

136
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:00,958
Ah, yes.

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,291
Isn't it cool?

138
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,666
-Huh?

139
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,333
Beautiful.

140
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,708
Coming through. Coffee's ready.

141
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,083
-Okay, here we go.
-Thank you.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's everything.

143
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,208
-Amparo, I want to speak first.
-Yes.

144
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,416
He just loves making us listen.

145
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,125
For the two of us, it's a pleasure,

146
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,125
and now having the opportunity
to finally meet Pablo's parents.

147
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,208
Pablo is like a son here in this house.

148
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,208
You've raised an upright
and elegant young man.

149
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,458
Your son's a magnificent mahogany table.

150
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,833
Because of his woodwork.

151
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,250
Ah…

152
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,458
Okay, okay. Get on with it.

153
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,916
Okay.

154
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:50,666
Oh, I like to use a serrated knife.
Mashes it less.

155
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,500
No more mashed up than it gets
in your stomach though, huh?

156
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,083
I suppose not.

157
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,583
How did you meet each other?

158
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,625
-Uh, well…
-At work.

159
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,833
Ah, then you must be a lawyer.

160
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,166
No, no, no.

161
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,958
No, my specialty is health.

162
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,125
-Ah.
-You're a doctor?

163
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,166
No, I'm working at a gym.

164
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,125
And she sure makes me sweat, huh, Mom?

165
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,125
She'll be the boss soon.

166
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,250
Well, I am almost a partner there.

167
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,041
That's my girl.

168
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,291
Yes, anything she aims for, she gets.

169
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,583
-Just like her mother.
-Yeah.

170
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,375
He only says that because
I was the first woman bus driver

171
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,208
who could handle 80 passengers
on the 45-foot bus.

172
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,000
Incredible the way she drives.

173
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,916
-You idiot.

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,375
-Enough of that. Please help yourselves.
-Yes, go on. Make yourselves at home.

175
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,500
-Mm-mm.
-Excuse me?

176
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,125
Do you think it's possible
there are aliens among us?

177
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:51,041
Uh, at this moment, it's a firm yes, yep.

178
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,875
Okay, he believes.

179
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,708
-Goofball.

180
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,916
Well…

181
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,166
-Yes.
-I think it's time.

182
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,833
So, everyone…

183
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,208
Well, then, Sara and I
brought you here today because

184
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,458
there's something to announce.

185
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,416
Oh, I'm gonna be a grandma?
Am I gonna be a grandma--

186
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,625
No, my God, Mom!

187
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,041
-No, no, no, no, no!
-Okay.

188
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,416
Sara and I…

189
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,083
-And Pablo and I…

190
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,708
…we're…

191
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,125
…we're gonna get married!

192
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,500
-Getting married, yes!
-I knew it.

193
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,833
-I knew it!
-Old Sara's getting married!

194
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,708
-Are you gonna cry?
-Can I hug the groom?

195
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,791
Mom, can I, please?

196
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,916
This is amazing!

197
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,708
Air!

198
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes.

199
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,583
Mama, are you excited?

200
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,750
What?

201
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,958
Yes, I'm excited if you're excited.

202
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,000
That's great.

203
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,500
Okay, then, I guess, see you soon.

204
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,375
Hey.

205
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,958
-Bye.
-See you, bitches.

206
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,458
What? What's your problem?

207
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,708
Nothing, no.

208
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,166
-Good afternoon, Flor.
-Good afternoon, Sara.

209
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,416
Psst! Honey.

210
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,083
I don't think your mother likes me at all.

211
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,666
What do you mean?

212
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,333
Baby, she loves you.

213
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,250
I hate her. I hate her, Ernesto.

214
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,291
Tell me that wasn't
our new daughter-in-law.

215
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,875
Nothing would make me happier.

216
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,500
Something's wrong with our son.
Tell me what he sees in her.

217
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,750
That mother and Miguel,
that stupid pooch drooling everywhere.

218
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,833
Not to mention, did you see
what she did with the cake?

219
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,958
No denying they're
a bit colorful, but, uh…

220
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,583
Oh, check out Mr. Nice Guy.

221
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,166
I hope it's a phase because
those unbelievable in-laws…

222
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,166
Imagine all the Christmases.

223
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,166
Don't say it.

224
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,416
See you later!

225
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,250
Ladies, there's a new exhibit
at the Foundation Museum.

226
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,000
We could go next week
after the conference is done.

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,125
But it has to be morning time
because there's a market for charity.

228
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,166
I think these things are wonderful,
but so much art!

229
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey, what happened with Pablo?

230
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,250
What?

231
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,000
You said he had some kind
of surprise for you, right?

232
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,666
A surprise woman, maybe that lawyer?

233
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,083
There was some woman,
but it seemed pretty temporary.

234
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,375
-Your scarf is beautiful.
-Yes, my daughter-in-law bought it.

235
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,875
She's meeting me here any minute.
We're going shopping.

236
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,000
There she is.

237
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,916
Fabiola!

238
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,791
-Hello, darling!
-Hi.

239
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,375
My favorite mother-in-law.

240
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,916
Mwah! Mwah!

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,916
You look great.
Everyone thinks we're sisters.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,916
-Oh, such exaggerations.
-Just a bit.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,375
Well, girls, I'm stealing her.
And this is all paid, okay?

244
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,708
-Oh, thanks.
-Ciao!

245
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,541
Ah, she's divine.

246
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,750
She's disgusting.

247
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,125
What?

248
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,833
-Hmm?
-Oh, she's charming.

249
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,000
Yes.

250
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,750
Pablo.

251
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,750
Hey, Mom. You're awake?

252
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,416
Trouble sleeping.

253
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,791
Oh, I'm exhausted
so I think I'll go to bed now.

254
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,750
Pablo?

255
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,000
Pablo, come here for a second.

256
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,833
I just keep thinking
about the wedding, and, um…

257
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,291
Are you sure that getting married
is a good idea?

258
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,500
Mama, you know I don't disobey.

259
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,166
Right? I did well in school,
I have my master's.

260
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,958
I studied internationally,
I got the MBA, didn't I?

261
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,750
We provided the best education possible.

262
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,791
Mm-hmm. I gave you every reason
to have faith in me.

263
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,000
Right?

264
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,666
Mom, Sara is…

265
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,833
she's so different.

266
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,541
Well, that's definitely
one way of saying it.

267
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,875
She's totally full of life.

268
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,000
Everything with her is an adventure
and, well, she has a passion

269
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,458
for everything she does
that drives me crazy.

270
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,000
She has a kind of…

271
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,916
a truth and this fire, magic fire,

272
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,541
she shares it with me, Mom,

273
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,833
and it makes me feel good.

274
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,958
And I know you care about my happiness.

275
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:34,916
Don't you, Mama?

276
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,458
Of course I do, sweetheart.

277
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,000
Perfect. I wanna ask a favor.

278
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,916
-Mm.
-A favor?

279
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,291
-We're taking a weekend trip to Soria.
-Oh.

280
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,958
Her father's village, because
Sara wants to show me the church

281
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,625
where we'll have the wedding.

282
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,833
In Soria?

283
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,458
Uh-huh, at the beginning of January.

284
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,250
-In Soria, in January?
-Mm-hmm.

285
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,250
-It's a tradition in her family.
-It's a tradition to freeze?

286
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,083
We'll figure something out,
but you'll come with us?

287
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,083
-You will? You're the greatest.
-What…?

288
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,291
I love you.
00 sharp tomorrow morning.

289
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,541
-Tomorrow?
-Get more of these, they're delicious.

290
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,291
I love you!

291
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,000
There's a wedding.

292
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,000
In Soria, in January.

293
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,791
No.

294
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,000
No.

295
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,958
Seven meals, seven Tupperwares. Hmm?

296
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,791
And Trini.

297
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,250
I'm good on Tupperware.

298
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,458
You won't be cooking?

299
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,291
Saturday is my day for sleeping.

300
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,583
Heat it up whenever you get hungry.

301
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,708
Does it work in Celsius or Fahrenheit?

302
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,375
-In the microwave.
-Trini.

303
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,958
I should stay, shouldn't I?

304
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,958
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Please, you have to go.

305
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,208
It'll be good to have
some time for myself, dear.

306
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,166
Perhaps, and make those corrections.

307
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,333
Your paper on photometry
is about to be overdue.

308
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,833
Just what I was thinking,
my paper on photometry.

309
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,625
-Perfect.

310
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,916
Ah.

311
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,250
Better go.

312
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,833
Well, on my way.

313
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,041
Ooh, oh, hmm, eh…

314
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,458
No, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry.

315
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,500
So that's where the fridge is. Ah!

316
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:35,125
I'm so happy you invited me to go
on this trip along with youse. Thanks.

317
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,541
Amparito doesn't like
going to the village.

318
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,416
-You don't say.
-So I'm always stuck going by myself.

319
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,458
He likes you a lot.

320
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,833
-Hey!

321
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,625
Baby, listen, it's our song, right?

322
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,208
No, I was wrong. This isn't it.

323
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,750
-How can you listen to this?
-I got mixed up.

324
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,916
These songs sexualize us
over and over.

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,791
I like reggaeton, it's cool,
but the lyrics are awful.

326
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,333
-I'm sorry.
-It's pure male sexism.

327
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,958
These lyrics make kids
believe like they do these days.

328
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,916
-It sucks! I didn't expect this from you.
-You're right.

329
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,333
Come on, Sandun, time to pee.

330
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,375
He's as big as a horse, but that bladder
belongs to a Chihuahua.

331
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,250
The plan is, I'll manage it in two years

332
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,416
and own it within four years, guaranteed.

333
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,583
Visualize a goal mentally
and pedal your ass off.

334
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,666
That's what I say to students
on the exercise bike,

335
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,500
and boy, do they sweat.

336
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,833
And you, Lucí?

337
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,208
-I don't sweat.

338
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,333
Yeah, but I meant for a job, you know?

339
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,916
Well, my mother never rests.

340
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,208
Well, I help Ernesto with his paperwork
and the talk he's preparing

341
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:54,208
for the Royal Academy of Exact Sciences,
Physical and Natural.

342
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,833
Yeah, but I mean, that's not really
"work work," am I right?

343
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,291
I've worked my fair share.

344
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,333
Up until I had Pablo,
I happened to run a school.

345
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,375
Beauty school?

346
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,583
No, my love, a different kind, a prep.

347
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,208
-A prep?
-Yes, a prep school.

348
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,458
-You what?
-A prep school? For what?

349
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,125
It's to prep you for school.

350
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,208
-And the school?
-That's to prep, like she said.

351
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,041
-She didn't say anything about the school.
-Prep school is the school.

352
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,375
-Oh, Sandun!

353
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,416
Never mind.

354
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,291
-Never mind, I'm through with that.
-Why did you walk away?

355
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,791
Well, I wanted to help
my husband's career

356
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,291
and care for Pablito.

357
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,708
Yes.

358
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,125
Ooh.

359
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,458
Before too long, Pablito's gonna be
taking care of himself.

360
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,458
Mm-hmm.

361
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,000
Deep breathing, Lucía.

362
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,166
You don't breathe air
this fresh in Madrid.

363
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,958
Come on, Sandun.

364
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,583
-This way.

365
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,750
You're gonna love it,
mother-in-law, it's beautiful.

366
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,166
-Go inside, son.
-Thanks. This way?

367
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,416
-Make yourself at home.

368
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,958
-Dad!
-Sorry.

369
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,083
Excuse him, mother-in-law.

370
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:32,125
Well, we finally arrived. Please come in.

371
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,083
What a house!

372
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,541
-Dad!

373
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,875
-Oh!

374
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,250
-Don't worry, Paqui always gets inside.

375
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,458
-Yeah.

376
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,000
Baby, head to the church.
I'm gonna heat up the house.

377
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,125
-Lucía?

378
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,416
This is great!

379
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,208
You're not going out in that jacket?

380
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,208
It's a warm blazer, it's tweed.

381
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,083
-What?
-Come here!

382
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,833
It's too thin. I'll get you one
of Amparo's coats.

383
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,416
-I've got her!

384
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,375
Oh, my. Strangers.

385
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,833
I want some advice.

386
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,708
What should I do if the priest
wants to know if I'm a believer?

387
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,791
You're an atheist?

388
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,916
Well…

389
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,125
I'm more of a practitioner
of lunar nodes and numerology.

390
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:33,041
For example, God is for sure a seven
with a conjunct Sun-Uranus.

391
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,083
All this in seven days?
No way he's pulling that off on Mars.

392
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:40,125
I wonder if that's something the priest
maybe doesn't need to know about?

393
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,250
There's a possibility
he won't do the ceremony.

394
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,000
So, what do I do? Tell the priest a lie?

395
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,708
I think you should listen.

396
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,208
Belief should always be honored, dear.

397
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,541
Right?

398
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,291
You betcha, Lucí.

399
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,666
I'm gonna be myself.

400
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,083
What's all this?

401
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:12,041
Holy Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

402
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,666
You there, whose girl are you?

403
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,416
Miguel's my father, ma'am.

404
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,166
What a lovely girl.

405
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,791
Welcome.
And when did you get into town?

406
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,791
And when are you leaving?

407
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,541
Father Custodio?

408
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,000
Father?

409
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,625
My God!

410
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,416
Sara, dear!

411
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,791
I wondered where you'd been.

412
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,583
I've been changing
the light bulbs out for LEDs.

413
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:45,791
God knows how important it is
to be energy efficient these days.

414
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,291
Why the visit?

415
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,458
Ah!

416
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:53,375
It's because, Father, I'm getting hitched.

417
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,541
Congratulations, my girl.

418
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,791
Personally, I thought
we might have lost you.

419
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,791
Father, I have to be honest here.

420
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,833
I do have some of my own beliefs.

421
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,250
I'm not sure I have faith
in the normal way.

422
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,750
Is there love?

423
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,791
-Yes.
-There's love.

424
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:11,875
There is.

425
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,583
I want us to spend
our whole lives together.

426
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,958
Oh, and you say you don't
have faith, my girl.

427
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,250
-You're going to marry them, Father?
-Of course.

428
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,166
God is love above all,

429
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,666
and right here I see love.

430
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:30,375
See, you were right,
I should always be myself.

431
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,458
-Oh, I wanna show you something.
-Let's find a date.

432
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,333
What's open, free days this year?

433
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,250
If you don't find something available,
it's no big deal.

434
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,916
-The Church is very busy.
-It may be consecrated.

435
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,333
-The dates open are January…
-Don't touch that.

436
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,500
-I don't think you're supposed to.
-The fourth, fifth…

437
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,458
I am such a big fan of weddings.

438
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,625
-Look at that body wafer--
-Okay.

439
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,083
-January 9th…
-So many days open?

440
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,541
Usually, I keep one day
a week unscheduled.

441
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,791
-This place has so many old people, sadly.
-Please put that down!

442
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,791
That was the last one.

443
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,541
I'm kidding, Sara.

444
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:09,125
I believe God gave us our love of humor.

445
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,458
-I'm so happy!

446
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,041
Did you know Father Custodio
was the guy who married my parents?

447
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,708
He's the best!

448
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,791
Honey, go on inside and see
if you can help Miguel.

449
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:25,916
Uh…

450
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,791
Okay.

451
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,291
Well, at least we have
one thing off the list, right?

452
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,750
That's just the beginning.

453
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:38,625
On to the photographer
and the catering, the drinks,

454
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,916
your wedding dress, the invitations,
and you don't want to seat them badly,

455
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,583
it makes them so furious.

456
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,791
Then there's the maid of honor,
bridesmaids,

457
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,333
registering for gifts,
which takes forever.

458
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:51,458
-The flowers…
-Oh, my God, that's so much.

459
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:52,500
What am I gonna do?

460
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:55,291
Just when I upped my hours at the gym
to get that promotion.

461
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,333
Oh my, you enterprising girl, you.

462
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,083
Well, maybe I can get help
from my mother.

463
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,500
Of course, she must have some days off.

464
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,625
That's the thing about mothers,

465
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:09,000
we'll sacrifice anything
for our children. Yeah.

466
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,708
But she shouldn't have to waste
vacation days on this.

467
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:12,666
Hmm.

468
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,750
Maybe I should postpone the wedding.

469
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,000
Would be a shame.

470
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,125
But an ambitious girl like you
needs to think about her career

471
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:24,666
and her future.

472
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,708
That's the truth, Lucía.

473
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:33,125
And planning a wedding
requires so much of your time.

474
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,083
I know. Whoo. I know.

475
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,500
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

476
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:42,291
I'm sorry, though, but I hope you know
I'll always be here for you.

477
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,208
Yeah.

478
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,458
Come on.

479
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,125
Roasted veal with mushrooms.

480
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,666
Found them with Sandun.

481
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,000
Have a seat.

482
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,791
You're here, Lucía.

483
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,333
Thank you.

484
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,958
You okay?

485
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,708
A bit more.

486
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,958
-There.
-Okay.

487
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,250
Try some, go on.

488
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,750
-Now?
-Yes, please.

489
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,791
All right.

490
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,083
Please, help yourselves.

491
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,666
I'd like to say something.
No speeches.

492
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,958
-No, no, Papa.
-Huh?

493
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:43,500
I wanna go first.

494
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,833
Pablo, I've been thinking,

495
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:52,500
and with all my new work hours
and my goals,

496
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,166
plus planning a wedding,

497
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,333
all those crazy preparations,

498
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,958
it's clear that the only way

499
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,916
for our wedding to be awesome
is for me--

500
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,125
Is to wait awhile.

501
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,833
-What are you saying?

502
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,666
No, no, no, no, no.

503
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,666
I have a much better idea.

504
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:17,041
I'd like you to be the one
to help us with the preparation.

505
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:21,083
-Who?
-Who better than you, Lucía?

506
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,125
You've got so much spare time.

507
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,125
Well, I don't have that much spare time.

508
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,541
Honey, slow down.
Maybe she doesn't want to help--

509
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:30,125
No, but it was her idea originally.

510
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,666
There wasn't any reason
to beat around the bush, Lucía.

511
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:39,125
That is very generous
on your part, Lucía.

512
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:43,166
Thank you. Mom, you're the best. Thanks.

513
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,750
Mm! I love you!

514
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,208
-Honey.

515
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,500
-My mother's watching.

516
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,000
-More wine?
-Yes, thanks.

517
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,416
Sh, quiet!

518
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,875
How did you like the visit
to the church, Lucía?

519
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:19,333
It was really beautiful.

520
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,708
It's lovely to visit during the day.

521
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,166
Morning is best.

522
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,583
The light that comes in by the altar

523
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,125
just behind the statue of the Virgin

524
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,333
illuminates her crown of gold and silver.

525
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:36,916
It's like the sun itself
is sitting on her crown,

526
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,166
like some special jewel.

527
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:44,916
I will never get tired of saying it.

528
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,416
Art is delight.

529
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,791
And delight is art.

530
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,333
Oh, Pops!

531
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,791
Leave her alone.

532
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,250
Jeez!

533
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,208
If he's boring you, just say so.

534
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,958
Nobody's bored, love.

535
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,125
Am I boring you?

536
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,833
-No, no, not at all.

537
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:06,458
Okay, you two, we have to go to bed.

538
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,041
Yes.

539
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,333
Good night, Dad.

540
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,083
-Hmm. Good night, my sweet girl.
-Love you. See you tomorrow.

541
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,666
-Good night.
-See you, Mom.

542
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,125
It's freezin', huh?
That's typical Soria.

543
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,416
Thank you for dinner.

544
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,375
I'm glad you enjoyed the food, Lucía.

545
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,458
My only purpose on this visit…

546
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:44,291
…is for you to enjoy yourself,
feel at home.

547
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,875
This village has wonderful treasures.

548
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:51,916
The hermitage,
the cemeteries, the vistas…

549
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,291
-the pillar…

550
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,708
-The little fort…

551
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:58,666
the fountain.

552
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,125
-The plaza…

553
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:02,166
those porticos.

554
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,625
-Incredible.

555
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:06,708
-And best of all, the silence, the peace.

556
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:14,375
Well, I guess it's time to go to bed.

557
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,708
-To sleep.
-What else?

558
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,125
Yes, okay.

559
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:26,791
You lost?

560
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,416
Perhaps the stairs.

561
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,875
Towards the room.
To sleep. Good night.

562
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:05,875
Ernesto.

563
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:08,791
Hello. Well, thank goodness
you're coming home tomorrow, huh?

564
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,333
Yes, I miss you too, my love.

565
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:15,083
I can't seem to work out which button
opens the stupid microwave,

566
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,208
and Trini won't answer my WhatsApps,

567
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,333
and I know she reads them,
the checkmark is blue.

568
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:21,708
Ernesto, the microwave
doesn't have a button.

569
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,333
You just have to pull open the door.

570
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:26,541
Oh.

571
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:29,500
Hmm.

572
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:36,000
It's been a long day,
and I'm getting just a bit worn out.

573
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,750
Good night, sweet dreams.

574
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,625
I know how well you sleep
in a small town.

575
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,458
Whoa!

576
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,750
The hatch hadn't been battened.

577
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:34,000
-What?

578
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,250
Don't worry, it won't come open again.

579
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,625
So you'll sleep easily.

580
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,875
Sandun!

581
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,333
Sandun?

582
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,291
Sandun!

583
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,625
-Have a look at these vegetables, Lucía.

584
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:52,458
My God, can you believe
the size of this apple?

585
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,791
That country smell.

586
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,916
And these turnips,
these are great for the circulation.

587
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,750
We're Radio Soria on your radio
playing the latest hits by Lee Ray.

588
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,416
Sarita, it's our song.

589
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,625
Yes!

590
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,833
Come, sing with me.

591
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:19,083
Come on, you can do it.

592
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,791
¡Olé!

593
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,750
-Uh…
-The missus got this fruit?

594
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,291
Yes.

595
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,208
-Hmm.
-Good morning.

596
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,083
Here you go.

597
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,166
Thanks, Trini.

598
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,583
-Good morning.
-Hello.

599
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,333
Not today either?

600
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:55,708
I always say breakfast is
the most important meal, and I believe it.

601
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:58,583
-Yes, you're right.
-I know I'm right, thank you.

602
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,916
Just ask any reputable nutritionist.

603
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,083
-I meant that's something you always say.
-Good morning, Trini.

604
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:06,166
-Mom.

605
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,458
Mm.

606
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:08,916
Mm-hmm.

607
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,125
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

608
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,750
How was the trip?
Anything interesting?

609
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,875
Well, it's what you expect
from a small town

610
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:19,750
-with a church and a pillar…

611
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:22,333
…an hermitage, a little fort…

612
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,375
-She fell in love.

613
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,583
-I did?
-Yeah.

614
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,958
Admit it, Mom.

615
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:30,041
Go on, admit it, you loved Sara.

616
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,583
-That's so nice.
-You know what else?

617
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,875
She offered to help us
with the preparations.

618
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:36,541
Really? You offered?

619
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,208
Today we're looking at flowers,

620
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,833
and by the way,
Miguel wants to help so he's coming too.

621
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:42,916
Uh, it's late.
I need to get to the office.

622
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,125
Who's Miguel?

623
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:48,791
Trini, don't you have
something else to do,

624
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,708
like fluffing the pillows?

625
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:53,583
If I fluff them anymore,
they'll be pigeons.

626
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:04,833
Ernesto, why don't you come with us
to look at flowers?

627
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,416
But you hate shopping with me.

628
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,291
Yeah, but this is different.

629
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,416
Because it would help if you came with us.

630
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
Why?

631
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:18,541
To weigh in,

632
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,958
maybe give your opinion.

633
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:24,458
My opinion?
But isn't that precisely what you hate?

634
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:28,333
Plus you remind me constantly
that your taste is impeccable.

635
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:31,333
-Ernesto. Ernesto!
-Have fun, dear.

636
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:33,708
But there's nothing
on your schedule today.

637
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,458
What is wrong with you, Lucía?

638
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,708
This.

639
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,291
-Mom?
-You need me?

640
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:04,125
Sara mentioned we could,
uh, fill the church with thyme,

641
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:07,458
because she said that's something
that's typical of Soria.

642
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:10,500
Honey, so are pork cracklings.

643
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:13,166
You're not going to serve those
at the banquet, are you?

644
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,250
Of course we aren't.

645
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:17,041
How about using calla lilies
for the bride's bouquet?

646
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,333
-Sure.

647
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:19,541
Ah, they're here.

648
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,958
-Hello, sweetie!
-Hi, love.

649
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,375
Hello. What's up?

650
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:27,666
-Oh, check this out.
-Ooh, do you like these?

651
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:35,958
-My in-law.

652
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,875
-Hi.
-Shit, you're all primped, aren't you?

653
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,083
You came with the bus?

654
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:45,666
Yes, I was heading to the depot
and this was just past my route.

655
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,458
Forty-five-foot monster.

656
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,166
How about that?

657
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,625
I'll give you a ride home.

658
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:52,958
-On the bus?
-Yeah.

659
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:56,333
Mom, what about flowers made of paper?
It costs less.

660
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:02,416
Something wrong, Lucía?
Because you look a bit tense.

661
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,708
Amparo, mother to mother,

662
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,666
do you think they should do this?

663
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,083
To be frank, I have to say no.

664
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,666
I mean, flowers made out of paper,
that's tacky.

665
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,583
No, I mean the wedding.

666
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:18,083
Don't you think it's a bit premature?

667
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,208
Sure, if you like it, I love it.

668
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,875
Oh, yes, please!

669
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,041
Or a lettuce.

670
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,541
Please, when I was her age,
I was a mama too.

671
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,333
But those were different times.

672
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:30,083
Hey, Lucía, I don't usually give advice,

673
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:33,375
but this wedding is the best thing
possible that could happen to us.

674
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,500
-Is it?
-We've done our job as mothers.

675
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,458
And everything's good.
Now it's our turn…

676
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,666
…to relax, go out, enjoy.

677
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,916
You know, have fun.

678
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,166
And you and your husband are all alone
in your house. You get me, right?

679
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,000
No, I don't.

680
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,166
Come on.

681
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,041
What I would give for the naps
we used to take,

682
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,458
but just the two of us.

683
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,791
Toni has no idea up there
with his headphones on.

684
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,833
Mom! Artichoke or cabbage?

685
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:02,375
Oh, hon, either of them.
They're hilarious.

686
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,541
Have fun, girl.

687
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,625
-Ooh, don't you just love it?
-Thanks.

688
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:06,875
I'm really going large…

689
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:09,291
-"Have fun."
-It is so unique!

690
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,500
-Let's see, it really does…
-Mm-hmm.

691
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:16,500
-It suits her.
-But pink suits her more.

692
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:18,125
-Artichoke won.
-It suits her.

693
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,708
-Is there something…
-Mm-mm.

694
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:44,666
I started using
that anti-dandruff shampoo you got me.

695
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,916
Yeah.

696
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:56,791
SCHOOL

697
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,583
DO YOU NEED A CHANGE?

698
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,000
Good morning.

699
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,458
-Hello, Pilar. How's the family?
-Fine, thank you.

700
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:29,208
-My God!
-Hey, Peewee, the family good?

701
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,583
Behave!

702
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,125
Ernesto gets his suits made here.

703
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,291
The way Peewee looks at me, huh?

704
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,166
She must think
the showroom dummies escaped.

705
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,083
Toni, don't cause trouble today.

706
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:42,541
Can you have them bring him
a sports coat or something?

707
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,416
Are these alterations finished?
Great. Thank you.

708
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,541
No problem.

709
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:51,583
Hey, I know my way
around a fancy joint.

710
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,875
Besides, this tracksuit is for bowling.

711
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,250
Dad's here, finally!

712
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,791
-Hi!
-My girl.

713
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,708
Lucía, what a surprise!

714
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,583
-Well, hello, Miguel.
-Mikey.

715
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:04,250
Well, Sara wanted me
to come help out today,

716
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,750
but if I'd realized they already
had an expert…

717
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:08,916
But you knew she was coming
with us today, Pop.

718
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,041
No, I didn't, honey.

719
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:12,916
What do you mean?
You even thanked her.

720
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,208
Doesn't matter, does it?

721
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,708
Might as well stay, I'm here.

722
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:18,833
Besides I'm a fashion lover.

723
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:24,000
Have you chosen a suit
for the big day yet?

724
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:25,583
Yes. Yes, yes.

725
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,416
No. No, no.

726
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
Which one?

727
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,041
From my wedding.

728
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,250
Very fancy, Lucía.

729
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,041
Very fancy.

730
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,625
So you want me to show up
in a penguin suit?

731
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:43,375
-It's a coat.
-Like a movie star.

732
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:46,125
It's stylish, but neoclassical.

733
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:47,833
Sober, elegant.

734
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,333
Like you, Lucía.

735
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:51,333
Dad?

736
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:53,833
Dad?

737
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:55,416
Do you like this one?

738
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,166
Hmm. No.

739
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:01,208
Let's put on the next one.

740
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,541
We have to pay for this, no?

741
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,083
-No.
-Ah!

742
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:06,083
No.

743
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:09,208
Ah! Bring me another?

744
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:11,166
-More champagne.

745
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,583
-Oh, no.
-Just a little more.

746
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:13,583
It's okay, stop it.

747
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:15,041
Go, Toni, go!

748
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:17,708
Another aisle, you're the fuckin' man!

749
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:19,041
-Oops.

750
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,666
Oh. It was like that.

751
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,166
A little card? Just the one…

752
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,041
Feast your eyes on what I found, honey.

753
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:27,833
Fantastic!

754
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:29,875
Papa!

755
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,041
$80.

756
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:33,208
-$40.
-It's $80.

757
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:36,583
You say $80, I say $40,
tell me that we have a deal,

758
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:38,375
and I'll do an Insta-story for you…

759
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:39,333
My boy.

760
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:42,375
-I'll tell you what, $85 even.
-Okay.

761
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:45,000
No, no, no, hold on, hold on. May I?

762
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,041
-Sure, go ahead.
-I certainly love a Windsor.

763
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:50,458
Well, my husband seems to think
I do too many tucks.

764
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,625
Very few, in my opinion.

765
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:57,750
Papa!

766
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:00,750
That's it!

767
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:03,083
No, no.

768
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,708
That's not it, honey.

769
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,916
Hey, Toni, how do I…

770
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,458
Pablo, how do I look?

771
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:12,000
Whoo. Very smart, Mikey, perfect.

772
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:14,708
It was your mother's choice.

773
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:17,750
Why don't you choose? Really.

774
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:20,958
This one's better.

775
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,666
Then the decision's made.

776
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,291
You don't like anything I like!

777
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:33,916
You can top me off.

778
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:35,791
Thank you.

779
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:42,083
That little tiny pea thing,
that was what again?

780
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,541
A cut of venison,
charred potato and olive.

781
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,000
-Venison?
-Mm-hmm.

782
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:49,500
If they had an empanada,
they could fit the whole deer inside.

783
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:53,666
And our next selection.

784
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:57,750
A small bite,
featuring pork rinds and chili.

785
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,125
I…

786
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,458
Tastes like…

787
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,833
Oh!

788
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:08,041
It's crunchy.

789
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,500
And you'll notice it finishes
with a kind of…

790
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,666
…punch, but just a little touch…

791
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,000
-…of spice.

792
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,833
I didn't notice any punches.

793
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:22,958
I don't know,
maybe they could make it spicier.

794
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,333
We could.

795
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:26,375
But this time, add the pork rinds,

796
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:29,083
with all the foam, sorbets and cones…

797
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,375
This is like a beach bar menu, huh?

798
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,041
-Okay.

799
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,750
We'll take a bunch of those thingies
there with the egg,

800
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,833
the artichoke with the goat

801
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:39,750
and the lawn clippings,

802
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:43,041
and the mouth bomb for my father.

803
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,541
He loved it.

804
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,333
So, then everything's settled.

805
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:49,333
Okay. So, then if you'll please
follow me to the back,

806
00:44:49,416 --> 00:44:51,625
our administrator will settle the details.

807
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,916
-Thank you.
-Yes.

808
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,250
The garden's beautiful, right?

809
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:12,791
I see something that is
much more beautiful than a garden.

810
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:15,958
Miguel, please, don't.

811
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:20,000
Lucía, whenever I get near you,

812
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:24,625
I feel a solid attraction.

813
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,500
Then you should probably
keep your distance.

814
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,750
You want this just as much as I do.

815
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:47,583
-No, we shouldn't do this, Miguel.
-Yes, we should--

816
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:49,500
Hey, I forgot to grab the wallet.

817
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,958
Mom, you're flushed.

818
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,416
-That's not true.
-Oh, Lucí!

819
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,458
Your face is really red.

820
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,958
It was that thingy,
I told you it was too hot!

821
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:02,458
-I'm fine, really.
-It's getting redder.

822
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:05,166
-I'm perfectly fine.
-Maybe it's some allergic reaction.

823
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,250
You can't breathe? Dad, take her pulse.
You're good at this.

824
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,500
-Sara, please.
-No, he's really good!

825
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:12,708
-No, stop touching me!
-Okay, okay.

826
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,375
I'm fantastic, I'm fantastic!

827
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:18,041
Well, she's fine. She's fantastic.

828
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:23,500
Uh-uh, that's it, no pork rinds.

829
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:29,666
Lucía! Wait a minute.

830
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,500
Lucía!

831
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,458
Hey, wait up, Lucía.

832
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:40,583
I'm sorry.

833
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:42,500
Well, no, I'm not sorry, actually.

834
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:45,083
-Miguel, you know we can't do this.
-Oh, please.

835
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:48,000
No, no, no, not my hand.
Not my hand.

836
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,750
You've got to stop denying this.

837
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,500
-Something's starting here, Lucía.
-No, Miguel.

838
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:58,125
You're wrong.

839
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:00,041
I'm… very content.

840
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:01,666
I need things…

841
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,625
to always be perfect.

842
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,750
This would be wrong for both of us.

843
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:07,958
We have to stop.

844
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:13,708
Good afternoon.

845
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,875
He's a great astrophysicist.

846
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:30,833
Sorry?

847
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:34,625
He's a great astrophysicist.

848
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:35,916
Astrophysicist!

849
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,291
Oh, I see.
He's an expert in Mars exploration.

850
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,625
He's looking for life…

851
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:49,250
I don't know, what do you think?
I think the Chinese…

852
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,500
Finally.

853
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:29,458
What's the matter?

854
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:31,833
No, it's okay. I'm hot.

855
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:32,875
You didn't--

856
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,958
I'm wearing a double layer thermal.

857
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:37,750
These churches sometimes
get drafty, that's all.

858
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:56,833
Fuck. Ease up on the damn feather, Mom.

859
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:59,083
I am checking out the ladies.

860
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:01,375
-Hey.
-Quiet. You have no idea.

861
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:04,500
In Hello, the Princess of Cornwall
wore the same one.

862
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:08,625
Look. She's always perfect, the old cow.

863
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:11,416
Hey, man, if she's hot,
well, then she's hot.

864
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:14,583
Oh, my God.

865
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:16,125
This age is bad.

866
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,125
They're here!

867
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,833
And start the organ.

868
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:24,416
Okay, everybody, let's go. Places.

869
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:02,625
I love you!

870
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,541
I know.

871
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,333
Let's go. Come on. Sara.

872
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,916
-Take care of my girl.
-Yes, sir.

873
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,583
-You may be seated.

874
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:19,875
You look beautiful.

875
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:22,291
I can't believe how beautiful you look.

876
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:26,000
My dear sisters, my dear brothers,

877
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:27,875
this is a celebration of…

878
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,833
Just so you know,
I missed you.

879
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:32,375
…to enter the contract
of marriage today,

880
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:34,750
before the ministry of the Church

881
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:36,791
and before all of us gathered here.

882
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:39,708
-This is not the place!

883
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,916
The Lord blesses thee…

884
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,875
Lucía, you torture me.
I miss you every day.

885
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,541
No! Not here.

886
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,333
…the conjugal desires between you,

887
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,625
so that you keep mutual…

888
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,916
-No!
-Silence, you!

889
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Really.

890
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,166
Sorry.

891
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,416
I meant to say,
mutual respect and fidelity.

892
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Sorry, Father.

893
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:01,958
-Sorry.

894
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,958
-Where was I?
-What?

895
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,291
No. No!

896
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:09,875
…and to express the mutual…

897
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:12,791
The country house is empty,
you could meet me there tonight.

898
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:16,375
-What?
-Just you and me if you say yes.

899
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:18,833
Thus we make the sign of peace.

900
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,708
-Peace to you.

901
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:25,750
Yes?

902
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,916
What do you say?

903
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:30,208
Wait.

904
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:33,875
Peace unto you.

905
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,958
Wait. Peace.

906
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,083
Yeah.

907
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:40,958
Oh, but this isn't the way
that it's supposed to work.

908
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,750
Whoo!

909
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,750
What's up? We're family now!

910
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,458
My children, do you both love each other?

911
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:54,875
-Yes, of course, Father.
-Yes.

912
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:58,416
Well then, I now declare you
husband and wife.

913
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:04,875
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous,
and gorgeous!

914
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,916
Congratulations
and welcome to the family!

915
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,416
Mama!

916
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:13,041
Thank you, Father!

917
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,083
I wish you all the happiness.

918
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,375
I love you.

919
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:22,625
I'm married now!

920
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:29,000
-Catalog pose!

921
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:30,208
Check me out!

922
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,791
Congratulations, Sara!

923
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:34,000
One more! Smile!

924
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,291
It's your turn to catch 'em!

925
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:37,541
Wait up, wait up!

926
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:49,916
This was the garter belt
that belonged to my mother.

927
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,291
Hey, here's something borrowed.

928
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:54,875
Mm, get it! I'm embarrassing myself.

929
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,250
Go for it tonight!

930
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,791
Congratulations, Sara.

931
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:05,583
-Excuse me.
-What do you want?

932
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:11,416
Stop looking at the sky, professor.
You're not at work!

933
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,041
-Just a bit more, thanks.
-Drink up, drink up.

934
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:16,000
-That's good, please. Stop.
-Drink up!

935
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:18,333
-That's good, please.
-This is a very good wine.

936
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:19,541
-Drink up.
-Stop it.

937
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:22,625
-Look at them.
-Just wait till you hear my speech.

938
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:23,958
I have a question.

939
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:27,000
I was watching a documentary
about your field the other day…

940
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:27,958
Yes.

941
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:31,250
…and when they stuck a flag
on the Moon, it wasn't waving.

942
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,958
You know what I mean?
There's no wind.

943
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:35,708
It's a movie.

944
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:37,458
Nobody's ever been to the Moon.

945
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,166
-We've definitely been to the Moon.

946
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,708
Sure.
And Earth is round. Fuckin' liars.

947
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,875
Please, a moment for the bride's father.

948
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:57,583
As you can imagine,
it's a happy day for us here,

949
00:53:57,666 --> 00:54:00,000
not only because my daughter got married,

950
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:03,083
but also because she married
a man like Pablo.

951
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:05,833
Don't be embarrassed
if you're emotional, it's beautiful.

952
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,000
It's the thermal again.

953
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,625
Then take it off.

954
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,666
The thing about love is, it's a mystery.

955
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,125
Aw!

956
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:16,625
It's like a spark that appears
out of the blue

957
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:20,291
and is able to set fire
to an entire forest.

958
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,750
And suddenly this person

959
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:29,416
you barely even know
has become indispensable…

960
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,875
I'm too hot!

961
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:33,083
She becomes indispensable,

962
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:37,583
and you start to realize that
everything about her is special.

963
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:42,625
Her beauty and elegance,
her smile is magical.

964
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:45,541
-And her blond hair…
-Hmm?

965
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:47,875
-Huh?

966
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,708
…with a touch of copper, teal…

967
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,250
violet?

968
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:58,166
Will you come to the bathroom with me
and stick this shirt in your purse?

969
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,958
Go later, not now.

970
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:03,750
Well, in that case,
here's to the newlyweds.

971
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,958
To the bride and groom!

972
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:08,125
-Hurray!
-Mike!

973
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,750
Thanks, Mikey.

974
00:55:13,541 --> 00:55:15,541
May you be very happy.

975
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,875
Father, I certainly think you've had
quite enough of the prawns.

976
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,166
Be quiet, would you?

977
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,750
These prawns are free!

978
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:25,000
A souvenir so you don't forget
the big day.

979
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,958
-Oh, cool. Thanks.
-Thank you.

980
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:30,666
-What an enormous lollipop.
-Yeah, but where do I put it?

981
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,333
I'm suffocating!

982
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:35,625
-That won't fit in my purse.
-I don't care, I don't care.

983
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,333
This is ridiculous.

984
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:38,875
Hey, wait for me.

985
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:41,958
Give me your bag.

986
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:43,333
I'll be quick.

987
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:49,333
Lucía?

988
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:52,250
This is quite the wedding.

989
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,291
Full of contrasts.

990
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:59,375
And this village is so…
How did you go about choosing it?

991
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:02,291
Well…

992
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:05,083
the bride's family is from here.

993
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:07,375
-Ah!
-That makes sense.

994
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:09,958
Very authentic here, no?

995
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,458
It's a village.

996
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,250
It is.

997
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,833
Actually, if you'll just look
a bit deeper,

998
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,583
there are some very interesting things,

999
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:22,083
but, of course, for that
you have to look a bit closer.

1000
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:27,833
Have fun, ladies.

1001
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:33,166
-What is wrong with her?
-I don't know.

1002
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:40,250
I need you to hurry
and get out of the bathroom.

1003
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:41,416
Make it fast.

1004
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:50,041
I was looking for you as well.

1005
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,541
Hmm. Here?

1006
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:54,333
What's happening, Miguel?

1007
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:57,791
Come on, let's "Paquito"!

1008
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,000
Sarita!

1009
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,583
Father! Oh!

1010
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:21,291
Father, enjoying yourself?

1011
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:22,708
Very much!

1012
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,166
Father, you're the bomb!

1013
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,458
-Come on.
-Miguel, please!

1014
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:31,583
-We have to talk, Lucía.
-About what?

1015
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:34,791
-We have to talk.
-There are so many people here!

1016
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:37,500
Miguel, what are you doing?

1017
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:43,916
I can't take it.
I have to tell you, Lucía.

1018
00:57:45,416 --> 00:57:46,541
I'm so in love.

1019
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:50,583
What do you mean, in love?

1020
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:53,041
Tell me you don't feel the same way.

1021
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:57,750
Tell me and I'll stop bothering you.

1022
00:57:57,833 --> 00:58:01,375
Right now, I'm not sure
what I feel, to be honest.

1023
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:04,125
I say we go with it, Lucía.

1024
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:07,000
Because art is pleasure,

1025
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,791
and pleasure is art.

1026
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:12,000
Are you insane?
It's the wedding of our children.

1027
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:17,208
You'll see, Auntie, over here.
It's very quiet.

1028
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:21,875
Oh! Ah!

1029
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,333
Oh, my God!

1030
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,291
Oh!

1031
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:29,208
-Isn't that my nephew?

1032
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:30,958
It's not that quiet here.

1033
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:33,208
What the hell are you doing?

1034
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:35,125
This isn't what it looks like.

1035
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:37,833
-We've fallen in love.
-No!

1036
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,125
What did you say?

1037
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,208
-No!
-Yes, yes.

1038
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,625
No, Amparo, there's another explanation.

1039
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:47,166
Just stay calm because I promise you,
we aren't in love.

1040
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,833
-We are, we are.
-We're not, we're not.

1041
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:53,458
-Don't come any closer to me.
-Amparo, I was going to tell you.

1042
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:57,833
Amparo, no. Miguel, stop her, please,
before we make a scene!

1043
00:58:57,916 --> 00:59:00,166
-Amparo!
-How is your life, dear?

1044
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,583
-How come you never call me?
-Amparo!

1045
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,416
-Give me those cheeks.
-Amparo!

1046
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,958
-Amparo!
-Fucking bastards!

1047
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:10,291
We need to fatten you up!
You should come by the house.

1048
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:11,708
Amparo, please!

1049
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:14,166
Let's talk this over
like civilized people!

1050
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,500
Please! It's a game.

1051
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:18,583
You look so much like your Uncle Felipe.

1052
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:20,708
-Rest in peace.
-I was talking to Aunt Paca.

1053
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:23,250
She has that corner store,
and, anyway, she told me…

1054
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:25,416
-Excuse me.

1055
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:32,541
Hey, Mom, we were looking for you.
We wanted to…

1056
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:35,541
…say thank you for the wedding,
it's just perfect.

1057
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:38,375
-I know you didn't expect that.
-Fuck that blond whore!

1058
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:41,125
Shit, Mom, I told you
they're not playing a copla.

1059
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,583
It's not a fucking copla.

1060
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:45,791
Your father and Lucí are making out!

1061
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,375
I know you're really sad,
but Lucía is hot.

1062
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:53,416
When I met you, I thought
you were a bit of a stuck-up lady,

1063
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,833
and I have to admit,
though it's embarrassing,

1064
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:57,833
that I thought you hated me at first.

1065
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:58,791
No.

1066
00:59:58,875 --> 00:59:59,916
Give me the microphone.

1067
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,541
Mom, don't ruin my session.
Look, Sara's still having fun.

1068
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,000
Give me the mic!

1069
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:05,541
How about a dance, Aunt Sally?

1070
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:08,208
Ah, kid, the wedding
was such a wonderful affair.

1071
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:11,083
-Let's go see Sarita--
-Sara was a gorgeous bride.

1072
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:12,333
Here's to the newlyweds!

1073
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:16,125
And you're always so awesome
and super generous and thoughtful.

1074
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:18,500
You're so thoughtful and just…

1075
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:20,375
…a fucking bitch…

1076
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:27,541
…and my stupid husband are cheating
on me in front of my friends and family.

1077
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,625
Your husband cheated on you?

1078
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:36,166
With your wife, you moron!

1079
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:42,041
He's such a phony!

1080
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,625
What are you saying, Mom?

1081
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:45,291
Best to ask your father.

1082
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,708
Is this true, Papa?

1083
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:52,500
Mom?

1084
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:04,833
What is that lipstick?

1085
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,541
This wasn't from Lucía.

1086
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:10,250
It was from your great aunt Melifelli.

1087
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,625
Get the hell out.

1088
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:27,291
Get in the car.

1089
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,375
It was one kiss, I swear.

1090
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:37,708
How dare you!

1091
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:40,500
I don't know, but I feel awful.

1092
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,583
At the wedding of our son, huh?

1093
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:46,208
In front of all my coworkers
and in front of my friends.

1094
01:01:48,416 --> 01:01:50,750
I'm sorry,
next time I'll be more discreet.

1095
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:51,791
What are you saying?

1096
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,791
It seems like the only thing
that's important is what they think.

1097
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:57,083
I don't even recognize you!

1098
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:00,083
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1099
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:03,000
I'm sorry, I don't know
what happened to me.

1100
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:06,791
I don't know, was it a cry
for help or attention?

1101
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:10,708
Oh, well, if it was for attention,
you eclipsed the bride.

1102
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:15,125
I'm talking about your attention, Ernesto.

1103
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,541
-My--
-It seems like I don't exist to you.

1104
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:20,291
But, Lucía, you're all over
everything I do.

1105
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:23,375
The way I eat, dress,
I always do what you want me to.

1106
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:26,625
I don't sit on the sofa
because I'll crush the fucking cushions.

1107
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,333
Come on. Get in the car, please.

1108
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:30,666
But…

1109
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,000
do you really think I care
about the cushions?

1110
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:38,333
I'm sick of the cleaning, managing,
caretaking, the organizing.

1111
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:40,750
I'm your wife, not your mother.

1112
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:43,625
You say the weirdest things.
Of course you're not my mother.

1113
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:48,000
Then why don't you ever touch me, Ernesto?

1114
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,458
Tell me why.

1115
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:53,416
I had no idea that's what you wanted.

1116
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,708
Ernesto, the whole world
wants to be touched.

1117
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:57,083
Since when, though?

1118
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:58,458
I tried.

1119
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,333
I tried for years to.

1120
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:03,458
-But you never…
-I what?

1121
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:08,333
Say it.

1122
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:10,583
You never responded.

1123
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,833
And you're telling me this now?

1124
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:19,708
-Why didn't you? You never said anything.
-Pretend that it was nothing.

1125
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:22,208
And then, because things
weren't so bad, you know?

1126
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:28,500
If we weren't doing so badly,

1127
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,708
I assure you I never
would have noticed Miguel.

1128
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:32,333
-Miguel!
-You understand?

1129
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:33,916
You slept with him, didn't you?

1130
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,583
No, I didn't.

1131
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:41,791
I told you, it was one kiss, period.

1132
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:43,041
I knew it!

1133
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,208
You knew it?

1134
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:53,541
You don't understand anything.

1135
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,541
I understand it all, Lucía.

1136
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:58,208
No, we never slept together.

1137
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:59,250
Mm-hmm.

1138
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:02,250
What's the matter?
You don't believe me?

1139
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,708
-Are you surprised?
-Huh?

1140
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:05,833
When you're making out
with some other guy?

1141
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:08,750
-I give up. I'm leaving.
-Where are you going, Lucía?

1142
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:09,833
Wait, stop. Why?

1143
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:13,083
Because I don't want to stay here
one single minute longer.

1144
01:04:13,166 --> 01:04:14,250
-You understand?
-Okay.

1145
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:17,666
-Not a single minute more.
-Calm down, Lucía. Calm down, please!

1146
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,708
I… don't understand
what's happening to us.

1147
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:21,958
It's okay.

1148
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:24,208
Look.

1149
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,083
Yes?

1150
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,541
-Okay.
-Lucía.

1151
01:04:31,916 --> 01:04:34,041
Let me just make a suggestion.

1152
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,541
Why don't we both go see a doctor?

1153
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:38,250
What? A doctor?

1154
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,958
Yes, a doctor.

1155
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:44,333
Why? A doctor? Why?

1156
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:47,666
Because, I mean, because, well, maybe…

1157
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,750
maybe he can help you, Lucía.

1158
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,291
-No.
-Lucía, please.

1159
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:53,791
Don't touch me!

1160
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:58,000
This could just be a spike
in your estrogen, nothing more.

1161
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:02,000
Lucía, please, where are you going?
It's night and it's raining!

1162
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:03,458
You son of a bitch, I do not care.

1163
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,333
Please, Lucía, where are you going?

1164
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:06,875
-Lucía!
-Stay where you are!

1165
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:09,666
Lucía, this village is dangerous.
Please stay!

1166
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:12,208
Go fuck yourself!

1167
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:13,625
Get away from me!

1168
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,541
Lucía!

1169
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,708
Lucía!

1170
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:39,000
Since everybody thinks we had sex…

1171
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:43,000
we might as well.

1172
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,083
All right.

1173
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,666
-How the fuck do I unfasten this?
-It's got buttons.

1174
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:42,208
Oh, shit.

1175
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:46,583
Shoo, shoo!

1176
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,500
Not possible.

1177
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:55,916
Where is my underwear?

1178
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:00,125
Shh… what?

1179
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:10,375
"ART IS PLEASURE,
AND PLEASURE IS ART"

1180
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,208
Oh, no way.

1181
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:19,625
No way, no way!

1182
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:21,208
What have I done?

1183
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,875
-Good morning.
-What have you done?

1184
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:25,458
I did it all.

1185
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,500
Toast and eggs and sausage.

1186
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:29,583
You're thinking about eating right now?

1187
01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:33,291
Well, breakfast is the most important meal
of the day, Lucía.

1188
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:34,666
I have to get out of here.

1189
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:37,166
Where's my dress?

1190
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,416
What's happening?

1191
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,375
What's happening?

1192
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:41,750
We probably made
the biggest mistake of our lives.

1193
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:44,416
-Are you talking about us?
-There isn't an "us."

1194
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,666
We should talk, honey.

1195
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:48,375
You don't wanna eat breakfast,
no problem.

1196
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:49,666
Fuck the toast, see?

1197
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,375
-Honey?
-Huh?

1198
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:52,791
-Hmm!

1199
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:55,500
If you're talking
about Ernesto and Amparo,

1200
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:58,500
they're both adults and have to understand
that we're in love.

1201
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:00,500
Please don't say that anymore.

1202
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:03,791
I felt love last night, and I…

1203
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:07,166
haven't felt that much love
in a long while.

1204
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,708
Nobody's gonna make me regret it.

1205
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:10,083
Last night,

1206
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,791
we ruined the wedding of our children,
right after we gave them away.

1207
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:15,250
What can we do about that?

1208
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:19,375
What's important is that
something exists right here.

1209
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:21,625
And life is too short.

1210
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:25,833
I agree with all that, but you can't just
cause harm to the people you love,

1211
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:27,791
because it doesn't work that way.

1212
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:30,083
Don't you understand?

1213
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:33,541
But wait, Lucí, if we don't give
this relationship a try,

1214
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:35,333
we'll never know the truth about it.

1215
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,291
But the things that I want…

1216
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,708
don't have anything to do with you.

1217
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,041
I'm sorry, Miguel.

1218
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,250
Goodbye.

1219
01:08:58,416 --> 01:09:00,041
I forgive you.

1220
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,666
My purse.

1221
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,166
I forgot it.

1222
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,000
Thank you.

1223
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:41,750
With your budget and with no paycheck,
this is the best that we can do.

1224
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:44,333
But…

1225
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:47,708
But this is the trash room.
Can we see the whole apartment?

1226
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:49,083
Mm-hmm.

1227
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:51,458
I'll leave you alone
so you can make your decision.

1228
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,750
It's butane.

1229
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:26,541
Come on. Now, now!

1230
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:29,083
Isn't there any other music? No?

1231
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:30,500
What's this?

1232
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,291
God.

1233
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:35,333
Ugh, no!

1234
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:38,583
Too much dirt.
Where is the white part?

1235
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,041
Oh, gross.

1236
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:49,083
That's it.

1237
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:52,250
No. No, it's not.

1238
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:56,958
I hate your fucking music!

1239
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:51,041
No, please, no!

1240
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:55,500
Uh… uh…

1241
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,541
I was just…

1242
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,708
uh…

1243
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,916
Good night.

1244
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:07,250
Tomorrow, you think,
maybe we can eat something?

1245
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,250
-Huh?

1246
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:23,166
Come on, fuck!

1247
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,833
Hmm. Not sure what you want here.

1248
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:27,083
-There's no rush, Paco.
-Shut your mouth.

1249
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:32,666
-Of course it's a woman!

1250
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:33,791
Whoo!

1251
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:38,583
You're pushing it.

1252
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:39,708
Not today.

1253
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:42,250
Hang on tight!

1254
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:52,958
Fuck! All the idiots come out
when I'm driving!

1255
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:57,541
Hurry up, please! Traffic!

1256
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:01,375
-Old man goes slower than molasses!
-Don't you see a walk sign?

1257
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:06,166
Okay.

1258
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:09,166
Paco, take it easy.

1259
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:12,875
Have a look.

1260
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:14,500
Can you see it all right?

1261
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:18,791
With this piece of paper,
I can drive a combat tank.

1262
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:20,291
Hmm? Is that clear?

1263
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,416
-I'm calling the police.
-That's fucking great.

1264
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,583
-Yes, it is fucking great.
-Do it already.

1265
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:27,000
-Would you shut up? I'm dialing.
-Call them, yep.

1266
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:30,291
-Police department.
-There's a woman here and her bus--

1267
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:32,916
My name's Amparo Perez Soria.

1268
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,833
Tell them I'm 48 years old
and I get up at00

1269
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:38,333
every single fucking morning
to drive a bus

1270
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:41,208
among assholes like you
who think they own the road.

1271
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,833
Okay, lady, enough already.

1272
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:44,500
-Paco, please--
-Shut the fuck up.

1273
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:45,916
I can't hear you.

1274
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,583
Tell that when I'm done
after eight hours or so of driving,

1275
01:13:48,666 --> 01:13:50,916
I go home to my house, feed my family,

1276
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,250
help my husband fill out his paperwork,

1277
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:56,625
and listen to all his problems
as if they were my own problems.

1278
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:58,958
-Why the hell are you telling me this?

1279
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:02,041
And when I'm lucky, I fall into bed
at00 for a few hours' sleep,

1280
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:05,083
before I get up to do the whole damn thing
again, and do I complain?

1281
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:07,458
-Do you see me scowling? No.
-Sir?

1282
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:11,458
Why? Because I love my damn job,
and I love my stupid husband.

1283
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:12,583
And what does he do?

1284
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:15,125
He cheats on me
with the fist rich woman he meets,

1285
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:17,458
taking a piss on 25 years of marriage!

1286
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:19,250
-So, yes, yes!

1287
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:21,000
Of course it was a woman driver,

1288
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:24,375
because only a woman is capable
of putting up with all this bullshit!

1289
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:26,291
Sir, hanging up now.

1290
01:14:41,666 --> 01:14:43,250
Dear Amparo,

1291
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:46,916
I never wanted to break up the family.

1292
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:50,500
I don't expect you to forgive me.

1293
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:52,875
I only want to explain

1294
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:55,500
what led me to do what I did to you.

1295
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,416
Dear Sara.

1296
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:31,833
I'm sorry I was so tough on you.

1297
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,958
I've never allowed myself
to make mistakes.

1298
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:38,458
Not me and not the people around me.

1299
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:43,208
Maybe this is why,
when I finally made a mistake,

1300
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:44,916
it was unforgivable.

1301
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:58,375
Dear son,

1302
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:03,041
I hope you know how much I love you.

1303
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:09,750
I also hope you understand
that mothers are also just people.

1304
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:12,750
I have my insecurities,

1305
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:16,333
fears, and flaws too.

1306
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:41,541
Dear Lucía.

1307
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:43,708
I'm sorry.

1308
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:57,583
Watch where you're going, guys.
Be careful!

1309
01:16:57,666 --> 01:16:59,791
TONIGHT YOU'RE MAKING DINNER

1310
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:03,750
Every day is the same, every day.
Every damn day, I tell you!

1311
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:06,125
-Are they yours?
-What did they do now? Nathan!

1312
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:08,083
No, no, they didn't do anything.

1313
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:09,791
Then what is it that you want?

1314
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:14,041
A change.

1315
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:17,333
I need something new.

1316
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:20,416
Got it. Come in. I'll do it.

1317
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,791
Really?

1318
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,083
-All right.
-I'll see you later.

1319
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:26,375
-They're yours, all of them?
-Yeah.

1320
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:33,291
I assume you understand
that after so much time,

1321
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:35,291
you'll have to start at a lower position,

1322
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:39,375
and right now the only open spot
we can offer is Head of Studies.

1323
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:41,791
I understand perfectly.

1324
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:42,916
Good.

1325
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,791
And it's all changed quite a bit.

1326
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:46,750
Yes, it has.

1327
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:52,583
My most rebellious student,
who almost boycotted the Christmas photo,

1328
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:54,000
is the head of the school.

1329
01:17:56,375 --> 01:18:00,500
I meant the online class.
It's all computerized now.

1330
01:18:02,916 --> 01:18:05,875
The books, assignments, lessons.

1331
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:06,833
Everything.

1332
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:10,458
I imagine no more nights
filling out little blue books.

1333
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:12,458
Yeah, that's right.

1334
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:19,041
Shall we check out the tour…
tour your office?

1335
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:20,500
Let's tour the office.

1336
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:23,250
-I'm ready.
-I'm ready when you are.

1337
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:26,166
So it might need
a bit of tidying up.

1338
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:30,666
I'm looking forward to it.

1339
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:33,333
So, I guess, welcome back, then.

1340
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:34,416
Olmedo.

1341
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,666
Hmm?

1342
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:38,625
I'm very proud of you, dear.

1343
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:42,375
Well, yeah, thank you, teach.

1344
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:28,250
Hello, Paco.

1345
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:32,250
Thanks. Put it on my tab.

1346
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:34,208
You're always in such a rush, Lucía.

1347
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:35,583
-Ciao.

1348
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:37,583
You know it. Good morning, Mohamed.

1349
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:39,583
Salam alaikum, Lucía.

1350
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,583
-Hello, girl.
-Lucía.

1351
01:19:44,666 --> 01:19:47,000
-You need a trim already, huh?
-You sure?

1352
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:50,500
Yeah. Come by a little later.
I'll be there.

1353
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,125
Maria?

1354
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,708
-Hi, Maria!
-Hey, Lucía! How's everything?

1355
01:19:58,791 --> 01:19:59,833
I'm getting by.

1356
01:19:59,916 --> 01:20:02,166
-Are you coming to my gig?
-Of course.

1357
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,375
You gotta be there, okay?
Please be there.

1358
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:05,375
Yes, I'll be there.

1359
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:07,125
-Don't miss it.
-I'm off to work.

1360
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:11,333
Hello. Good morning.

1361
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:12,750
Good morning.

1362
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:43,916
Good morning.

1363
01:20:47,416 --> 01:20:49,666
Yesterday, I placed an ad
for a new PE teacher.

1364
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,125
-I'm sorry.
-Why are you sorry?

1365
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:54,416
Because we've already seen 30,
and another 30 are coming. Good luck.

1366
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,375
Hello.

1367
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:03,375
Huh. Must be my first candidate. Hmm.

1368
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:05,583
Gonzalo, is it?

1369
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:08,666
Yes, and I've danced professionally.

1370
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:09,958
You know dance?

1371
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:11,250
Professionally.

1372
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:13,416
I've done courses.

1373
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,666
Psychodance, tantra.

1374
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,291
Can I give you a demonstration?

1375
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,875
Not necessary.

1376
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:26,000
Ah!

1377
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:26,958
Ah-ah-ah!

1378
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:29,291
Okay, well, thanks. We'll call you.

1379
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:31,916
When? When?

1380
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:34,833
You'll love it at this school.

1381
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,291
We have a calendar
just full of activities.

1382
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:38,750
Farms, museums,

1383
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:41,125
and once a year,
we do a trip to Andalucía.

1384
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:42,958
Are you serious? I love Italy.

1385
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:46,000
Ooh. Well, that was great.

1386
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:47,125
We'll call you.

1387
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,708
I'm gonna get a passport.

1388
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:50,000
The door's that way.

1389
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:53,083
-No luck.
-There is one girl left.

1390
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:54,791
Over there.

1391
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:59,875
-Sara!
-Yes, Sara Martinez.

1392
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,833
The poor girl was fired.

1393
01:22:01,916 --> 01:22:04,041
Do you know why?
Because she got pregnant.

1394
01:22:04,125 --> 01:22:06,625
The bastards!
I mean, thoughtless people.

1395
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:07,833
You're pregnant?

1396
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:10,416
Yes, but we don't care
because it's not important.

1397
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,083
Personal matters don't figure
into our hiring criteria

1398
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:15,416
so don't worry about that,
it's not a thing, okay?

1399
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:16,875
You're pregnant.

1400
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:20,583
Lucía, please stop saying that.
It's awkward, so maybe don't say it.

1401
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,166
-Sara!
-Lucía! Please, listen to me.

1402
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:26,208
Pregnant women these days can climb
Mount Everest if they want to, okay?

1403
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:28,916
-This paleolithic attitude doesn't work.
-Sara!

1404
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,208
Lucía!

1405
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:33,458
Please apologize if you catch her,
and hurry, okay?

1406
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:37,875
Eh! We already lost one Zumba teacher.

1407
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:45,458
Sara! Sara!

1408
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:49,250
-Sara!
-What the hell is this?

1409
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:51,708
Sara, please listen to me.

1410
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:55,125
The wedding was a long time ago,
and we need to talk.

1411
01:22:57,666 --> 01:22:59,666
Congratulations on the pregnancy.

1412
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:01,708
Well, I think somebody's losing it.

1413
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:03,666
And now you don't have any work, right?

1414
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,625
-Yeah, you like that?
-No!

1415
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:08,958
From 100 to 200,
I tripled their clients in one year.

1416
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:10,500
Actually, you doubled them.

1417
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:14,208
Then overnight, man,
they just kicked me out.

1418
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:17,250
-I know, dear.
-I've worked so hard all of my life.

1419
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:18,666
-All of it.
-Yeah.

1420
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:20,666
I can't just be a mother, you know that.

1421
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:23,250
There's just no way
that I'm staying at home

1422
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:25,416
changing diapers
and making dinner for your son.

1423
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,291
No, I'm independent, and now I need a job.

1424
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:30,000
That's why I'm helping you out.

1425
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:31,333
-No.
-Yes.

1426
01:23:31,416 --> 01:23:33,166
No, no, no, no way.

1427
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,541
I got plenty of help from you
and my father at the wedding.

1428
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:37,583
-Now, back up, I'm outta here.
-Sara.

1429
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:41,041
The job is still open,
and if you want it, it could be yours.

1430
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:42,208
Permanent contract.

1431
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:44,458
In two years you could be
the department head.

1432
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:48,208
What do you say to your students, Sara?
Look toward a goal and pedal!

1433
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:50,166
Just focus!

1434
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:57,166
A baby. How exciting.

1435
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,291
So, how are you?

1436
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:12,708
Are you handling things, Papa?

1437
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,708
Perfectly, Pablo.

1438
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,083
Can't you see?

1439
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:26,625
The sofa, it's new?

1440
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:27,708
No.

1441
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,875
But I got rid of the cushions.

1442
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:34,125
Want something to drink?

1443
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:37,000
Herbal tea if you have it.

1444
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:39,250
-She likes mint tea.
-Mint tea, mint tea.

1445
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:41,416
That's a great idea, I'll also have one.

1446
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,791
Hmm?

1447
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:46,208
You know, I've been

1448
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,416
reflecting on life.

1449
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,291
So ephemeral, it's ever changing.

1450
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:54,666
Look at Pluto.

1451
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:56,791
One day it's a planet and

1452
01:24:57,583 --> 01:25:02,375
overnight it becomes
nothing but a planetoid.

1453
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:03,833
Oh, poor Pluto.

1454
01:25:03,916 --> 01:25:06,416
Dad, forget about that.

1455
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,500
Come back down to Earth.

1456
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:13,333
You need to get out there,
fix yourself up.

1457
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,458
You're right.

1458
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:20,208
Hey, uh, will you bring some cookies
when you get the tea, please?

1459
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,500
To cheer me up.

1460
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,583
Jeez!

1461
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,583
Is she getting the cookies?

1462
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:48,375
-Oh, wow!
-This is your classroom.

1463
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:51,250
We also use it for concerts, meetings.

1464
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:52,583
Hey, guys.

1465
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:57,625
Okay, I accept.

1466
01:25:57,708 --> 01:26:01,833
But only if you promise my mother
doesn't ever find out we work together.

1467
01:26:01,916 --> 01:26:03,375
You have my word.

1468
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:09,000
And you and me are colleagues,
we're absolutely not friends.

1469
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:10,333
Mm-hmm, yes, of course.

1470
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:15,166
They are all gonna shit.

1471
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:21,833
I'm warning you.

1472
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:25,708
This tiny kid growing inside of me
is the only one to bust my ovaries,

1473
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:27,291
got it?

1474
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:29,625
Tomorrow bring tracksuits to class.

1475
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:32,833
Okay, come on, let's open those chakras
by moving our hips.

1476
01:26:32,916 --> 01:26:34,583
Down here.

1477
01:26:34,666 --> 01:26:37,333
Open your legs,
first the right then the left.

1478
01:26:37,416 --> 01:26:40,958
-One, two,, keep the rhythm, and one, two.

1479
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,875
Mom, I look like Grandma in her nightgown.

1480
01:26:56,958 --> 01:27:01,083
No, you don't.
Grandma doesn't have wings.

1481
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:03,750
Come on!

1482
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:12,500
Excuse me, how much
for a mango and three bananas?

1483
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:14,083
Uh, $4.

1484
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:17,000
Four dollars.

1485
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:18,916
Thanks. Merry Christmas.

1486
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,875
Thank you so much.
Have a wonderful evening with your family.

1487
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:24,166
Thank you.

1488
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:34,083
Okay, yeah.

1489
01:27:36,166 --> 01:27:38,000
Oh, my God.

1490
01:27:40,291 --> 01:27:42,041
Ernesto?

1491
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:45,166
{\an8}"Physics professor, good physique."

1492
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:46,375
{\an8}"Loves to joke." Hmm.

1493
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,333
"I value faithfulness above everything."

1494
01:27:49,416 --> 01:27:51,458
Wow.

1495
01:27:51,541 --> 01:27:52,791
Hmm!

1496
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:55,250
My God.

1497
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:59,250
The butane, finally!

1498
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:04,458
Hi, Mom.

1499
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:10,625
Oh, Pablo, honey!

1500
01:28:12,041 --> 01:28:13,750
What a surprise!

1501
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:16,416
Have a seat.

1502
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,166
Merry Christmas.

1503
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,541
Here.

1504
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:31,666
Want some tea?

1505
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:33,833
Yes, thanks.

1506
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:41,500
"Dear Lucía, I'm sorry."

1507
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:45,791
"I'm sorry I didn't look after you,
listen to or love you."

1508
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:49,208
"I'm sorry I became
what others expected of you,

1509
01:28:49,291 --> 01:28:52,583
without thinking about
what you really wanted."

1510
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:54,125
"You've failed yourself,

1511
01:28:54,208 --> 01:28:59,166
and in a way, you failed your loved ones."

1512
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,125
Nice place you got here.

1513
01:29:12,208 --> 01:29:14,875
A bit on the small side,

1514
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:16,416
but very pretty.

1515
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:21,000
So many things have gone on.

1516
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:22,833
Many, yeah.

1517
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:24,833
I missed you so much.

1518
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,125
Me too.

1519
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:28,041
So much.

1520
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,125
Oh!

1521
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:34,958
-Hey, Mom?
-Yes, honey.

1522
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:39,500
Are you thinking about adopting a cat?

1523
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:40,916
And who's that man?

1524
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,125
A cat?

1525
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,666
No way. With all the work they are,
a cat would be silly.

1526
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,208
-I mean…
-I guess.

1527
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:55,541
{\an8}I'M SORRY AMPARITO

1528
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:58,041
{\an8}If you're here for 207,
I'll let you in around the side.

1529
01:29:58,125 --> 01:29:59,000
{\an8}Got it, lady.

1530
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:11,291
You've got this, Lucía.

1531
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:18,041
Ay-ay-ay! Look at this!

1532
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:19,625
This is gonna be a disaster!

1533
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:22,291
My mom is going to kill me!
How did I agree to this?

1534
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:23,250
And it's

1535
01:30:23,916 --> 01:30:26,250
Christmas Eve! We have to cancel.
Pablo, Pablo!

1536
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:29,000
How about you call your mom,
I call my mom, and we cancel it?

1537
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:30,000
Sit down, my love.

1538
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:33,583
They're going to be here in ten minutes
and we've taken all the school stuff away.

1539
01:30:33,666 --> 01:30:34,916
Just a minute.

1540
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:37,541
Ah, yes.

1541
01:30:37,625 --> 01:30:39,125
A school Christmas photo.

1542
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:43,208
Everything's in order.

1543
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:47,541
Thirty-five minutes, grill mode is set.

1544
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:51,416
It's all under control, my sister.

1545
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,125
We've got a pizza pepperoni,
when we're done it's DJ Toni.

1546
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:56,458
This is gonna be a disaster.

1547
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:58,375
Check out my scratching,
you're gonna love it.

1548
01:30:58,458 --> 01:30:59,833
Do-it-do-it!

1549
01:30:59,916 --> 01:31:02,833
Eeeeeee!

1550
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:12,291
-Was that the soup?
-What soup? No way.

1551
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:15,708
Yep, total disaster.

1552
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:18,166
No, no, honey.
Everything's going to be great.

1553
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,458
Plus we have reinforcements.
Father Custodio.

1554
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:23,208
This is only a dinner,
it's not an exorcism.

1555
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:26,000
Yes, but it was also only a wedding.

1556
01:31:26,083 --> 01:31:27,625
I see your point there.

1557
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:31,916
They're here.

1558
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,083
Keep breathing.

1559
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,958
Hello.

1560
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:39,083
Hello.

1561
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:40,250
Merry Christmas.

1562
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:41,375
Merry Christmas.

1563
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:43,875
I brought this for you.

1564
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,208
That smells really good.

1565
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,958
It's a bottle of wine.

1566
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,375
Come inside.

1567
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:54,333
-Hi.
-Hi.

1568
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:56,666
I'm glad you're here, Mom.

1569
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:58,375
Me too.

1570
01:31:58,458 --> 01:31:59,958
You guys look very festive.

1571
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:02,125
I don't know how to open this thing up.

1572
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:05,958
-I believe the opener's in the drawer.

1573
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:12,625
Oh, look!

1574
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:14,958
What a lovely Christmas card.

1575
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:15,958
How nice.

1576
01:32:16,041 --> 01:32:19,166
I should set it out
so everyone can enjoy it.

1577
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,541
It's beautiful!

1578
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:23,208
Well, look at her. She cut all her hair!

1579
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:25,500
It's the eastern star
that brought the wise men.

1580
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:27,291
Do you think it's genetic, Ernesto?

1581
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:30,208
Tell me, who's your hairdresser?
Nope? No idea?

1582
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,666
Welcome, Mikey.

1583
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:42,791
Your haircut's nice, it looks good on you,
but I prefer it a little longer.

1584
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:44,333
You missed the boat now.

1585
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,083
-Lucía.
-You're already here.

1586
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:49,041
She's single, right?

1587
01:32:49,125 --> 01:32:52,208
I came to help out in the kitchen,
and guess what happened?

1588
01:32:52,291 --> 01:32:54,791
Right out front
I found a huge parking spot.

1589
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:57,291
-Great, that's really lucky.
-Hello.

1590
01:32:57,375 --> 01:33:00,625
Would have been here sooner, but
some asshole took up two parking spaces.

1591
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:04,000
Wait, can I help?

1592
01:33:04,083 --> 01:33:05,291
-Dad.
-My girl.

1593
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:07,791
-How are things?
-What can I tell you, honey?

1594
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,375
I'm okay, hmm?

1595
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:11,833
-You just relax, I'm here to help.
-Mm-hmm.

1596
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:15,708
Last night your mother,
she sent me a goodnight text message.

1597
01:33:16,375 --> 01:33:20,000
Well, it was only an emoji,
but it was that nice smiley one?

1598
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:24,416
Oh, and of course I wrote
a little conciliatory speech

1599
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,541
to celebrate the miraculous birth of…

1600
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:28,833
Jesus Christ!

1601
01:33:28,916 --> 01:33:31,458
I almost twisted my ankle on the doormat.

1602
01:33:34,541 --> 01:33:37,208
You have busted out there, Mama.

1603
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:51,458
Wow.

1604
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:52,833
I'm so happy.

1605
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:56,375
Thanks for keeping
the family tradition, Amparo.

1606
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:11,041
Well, who's ready to eat?

1607
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:19,958
Pablo, honey.

1608
01:34:23,666 --> 01:34:27,000
Hey, let's behave, if nothing else,
for the kids, they've made such an effort.

1609
01:34:27,083 --> 01:34:28,166
Hmm.

1610
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:30,125
I'm the one making an effort,

1611
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,875
here having dinner with your ex.

1612
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:35,291
With whose ex?

1613
01:34:35,375 --> 01:34:36,875
She's my ex.

1614
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:40,041
And besides, we're just on a break.

1615
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:41,583
What?

1616
01:34:41,666 --> 01:34:42,875
Oh, no?

1617
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:44,333
-No.
-Oh.

1618
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:46,041
The vol-au-vents!

1619
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:51,000
Well, honey,
tell us about your new school.

1620
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:53,166
We haven't heard anything.

1621
01:34:53,916 --> 01:34:55,250
Probably Dad…

1622
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:57,958
Dad wants, Dad wants tonight…

1623
01:34:58,041 --> 01:35:01,500
-Dad wants tonight, to begin the night…
-The photo.

1624
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:02,916
…with a speech I've written.

1625
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,291
-Sure.
-I wrote it myself.

1626
01:35:05,375 --> 01:35:07,583
And it goes like this.

1627
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:10,500
"Tonight is Christmas Eve,
a very special night,

1628
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:12,916
that I can't imagine spending
without my family."

1629
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,083
Excuse me.

1630
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,791
-Fuck, Ernesto.
-This is…

1631
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:18,541
-I'm going. Can I go?
-"Though…"

1632
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:21,958
-Get it.
-"…a rough year of highs and lows,

1633
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:23,583
comings and goings,

1634
01:35:23,666 --> 01:35:27,291
I know that if this family
was a cabin…"

1635
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:28,791
-Not that.
-"…it would be a cabin

1636
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:31,375
that's connected
with firmly joined blocks."

1637
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:33,208
Ah!

1638
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:35,750
-"A cabin that, with patience…"
-The photo.

1639
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:37,583
-"…and understanding…"
-The photo!

1640
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:39,750
-"…I know it will survive…"
-Oh, the photo!

1641
01:35:39,833 --> 01:35:41,875
-"…any storm it comes across."
-What a poem.

1642
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:43,333
"Of this I am convinced."

1643
01:35:43,416 --> 01:35:44,916
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes, yes, yes!

1644
01:35:45,916 --> 01:35:48,708
-Yes?
-He's sure of it. Otherwise, he…

1645
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:49,750
wouldn't have said it.

1646
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:52,666
-Yes, that's right.

1647
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:53,833
What's that music?

1648
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:57,000
It was my phone, it was my phone,
just my phone.

1649
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:58,916
But I'm not answering it, no way,

1650
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,750
because that would be disrespectful
to the Christmas speech.

1651
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:05,583
Even if they discovered life on Mars,
life on Mars…

1652
01:36:05,666 --> 01:36:06,875
There's life on Mars.

1653
01:36:06,958 --> 01:36:11,250
Please sit down at the table then,
before these volcanoes get cold.

1654
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:12,833
Volcanoes? Vol-au-vents.

1655
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:16,166
-Throw that…?
-Do me a favor and sit down.

1656
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:20,875
I hope that you liked it because
I wrote it with my heart on my sleeve.

1657
01:36:24,916 --> 01:36:26,333
What are you doing?

1658
01:36:26,416 --> 01:36:29,541
-Breathe. You're going to choke.
-I think I'm dying, Mom.

1659
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:32,875
Because my heart is
the only thing that I have…

1660
01:36:32,958 --> 01:36:34,666
Honey, can I have a little bit more soup?

1661
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:37,916
No.

1662
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,416
No, I can't have more soup?

1663
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:42,625
No, Mom, how could I not give you soup?

1664
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:44,750
-Come on.
-You don't want soup, Mom.

1665
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:45,791
Hmm-mm.

1666
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:48,875
-That soup looks lovely.
-I don't want it!

1667
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:52,125
-I stuck my fingers in it before.
-Are there shrimp in it?

1668
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:53,416
Oh, boy.

1669
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:57,958
-Why?
-Honey, no more, that's enough.

1670
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:01,125
-Delicious.
-I'm finding you all the best bits, Mom.

1671
01:37:01,208 --> 01:37:03,375
More soup, more soup!

1672
01:37:03,458 --> 01:37:04,625
Enough, already.

1673
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:05,875
Done.

1674
01:37:07,166 --> 01:37:08,625
-No!
-Oh, fuck.

1675
01:37:09,583 --> 01:37:10,500
Hmm.

1676
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:13,250
I knew it, I knew it.

1677
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:15,416
I knew that I'd get dirty.

1678
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:17,833
Shit, I'm going to the bathroom.

1679
01:37:17,916 --> 01:37:18,916
This is bad.

1680
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:23,875
You're welcome.
We dodged that bullet, didn't we?

1681
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:28,458
Who's going in there?

1682
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:32,208
Fine, I'll go.

1683
01:37:32,291 --> 01:37:35,375
You, my son, have sawdust for brains.

1684
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:37,333
What did I do now?

1685
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:48,666
-Amparo.
-Yes?

1686
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:52,833
I need to tell you something
very, very, very important.

1687
01:37:52,916 --> 01:37:54,125
What?

1688
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,166
It won't come out.

1689
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,875
I mean the stain, it won't come out.

1690
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:01,708
It has fat in it, so it won't come out.

1691
01:38:01,791 --> 01:38:03,708
-Let me.
-No, no, no, leave me. Stop.

1692
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:06,208
-Leave me alone!
-Let me tell you what to do.

1693
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:11,541
-Leave me alone!
-Come on!

1694
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:12,916
-Stop it!

1695
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,541
-What's a shower doing in here?
-Just listen to me.

1696
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:17,875
Go back and sit down
and I'll hold your bag for you.

1697
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:19,375
You're completely insane.

1698
01:38:27,208 --> 01:38:28,458
Are you serious?

1699
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:30,750
All this shit to give me a Christmas card?

1700
01:38:31,625 --> 01:38:33,000
Fuck.

1701
01:38:33,083 --> 01:38:34,875
You posh chicks.

1702
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:38,708
This isn't good.
Things are gonna get so messy.

1703
01:38:38,791 --> 01:38:40,166
What is this?

1704
01:38:43,166 --> 01:38:44,291
What do you think?

1705
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,791
Come on, I can't believe this.
No way.

1706
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:51,500
What's so hard to believe?

1707
01:38:51,583 --> 01:38:52,750
It's perfectly simple.

1708
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:55,541
-This is Sara, this is Lucía.

1709
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:58,500
They're in school, working together.

1710
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:01,500
It's like…

1711
01:39:02,541 --> 01:39:03,666
Mom, I'm sorry.

1712
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:07,375
I was going to tell you.

1713
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:17,291
And you… you knew about this?

1714
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:23,583
-And you bitch!
-Mom!

1715
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:25,750
First you steal my husband
and then my daughter?

1716
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:28,291
Mama, don't!
Lucía was only trying to help out!

1717
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:31,125
Help? And sleeping
with your father was to help?!

1718
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:32,333
No, Amparo! Amparo!

1719
01:39:32,416 --> 01:39:34,208
You got carried away
and you fucked us all!

1720
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:36,916
-Mom!
-Would you pass the prawns?

1721
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,333
No!

1722
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:41,208
And you know what?

1723
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:45,375
It's for the best this happened to us,
and to you too, Ernesto.

1724
01:39:45,458 --> 01:39:48,291
-One day you'll realize that.
-So I'm gonna have to be grateful as well?

1725
01:39:48,375 --> 01:39:49,666
Let her go.

1726
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:55,541
-Do you know why I lost interest?
-This is not the time for this.

1727
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:59,000
Because when we had Pablo,
your life never changed.

1728
01:39:59,083 --> 01:40:01,250
You just kept going on the same way.

1729
01:40:01,333 --> 01:40:03,375
And mine completely changed.

1730
01:40:03,458 --> 01:40:06,041
I devoted myself to helping you
with your career

1731
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:07,833
and taking care of our son.

1732
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:09,541
Well,

1733
01:40:10,375 --> 01:40:12,875
this is exactly
what I didn't want to happen,

1734
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:15,833
to throw this in your face,
because I've had a good life

1735
01:40:15,916 --> 01:40:19,083
and I chose what I thought
was best for everyone.

1736
01:40:19,166 --> 01:40:20,625
I was good.

1737
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:24,250
Better than good, I was great.

1738
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:26,833
I was the perfect wife.

1739
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:30,166
People always said, "I'm jealous,"
and "you're so lucky."

1740
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:33,166
I believed it.

1741
01:40:34,541 --> 01:40:36,875
All that time,
do you know what happened to me?

1742
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:41,125
I disappeared.

1743
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:43,583
I forgot myself.

1744
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:49,083
I quit my job, and you know what, Sara?
I was passionate about my job.

1745
01:40:49,166 --> 01:40:50,583
I really loved it.

1746
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:53,041
I liked living and I like making mistakes,

1747
01:40:53,125 --> 01:40:55,375
having problems that count.

1748
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:01,291
Because to know who I am,

1749
01:41:01,375 --> 01:41:02,958
and I was feeling so lost,

1750
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:05,125
I have to make mistakes
and get into trouble

1751
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:06,833
and have my own problems.

1752
01:41:08,541 --> 01:41:11,250
And that's why I don't regret
anything that happened,

1753
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:15,333
because I have discovered…
I have discovered who I am.

1754
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:18,916
Now when I look in the mirror,

1755
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:21,625
I see myself.

1756
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
That's why I can't,

1757
01:41:25,083 --> 01:41:26,458
I can't,

1758
01:41:26,541 --> 01:41:30,750
and I don't want to go there again.

1759
01:41:33,916 --> 01:41:35,125
Now it's my turn.

1760
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,625
And hey, maybe you're horrified
by this new Lucía,

1761
01:41:41,666 --> 01:41:43,000
but it's who I am.

1762
01:41:44,541 --> 01:41:45,666
It's who I am.

1763
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:48,333
I don't want to disappear again.

1764
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:53,750
Because I disappeared,
I hid, I hid for 50 fucking years.

1765
01:41:55,666 --> 01:41:58,000
And I can't believe
that I'm seriously saying this

1766
01:41:58,083 --> 01:42:00,208
to five grown adults dressed as elves.

1767
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:03,333
Merry Christmas.

1768
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:06,500
Merry Christmas, sweet Lucía.

1769
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,500
No one's getting up?

1770
01:42:11,583 --> 01:42:12,791
Uh…

1771
01:42:12,875 --> 01:42:13,958
I'll go.

1772
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:32,208
Lucí! Stop, unless you want me
to fall over.

1773
01:42:32,291 --> 01:42:33,750
She's funny.

1774
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:36,333
-Sh!

1775
01:42:38,375 --> 01:42:39,791
No, please don't leave now.

1776
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:41,541
You just got a little carried away.

1777
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:44,791
Look at me, I'm Scorpio.
I'm always getting carried away.

1778
01:42:44,875 --> 01:42:46,416
Thank you, from the heart.

1779
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,208
The only thing I'm sorry about
is hurting you,

1780
01:42:49,291 --> 01:42:51,083
-how much I hurt you.
-Is the lady okay?

1781
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:52,500
-Ah!
-That much?

1782
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:55,666
-I think my water broke.
-Really? That's great.

1783
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:56,833
It's great?

1784
01:42:56,916 --> 01:42:58,916
Well, it really, really hurts!

1785
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:00,833
Come on.

1786
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,208
It's gonna be okay.

1787
01:43:04,291 --> 01:43:06,250
-Breathe.
-Breathe.

1788
01:43:06,333 --> 01:43:07,416
Two aspirin?

1789
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:10,000
Maternity's in this direction.

1790
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:12,833
Ow! Have you gone crazy?

1791
01:43:12,916 --> 01:43:16,250
-Please shut up. I am done with your shit.
-Ow!

1792
01:43:47,916 --> 01:43:51,583
Hey, what if all the drama
has caused the birth to be premature?

1793
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:54,916
Well, she's already nine months' pregnant.

1794
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:59,375
Wanna meet her?

1795
01:44:02,791 --> 01:44:04,708
Yes, uh, it isn't…

1796
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:06,916
Now, huh?

1797
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:13,750
Surprise.

1798
01:44:13,833 --> 01:44:15,000
Oh, Trini!

1799
01:44:15,083 --> 01:44:16,541
Ma'am.

1800
01:44:17,291 --> 01:44:18,458
The boy is a father.

1801
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:20,916
The flowers are lovely. Come in, please.

1802
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:23,500
-Hello.
-Hi, Trini.

1803
01:44:23,583 --> 01:44:25,208
Isn't she just the sweetest?

1804
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:29,833
Oh, she looks a bit like me.
Don't say she doesn't.

1805
01:44:29,916 --> 01:44:31,416
The eyes.

1806
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,458
She has your eyes, my love.

1807
01:44:34,875 --> 01:44:37,791
Looks like you're really great
at everything, eh, sis?

1808
01:44:37,875 --> 01:44:39,875
Toni, do you wanna hold your goddaughter?

1809
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:42,416
-No, no, no.
-Cradle the head right, Toni.

1810
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,583
-Be careful.
-Cradle it.

1811
01:44:43,666 --> 01:44:46,583
-Hand under the neck.
-Her neck, arms facing downward.

1812
01:44:46,666 --> 01:44:48,166
-Lift her slowly.
-There.

1813
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,958
-There.
-You got it, there.

1814
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,041
She looks like your godfather.

1815
01:44:53,125 --> 01:44:54,791
-How are you, baby?
-Ooh!

1816
01:44:54,875 --> 01:44:56,916
-No, no!
-I was joking.

1817
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:00,416
Why don't you hand her
to her grandmother?

1818
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,625
-Yes.
-This is Alex.

1819
01:45:01,708 --> 01:45:03,541
-Oh, come here, Alex.
-Alex?

1820
01:45:03,625 --> 01:45:05,708
-Oh, she's beautiful.
-Hello, Alex. Hello, Alex.

1821
01:45:05,791 --> 01:45:07,666
You are so tiny!

1822
01:45:08,375 --> 01:45:09,708
She looks like an atom, no?

1823
01:45:09,791 --> 01:45:13,375
No, not an atom.
She's a subatomic particle.

1824
01:45:13,458 --> 01:45:16,291
-Do you wanna hold her?
-No, no, no.

1825
01:45:16,375 --> 01:45:18,791
Oh, she's hungry.

1826
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:22,458
-Well, and a photo for prosperity, yeah?
-Go ahead.

1827
01:45:22,541 --> 01:45:25,125
Will you take it, Trini?
Godfather in the middle.

1828
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:26,333
Okay.

1829
01:45:26,416 --> 01:45:28,791
Just a minute. Hmm.

1830
01:45:28,875 --> 01:45:30,166
-Something there?
-No.

1831
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:31,416
Yeah.

1832
01:45:33,791 --> 01:45:36,125
Okay. All together.

1833
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,375
Move closer.

1834
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,125
I'm cutting off the heads.

1835
01:45:46,666 --> 01:45:48,166
Mama!

1836
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:50,125
-Papa!
-Oh!

1837
01:45:50,833 --> 01:45:52,291
Okay.

1838
01:45:52,375 --> 01:45:53,250
Nice.

1839
01:45:54,708 --> 01:45:56,416
-Very pretty.

1840
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,208
Hmm.

1841
01:45:58,958 --> 01:46:02,291
Come on, come on, come on.
We have so much to do today.

1842
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:03,416
Uh-huh.

1843
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,625
First we have to go to work.

1844
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:08,250
And then,

1845
01:46:08,333 --> 01:46:11,041
we have the counselor's meeting.

1846
01:46:12,041 --> 01:46:16,208
I know, you're going to behave, right?
Are you going to be a good girl?

1847
01:46:16,291 --> 01:46:17,291
Yes!

1848
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:21,666
You're the best girl, right?

1849
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:24,500
You're very good, very good.

1850
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:26,458
I'll show you off to my friends

1851
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:29,625
and they'll tell me you are
the most beautiful baby ever.

1852
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:31,083
Yes, yes!

1853
01:46:31,166 --> 01:46:34,208
Guess who's going to a big girls' night?

1854
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:36,541
Yeah?

1855
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:37,916
And the best part is that…

1856
01:46:45,208 --> 01:46:46,875
Yes, because you have good friends.

1857
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:48,875
Has your mom taught you to Zumba?

1858
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:50,541
Your grandma can do the Zumba.

1859
01:46:50,625 --> 01:46:51,916
Yes, I can do that!

1860
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,750
Do you want to Zumba?

1861
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,625
I'll teach you. We'll be fantastic.

1862
01:46:57,708 --> 01:46:58,916
Better than even your mom!

1863
01:47:01,375 --> 01:47:06,083
