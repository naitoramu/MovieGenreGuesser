1
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:05,506
We are so in luck!

2
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,550
Treeger said we could have
all this cool stuff!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,427
Wait right there.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,556
Oh, no. I'm paddling away.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,105
Really? We got all this
rusty crap for free?

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:27,777
This and a bunch of bubble wrap.
And some of it is not even popped.

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,830
Could we be more white trash?

8
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,291
The One with the 'Cuffs

9
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,839
How desperate am I?

10
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,968
Good thing Chandler's not here.
He always wins at this game.

11
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,512
I just told my mom
I'd cater her party.

12
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,638
How come?

13
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,015
I need the money.

14
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:42,895
It'd be a great way to get rid of
that last smidgen of self-respect.

15
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,855
I think this is a good thing.

16
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,942
Mom wouldn't have hired you
if you weren't good.

17
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:54,657
You don't have to stick up for her.
She can't hear you.

18
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,076
Do you have any juice?

19
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,162
Just pickle.

20
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:04,708
Funny story.
I bumped into Joanna yesterday.

21
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,544
My boss, Joanna?
That must have been awkward.

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,965
Actually, she asked me
if I wanted a drink.

23
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:16,720
You didn't say yes to that,
did you?

24
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,642
Hello, Rachel.

25
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,230
Well, not at first.

26
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,859
What is she doing here?

27
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,617
Last time you went out with her
you said she was a dud!

28
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:45,207
I judged her too quickly.
This time, we took it to the next level.

29
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:51,422
Last time I almost got fired.
You must end it. You must end it now.

30
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,799
It's not an everyday occurrence!

31
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:58,053
Usually I'm in there by myself.

32
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,854
Promise me you will end it.

33
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,940
- I promise. I'll end it.
- Thank you.

34
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,234
I hope you know what I'm giving up.

35
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:17,739
She's not just the boss in your office.
You know what I mean?

36
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,079
Sorry.
I knew what he meant.

37
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,918
How's the hired help?

38
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,546
Doing great.
Quiches are coming along.

39
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,841
What's this?
Blue nail polish?

40
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,759
I thought it was cute.

41
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,807
It's what your grandmother's hands
looked like when we found her.

42
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,810
Let me ask you a question.

43
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,436
Why did you hire me?

44
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,481
Richard raved about
the food at his party...

45
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,317
...but you were sleeping with him.

46
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,945
Then I heard the food at that
lesbian wedding was nice.

47
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,990
I assume you didn't sleep
with anyone there.

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,035
At least that would be something.

49
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,039
Oh, my God!
Did you hear that?

50
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,293
She hired me because
she thinks I'm good.

51
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,754
I didn't hear that.

52
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,132
She didn't hire me out of pity.

53
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:22,721
It wasn't so she could pick on me.
She actually thinks I'm good.

54
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,975
And hey, it's cool
if you're a lesbian.

55
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:45,994
Good afternoon. Are you
the decision-maker of the house?

56
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,418
Do you currently own
a set of encyclopedias?

57
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,590
No, but try the classifieds.
People sell everything in there.

58
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,634
Actually, I'm not buying.
I'm selling.

59
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,011
Let me ask you one question.

60
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,723
Do your friends ever have
a conversation...

61
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:12,021
...and you just nod along,
not sure what they're talking about?

62
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:20,529
I'm telling you,
it's totally unconstitutional.

63
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,076
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.

64
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,875
It was like the
Algonquin kids' table.

65
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,004
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

66
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,257
You haven't said anything
for about two minutes.

67
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,677
Are you at all interested?

68
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,680
Come on in.

69
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,225
- That's weird.
- What?

70
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,393
Your nails.

71
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:56,189
I wore fake ones so my mom wouldn't
give me grief about biting them.

72
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,487
I meant, it's weird that
you only have nine now.

73
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,948
Oh, my God!

74
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,534
Wait a minute.

75
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,493
I had them when I put...

76
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,622
Oh, my God!
It's in the quiche!

77
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,874
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, don't panic.

78
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,126
I'll go buy you a new set of nails.

79
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,422
No one will know,
and you'll look great!

80
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:26,053
It's because they're going to eat...
That's the problem.

81
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,515
Honey, don't bite your nails.

82
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,519
Please don't freak out.

83
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:37,064
There's a blue fingernail
in one of the quiche cups.

84
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:41,318
And there's no way to know which one.

85
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,531
And whoever finds it wins the prize!

86
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,075
I'm not freaking out.

87
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:52,830
- Why are you laughing?
- Now your father owes me $5.

88
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,373
You bet I'd lose a nail?

89
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,001
Don't be silly.
I just bet that I'd need these.

90
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,505
Frozen lasagnas?

91
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,049
You bet that I'd screw up?

92
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,843
All that stuff about how I was good...

93
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,470
No, that was all true.

94
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,890
This was just in case
you "pulled a Monica".

95
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,644
You promised Dr. Weinberg
you'd never use that phrase.

96
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,771
Come on.
Have a sense of humor.

97
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,440
You're never able to
laugh at yourself.

98
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,776
That's right.

99
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:27,364
My mom has no faith in me!
That's hilarious!

100
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,951
I don't get it.

101
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,869
No. I have faith.

102
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,457
No. You have lasagnas!

103
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,758
The ruined quiches are ready!

104
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,727
It just doesn't feel like
we're breaking up.

105
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:01,356
No, we are.
I'm sad.

106
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,992
Can you wait till tomorrow?
All right.

107
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,244
Unbelievable!

108
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,955
Thanks.

109
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:20,793
That was my boss.
I have to go.

110
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,544
What are you doing?

111
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,005
- I'm getting dressed.
- Why?

112
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,717
When I walk outside naked,
people throw garbage.

113
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,970
Wait.
I want to show you something.

114
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,431
What is it?

115
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,558
Just a little gag gift
somebody gave me.

116
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,978
Put your hands together.

117
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:43,357
You're not the boss of me.

118
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,860
Yeah, you are.

119
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,698
Saucy!

120
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,997
I'll be back in two minutes.

121
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,333
You're going to leave me like this?

122
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:06,171
Knowing you're here waiting for me.
I think it's exciting, don't you?

123
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,882
If you don't come back soon...

124
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:13,553
...there's pretty much
nothing I can do about it!

125
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,516
I brought you back a macaroon.

126
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:22,271
Great. I'll keep it in
my butt with your nose.

127
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,736
That's weird.
She locked the door.

128
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,948
You know why? She's got
the bonus list in there.

129
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,742
I saw her working on it today.

130
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,411
Swear you won't tell.

131
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,622
When Mark left, he gave me
a key to her office.

132
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:44,168
You want to see the list?

133
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,850
How are you?

134
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,249
Hello, Joanna...

135
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:29,672
- office.

136
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,174
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'll be a little longer.</i>

137
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,968
- How little?
<i>- A couple hours.</i>

138
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,555
This isn't funny.
Get back here now!

139
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,930
<i>- I can't!</i>
- Why not?

140
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,974
<i>I'm in my boss' car.</i>

141
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:44,478
- What?
<i>- Tunnel!</i>

142
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:01,662
What?

143
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:06,125
<i>Rachel, could I see you</i>
<i>for a moment?</i>

144
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,508
Okay, here's the situation.

145
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,052
The keys to the cuffs
are on the door.

146
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,512
Could you be a doll...

147
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:23,141
...and grab them and
scoot on over here and unlock me?

148
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:28,606
And on a totally separate subject,
that's a lovely pantsuit.

149
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,443
You promised you would
break up with her.

150
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:38,365
I did break up with her!
She just took it really, really well!

151
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,536
Jeopardizing my career
never entered your mind?

152
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,162
It did enter my mind.

153
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:49,919
But then something happened
that made it shoot right out.

154
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:55,173
You got yourself into those cuffs,
you get yourself out.

155
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,051
I can't get myself right out of them.

156
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:02,097
You must have me confused with
the "Amazing Chandler"!

157
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:08,144
Unlock me! She could be gone
for hours, and I'm cold and...

158
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,773
All right! This is it!

159
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,776
Never see her again.

160
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,069
Never!

161
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,779
Never come in here again.

162
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,322
Fine!

163
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:22,034
Give me back my Walkman!

164
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:25,120
I never borrowed it.

165
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,080
Then I lost it.
Buy me one!

166
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:32,086
You got it! Here we go!
Come on. This is great!

167
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,005
Does it hurt?

168
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:40,677
No, I always see guys do this
when handcuffs are taken off.

169
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,431
Hello, sweet pants!

170
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,142
Wait!
What will you tell Joanna?

171
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,226
About what?

172
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:53,023
She'll see you're gone and know
I let you out, and I'll get fired!

173
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,150
I'll tell a lie!
I'm good at lying!

174
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,652
I actually did borrow your Walkman!

175
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,739
She'll know I have
a key to her office.

176
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,658
I've got to lock you back up.

177
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,912
I don't think so.

178
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,050
This is much better.

179
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,721
Here's somebody interesting.

180
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,807
What do you know about Van Gogh?

181
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,643
- He cut off his ear.
- And?

182
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,728
I'm out.

183
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:35,107
He painted that.

184
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,609
That's pretty nice.

185
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,737
I thought he cut off his ear
because he sucked.

186
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:43,032
- What else you got in there?
- Let's see...

187
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:47,161
- Where does the Pope live?
- In the woods.

188
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,497
Wait, that's the joke answer.

189
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,916
Actually, it's Vatican City.

190
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:56,796
Now, what do you know about
vulcanized rubber?

191
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,465
Spock's birth control.

192
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,720
You need these books.

193
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,686
This used to be your room?

194
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:17,941
You must have been in
really good shape as a kid.

195
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,403
I'm such an idiot!

196
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,614
I can't believe I thought
she could change.

197
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,451
Who cares what your mom thinks?

198
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,746
So you "pulled a Monica".

199
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,165
I'm glad that's catching on.

200
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:37,502
Why does that have to be a bad thing?
Just change what it means.

201
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,380
Prove your mother wrong.

202
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,968
You finish the job, and
we'll call that "pulling a Monica".

203
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,720
What?

204
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:52,559
If a kid gets straight A's, his
parents say, "You pulled a Monica".

205
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:57,981
A fireman saves a baby,
and they go, "He pulled a Monica".

206
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,361
Someone hits a homer, and they say,
"That one's out of here".

207
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:06,240
Because some things don't change.

208
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,576
All right.
I'll go down there.

209
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:13,788
I won't serve the lasagna.
I'll serve what I make.

210
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,800
My breasts are really strong.

211
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,727
I have to get you locked back up.
I'm so going to lose my job!

212
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,814
She's very private about her office!

213
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,149
Now I know why!

214
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,277
You're in trouble either way.

215
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,738
If she sees me locked to this...

216
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:51,202
...she'll know you were here.
You might as well let me go.

217
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:56,206
- I'll clean your bathroom for a month.
- Still won't be clean.

218
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,043
All I want is my freedom.

219
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,087
- Foot rubs for a month!
- Freedom!

220
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:06,132
- I'll put all your photos into albums!
- I want my freedom!

221
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,844
Why won't you hear me!
Sophie, help me!

222
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,306
Sophie, sit!

223
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,434
Would you just calm down?!

224
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:25,027
I'm going to say this
for the last time.

225
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:28,947
Would you please just...

226
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:36,246
There's a lot I didn't know
about vomit.

227
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:41,251
In a minute.

228
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,961
So what do you say?

229
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:46,841
You get the whole set
of encyclopedias for $1200.

230
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,968
That works out to
just 50 bucks a book.

231
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,347
$1200?

232
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,308
You think I have $1200?

233
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,185
I'm home during the day...

234
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:02,481
...and I got patio furniture
in my living room.

235
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:06,360
There's a few things
you don't get from book learning.

236
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,862
Well, what can you swing?

237
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:13,950
How about zero down and zero a month
for a long, long time?

238
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,537
You don't have anything?

239
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,123
You want to see what I got?

240
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,418
I got a baby Tootsie Roll...

241
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:27,631
...a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex...

242
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,925
...a rock...

243
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,803
...and an army man.

244
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:37,099
Okay, I get the picture.
Thanks for your time.

245
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,518
And a fifty.

246
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,271
These must be Chandler's pants.

247
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,481
For $50 you can get one book.

248
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,484
What will it be?
A? B? C?

249
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,319
I'll stick with the V.

250
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,033
I want to see how
this bad boy turns out.

251
00:17:56,076 --> 00:18:01,206
I will buy and wrap
all of your Christmas gifts!

252
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:05,001
I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice
every morning!

253
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:08,130
With extra pulp?

254
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,385
I've got it!

255
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,804
You don't have it.

256
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,306
I have so got it!

257
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,477
There will be rumors about this.
No way to stop it.

258
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,729
Sophie, Monica and Phoebe know.

259
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:27,107
- How do they know?
- I called them.

260
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,568
When they ask me what I saw...

261
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:34,448
...I can be very generous...

262
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:38,285
...or very stingy.

263
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,329
Go on.

264
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,998
I can make you a legend.

265
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:47,794
I can make you
this generation's Milton Berle.

266
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:53,092
- And Milton Berle has...
- Not compared to you.

267
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,639
They're not even
touching the lasagna.

268
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,100
They love your casserole!

269
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,605
It's hard to believe
a while ago this was just ingredients.

270
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,234
Everyone seems to like your dish.

271
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,902
And you?

272
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,863
I thought it was...

273
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,616
...quite tasty.

274
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,744
So if everyone liked it,
and you liked it...

275
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,372
...that would make this a success.
Which would make you...

276
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:27,084
A bitch?

277
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:31,546
I meant "wrong",
but we can use your word.

278
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,008
Yes, well, I was wrong.

279
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:37,011
And I have to say...

280
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,765
...you really impressed me today.

281
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:46,937
You might even say that she
"pulled a Monica".

282
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,275
She doesn't know we switched it.

283
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:55,279
And the next time you cater for me...

284
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,866
...there will be nothing but ice
in the freezer.

285
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,951
That really means a lot.

286
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,913
Mom, don't bite your nails!

287
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,840
Hello, Chandler.

288
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,011
I love you.

289
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,097
What's going on?

290
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,811
No, he doesn't!

291
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:32,441
Two hours, that lasted.

292
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,360
So did you break up with Joanna?

293
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,861
I think so.

294
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:40,824
It's good you got out,
before she blew up like Vesuvius.

295
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,617
The volcano?

296
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:49,416
Speaking of volcanoes, man, are they
a violent igneous rock formation!

297
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,794
Lava spewing, hot ash.

298
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,797
Of course, some are dormant.

299
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:58,092
Why are you talking about volcanoes
all of a sudden?

300
00:20:58,342 --> 00:20:59,385
We don't have to.

301
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:03,097
What do you want to talk about?
Vivisection?

302
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,766
The vas deferens?

303
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,935
The Vietnam War?

304
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:13,023
Did anyone see that documentary
on the Korean War?

305
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,442
Korea's a beautiful country.

306
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,528
With such a sad history.

307
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,074
Could there be more Kims?

308
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,334
- Who's out there?
- Me! Good morning!

309
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,419
Could you come in here, please?

310
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,798
Sure! They didn't have
poppyseed bagels...

311
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:41,885
...so I have sesame...
Oh, my word!

312
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,890
I've had a slight office mishap.

313
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,644
Could you get the key for me?

314
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,776
So sorry!

315
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:03,573
Tell your friend Chandler we're
definitely broken up now!
