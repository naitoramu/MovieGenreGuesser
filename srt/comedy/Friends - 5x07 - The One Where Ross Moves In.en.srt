1
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,758
Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,385
No, look.

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,429
That's a pig.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,892
I know.
But look at the knobs on it!

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,190
Emily's cousin kicked me out.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,524
- What?
- Why?

7
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,444
When you sublet
from your wife's cousin...

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,781
...then you divorce, sometimes
the cousin wants his apartment back.

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,492
Didn't you sign a lease?

10
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,746
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,249
You can stay with us.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,292
Anything you need.

13
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,379
But you have to let us know
when you feel better...

14
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,966
...so we can make fun of your hair.

15
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,343
You got it.

16
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:56,223
Thanks, I really appreciate this.
I'm going to get packing again.

17
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:01,478
I've been moving around so much
that I feel like a nomad.

18
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:07,776
He thought you said gonad.

19
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,322
The One Where Ross Moves In

20
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:03,082
If every place were this clean,
it'd be tough making a living.

21
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,042
Oh, Larry!

22
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,795
Do health inspectors
work on commission?

23
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,005
No, bribes.

24
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,592
- It's okay to laugh?
- I was just kidding.

25
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:18,513
- I'll check the kitchen floor.
- Knock yourself out.

26
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,933
Yummy!

27
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,063
Yeah, I'd let him check out
my kitchen floor.

28
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,151
A ninety-eight.

29
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,029
I deducted two points
for not wearing your hat.

30
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,406
That is a Section 5 violation.

31
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,493
Now look, Larry, honey.

32
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,662
I wrote the book on Section 5.

33
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,373
You only need to wear it
in the kitchen.

34
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,499
Where's your hat?

35
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,877
In the kitchen. I'll get it.

36
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,672
There's the two points!

37
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,176
You should really read
that book you wrote.

38
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,979
You saw the hat in the kitchen and
knew she'd go in hatless to get it.

39
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,692
You could have your own
health inspector detective show.

40
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,110
I don't know about that.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,697
But then I could be
your sidekick, Voonda.

42
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,200
Maybe I could ask Voonda
to dinner sometime?

43
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,577
She would love that...

44
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:27,499
...since you know
all the clean places to eat.

45
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,045
I'll call you.

46
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,343
He's so funny!

47
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,768
Thank you.

48
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,021
How's Ross doing
since all the Emily stuff?

49
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,606
He's not great.

50
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,817
But he's dealing with it.
Wait, you're not...

51
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,487
I can't get started
with all that Ross stuff again.

52
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,199
He'll be screwed up for a long time.

53
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,161
Besides, I don't go for guys
right after they get divorced.

54
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:10,250
Right, you only go for them
five minutes before they get married.

55
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,964
- Two pounds of mocha java.
- It's Danny.

56
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,341
Are you going to go out again?

57
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,385
I don't know.
He hasn't called since we went out.

58
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:24,598
I see him in the hallway.
We flirt. I'm all...

59
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,976
...and then nothing.

60
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,395
Wow, thirsty.

61
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:34,358
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Sort of a housewarming thing.

62
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,818
- Fun.
- Great!

63
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,528
I'm looking forward to it.

64
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,489
See you!

65
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,205
So I guess we won't
be warming his house.

66
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,959
All right, I see what he's doing.

67
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:56,338
He's not asking me out
because he wants me to ask him out.

68
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,589
And you won't do that.

69
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,216
That's right!

70
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,511
Because that would give him
the control.

71
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,889
So now he comes up with this
"I've got a party" thing...

72
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,767
...to get me to hint
for an invitation.

73
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,145
Blew up in his face, didn't it?

74
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,857
So there is no party?

75
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,068
No, there's a party.
There's a party.

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,736
But the power?

77
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,281
That is still up for grabs.

78
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,324
You follow me?

79
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,826
I think so.

80
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:30,330
So he won't invite you to his party
because he likes you?

81
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,958
Exactly!

82
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,888
Hey, roomies!

83
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,599
I love what you've done
with the place.

84
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,684
I know it's a lot of boxes.

85
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,855
- I appreciate you letting me stay here.
- Not a problem.

86
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,149
Since you'll be here a while...

87
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,485
...we could put your name
on the answering machine.

88
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,488
I hope you don't mind...

89
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:06,659
...but I kind of already
jazzed it up a little.

90
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,745
Check it out.

91
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,916
<i>We will</i>

92
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:19,088
<i>We will call you back</i>

93
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,759
Pretty cool.

94
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,182
- You're fake laughing too, right?
- The tears are real.

95
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,062
You look beautiful this evening.

96
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,232
Show me the badge again.

97
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,363
Shiny.

98
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,617
You mind if I wash up?
Who knows where these have been?

99
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,496
You are just nonstop!

100
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,548
- We're out of here.
- Why?

101
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,636
I saw ten violations.
I'm shutting this place down!

102
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:12,432
- You have the power to do that?
- This does.

103
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,561
Shut it down.

104
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,534
What are you doing?

105
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,578
Nothing.

106
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,332
You built a fort, didn't you?

107
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,376
Kind of.

108
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,088
Oh, my God! The air purifier.
Ross' air purifier.

109
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:48,176
All I heard for four years
through college was...

110
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,388
You should have gone out
once in a while.

111
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,182
- I hate this thing!
- Come on, Chandler.

112
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,061
Ross is our friend.
He needs us right now.

113
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:02,983
So why don't you be a grownup
and come watch TV in the fort?

114
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,032
I wanted to invite you to the party.

115
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,367
Thanks, I'll try to stop by.

116
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:15,788
Actually, I think
I'm going to be busy.

117
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,415
You are?

118
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,752
Remember, I've got that gala?

119
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:26,256
What's the gala for?

120
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,427
It's a regatta gala.

121
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,886
Do you sail?

122
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:34,931
No, but I support it.

123
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:40,312
I hope I see you tomorrow night.
Take care.

124
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,234
Walked right into that one,
didn't he?

125
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,735
What one?

126
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,654
You wanted him to invite you
and he did.

127
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,908
He waited until the last minute.
So if I said yes...

128
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,912
...he'd know I had nothing better
to do than wait for his invitation.

129
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,455
But I said no...

130
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,541
...which puts me back
in the driver's seat.

131
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,128
So the ball is in his court?

132
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,421
Ball?

133
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:09,091
No, there's no ball.

134
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,894
Joey, please.

135
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,854
Sorry.

136
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,622
Hello, children.

137
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:45,044
You want to play some foosball?
Please?

138
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,340
We moved the table into my room
because of all the boxes.

139
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,511
Come on!

140
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,683
I have one question.

141
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,437
What is the deal with this?

142
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,149
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?

143
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,860
No, the quiet down thing.

144
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,071
You mean this.

145
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,075
I don't know how much more
I can take.

146
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:22,957
Did you know he taped over my "Baywatch"
tape with a show about bugs?

147
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,666
My God!

148
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,045
What if that had been porn?

149
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,130
All right, this may be tough...

150
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,300
...but it's Ross.
I survived college with him.

151
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,386
I guess I can hold out
a little longer.

152
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,807
Let's have a game.

153
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,606
Fellas?

154
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:56,073
So he's out of here.

155
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:06,292
Got anything to eat?
I went to Jono's and it was closed.

156
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:11,672
I took Larry there, but it was all
violated, so we shut it down.

157
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:16,009
If this guy keeps closing our
favorite places, where will we eat?

158
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,887
I don't know. Clean places?

159
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,972
Yum!

160
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:26,479
It's Danny.

161
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,689
Don't let him in!
I'm supposed to be at a gala.

162
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,068
We'll be right there.
Can't you say it's later?

163
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,571
What kind of a regatta gala
starts at night?

164
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,616
The fake kind.

165
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:47,458
- I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
- We have a ladle.

166
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,920
See you at the party.

167
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:57,593
You know what Larry would say?
He'd say, "See you ladle."

168
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,932
I'm done. You want anything?
Sports? International?

169
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,976
Apartment listings?

170
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,185
I'll take sports.

171
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,314
Mine!

172
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,024
All right, international.

173
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,902
That's mine too.

174
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,197
I'm Italian.

175
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:22,993
I could check apartment listings,
though there's never anything here.

176
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,997
Not even on page seven?

177
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,084
You're right.
Here's an affordable place.

178
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:35,631
Two bedroom, close to work.
It's available in five weeks.

179
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:39,009
What about that circled one?

180
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,512
It's kind of expensive for a studio.

181
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,431
But it's available now.

182
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,724
Isn't it?

183
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,476
Yes, it is.

184
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:51,188
Let's go look at it!

185
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:54,525
There we go!

186
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,447
Guys, would you chip in for some
new air filters for the purifier?

187
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,658
I mean, after all,
we are all using it.

188
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,453
Let's go quicker!

189
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,550
Oh, my God!

190
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:25,014
Look at this kitchen/bathroom.

191
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:28,642
That's great!
So you can cook while in the tub.

192
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,187
Somebody was using his head.

193
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:36,650
Let's check out
the rest of the place.

194
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,035
I think this is it.

195
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:50,122
I don't know.
Maybe we should keep looking.

196
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,875
But this place is available now.

197
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:57,713
You don't want to be stuck
with us for five weeks.

198
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:05,220
So you think I should
take this place?

199
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,598
It's perfect!

200
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,686
How about you?

201
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,898
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.

202
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,111
I see what you guys are saying.

203
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,740
I'll go downstairs
and fill out an application.

204
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,413
We are bad people.

205
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:35,876
He knew we were trying
to get rid of him.

206
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:41,715
Could we get a bathtub
in our kitchen?

207
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,886
Ready for dinner?

208
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,096
- Absolutely.
- Great.

209
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,474
You wanted to go to
the Italian place on Bleecker St.?

210
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,476
I love that place!

211
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,687
So, no.

212
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,148
How about Mama Lozetti's?

213
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,442
Sure.

214
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,862
How long has that milk
been sitting out?

215
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,364
No, this place is totally healthy.

216
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,118
This milk is mine.
I bought this today...

217
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:13,831
...because I was thirsty for milk,
you know?

218
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,670
Okay, let's go.

219
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,548
Hey, buddy.

220
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:27,803
Health Code 11 B requires that refuse
be taken out the back exit.

221
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,305
But then I have to go
all the way around.

222
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,559
So you choose convenience
over health?

223
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,520
Stop, Larry.

224
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,817
Can't you just be Larry and not
Larry the health inspector guy?

225
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,902
It was exciting at first.

226
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:49,324
But now, it's like, so where
are we going to eat ever?

227
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:52,453
I suppose I could give him a warning.

228
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,914
Thank you.

229
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,540
Go, go!

230
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,755
If, after dinner,
you still need to bust someone...

231
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:08,886
...I know a hot dog vendor
who picks his nose.

232
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,017
Maybe we did good,
helping Ross get back on his feet.

233
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,894
That was a nice place.

234
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:23,734
No closet space, but he could hang
his stuff out the window in a bag.

235
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,821
What do we do?

236
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,573
I don't know.

237
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,617
Maybe pizza?

238
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:36,205
About Ross!

239
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:47,633
It's the apartment manager.
Ross put us as references.

240
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:51,053
Ross is the greatest guy.
He's very reliable...

241
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:57,226
Of course, he has a big, huge dog
that barks into the night.

242
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,563
Well, who doesn't love dogs?

243
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,065
He's a tap dancer.

244
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:07,611
Yes, some would say
that is a lost art.

245
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,781
He's a pimp!

246
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,075
There you go. He's a pimp.

247
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,912
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!

248
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,523
This is never going to work.
He's right there.

249
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:45,816
Just go say hi.

250
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:51,572
I have to go downstairs and back up,
as if I'm coming home from the gala.

251
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:56,910
So just go distract him.
But don't be sexy.

252
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,538
What's going on?

253
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:04,209
This is a great party.
Great food.

254
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:09,590
You know, most parties, it's all
chips and salsa, chips and salsa.

255
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,634
So...

256
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,845
What's this?

257
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,472
Salad.

258
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,268
And what's this?

259
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,562
Bread.

260
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,606
Aren't you a chef?

261
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,322
Right, tonight was your party.

262
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,699
You look great!
I'm glad you made it.

263
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,619
Well, you know,
the gala had to end sometime.

264
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,249
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

265
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,253
Whose court is the ball in now?

266
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,841
I thought there wasn't a ball.

267
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,511
Come on. He's glad I came.
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.

268
00:18:56,762 --> 00:19:00,224
Ball's flying all over the place.

269
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,809
This is my friend, Tom.

270
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,687
This is the girl I told you about.

271
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:08,107
Come on!
You telling people about me?

272
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,360
I think you two
could really hit it off.

273
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,905
I'm gonna to go mingle.

274
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,953
So you work at Bloomingdale's?
My mom calls it "Bloomies".

275
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,753
At ease, soldier!

276
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:30,962
I'm sorry?

277
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:34,591
You can just drop the act.
I know what's going on.

278
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,844
You're Danny's wingman, right?

279
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:42,016
You guys are best buds, frat bros.

280
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,684
I'm going to go talk to a friend.

281
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,729
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.

282
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,525
Go tell him, "Nice try."

283
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:56,071
He just keeps lobbing them up...

284
00:19:56,321 --> 00:20:01,201
...and I keep knocking them
right out of the park.

285
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:05,581
I think I need a drink.

286
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,252
Ninety-eight...

287
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,920
...ninety-nine...

288
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:14,048
...one hundred!

289
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:15,466
Okay. Go.

290
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:19,345
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

291
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:25,058
Here we go, here we go.

292
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:31,357
So I didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.

293
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:32,817
You're kidding?

294
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,195
But Phoebe said I could stay
at her place for a while, so...

295
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,824
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.

296
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,868
You don't need me
taking up all your space.

297
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:50,125
We got plenty of space.
There's still some by that speaker.

298
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,752
Please, just stay.

299
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,087
Are you sure?

300
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:58,968
- Definitely.
- You have to stay.

301
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,474
So I'm a pimp, huh?

302
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,436
It's okay.

303
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,938
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.

304
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:15,818
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.

305
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:22,741
And I'll do everything I can
to keep my annoying habits just...

306
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:41,051
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

307
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,220
The cowboy hat's a little much.

308
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,932
Come on, it's fun!

309
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,020
All right.

310
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,152
Isn't this a woman's hat?

311
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:04,241
Dude, stop talking crazy,
and make us some tea!
