00:02:57,155 --> 00:03:02,755
JACKASS 3.5

2
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,495
Hello, my name is Johnny Knoxville.

3
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,750
Welcome to Jackass!

4
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,091
Thank you very much.

5
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,644
People are always asking me,

6
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,223
"Is there anything
that you just wouldn't do?"

7
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,558
Well, this is it.

8
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,189
It's the Alligator Snapping Turtle,

9
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,315
probably the meanest thing
I'll have ever done to my butt.

10
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,693
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

11
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,024
Fuck!

12
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,744
Don't look at him, Steve-O.
Don't look at him.

13
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,571
-Look at him.
-Don't look at him.

14
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,781
Relax, relax.

15
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,245
Don't look at it.

16
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,457
Look at it.

17
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,552
Shit!

18
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,846
Fuck! God damn it!

19
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,299
-Fuck!
-Relax.

20
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,431
-Relax!
-Relax. Just relax.

21
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,062
-Hold your ground.
-Okay.

22
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,266
-Fuck, that must hurt really bad.
-Shit.

23
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,692
-Fuck.
-Are you okay?

24
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,354
-Mama.
-Fuck.

25
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,483
Okay, now he's just no
gonna fucking let go?

26
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,365
I knew this was fucking gonna happen!
He's not letting go!

27
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,326
-Shit.
-Relax. You need to relax.

28
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,452
Fuck!

29
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,080
-The turtle's the problem.
-I'm relaxed! Shit!

30
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,787
This would be horrifying if...

31
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,338
-Relax.
-Relax.

32
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,290
-Okay.
-Relax?

33
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,967
-Who could relax?
-I'm just gonna...

34
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,840
You son...

35
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,971
Jeez, relax, relax.

36
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,798
-Shit!
-Hold it together. Don't pull.

37
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,759
-Don't pull.
-Don't pull.

38
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,186
-It doesn't wanna let go.
-God!

39
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,229
-Oh, my God.
-Fuck!

40
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,149
That was horrifying.

41
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,817
Wow.

42
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,068
-Get him out of here.
-Son of a bitch!

43
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,773
Oh, my God.

44
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,992
He got you good.

45
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,489
Yeah.

46
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,916
There's a reason why I turned that down
for so many years.

47
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,672
I can't see anything!

48
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,803
-Spread your legs.
-Let go. Let go. Drop.

49
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,430
You're good.

50
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,934
You all right?

51
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,896
You want a donut?

52
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,612
This is Barrel Surfing.

53
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,069
Big-barrel surfing's for macho jerks
with a death wish.

54
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,201
No, it's not. It's the ultimate thrill,
the ultimate rush.

55
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,873
Even more than sex.

56
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,078
Well, that depends
on who you're doing it with.

57
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,265
That was pretty good.

58
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,785
Hold them!

59
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,924
I think Bam was great
at it the first time,

60
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,094
and now Dunn's stepped in
to up the failure rate

61
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,421
to an all-time high.

62
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,515
Oh, my God.

63
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,905
I've got a pile of shit in my nose.

64
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,609
I'm Ryan Dunn. This is face surfing.

65
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,494
That scene done yet?

66
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,640
Being on set is 50% fun as hell,

67
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,889
and the other 50%
is just pure anxiety, paranoia...

68
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,767
-Jesus.
-Oh, God.

69
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,521
The only thing I care about
is that it's fucking wet down here.

70
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,779
Shooting a Jackass movie,
it seems super fun,

71
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,447
but it's actually hell

72
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,071
because everyone
is trying to get everyone.

73
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,573
In particular, me, because I've been
a dick to everyone the whole time.

74
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,507
It gets very tense on set
when we're filming Jackass.

75
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,049
You're always
looking over your shoulder.

76
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,094
You just know something horrible
is gonna happen to you.

77
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,137
And it's not like it might. It will.

78
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,759
It's a snapping turtle on a stick.

79
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,985
Fucking with Ehren
is the best thing ever.

80
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,611
Where's he at right now?
I wanna pee on him or something.

81
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,610
Ehren's in there sleeping.

82
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,538
We got Ghetto Defibrillators.

83
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,537
Clear!

84
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,002
Fuck you!

85
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,558
I was worried about you.

86
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,725
Didn't know if you'd died.

87
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,475
I know. You were in here
snoring for three hours, dude.

88
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,601
We didn't know if you'd died.

89
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,523
It's all right. We're doctors.

90
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,819
You guys are dicks.

91
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,113
Can't somebody sleep a little bit
around here?

92
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,862
No. That's the whole point.

93
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,909
Sure, you can sleep.

94
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,414
You know that if you're being pranked,
if it's a good prank,

95
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,915
it's gonna end up in the movie.

96
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,747
And footage is footage.

97
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,709
But definitely, tensions get hot.

98
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,178
And you never know what's gonna happen.

99
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,641
He's not anywhere near you.

100
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,346
He's hiding behind a motherfucking
chain-link fence.

101
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,056
A chain-link fence.

102
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,267
That's worse than this.

103
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,448
He's gonna fucking try
and Rocky my ass right now.

104
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,254
Hey, hey!

105
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,959
Guys, stop.

106
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,295
Stop.

107
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,678
Stop, stop, stop. Come on.

108
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,600
It's cool. Come on.

109
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,727
-What was the name of that bit?
-Chill.

110
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,895
I don't know.

111
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,598
-"Fighting Each Other"?
-"Fight!"

112
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,149
I'm telling you,
it's nerve-racking, dude.

113
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,943
You gotta let out some aggression.

114
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,946
Man, it is nerve-racking as hell.

115
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:22,445
'Cause 24/7, when we're shooting, all
of us are always attacking each other.

116
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,906
I may be attacking everyone
a little more.

117
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,245
-Fuck!
-What the fuck was that?

118
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,549
I saw a Buster Keaton film where
he had a mini cannon tied to his foot,

119
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,003
and he couldn't get it off his foot.

120
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,384
And I thought it looked funny.

121
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,431
And so, we had one built.

122
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,637
Here.

123
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,595
One of the funniest times
is when I walked up behind Ehren

124
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,897
with the mini cannon,
and I was dressed as a pirate.

125
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,724
Get up and go.

126
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,311
And he kept moving
and I had to keep repositioning,

127
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,648
and finally,
he turns around and busts me.

128
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,950
And so, I have to walk this mini cannon
out of frame,

129
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,703
very un-sneakily,
and it was really awkward.

130
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,793
But he just...
Five minutes, hyper-vigilant,

131
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,542
five minutes goes by,
he forgets about it,

132
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,466
and then I shoot him in the ass.

133
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,478
Fuck, that hurt.

134
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,309
-You got it.
-Asshole.

135
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,564
-Ehren.
-He got us, too.

136
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,564
Shit. Right in the neck.

137
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,774
Arr you mad at me?

138
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,571
What's the bit here, Wee?

139
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,498
All right. So, today, Street Bike Tommy

140
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,203
is gonna come down this ramp
looking like a bowling ball,

141
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,377
launch into all of us standing out here

142
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,917
as the human pins, and knock us down.

143
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,298
-Do I look like the tenpin?
-You do look like the tenpin.

144
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,095
-That's what I am.
-Awesome.

145
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,094
It's pretty slippery out there.

146
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,927
Yeah, and the reason
it's slippery out there,

147
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,353
that's sex lube.

148
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,021
Lube it up, boys.

149
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,482
So, we're getting ready to do a bit
called the Slip 'n' Bowl,

150
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,531
but really, it's just a big ruse to
get all the guys in the middle

151
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:28,112
of a big, slippery mess, so we can fly
a remote-controlled helicopter in

152
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:32,040
that has paintball guns
mounted on either side.

153
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,874
It's gonna suck.

154
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,915
Here we go. Quiet, please.

155
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,959
All right. Get your goggles on, guys.

156
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,166
-Goggles on, guys.
-Let's get the intro.

157
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,462
Action!

158
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,966
I'm Street Bike Tommy,
and this is Slip 'n' Bowl.

159
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,513
Go!

160
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,346
I'm almost feeling bad now.

161
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,934
Shit!

162
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,281
Fucking shit!

163
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,367
Fuck!

164
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,494
Fucking assholes.

165
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,705
Fuck.

166
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,164
-Who is that?
-Who is that?

167
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,715
-Dave.
-Dave England.

168
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,043
-That's so...
-Fuck.

169
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,469
Oh, my God.

170
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,923
This whole thing was
just a big, elaborate ruse

171
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,724
to get you on something slippery.

172
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,926
I heard the noise and I was like,

173
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,557
"Are you guys cool
with this, like, sound?"

174
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,059
-Yeah, I was thinking...
-And then, all of a sudden, I saw

175
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,607
-the camera, and I was like...
-I wasn't in the bit.

176
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,275
I wasn't around, and I'm like,

177
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,069
"If they see me not around,
they're gonna get suspicious."

178
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,396
Everything was obvious.

179
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,073
That's what I was worried about
not going too fast

180
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,821
'cause I didn't want you...

181
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,158
I don't want you to fall...

182
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,786
The joke's on you now, boy.

183
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,878
I actually deserve that.

184
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,005
So we have a dick rocket, and
we're gonna launch it into Bam's ass,

185
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,965
AKA Uranus.

186
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,097
-It's science.
-We've been waiting for years

187
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,144
for technology to catch up with us.

188
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,645
Finally, we've got this contraption.

189
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,643
We're gonna send this cock rocket
straight to Uranus.

190
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,820
-You ready?
-Are you ready?

191
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,942
Let's do it.

192
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,993
Three, two, one, blast off!

193
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,323
Don't point that thing at me.

194
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,292
Okay, so we didn't get quite up there,

195
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,251
but it happens to a lot of guys.

196
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:32,591
Doesn't it, Ryan?

197
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,547
Bam, you ready?

198
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,641
Three,

199
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,842
two,

200
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,052
one,

201
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,354
blast off!

202
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,477
Shit.

203
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,401
What's going on, Bam?

204
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,901
Now, they have a lighter dildo

205
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,574
which seems like it would be better,
but, no.

206
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,249
It means it's gonna go so much faster
into my ass,

207
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,576
and it's gonna not feel very great.

208
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,963
So, we had to switch cocks.
Hopefully, this one will work.

209
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,085
It's a big, old cock.

210
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,008
Three,

211
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,175
two,

212
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,673
one,

213
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,221
blast off!

214
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,768
Did you like it?

215
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,023
Fuck, no.

216
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,363
One small step for man,
one giant leap for that sweet ass.

217
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,868
Jesus. You can't see shit
in these things.

218
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,247
Check it out.

219
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,708
Yeah.

220
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,668
This is the Magna-Goggles.

221
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,681
Oh, my God. Hold on.

222
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,760
-All right. Go.
-Okay.

223
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,469
Wait, let me aim you first.

224
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,891
Okay.

225
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,226
-All right.
-Yeah?

226
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,352
-Just go.
-Okay.

227
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,728
Go.

228
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,362
Go!

229
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,155
I'm sorry, bro

230
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,286
No you're not.

231
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:25,242
You ready to run a down and in pattern
about five yards out and across?

232
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,248
-Absolutely.
-All right. Give Preston a high five.

233
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,455
-Yes. All right.
-Come on.

234
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,165
These things suck.

235
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,051
Hut, hut!

236
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,099
Fuck!

237
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,889
-Where did that get you?
-Right in the nose.

238
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,357
Shit.

239
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,067
-You got this.
-I got this?

240
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,860
-Come on, Dunn.
-Yeah.

241
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,405
-Come on, Dunn.
-Let them have it.

242
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,194
Shit.

243
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,616
Wee Man is fun to dress up, period.

244
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,373
He just looks cute in anything
you put him in.

245
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,915
Preston, too.

246
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,046
This is Snow Tubing.

247
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,268
I fucking kicked him in the face.

248
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,186
-Kicked him in the face?
-I kicked him in the face.

249
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,730
Kicked him right here.

250
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,232
Frosty, he's bleeding a little.

251
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,604
This just ain't Frosty's day. Fuck.

252
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,537
That's one dumb reindeer.

253
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,724
Dude, this is screwed up.

254
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,688
That was good.

255
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,898
Can you help me up?

256
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,861
I saw this bit on
America's Funniest Home Videos.

257
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,197
Two kids run at a tree

258
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,999
with a 15-foot-long stick

259
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,999
on either end,
and they hit the tree in the middle,

260
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,206
and it just sends them flying
when they hit the tree.

261
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,714
Basically, we're gonna try to clothesline
ourselves with this two-by-four.

262
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,423
And it's downhill, and Dunn's
gonna be landing in horse shit,

263
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,473
-so I don't think...
-Thank you for pointing that out for me.

264
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,891
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

265
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,015
Why do you think I've been favoring
over here the whole time?

266
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,644
I didn't notice I have a big pile
of horse shit to land in.

267
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,940
Awesome.

268
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,858
This is the Blowback.

269
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,402
Shit.

270
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,281
-Fuck.
-Awesome.

271
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,984
Fucking stupid bullshit.

272
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,906
-That was great.
-I liked it.

273
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,328
"That was great"?

274
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,872
Did you guys stand there beforehand
and go,

275
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,665
"Let's just be enthusiastic
and encourage this thing"?

276
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,617
No no. That looks funny.

277
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,499
-That looks good.
-Yeah, man.

278
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,671
I wish you guys had a dick cam
'cause that's where that pole went.

279
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,998
That was rad.

280
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,043
It's such a dumb idea
'cause you have to choreograph it

281
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,799
so you're both doing it
at the exact same time.

282
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,174
You both weigh the same.

283
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,632
It was destined for failure
from the get-go,

284
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,718
but we kept on trying it
'cause we're stupid.

285
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,928
Nobody wants to jump in?

286
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,057
No.

287
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,771
I'm just saying.

288
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,895
I don't know. I'm feeling sorry for you.

289
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,601
Really painful thing,

290
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,152
low payoff.

291
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,613
Yeah.

292
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,065
Just do it again.

293
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,609
Take two.

294
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,536
-This is the Blowback.
-Shit.

295
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,377
I hate it.

296
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,751
Some things just don't translate
to camera.

297
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,252
Yeah?

298
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,210
ldeally, you want something
that doesn't hurt,

299
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,045
but looks really bad.

300
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,677
This is a whole other story.
The opposite.

301
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,348
At least we busted it,
so we can't try it again.

302
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,725
You tried it with Knoxville
and he sliced his hand open.

303
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,896
You could see his bone.

304
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,645
That ain't my fault.

305
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,567
I know. It's the Blowback's fault.

306
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,894
Dumb Blowback.

307
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,452
That hurt worse than when it...

308
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,581
It's out of frame. Turn this way
so everyone's out of frame.

309
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:39,962
It's stinging.

310
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,420
For a bit that doesn't work,
that fucking thing sucks.

311
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,046
All right, take a big breath.

312
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,048
You can do this.

313
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,879
Not too bad, right?

314
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,259
All right. It's gonna numb up.

315
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,103
A little burn, perhaps.

316
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,181
That camera on?

317
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,271
All right. If you have pain, tell me.
I'll get you more numbing medicine.

318
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,193
I know you're the type
that's not gonna tell me

319
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,942
'cause you don't want any more shots.

320
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,950
All right.
Let me get this thing closed up.

321
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,618
Fuck off.

322
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,374
I'm Brandon Novak,

323
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,287
and this is Doo Doo Falls.

324
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,046
-You okay?
-Fuck.

325
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,433
Thank God for that fucking helmet.

326
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,385
Dude, I hit my head so hard,

327
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,222
it honestly saved my life.

328
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,570
Did you make dookie on yourself?

329
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,988
Yeah.

330
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,817
He just shit his pants.

331
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,902
But if anyone deserves
to shit their pants,

332
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,534
it's you for doing that.

333
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,452
-Wipe your shitty ass.
-You wipe it.

334
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,376
-Why do I gotta wipe it?
-'Cause I can't move right now.

335
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,795
No no

336
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,165
Why so rough?

337
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,052
Fucking asshole.

338
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,386
-What are you doing, Ryan?
-Painting lips on the chick.

339
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,812
For the kiss.
What does it look like I'm doing?

340
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,649
All right. Hang on. Okay, go.

341
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,523
Steve-O, in a little bit more.

342
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,698
We're here with Mark Zupan,
and this is the Kissing Booth.

343
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,955
That was great.

344
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,703
P., that was gold.

345
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,203
Oh, my God.

346
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,786
-You all right?
-Make it happy.

347
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,917
Yay! Nice kiss.

348
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,294
Big, old kiss. She's hot.

349
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,376
Yeah.

350
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,632
The Phantom camera was so fun,
especially for Jackass

351
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,387
where we had a lot of impact.

352
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,969
It shoots so slow that one second
on the Phantom camera

353
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,474
is like 40 seconds.

354
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,441
Preston is your ideal guy
to shoot Phantom on.

355
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,523
Even a skinny guy,
if you hit him in the face,

356
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,650
you'll see the face come off the skull.

357
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,864
But the fatter you are,

358
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:18,072
the more rippling and waving it gets.
It's just gonna roll and look crazy.

359
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,747
I fell in love with the Phantom camera.

360
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,252
I was just thinking,
when I just put Wee Man,

361
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,454
his naked ass
with his balls hanging down,

362
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,416
and I threw a tennis ball at his balls.

363
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,720
Man, there are certain things
that look really great.

364
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:38,470
Anything Pontius does with his pee-pee
is funny on the Phantom camera.

365
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,226
When we found the Phantom camera,
we started writing

366
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,648
bits for it left and right.

367
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,281
I'm Danger Ehren,
and I'm about to go fishing.

368
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,989
It really captures what happens
when you get hit in the face.

369
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,575
You sure it's not just gonna hit me
right in the front of the face?

370
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,126
-Yes, I got you.
-All right.

371
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,078
I'm not gonna hit you in the front
of the face. I got you.

372
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,710
All right, guys, come on. We're rolling.

373
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,166
When was the last time
you took a fish to the head?

374
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,051
I haven't taken a fish to the head
in a long -ass time.

375
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,504
Why?

376
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,057
I missed.

377
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,479
Fuck.

378
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,740
I told you I wasn't gonna hit your nose.

379
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,989
What are your predictions?

380
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,945
How many walls do you think
he's gonna get through?

381
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,285
So, that's the object here?

382
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,667
Two and the beginning of the third one.

383
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,669
I'm with you. What's your predictio

384
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,843
Two and a bump into the third one,
with no damage to the third one.

385
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,262
-He's too light. He's only a buck 60...
-He's a buck 60.

386
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,091
-He's too light. He can't smash through.
-Then maybe you should go down there.

387
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:03,767
I'm not going there.

388
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,230
-Are you okay?
-No.

389
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,858
Oh, my God.

390
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,484
All right.

391
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,653
I love you.

392
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,615
For the love of fuck's sake,

393
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,537
this is Drywall Drop-In.

394
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,384
-Are you all right? Shit.
-Yeah, I'm fine.

395
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,587
You okay? Are you okay?

396
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,673
-Yeah.
-You have drywall in your mouth.

397
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,258
Watch out. There's nails.

398
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,559
-Okay.
-We'll get them off.

399
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,887
It looked especially funny
when you hit the walls.

400
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,437
You did good.

401
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,691
-Was it neat?
-It was neat-o.

402
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,777
Good. Just so long as it was neat.

403
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,729
Yeah. Way to go.

404
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,778
Who's Darf?

405
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,986
Darf is a friend of mine,

406
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,447
a friend of ours that we no longer see.

407
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:10,080
Darf is when Dave is blacked-out drunk,
and he's the worst.

408
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,628
He's the worst of any of the guys.
When he's drunk, he's the worst.

409
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:18,505
Apparently, from what I hear,
jf I drink too much,

410
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,007
I turn into a different person,
named Darf,

411
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,508
who's a total asshole

412
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,762
that just goes around doing
as many horrible things as he can.

413
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,770
And Darf showed up one night
in Northern California at a bar.

414
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,810
Everyone wanted to kick his ass.

415
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,980
I was told the next day,
I got my wiener out

416
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,436
and I put mustard all over it,

417
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,567
which is called the Portland Frank.

418
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,320
And I was like,
"There's no way I did that."

419
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,151
And I pulled my pants down,

420
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,077
and it was all mustard-y.

421
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,575
The next morning we get up,

422
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,952
and whose name
is on top of the stunt list?

423
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,749
Dave England.

424
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,877
This is where Dave stands up
on the back of a horse

425
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,170
and throws a parachute up?

426
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,588
Yes.

427
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,835
Will it work?

428
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,336
I hope not.

429
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:06,887
Well, after his performance yesterday,
I figured he was due for a stunt today.

430
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,182
Here we go. Okay.

431
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,309
Man, you got some alcohol
on your breath, still.

432
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,640
Sorry.

433
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,022
All right, we're good to go.

434
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,237
I'm here with Judd Leffew,
and this is Bareback Base Jumping.

435
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,329
Here we go.

436
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,458
Pull!

437
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,793
Where's the parachute?

438
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,054
Dave was a drunk piece of shit
last night,

439
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,882
and we're a little bit mad at him,

440
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,639
so I think we're gonna get this
in at least 10, 15 more times.

441
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,813
You almost got it, Dave.

442
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,111
Drop!

443
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:18,416
Just one more and I should be happy.

444
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,207
Oh, man.

445
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,933
It has to be soft...

446
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,932
-The soft stuff's over here!
-Oh, my God!

447
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,392
Fucking hell!

448
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,437
I love how you completely missed
the softer dirt,

449
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,109
and just went for the hard stuff.

450
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,359
Hey, look, it's hard to plan
when you're floating way up high.

451
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,940
-It's hard to spot your landing.
-You actually didn't float that long.

452
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,401
I thought I was gonna get caught
in those trees.

453
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,453
I think Dave did
the horse parachute thing

454
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,532
eight times, nine times that day.

455
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,908
Did you ever feel bad for him?

456
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:59,040
No. I've never felt bad
for Dave England in any situation.

457
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:13,892
We got a whole lot of diet cola
and a bunch of peppermint candies.

458
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,512
This is Bombs Away.

459
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,894
-Shit!
-Creepy-ass shit.

460
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,897
You're playing with a live grenade,
my friend.

461
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,988
Bombs away!

462
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,834
Fuck you!

463
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,562
Look at all the fucking dents
behind Lance.

464
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,106
-Where were you, Lance?
-I was right here.

465
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,747
That looks great.

466
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,619
Early on, Knoxville found this thing
online where this Chinese artist

467
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,506
paints himself into backgrounds
really intricately.

468
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,591
And so,
we knew that was the start of an idea,

469
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,341
just how do we finish it and pay it off?

470
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,382
That's where the Invisible Man came...
That's where it worked.

471
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,966
Fuck!

472
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,012
We also painted Wee Man.

473
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:26,058
April's house... April Margera paints
her house. Hand-does everything.

474
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,777
Their basement
is painted like a dungeon.

475
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,651
So, we had Seth paint Wee Man
into the wall.

476
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,196
He does blend right in
and he disappears.

477
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:42,204
We're in April Margera's house,
and this is the Invisible Wee.

478
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,592
Jesus! Son of a...

479
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,302
-Did you really not see that?
-Jesus!

480
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,975
-Soon as I grabbed you...
-He scared the shit out of me!

481
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,394
-Were the lights off?
-Who else can we get?

482
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,850
Who else doesn't know?

483
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,074
Oh, my God!

484
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,491
Oh, my God!

485
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,169
Hey, why do I get hit?

486
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,290
That scared the shit out of me!
Oh, my God!

487
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,920
You didn't see him at all?

488
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,845
Now we're gonna send Dunn down
with a cattle prod to get Wee Man.

489
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,137
You fucking dick!

490
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,356
Fucking guy.

491
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,858
That's what you get for scaring people,
you little...

492
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:01,077
That lovely contraptio
kills rats with electricity.

493
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,032
That's a metal rat.
It's hooked up to my nuts.

494
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,367
I'm Steve-O, and this is the Rat Zapper.

495
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,045
-All right then!
-Nailed it!

496
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,753
Okay, I'm gonna just wind in here.

497
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,888
-Yeah, "Oklahoma" is the safe word.
-Yeah, I'll turn it off then.

498
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,975
-There we go.
-This is monster's balls.

499
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,768
-Shit!
-Here you go.

500
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,314
Monster's balls.

501
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,354
Fuck!

502
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,530
Oklahoma!

503
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,614
-Man!
-See, you didn't tape them tight enough.

504
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,869
He yelled, "Oklahoma."

505
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,082
Ryan just stood there for a while
before he turned it off.

506
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,333
-It was for his own good.
-We didn't know how to do it.

507
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:59,174
-You think that felt good for the rat?
-Fuck!

508
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,346
-You forgot to sponge him.
-Did it hurt?

509
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:08,520
Thanks, guys. Oh, my God!
That is not fucking happening again.

510
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:13,855
I'll... You touched your bloody nuts
with those fingers, so...

511
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,275
What are these called again?

512
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,448
-Belt sander skates.
-Belt sander skates.

513
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,069
I'm Brandon Novak,
and this is Belt Sander Skates.

514
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,342
Where doesn't it hurt?

515
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,597
That's a wrap on this one,
right, Tremaine?

516
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,097
I can't take any more of that.

517
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,974
I guess both me and Knoxville
were old men in the first, and Bam.

518
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,434
The three of us were old men
in the first one.

519
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,486
In the second one, I was an old lady,
and Knoxville was an old man.

520
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,655
In the third one
I wanted to be a fat, old lady.

521
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,568
-You're big-boned.
-Yeah, I'm big-boned. That's all.

522
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,074
I think that reads.

523
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:12,243
-Fuck. Is that too much?
-The camel toe looks great.

524
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,162
-Excuse me, sir?
-Yeah.

525
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:19,128
A man just told me... He walked by me
and he told me I have a camel toe.

526
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,335
-What happened?
-He said I had a camel toe.

527
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,921
-Do I have something on my face?
-No.

528
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,846
Do I have a camel toe on my head?

529
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,104
-For me, no.
-Not for you?

530
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,563
Something else you needed?

531
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,858
Yeah, do I have
a giant pussy somewhere?

532
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,235
I don't know.

533
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,231
I didn't realize how insanely hot
it was gonna be,

534
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,942
and it was, like, this much makeup.

535
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,450
And it was like wearing five
sleeping bags in the dead of summer.

536
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,953
After the first hour,
I just completely...

537
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,710
It was as close as I've ever
come to like, a heatstroke.

538
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,458
I was just gonna pass out and...

539
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,461
At a certain point, I couldn't
even think, let alone be funny.

540
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,838
Oh, my God! It's so hot.

541
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,174
It is unbearably hot.

542
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,887
He gave it hell, man. He tried.

543
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,730
We shot a lot of...
What did we call her, "Kathy"?

544
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,602
Hi, my name's Kathy,
and I have a camel toe.

545
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,982
Come with me on a day of adventure.

546
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,157
Shit! Oh, my God!

547
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,573
I don't know how to start this thing.

548
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,084
How do I turn?

549
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,253
There!

550
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:46,177
I'm such a slut
I like it in my butt

551
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,431
I like sunshine all day long

552
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,649
Help. Help.

553
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:06,777
Help.

554
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,907
I'm starting a modeling career,

555
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,613
and I was wondering
what you think of my modeling photos.

556
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,374
This is a photo of me. You like it?

557
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,162
I have a new photograph
that I just shot of me.

558
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,209
Wanna make love?

559
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,384
No. Not to him, to me.

560
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,298
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
I love you.

561
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,898
Shit! Shit!

562
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,898
You're my hero

563
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,199
Spike, I don't think we go...
No one got that.

564
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,990
Okay. Are you serious?

565
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,325
Where do you think we're parked?

566
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,532
Well, you gotta get the one right
in front of him. The $7 one.

567
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,709
-That's the one we set up for.
-All right, dicks.

568
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,456
Fuck.

569
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,335
Johnny, did you get that one?

570
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:08,460
-No, we did not.
-Fuck, man! What is he doing?

571
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:13,473
Fucking A, man.
I can't believe this guy is a director.

572
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,304
This is bullshit!

573
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,351
Rick's going off on you right now,
Spike.

574
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,349
I'm gonna butt-fuck Rick.

575
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,526
Remember when we were sitting around
there, at that college,

576
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,978
and you said that you could
kick somebody in the head?

577
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,233
That's not how it works.

578
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,690
-What happened?
-No. We were shooting slo-mo stuff,

579
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:36,075
and Bam said that he wanted to do
a flying kick to the head.

580
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:40,245
I'll come at this angle.
Like, if you're standing right there,

581
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,624
I'll come right about here,
and I'll just be like...

582
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,334
And then, right there.

583
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,005
All right. Let's do that.

584
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,423
And somehow I got elected
to be the kickee.

585
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,844
Well, you're the only one
that can jump that high.

586
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,137
No I got to be the kickee at first.

587
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,716
How did this get pitched to you?

588
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,391
I was just sitting
at the table over there,

589
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:03,189
and Jeff said, "Hey, how about Bam
double-flying kicks you in the face?"

590
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,608
-And here you are, on your mark.
-Yeah.

591
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,357
Remember we caught you putting
styling gel in your hair?

592
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,654
Fuck you...

593
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,233
Fucking shit, dude!

594
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,826
You okay?

595
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:20,657
-Fuck! Dude, I'm fucking seeing stars.
-My fucking back!

596
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,830
That's Bam Margera.

597
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,040
You fucked up my hair, dude!

598
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,506
And then the day went on, and Bam...

599
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,549
He was talking shit,
saying you couldn't do it.

600
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,252
No. You got it all wrong.

601
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,344
He challenged Knoxville.

602
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:39,601
-Didn't do it!
-Didn't do it!

603
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,894
-So, you can't do it.
-Other people can do it.

604
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,472
-Okay, can you do it? Dave?
-Somebody with talent can do it.

605
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,649
-Dave can do it.
-I can't.

606
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,817
-Dave can do it.
-Nobody can do it.

607
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,271
-Me and Zupan can.
-Nobody can do it.

608
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,357
-We're out.
-Can anybody do it?

609
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,191
Dave, go try it. Dave, go try it.

610
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,530
You're good to go?

611
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,612
So, Bam, how many people
can't double-kick you in the face?

612
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,493
No one here. There's 40 people here
and nobody can kick me in the face

613
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,916
with two feet,
but everybody thinks it's so easy.

614
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,870
-Actio
-Knoxville, Dunn.

615
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,967
Dude, he jumped over you.

616
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,138
-Oh, my God!
-Way to go Dave.

617
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:21,138
-Oh, my God!
-You almost went over him.

618
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,140
That was pretty good.

619
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,151
This is the Enema Long Jump.

620
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,696
Each contestant is gonna insert
two enemas

621
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:37,241
and see who can jump the farthest
and shit the most.

622
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,154
It doesn't matter
if you shit before you jump,

623
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,119
after you jump,
or while you're airborne.

624
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,325
It's just rad doing enemas.

625
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,584
-Let's enema up.
-Let's get to it.

626
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,915
How'd you put it in?

627
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,044
-I'm just going...
-Why you choosing to be back there?

628
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,300
-Yeah.
-Because he's the official.

629
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,470
-Easy in and easy out?
-Bam, come here.

630
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,471
-God!
-Yeah!

631
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,931
Yours go in easy?

632
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,977
I like pooing,
but I like pooing with these better.

633
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,107
If you do them every day for no reason,

634
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,852
not while doing a movie,
you're a weirdo.

635
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,778
God, I want to shit!

636
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,613
Here.

637
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,878
8'11".

638
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,217
-Go.
-You can win this!

639
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,649
Measure it.

640
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,314
I think you're winning.

641
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,655
I'll hold your legs up
while he squirts it in.

642
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,943
Really get it in there.

643
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,956
All right, you're good.

644
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,207
-Get back over there.
-Yeah.

645
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,173
Steve-O, come on, win this!

646
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,261
-Right on...
-Right in the fucking...

647
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,183
Here he goes!

648
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,601
Dude! Do you see that

649
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,811
-brown shit in there?
-You're walking on it.

650
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,026
-Did I win?
-Yeah.

651
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,698
-The guy is so stressed!
-What do you got?

652
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,400
-11'6".
-11'6".

653
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,573
-Dave, you gotta get...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

654
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,714
-Fucking A. Wait...
-No, no, no, no.

655
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,543
That's where Steve-O already landed.

656
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,261
Oh, my God, dude!

657
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,393
That was it. 12'4".

658
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,262
Dave won.

659
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,098
-I would say we're all winners here.
-Hold on, Rick, here.

660
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,980
Dude!

661
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,312
Oh, my God!

662
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,781
It was quite a battle,
but we have a winner.

663
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,739
With a jump of 12'4", Dave England.

664
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:30,789
Yes!

665
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,417
You know when I learned...
I decided to really

666
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,959
learn to wipe myself was when
my mom wasn't home one day

667
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,165
and my dad had to wipe my butt.

668
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,423
And I did not feel comfortable with it.

669
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,672
I didn't like that dude wiping my butt.

670
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,678
And he was kind of rough.

671
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,728
Yeah. Fuck, yeah.
This is Treadmill Shit Show.

672
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,448
You made it!

673
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,079
Yeah, whatever happened
to the treadmills?

674
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,373
We got all kinds of awesome stuff.

675
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,042
We had it where we had
all the treadmills lined up

676
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,415
facing each other, and we all,
at the same time, jumped in,

677
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,292
and Steve-O hit me right in the face.

678
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,716
-You all right?
-Was it Steve-O?

679
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,093
Dave got kicked right
in his fucking face.

680
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,550
He deserves it.

681
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,727
-Everybody deserves everything.
-Yeah.

682
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,519
You deserve this.

683
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,621
-Fuck!
-Tail bone!

684
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,872
-I love it.
-You were rad.

685
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,879
I love watching you skate.

686
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:18,098
I'm here with TV's Ryan Dunn,
and today's his lucky day

687
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,773
'cause this is Treadmill D-Style.

688
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,225
Rehoboth Beach!

689
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,617
His face almost stuck
in Wee Man's bottom.

690
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,003
It got dark fast.

691
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,293
Human Cheetah is a bit
where someone gets shot up

692
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,844
with paintballs all over the body.

693
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,887
The outcome is that
the bruises from the paintballs

694
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,559
leaves spots everywhere

695
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,683
and you're supposed to
look like a cheetah.

696
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,229
Steve-O has a heart,
Pontius has a heart,

697
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,776
they didn't want to shoot me.

698
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,899
But they actually fucked my bit up,

699
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,398
because Dave, he doesn't give a shit,

700
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,613
and he fully shot me all on this side,

701
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,780
and this was Steve-O and Chris' side,

702
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:18,583
and I had, like, one or two over here,
and this side was just covered.

703
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:22,336
And the paintballs were so powerful,
I got cut up

704
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,710
on all the spots that I got hit on.

705
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,299
I'm Wee Man, and this is The Cheetah.

706
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,932
Ready, aim, fire!

707
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,145
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

708
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,357
-Fucking hell.
-I'm hit and fucking bleeding.

709
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:50,064
-I nailed him there.
-God damn, you got rocked!

710
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,776
-How long does it take to bruise up?
-I'm already bruising.

711
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,453
They're hurting right now, dude.
It hurts!

712
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,620
-Which one hurts the most?
-Right here.

713
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:05,455
-You're right, that looks painful.
-That, and then right here.

714
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,332
Let me see.

715
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,793
No! Inside!

716
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,630
That's gonna hurt so bad when you wipe.

717
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,631
-I know.
-Oh, my God!

718
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,717
Don't get poo -poo in it!

719
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:22,976
Half my body is still bruised up
over here from The Cheetah

720
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,641
that happened, like, nine months ago.

721
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,481
And this side has nothing.

722
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:28,982
This was all my bros,

723
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,230
and this is all the dudes that hate me.

724
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:37,449
-I'm not whipping your dick out.
-All right, well, pull the fat up.

725
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,121
Didn't get up.

726
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,991
-I'm at it.
-You're at it?

727
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,414
All right,
just, please, pull the zipper down.

728
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:45,836
-The zipper's down.
-No, it ain't.

729
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,379
What are you guys doing?

730
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,002
It's so warm!

731
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,719
-Is that your dick?
-Just try to hurry, 'cause I'm gonna piss.

732
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:54,883
You almost had it.

733
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,807
Here, here.
I gotta get in there bareback.

734
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,843
It's getting weirder and weirder.

735
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,603
This is awkward.

736
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,263
Grab the boxers.

737
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:05,981
Pull 'em down, man!

738
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,275
God! It's like a river.

739
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,776
Bros.

740
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,077
-Feel better?
-No, because of the balls!

741
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,080
Yeah. Yeah!

742
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,368
See? That's what I was talking about.
It was blocking it.

743
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,127
Do an intro, Winter Fat Fucks.

744
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,008
This is Winter Fat Fucks.

745
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,551
All right, now I'm ready to rock.

746
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,905
Hit the Winter Fat Fucks.

747
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,899
Fuck!

748
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:12,040
-Hey, grandma.
-Eat shit, fat fuck.

749
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,973
It's the slow shit I hate.

750
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,114
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah!

751
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,618
I did it!

752
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,870
So good!

753
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,415
This is a woodpecker,

754
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:51,287
and this is a Wood Pecker.

755
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,455
What's gonna happen next?

756
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:59,216
By the way, this is Dr. Jesse Merlin,
our resident bird expert.

757
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,968
Can I place the woodpecker
on the limb now?

758
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,799
If you would, please.

759
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:05,218
This is a breakthrough.

760
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,803
Thousands of years of medical science
have led to this beautiful moment.

761
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,139
Here, Woody. Here, Woody.

762
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,391
-Have led to me losing my dignity.
-Woody. Woody.

763
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,647
-Here you go, look. Woody.
-Believe me.

764
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,989
He's into me right now.
My day's gonna go terribly wrong.

765
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,655
-This is where the magic happens.
-Don't move.

766
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:23,948
Boy!

767
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,331
I don't envy you.

768
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,669
It's dented.

769
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,622
Get in there.

770
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,253
We have a puncture.

771
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,689
Someone give me a stick
to bite on or something.

772
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,191
I don't wanna scare him.

773
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,523
Don't move 'cause he's standing on you.

774
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,449
It's hard to hold my ground right now.

775
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,699
No you can't move
because he's fully on your schlong.

776
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,495
I'm gonna be careful...

777
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,833
That was flesh!

778
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:25,381
He's chewing on my pee hole.
Okay. One second, one second.

779
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,052
Chewing on my pee hole.
Sorry, man, that freaked me out.

780
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,228
That's not what I expected.

781
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,066
Oh, God, it stinks.

782
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,907
You gotta see this.

783
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,416
-Cute little butthole.
-Look how disgusting that is.

784
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,748
Like, what if you had to do that?

785
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,834
It's like a stunt.

786
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,254
Let's just do it. Let's go do it.

787
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,760
That's a formidable scent.

788
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,590
-Is that from the smell of that?
-Dude, the smell is really...

789
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,934
If I did a shit,
it still wouldn't be good as this.

790
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,220
Fucking disgusting.

791
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,514
I can't be there.

792
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,022
Sounds like that bull
is just dying to shoot.

793
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,023
He's making lots of noise,

794
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:24,107
and I know that's not doing one thing
for Wee Man's confidence.

795
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,032
He looks pretty nervous, too.

796
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,202
It's fucking nerve-racking, man!

797
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,370
When that bull sees you
and comes at you,

798
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,286
it's no joke.

799
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,787
I'm Wee Man, and this is the Yoga Ball.

800
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,799
Get away from the fence.

801
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,762
-He survived.
-Wee Man! Wee Man!

802
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,397
Get up here!

803
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,108
Oh, my God!

804
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,603
That's so scary!

805
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,735
-That was one big son of a bitch, dude.
-I had no idea.

806
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,162
He came out, dude, I was like...

807
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,451
Fuck!

808
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,828
-He looked much shorter in the gate.
-Yeah.

809
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,164
He looked way shorter in the gate.

810
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,920
-Hey, man, awesome, dude.
-Thank you.

811
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:23,090
-Good God! You're my man.
-Thank you, man.

812
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,838
You've had some good moments
in this arena, man.

813
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,801
-Yeah. Thanks, Gary.
-Where is that bull now?

814
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,516
-Wee Man!
-Wee Man! All right!

815
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:38,685
I'm the devil, and it's time to burn.

816
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:48,031
The Flaming Gauntlet is definitely
my most macho bit,

817
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,780
because I knew
that I was gonna get burned.

818
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:52,953
What's the plan here, O?

819
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,156
Well, I come along this beam,

820
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,034
these balls are on fire,

821
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:03,047
and they're swinging,
and they knock me into the fire.

822
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,381
The guy who ran the warehouse
where we shot the Flaming Gauntlet

823
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,548
was concerned that the heat
from burning the coals

824
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,554
was gonna crack his cement.

825
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,723
So, in order to protect his cement,

826
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,390
he laid down these steel sheets.

827
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,407
Yeah, I noticed that.

828
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,204
-Why did they put it on a frying pan?
-I don't know.

829
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,587
Really walking the line
between horror and humor.

830
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,549
This is a rough one, man.

831
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,004
Like, I'm a thrower,

832
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:53,089
and if I hit him with one of the balls,
he's going into the pit.

833
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:54,844
That's gnarly.

834
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,769
Holy shit! My ball's crazy, man!

835
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:11,782
I'm Steve-O,
and this is the Flaming Gauntlet.

836
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,484
Fuck! Fuck!

837
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:53,820
It's still on you, man.

838
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:01,324
-God damn it.
-Is it hot?

839
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,667
Yeah, man, it's burned.

840
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,619
Yeah!

841
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,333
Is your skin burnt or is it just...

842
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,752
-Yeah, look at that, right there.
-Yeah.

843
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,674
-Shit.
-It's gonna get...

844
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,510
-Yeah, it's really hot.
-You're burned, man.

845
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,839
Yeah, it's really hot.

846
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,845
-That's the thing about fire.
-I know.

847
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:19,971
It's hot.

848
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,762
I got burned all up the side of my body.

849
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,939
I had to go to a burn unit.

850
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,106
Shit!

851
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,608
Call the medic.

852
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,194
Dude, grab some towels.

853
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,779
What's your pain level at?

854
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,704
A normal person
would probably ask for a painkiller.

855
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,993
Well, you got your card revoked.

856
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:49,880
If you want the job done...

857
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,670
-Just rub it in a little more.
-... if you want respect...

858
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,835
So gay.

859
00:57:53,957 --> 00:57:56,219
I don't know any gay dudes that do this.

860
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:58,881
This will plug you up.

861
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:03,553
That's a man
that has nothing left to lose.

862
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:09,559
That's Brandon Novak,
and this is the Dildo Bazooka.

863
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:13,233
Jackass 3D: Full Penetration.

864
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,241
Oh, God. Jesus.

865
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,702
-All right. Ready?
-Yeah, yeah.

866
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:34,212
I had a tripod brought in,
so I can get a guaranteed hit.

867
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,177
Wait.

868
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:39,254
Here we go.

869
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:54,732
Can I see where it hit?

870
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,532
Oh, God!

871
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,575
-The skid mark.
-Laugh it up, guys.

872
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,117
Oh, my God!

873
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,374
-It's shaped like a dong.
-Dude.

874
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:12,046
And there's a dong pointing to it.

875
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,965
I finally made it, Mom.

876
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,091
This is the Flying Nut High Five.

877
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:26,976
I fucking slipped!

878
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,397
Oh, my God!

879
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:33,647
Flying Nut High Five
is the attempt to jump up in the air

880
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:34,894
running at another dude,

881
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,900
spread your legs,
and then knock your nuts together.

882
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,323
But it never worked.

883
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,617
Surprisingly difficult.

884
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:45,996
Bam's Liberace diamond -covered soles,

885
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,160
it's the worst thing ever.

886
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,588
-Did I get sabotaged or am I just...
-No they're both... Look at this.

887
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,502
You just don't know how to sit right.

888
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,674
It's this chair, man.

889
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,426
Fucking chair.

890
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,429
It's, like, the most flimsy
fucking chair I've ever met.

891
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,930
Shit!

892
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,478
Here we go again.

893
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,523
This is the Flying Nut High Five.

894
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,277
Why don't you guys take your shoes off?

895
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,706
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

896
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:34,043
We started off on the same chairs!

897
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:37,464
Look at yours, it's just crumbling.

898
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,300
-It's ruined.
-Fuck!

899
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,886
No...

900
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:02,064
Come on, man. Look at this.
We got a parachute, two of us on a bike,

901
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,569
and a massive ramp.

902
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,159
And this bike was bought last night
on the Internet. Am I correct?

903
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:08,578
Yeah. I think he went and picked it up
about midnight.

904
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,580
Seriously, this was bought at midnight,

905
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,665
-found online.
-Yeah.

906
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:16,169
So, explain to me what this scene is.

907
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:22,335
All right. We got Andy Bell
and Dave England riding a motorcycle

908
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,171
and hitting that ramp going really fast.

909
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:28,348
And Dave England's on the back of it
with a parachute,

910
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,847
and they're gonna ditch the motorcycle
in the air,

911
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,599
Dave England's
parachute's gonna go up,

912
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:37,520
it's probably not gonna deploy,
and he's gonna hit very hard.

913
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,522
-In the water?
-Yeah.

914
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,353
Hopefully.

915
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:42,858
I'm gonna laugh my head off.

916
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:47,776
I'm here with Andy Bell,
and this is the Moto Base Jump.

917
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:49,577
Yeah.

918
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,580
Here we go. Here we go.

919
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,294
Kids, don't try this at home.

920
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,389
-He almost did a full roll.
-Look at it.

921
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,897
That, dude, when they hit the ramp,
they almost buckled.

922
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,477
Holy shit.

923
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:27,816
This game is called
God's Special Purpose for Me is Over.

924
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:33,914
-It knocked the wind out of me so bad.
-It knocked the wind out of me, too.

925
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,083
I just saw my entry, I'm like, "Oh, no."

926
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,661
God, it gave me a nutter.

927
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,918
Are you gonna try it again, ladies?

928
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,920
Over and over till we get it right.

929
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,592
With you on the back, Eddie.

930
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:52,925
Fat-Fat is hungry for some chocolate,
so now I'm gonna feed him.

931
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,848
I'm Wee Bam.

932
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,941
This is the Ballway.

933
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,768
Shit's gonna get muffed up.

934
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,537
That's the cutest thing I ever saw.

935
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,544
The look on his face was so happy,
like a big, perverted Labrador.

936
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,128
Oh, shit.

937
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,476
Yeah!

938
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,072
Fuck.

939
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,865
Was that the corner?

940
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,827
-Fuck.
-Dave.

941
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,336
That's not good.

942
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,380
That was the corner, right?

943
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,547
Yeah, he's gonna have to see somebody.

944
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,425
-Let's help him over here.
-Hit my head on the fucking wall, dude.

945
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,846
-Yeah.
-Grab his arm,

946
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,173
so he doesn't trip and fall.

947
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,057
Party.

948
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,110
-What are you guys doing?
-Wow.

949
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,615
This is the Electric Limbo.

950
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,296
He couldn't let go.

951
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,458
We shot a lot with electricity.

952
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,970
Like, we built a limbo bar
that was totally charged.

953
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,964
The bar was electric.

954
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,139
-Like that.
-It's great.

955
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,383
No off to the side shit.

956
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,311
-Oh, man, it's tough.
-I'm not sure about your technique.

957
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,977
You're leaning forward.
You should be going backwards.

958
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,646
Go, go, go, go.

959
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,821
Fudge!

960
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,987
Yeah, Wee.

961
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,996
Electricity's a wild beast.

962
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,081
And it's an unpredictable beast.

963
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,166
Come on, Dave.

964
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:32,088
Fucking shit!

965
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,258
Fuck!

966
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,179
And it sucks. Electricity fucking sucks.

967
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:39,595
Okay, whoever licks the ladder
is the champ.

968
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,426
Go, Steve-O.

969
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,016
Let's party!

970
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,936
-You got it.
-Get on your knees.

971
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,192
-All right.
-Damn!

972
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,525
-No
-Get your tongue way out.

973
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,859
There's no danger. Yeah.

974
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,115
Yeah, just put it in.

975
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,538
-You got it.
-You've licked worse things.

976
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,033
-It's a party.
-There it is.

977
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:06,459
-You got it.
-Do it.

978
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,831
Go, go, go, go, go.

979
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,501
The champ!

980
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:23,059
Whenever the bit involves
Pontius' penis in a costume,

981
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:27,139
you don't wanna be
in the peanut gallery.

982
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:32,227
Hey, Chris, we don't need to see
your outfit from this side.

983
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,069
You don't need to. It's a bonus.

984
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,986
What most people don't know is,

985
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,816
we did a lot of penis-related stunts

986
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:42,075
'cause there's so many funny ideas
to do with the penis

987
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,993
that have been yet unexplored.

988
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:51,042
And Chris is insanely particular
about putting a costume on his penis,

989
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:56,046
and it took us about
six hours just to get it dressed.

990
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,592
Since we made it tighter,
this is like one thing,

991
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,339
so it doesn't hang like it did.

992
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:04,926
But wait. I think if you keep jamming it
in there, it will bend it down.

993
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,349
Keep stuffing it in there.

994
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,102
That's what I was trying to say.
I need some assistance.

995
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:14,607
Also, a lesser-known fact is
they scheduled them one after another.

996
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,947
First, it's like,
"Put your penis in the rat trap."

997
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:19,941
He's looking at it.

998
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,119
And then,

999
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,707
the numerous helicopter tugs.

1000
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,213
Swing around with it.

1001
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,047
I like, in particular,

1002
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,469
when it's the clear box with the cat,

1003
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:43,931
and he had it dressed up like a cat toy
with catnip all over it.

1004
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,972
I guess the idea was
he'd get it scratched up real bad.

1005
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,230
Dude, that...

1006
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,405
Apparently, catnip
is an aphrodisiac, too,

1007
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:04,657
because he was really loving
on that mousy.

1008
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:09,832
We were just hoping that mousy
didn't grow in size and stature.

1009
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,910
And Pontius was making
all kinds of crazy faces

1010
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,417
to keep that from happening.

1011
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,668
He's a powerful little bastard.

1012
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:21,677
And it's really awkward.
The cat even, I think, felt awkward.

1013
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,843
What's your definition of uncomfortable,

1014
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,179
stud?

1015
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,458
Oh, God!

1016
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,878
Hi, Priya.

1017
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,381
Man, you're jumpy.

1018
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:02,381
So, Priya Swaminathan,
who is head of development

1019
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,463
for our production company,

1020
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:07,799
is super jumpy.
She gets scared so easy.

1021
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:13,560
So, we've rigged a triple train horn

1022
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,060
in her office.

1023
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,231
She's gonna flip out.

1024
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:21,313
She's gonna... All I've gotta do
is hit this little button,

1025
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,570
which they won't let me hold yet.

1026
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,362
'Cause I'll fuck it up.

1027
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,677
Oh, my God!

1028
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,254
I'm fucking quitting!

1029
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:47,847
What happened?

1030
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,391
Fuck.

1031
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,179
Oh, my God!

1032
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,104
-Horrible.
-Oh, my God.

1033
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,899
You guys are lucky
that I didn't pee my pants.

1034
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:01,694
I try to not let that happen.

1035
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,699
That's so fucking loud.

1036
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:13,873
Oh, my God. That scared me.

1037
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,878
Knoxville always just pranks everybody
and always gets away with it

1038
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:22,628
'cause it's very difficult to get him.

1039
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,216
But we got him.

1040
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:25,960
We were showing
a cast and crew screening,

1041
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,383
and then they're like,
"Hey, come down to the front

1042
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,715
"and say something to everyone."

1043
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,552
I was actually getting choked up
talking to everybody,

1044
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,763
and then Kimmel runs down there
and says, "Shut up."

1045
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:47,986
Enjoy.

1046
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,082
Knoxville has prescription lotion,
and that's all he uses.

1047
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,080
And I got it.

1048
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,663
But I got something else.

1049
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:02,834
Horse cum.

1050
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,843
From a horse, idiot.

1051
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,922
Dude, did you get it directly
from the horse?

1052
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,678
I don't know.

1053
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,425
Pour some of that out.

1054
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,761
Yeah, pour some out.

1055
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,188
It reeks. That's fucking...

1056
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,690
All right, that's good, that's good.

1057
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:23,684
That is fucking disgusting, dude.

1058
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,857
-Did you pour some out?
-Yeah.

1059
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,193
-Squeeze it.
-Squeeze the ball. Squeeze it first,

1060
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,786
-and then stick it in.
-I don't know.

1061
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,363
-You're making a cum bubble.
-Look at the cum.

1062
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,291
-I don't know. I'm stupid.
-Dude, cum bubble?

1063
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,117
Dude.

1064
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,703
What are you doing?

1065
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,625
What are you doing with your life?

1066
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,047
Dude, I'm gonna throw up.

1067
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,795
-Here, switch.
-Here, come on. Just...

1068
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,626
Come on. Put the fucking thing
in the fucking thing.

1069
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,382
-I'll do that part.
-Just pour it in.

1070
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:51,800
Yeah, just pour it in.

1071
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:53,722
Just pour it in. Make it a little...
Let me see this.

1072
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,391
Look at it. It's sticky.

1073
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,054
Gross.

1074
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:03,724
Look at it.

1075
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:06,022
It's stringy.

1076
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:12,817
Watch.

1077
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:20,325
Put it back in his car.

1078
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,751
Yeah, I'm gonna put it back
in his car now.

1079
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,831
That's why it's so stringy!

1080
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,174
It's been that way for months.

1081
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:33,425
Dude.

1082
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,557
I'm sweating.

1083
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:52,774
They got me.

1084
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:56,115
I was rubbing horse cum on my face
for weeks.

1085
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:59,948
And I knew one day, the consistency
of my sunscreen had changed.

1086
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,200
It got super stringy.

1087
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:06,379
Super stringy! And I thought
it had just got so hot in the car.

1088
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:10,879
But no, it wasn't because of the heat.
It was horse cum.

1089
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:15,721
Before we started filming, I had a dream

1090
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,719
where we were on the set,

1091
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:22,895
and we were drawing a dart board
on my face with markers.

1092
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,563
And then I woke up from the dream,
and I was like,

1093
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,481
"We've gotta throw darts at my face."

1094
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:29,644
Knoxville and Tremaine
said that they liked the idea

1095
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:34,649
only if somebody shot darts
from their asshole through a blowgun.

1096
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:39,995
I'm Steve-O, and this is Fart Darts.

1097
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,687
That's good.

1098
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,364
That was in there.

1099
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,287
-It's bleeding.
-It's bleeding.

1100
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:27,790
God! You are awesome.

1101
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,620
-Look how deep that went in.
-Show the camera.

1102
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:32,548
-Look how fucking deep that went.
-Look at... Fucking... Look!

1103
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:33,883
Good job, Will.

1104
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:38,380
Knoxville's incredible nut shots,
that occupied some time.

1105
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,048
I figure, what, we filmed eight months?

1106
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:45,512
Two of them were incredible nut shots.

1107
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,559
How many basketballs
did we go through for this?

1108
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,812
Probably about 200.

1109
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:54,316
Because first you wanted
the women's basketball

1110
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,817
'cause you thought
that was the perfect one.

1111
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,648
Well, for different shots,
it's different.

1112
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,405
If you gotta throw it a great distance,
shoOting with the women's basketball,

1113
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,738
-you can throw farther.
-You got it down to a science.

1114
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,245
But it's true. When we first started
doing it, we would just get

1115
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,327
a bunch of different basketballs,
and throw them.

1116
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:12,255
But I realized that you need all the...

1117
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,502
Whatever thing you do,
you need all the basketballs

1118
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,505
the same size and the same pressure

1119
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:20,338
because it's hard enough hitting
someone from a great distance

1120
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:23,766
Or bouncing it. So, we trjed to remove
all the varjables.

1121
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:28,017
And it would take anywhere
from an hour to 13

1122
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,519
to just get one shot.

1123
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,032
Yes!

1124
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,590
Yeah!

1125
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:37,729
Yeah!

1126
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,023
Fuck that fucking shit.

1127
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:25,777
Fuck that.

1128
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,197
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough.

1129
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:30,573
Yeah, I do.

1130
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:18,329
Let go.

1131
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:52,697
Fuck!

1132
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,364
Oh, my goodness!

1133
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:36,662
Who put that there?

1134
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:40,032
It's Spanish Street Bike Tommy.

1135
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:43,244
Street Bike Tommy and Steve-O
had a baby.

1136
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:47,548
Steve-O and Street Bike Tommy
had this baby right here.

1137
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:48,669
He's cute.

1138
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,262
I got shit all over my balls.

1139
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:01,312
My balls are sitting in
a little bowl of poo water.

1140
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:05,982
Oh, God. I'm embarrassed.

1141
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,717
All right, this is piss from
a female donkey in heat.

1142
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:46,098
Why did you drink that?

1143
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:47,524
Because I'm horny.

1144
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,895
God!

1145
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:57,952
I don't think
you're getting the donkey hot, Steve-O.

1146
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,871
Dude, I don't even know
what to complain about anymore.

1147
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:08,959
My hand, my fucking chipped shoulder,

1148
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:12,257
my broken ribs, my hurt-ass knee,
which hurts like hell,

1149
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,630
and now a twisted fucking ankle.

1150
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:16,803
I don't know
what to complain about anymore.

1151
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,005
That sucked.

1152
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:27,723
Wait, you know what I forgot to do?

1153
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:30,734
When we got into London,
we actually, from the airport,

1154
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:34,234
we passed a town called Bicester.

1155
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:37,156
Get your tongue out of my mouth!

1156
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:42,738
It's so rough. It's like a cat's tongue.

1157
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:52,752
We'll have justice on three, two, one!

1158
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:57,753
Oh, my God!

1159
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,806
Oh, God. Do not throw hard.

1160
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:14,861
-That hurt!
-Let's see that run back.

1161
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:16,813
That's what I was talking about.

1162
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,707
Clear!

1163
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,126
You're a fucking asshole.

1164
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:06,500
