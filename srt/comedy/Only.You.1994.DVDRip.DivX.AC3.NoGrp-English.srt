1
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:24,267
Only you

2
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:30,403
Can make this world
seem right

3
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,583
Only you

4
00:00:36,882 --> 00:00:40,685
Can make the darkness bright

5
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:44,958
Only you

6
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:47,085
And you alone

7
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:52,763
Can thrill me like you do

8
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:58,675
And fill my heart with love

9
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:01,676
for only you

10
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,539
Baby, only you

11
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:13,982
Can make this change in me

12
00:01:15,853 --> 00:01:18,417
For it's true

13
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:23,994
You are my destiny

14
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:29,897
Stop pushing it. You're supposed to
let it happen, not force it.

15
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:32,906
- I'm not pushing it. You are.
- I am not.

16
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:35,807
You're doing it again.
You're pushing it. Stop it.

17
00:01:35,873 --> 00:01:38,310
Mom! Larry's pushing it!

18
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:43,182
- Larry, don't push it.
- I'm not. It's moving itself.

19
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:45,308
Wait.
I have to write this down.

20
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:50,619
Grandma said everyone has a soul mate.
This way I'll know his name.

21
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:54,423
The one I'm supposed to wait for.
The one that'll wait for me.

22
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,737
But, Faith, what if this guy
lived a billion years ago?

23
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:15,111
- What if he's a dead caveman?
- Don't be stupid, Larry.

24
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:19,415
Soul mates are our destiny.
They live when we live.

25
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:23,480
What if he lives here in Pittsburgh
and you just pass him on the street?

26
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:28,154
It couldn't happen. I'd know.
Like when bees know how to make honey.

27
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:31,255
And you'll know too,
cause you have one.

28
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,356
We all do.

29
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,672
Look.

30
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:53,310
"Damon Bradley."

31
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:09,630
My other half?

32
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,695
My soul mate.

33
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:31,553
She wants to know
if she's going to marry Alex.

34
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:35,060
I do not!
He doesn't even have a brain.

35
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:39,087
He's got pretty eyes. That means
your kids would have pretty eyes.

36
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,097
He can get a brain later.

37
00:03:41,164 --> 00:03:43,098
What do you think, Faith?

38
00:03:43,165 --> 00:03:46,535
The most important thing is true love.
Isn't that right, Kate?

39
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,004
Look out below!

40
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:55,411
Larry, I hate you!

41
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:58,040
- Bill is gonna be so mad.
- I know.

42
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:00,983
Next.

43
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:10,395
So, what destiny do you wish
from Madame Divina?

44
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:15,991
Just basic destiny stuff,
I guess.

45
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:19,093
But I don't want to hear anything bad,
if that's okay.

46
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:38,888
Something's coming to me.

47
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:42,792
I'm getting a name.

48
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,163
A name that is very important.

49
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:51,899
David?

50
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:54,464
No.

51
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:57,071
Damon.

52
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,467
His name...

53
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,774
is Damon Bradley.

54
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:06,111
Oh, my God.

55
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:10,510
Your destiny is $ 2.

56
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:20,928
The truth is...

57
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:24,729
you make your own destiny.

58
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,099
Understand?

59
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,105
Don't wait for it to come to you.

60
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:38,045
14 years later

61
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,048
"From the Latin root destinare...

62
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,216
meaning, to have destination...

63
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:51,225
to journey...

64
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,391
to take a trip where the events
are totally predetermined."

65
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:58,356
Imagine that.

66
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:02,167
The motion
of like attracting like.

67
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:06,301
The motion
of a divine preordination.

68
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:10,980
Okay. Look.
One hand, two hands.

69
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,479
Put them together...

70
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,850
and what do they make?

71
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,577
One.

72
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,819
Right! So, Plato tells us
we began in circles.

73
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:25,885
When we strived to be like the gods,
we were punished by a thunderbolt...

74
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,763
that struck us and cut us
right down dead center...

75
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,354
in half.

76
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,197
We scattered
to the ends of the earth...

77
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:37,034
searching and searching...

78
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:39,164
for our other half.

79
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:41,903
Now, what Plato was saying...

80
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:44,070
is that if we just stop...

81
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:46,204
and go with the flow...

82
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:48,715
and follow our destiny...

83
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,719
it'll lead us back to each other.

84
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,845
Okay, so following through
on this...

85
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:58,084
read from your green book.

86
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,684
Remember, one Wordsworth,
one Keats or one Shelley.

87
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,422
Have a great holiday.

88
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:25,008
Don't get up, Leslie.
I got everything.

89
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:28,317
- Kate, did you want me to help you?
- Oh, no. You might strain yourself.

90
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:31,483
- I would've helped.
- What is all this? What's going on?

91
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:35,121
Wine, candles.
What is it?

92
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:37,490
He proposed.

93
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:40,089
Faith, that's great.

94
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:42,431
Did he get down on his knees?

95
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,099
Well, no.
He turned down his beeper.

96
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:49,234
He's a doctor. He's practical.
He doesn't have to get on his knees.

97
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:51,242
Did you guys set a date?

98
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:55,112
Well, no. I don't think
we should rush into anything.

99
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:57,115
Let me see the ring.

100
00:07:58,215 --> 00:07:59,980
Where is it?

101
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,180
You don't have it on?

102
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,887
- I'm blind. Oh, my goodness.
- It's so pretty.

103
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,897
Where are my sunglasses?
It's gorgeous.

104
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:13,399
- I hate you.
- Oh, my God.

105
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:18,501
I asked him to give me 24 hours
to think about it.

106
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,007
I'm never going
to get divorced, so...

107
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:27,045
I'm telling you
what I told him...

108
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,775
that I need time to reflect...

109
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:32,842
and that I'm going to say "yes."

110
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:37,079
I told my parents
I'm engaged.

111
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:39,215
Oh, well
then it's official.

112
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,387
- Dwayne. What a catch. He's a doctor.
- He's so intelligent, Faith.

113
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:45,022
- He's a doctor. What do you want?
- Good sense of humor too.

114
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:47,795
- He's got a mild sense of humor.
- He's a doctor. It's a tradeoff.

115
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:50,165
He can't have a sense of humor too.
He saves lives.

116
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:52,067
He's a foot doctor.

117
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:54,663
He saves feet.
Feet are important.

118
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:56,674
Plus, he's tall.
Your kids will be tall.

119
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,644
Yeah. He's a sweetheart.
You don't have to sell me on him.

120
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,703
He's as good as gold.

121
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:03,714
What is it you're waiting for?

122
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:08,885
I'm not waiting.

123
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:10,888
Hey, Faith, grab me a beer.

124
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:13,892
Faith, don't wait.
You wait, you'll wind up with nothing.

125
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:19,527
Oh, yeah. Hi, Larry.
Yeah, she's here. Hold on.

126
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:23,033
- My brother for you.
- Uh-oh.

127
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,037
Stop it.
Don't eat my crust, Les.

128
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:31,944
You still there?
I thought you'd be heading home by now.

129
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:34,478
- I'm not. I'm here.
- What are you doing there?

130
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:37,949
Hanging out with your sister and Leslie.
What is it? You miss me?

131
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:41,783
Yeah, my heart is breaking for you.
Did you forget what night it is?

132
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:43,822
The guys are coming over
for poker.

133
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:46,517
Oh. I didn't know
you wanted me to play.

134
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:51,794
Very funny. Get home, make some
sandwiches and pick up some beer.

135
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:54,732
This is my one night out.
The kids are at Gus's.

136
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:57,563
- Give me a break.
- Kate, I still got lots of work to do!

137
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,465
Well, I've been in class
all day.

138
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:01,197
Class?

139
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,571
The guys are gonna be there
without anything to eat!

140
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,575
I'm a woman, not a menu.

141
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:08,373
All of a sudden
you're Helen Reddy.

142
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:09,810
Get home!

143
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,815
You're gonna embarrass me.

144
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:15,217
Fend for yourself,
because I'm not coming home.

145
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:16,947
I gotta go.

146
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:20,184
What?

147
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:22,658
It's Ezio Pinza.

148
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:23,818
Ezio who?

149
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:27,161
He was in South Pacific
with Mary Martin.

150
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:32,102
Why don't they write songs
like this anymore?

151
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:34,602
I've gotta get going.

152
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:37,607
No, no, no.
You gotta stay and watch this.

153
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:41,701
When you feel her call you

154
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:46,047
Across a crowded room

155
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:48,210
Then fly to her side

156
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:52,018
Saw a psychiatrist on Donahue say
that love songs are just a cruel hoax...

157
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:54,023
that feed people's fantasies.

158
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,028
Romance on a daily basis?
Nobody has that.

159
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,723
Yeah, but, Katy,
somebody wrote those songs.

160
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:03,527
They came out of
somebody's experience.

161
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,669
No, I think they came out of
someone's imagination.

162
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:11,464
Once you have found him

163
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,033
Never let him go

164
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:17,604
Once you have found her

165
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,115
Never

166
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:23,552
Let her

167
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:26,818
Go

168
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,835
Oh, my gosh.

169
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,303
Wow.

170
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:50,376
- Oh, look how it sparkles.
- She's a beauty.

171
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,004
Must've cost a lot.

172
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,180
Yeah, I researched a lot of diamonds
and gemstones for this. Learned a lot.

173
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,186
It's amazing how many variations
there are...

174
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:01,189
of pure carbon
crystallized into octahedrons.

175
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,027
But here's my real gemstone
right here.

176
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,325
Sweet.

177
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,804
- I know you don't like that. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Is it all off?

178
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,339
- Yeah, I got it all.
- Great.

179
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,400
You've got to show this
to Aunt Gloria and Aunt Lil.

180
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,707
They came all the way
from Pottsville.

181
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,077
- May I see it one more time?
- Oh, Leslie!

182
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,640
Oh, my God!
It's the perfect size!

183
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,651
Come on, sweetheart.

184
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,414
I feel like crying.

185
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,252
- I have a headache.
- Again?

186
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,451
Yes, but not
one of those headaches.

187
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,223
I have 50 bobby pins
holding my hair together.

188
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,229
What is this?
It's down. Put it up.

189
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,461
It's not exploitation.
Everybody wants money, right?

190
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,593
That's what makes
this country great, doll.

191
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:51,505
- Don't call me doll, okay?
- You used to love it.

192
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,632
Well, you said it differently then.

193
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,376
Faith?

194
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,410
- Faith.
- Oh. Yes.

195
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,779
I wore it,
my daughter wore it...

196
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,787
and I want you
to have the same joy.

197
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,960
And I must say I was thrilled
when Dwayne said you would wear it.

198
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,994
Dwayne?

199
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,960
- Where are you going?
- She's got another of her headaches.

200
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:24,905
It's a bobby-pin headache, Mom.
Talk to you later, Les.

201
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,068
- We're going. Can I have the keys?
- I've got the keys. Let's go.

202
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,406
Well, good night, okay?
Call me early.

203
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,810
Faith, I gotta go.

204
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,814
Call you tomorrow.

205
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,912
- It would mean a lot to her.
- It means a lot to me too, Dwayne.

206
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,923
- She's not a young woman anymore.
- She's already been married twice.

207
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,928
Surely we can do this one little thing
for her. Will you think about it?

208
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,589
- The thing is, you didn't ask me.
- Oh, my God.

209
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:53,362
Here comes your crazy uncle Pat.
He wants to take another picture.

210
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,800
- Ask me next time.
- Let me fix your hair.

211
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:59,034
- It's supposed to be like that.
- There. Now you're perfect.

212
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,801
One more. Good one.

213
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:14,815
- Sorry I'm late, Faith.
- Don't look!

214
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:17,618
Oh, dear. Okay.
Guess what. I'm free.

215
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:20,684
My mom and dad took the kids
to the lake for Labor Day...

216
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,697
so I was running around
getting that stuff together.

217
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,562
- Dwayne's not coming over, is he?
- No.

218
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,568
He had emergency surgery.

219
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:37,870
You can look.

220
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,243
Wow!

221
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:48,185
Faith, that's a dress.

222
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:50,222
I've decided it's romantic...

223
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:53,226
wearing the gown of the woman
who bore your husband.

224
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,195
I mean, my daughter
will wear it too...

225
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:57,661
someday...

226
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:59,425
maybe... not.

227
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:02,333
Wait a second.
Put the veil on.

228
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,336
It'll be okay.

229
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:11,436
- Sweet of her, wasn't it?
- Yes.

230
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:14,446
lf l had this dress,
I'd give it to someone.

231
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:19,013
- I look like a muffin.
- No, you look fine.

232
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:23,818
Did it come with the soundtrack?

233
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,415
I think it's built in here
somewhere.

234
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:28,723
There's probably
plenty of things.

235
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,856
It's the thickness.
We'll fix it. Don't worry.

236
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,865
I'll pin it a little bit.

237
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,867
We'll see what we can do.

238
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,273
- Life's not like it is in the movies.
- No, it's not.

239
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:45,743
Although from day one
everyone conspires to tell you it is.

240
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,072
Your mother, your father.

241
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:50,913
Teachers, priests, everybody.

242
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,977
Dreams come true. The good guy wins.
People live happily ever after.

243
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:56,987
All that crap.

244
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,923
Then one day you wake up
and realize that...

245
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:01,856
your life should be...

246
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:03,588
different.

247
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:09,659
Katy, dreams aren't crap.

248
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:15,072
Okay, what about
unforgettable moments?

249
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,538
You can't tell me
you don't have...

250
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:20,338
one memorable,
unforgettable moment...

251
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:22,845
because I know
you've had thousands of them.

252
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,812
We're having one right now.
I'm in my wedding dress.

253
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:32,450
Those are the things to notice.

254
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,694
Kate, what's wrong?

255
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:42,598
l don't know.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,370
Faith, I gotta talk to you
about something.

257
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:49,530
What?

258
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:53,543
Larry and l, we're just--

259
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:59,948
I'm sorry.
l have to answer.

260
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:02,953
Dwayne's having his calls forwarded.
Don't move.

261
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:12,728
- Dr. Dwayne Johnson, please.
- He's not in at the moment.

262
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:15,823
He's doing an emergency matrixectomy.
Can I take a message?

263
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:18,869
- Who's this?
- Faith, his fiance. Who's this?

264
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:22,805
Hi. I'm a high school buddy of Dwayne's.
Congratulations on your wedding.

265
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,671
- Thanks.
- I'll be in Europe, so I'll miss it.

266
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,973
- Aw, that's too bad.
- Be careful.

267
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:29,705
What's your name?

268
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,841
I can hardly hear you.
Can you spell it?

269
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:35,385
Yeah. D-A-M-O-N...

270
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,750
B-R-A-D-L-E-Y.

271
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:46,620
- Hello? Are you okay?
- What?

272
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:49,995
What's going on?
Who is it?

273
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,830
- Damon Bradley?
- Yeah?

274
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:56,498
- Where are you?
- I'm at the airport. Why?

275
00:17:57,605 --> 00:18:00,007
- Where are you going?
- To Venice. Why?

276
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:02,875
I love Venice!

277
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:06,246
I gotta run now, but maybe someday
we can all get together.

278
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,551
He hung up.
He hung up.

279
00:18:15,622 --> 00:18:18,560
It's okay, honey.
If he calls you once, he'll call back.

280
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,825
- Get me out of this.
- Hold on. There's a million buttons.

281
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:24,765
Whoa! Spin! Spin! Spin!

282
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,536
Jesus.
Where are you going?

283
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:30,595
To the airport.
Call a cab.

284
00:18:30,671 --> 00:18:34,111
- You can't just go to the airport!
- I'll be downstairs.

285
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:36,202
Change your dress!

286
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,077
Faith!
It's a coincidence!

287
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:49,556
It is not a coincidence.
You don't understand. It's fate.

288
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:52,560
I just wanna get a look at him,
that's all.

289
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:56,063
Come on, Faith!
This is insane!

290
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:15,074
- Stop!
- Be careful!

291
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:17,049
- Oh, God.
- Watch it.

292
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,915
Good luck!

293
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:22,747
Sorry!

294
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:35,999
Excuse me, sisters.

295
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:43,234
Flight 417?

296
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:46,246
The flight's closed.
Your boarding pass, please.

297
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:49,215
I misplaced it.

298
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:53,688
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass
we cannot let you on the plane.

299
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:56,578
- It's here somewhere.
- Great.

300
00:19:56,654 --> 00:20:00,186
Until you find it,
we can't let you on the plane.

301
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:03,095
Look, this is a real emergency.

302
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:08,070
Please let me on for just one second.
I really need to see somebody onboard.

303
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:12,039
I'm sorry. We have very strict rules.
They are for your own safety.

304
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:14,507
You could affect my life.

305
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,338
Just a moment, please.

306
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,586
This is Eric over at TWA.

307
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:30,818
We have a 237 on our hands here.

308
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,515
Uh-huh.

309
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:34,924
Yeah.

310
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:36,257
Thanks.

311
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:40,233
It'll be just a moment.

312
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:57,080
The man I was supposed to marry
is on that plane.

313
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:06,525
I'm telling you,
it is a miracle.

314
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,587
There is no such thing
as a coincidence.

315
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:15,727
Kate, if I don't get on that plane
I am going to regret it.

316
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,739
No, not today, but tomorrow
and for the rest or my life.

317
00:21:21,171 --> 00:21:24,268
It's Labor Day weekend.
I don't have classes till Wednesday.

318
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:27,809
Thank you!

319
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:31,780
Okay, my passport's
in the top left drawer.

320
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:35,219
Pack all my nice underwear,
anything non-wrinkly.

321
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:36,777
Don't forget my blow dryer.

322
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:41,922
Oh, Katy, you gotta hurry. The plane
leaves in an hour and 12 minutes.

323
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:58,073
Faith! Faith!

324
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:02,373
- My God, you smashed that lady.
- Oh, I didn't hurt anyone.

325
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:04,642
- Nice jacket.
- Hi.

326
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,844
- I'm coming with you.
- Are you crazy?

327
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,821
Oh, yeah. I'm crazy.
Sorry.

328
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:12,318
You can't go alone.

329
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:15,054
What if you make a mistake
you'll always regret?

330
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,029
Do I need to remind you
your wedding is in ten days?

331
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:22,262
Katy, look, I know you think
this is irresponsible...

332
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:25,600
but think how much more irresponsible
it would be...

333
00:22:25,668 --> 00:22:27,604
to marry the wrong person.

334
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,701
- I packed jeans and a dress.
- God, I wish l had a passport.

335
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:34,134
Excuse me.

336
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,479
I also packed that little red dress
you never have the guts to wear.

337
00:22:37,547 --> 00:22:39,209
I got the blow dryer.

338
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:42,550
Just get an adapter before
you plug it in. It could blow up.

339
00:22:44,687 --> 00:22:46,782
Why are we doing this?
It's insane.

340
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:51,524
What if Dwayne and I aren't meant to be?
It's not fair for me to waste his life.

341
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:54,224
She's right.
What if he's really her soul mate?

342
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:57,234
He's not her soul mate.
She's never even met this man.

343
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,738
She's waited her whole life for somebody
with a name she got off a board game...

344
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:03,399
when she was 11.

345
00:23:03,472 --> 00:23:05,840
You forgot about
the fortune teller.

346
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:11,982
Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry.

347
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:14,143
- We only got five minutes.
- Oh, God.

348
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:16,152
Bye, you guys.
Have a good time.

349
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,825
- Oh, my God.
- It's your hoops.

350
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:25,988
- Coming from or going to the wedding?
- Going. Come on.

351
00:23:27,395 --> 00:23:28,830
Good-bye.

352
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:35,237
So we're gonna fly to Italy and comb the
streets looking for a total stranger.

353
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:37,239
He's going to Venice, right?
Small city.

354
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:40,243
So I called six hotels
and found out where he's staying.

355
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:42,836
Let's go, girls.
You'll miss the happy day.

356
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:45,348
We'll see him tomorrow
and be back the next day?

357
00:23:45,414 --> 00:23:48,648
Exactly. He's registered
at the Hotel Danieli.

358
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:51,848
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- We get all kinds here, don't we?

359
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,182
Unbelievable.

360
00:24:07,068 --> 00:24:08,900
Hotel Danieli?

361
00:24:11,872 --> 00:24:15,004
So many planes.
l have motion sickness.

362
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:16,943
- Oh, my God.
- A boat?

363
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:19,141
- It's gonna be great.
- No, it's not.

364
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:22,152
- I don't feel well, Faith. I'm tired.
- Give me your hand.

365
00:24:22,216 --> 00:24:25,245
I'm a very good friend.
Do you realize that?

366
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,750
"The most serene."

367
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:59,256
Where people come looking for something
they can't find anyplace else.

368
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:06,654
- Faith, this is a Lifestyles hotel.
- What?

369
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,655
Lifestyles or the rich and famous.
We can't afford this.

370
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:10,657
Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.

371
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:31,509
Kate.

372
00:26:32,744 --> 00:26:35,113
He could be anywhere.

373
00:26:39,317 --> 00:26:40,752
Come on.

374
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,857
Reservations
for Faith Corvatch, please.

375
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:55,261
You could put the room
on this.

376
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:03,242
Could you please tell us
what room Mr. Bradley is in?

377
00:27:03,307 --> 00:27:04,742
Yes.

378
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:09,981
I can't stand it.

379
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:15,914
I'm sorry. Mr. Bradley
has already checked out.

380
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:21,917
Excuse me?

381
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:26,166
He just arrived today.

382
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:31,999
Mr. Bradley left
about half an hour ago.

383
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,266
Would you prefer an interior or--

384
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:37,276
You're saying he checked in,
then checked out? No.

385
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:40,279
You must be mistaken.
He's supposed to be here now.

386
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:44,344
I'm very sorry.
Perhaps you misunderstood.

387
00:27:45,216 --> 00:27:47,413
Perhaps you misunderstood.

388
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:49,078
Please check again, sir.

389
00:27:49,153 --> 00:27:53,993
lf you would check again, we'd really
appreciate it. Thank you. Damon Bradley.

390
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:56,153
With a "B."

391
00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:03,527
Room 217.

392
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,539
His key has been returned.

393
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,905
I'm afraid your friend
has departed.

394
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:13,137
Did he leave
any forwarding information?

395
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:16,339
Which way did he go?

396
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:20,649
I don't know.
We don't usually follow our guests.

397
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:24,714
Excuse me, sir.
I don't think you understand.

398
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,988
My friend has traveled a long way
to find this gentleman.

399
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:31,691
Anything you can do to help us
we would appreciate. Anything at all.

400
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:33,856
What?
I was just getting going.

401
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:03,795
Oh, he ate breakfast.
Thank God, 'cause I'm starving.

402
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:12,731
I think this is the room
Cathy Lee Crosby stayed in.

403
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:14,236
Garbage. Good idea.

404
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:16,536
Columbo always
goes through the garbage.

405
00:29:16,606 --> 00:29:18,872
Butterfinger. Butterfinger.

406
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:20,239
- Map.
- Three Butterfingers.

407
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:22,940
- Banana.
- Map? Is anything circled?

408
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,280
- Telephone message.
- Let me see.

409
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,113
It's in Italian.

410
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,620
We'll get somebody to read it.
Let's go.

411
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:36,859
This is a phone number in Rome.

412
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:39,863
You'd like me to call this number
and what?

413
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:42,422
Ask for Damon Bradley.

414
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:44,797
- Just ask, that's all.
- Okay.

415
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,959
Thank you.

416
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,863
And ask whoever answers
if they know Mr. Bradley.

417
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:51,532
Okay.

418
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,735
- Or where we might find him.
- Okay.

419
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:58,615
I'd ask for him first,
then go on to the other things.

420
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,149
Okay!

421
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:09,819
Oh, my God.
He's a priest?

422
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,257
It's a store in Rome.

423
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:31,113
He said some woman he works with
knows him.

424
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:33,081
Her name's Anna.

425
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:35,117
But she won't be in
till tomorrow.

426
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:37,483
- Let's go Rome.
- Rome?

427
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:39,487
Rome? Tomorrow?

428
00:30:39,553 --> 00:30:43,653
Tomorrow is sciopero generale.
Everybody will be on strike.

429
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:48,160
Good luck.

430
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,369
Everybody's on strike?
No planes, buses, trains?

431
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,873
Nobody shows up for work?
What kind of country is this?

432
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:16,291
The point is, we've been
on the wrong road for an hour.

433
00:31:16,356 --> 00:31:19,385
No, no, no.
The point is, we're looping.

434
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:24,960
We looped back around to that freeway
or turnpike or whatever they call it.

435
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,546
- Which way do we loop?
- Right.

436
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:42,115
Left. Right.

437
00:31:42,181 --> 00:31:43,616
Kate!

438
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:08,710
I told you a liter
was less than a gallon.

439
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:14,682
We would've had enough gas
if you hadn't gotten us lost.

440
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:20,087
Besides, a kilometer
is less than a mile.

441
00:32:20,152 --> 00:32:22,122
Right. Less than a mile.

442
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:25,628
So we should have been able
to cover more of them.

443
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:32,198
This is great.

444
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:50,150
I wonder what time it is
in Pittsburgh.

445
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,961
Sorry I got us lost.

446
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:10,003
I'm sorry I'm so edgy.

447
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,505
I'm afraid we're losing him.

448
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:26,620
I didn't tell him I was going
to the lake with the kids.

449
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:30,122
I told him
I was leaving him.

450
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:34,093
Leaving him?

451
00:33:35,594 --> 00:33:37,529
I think he's having an affair.

452
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:42,236
- How do you know? Did he say something?
- No.

453
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,032
- Did you see him with her?
- No.

454
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,038
- How do you know?
- I just know.

455
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:55,975
Kate...

456
00:33:56,046 --> 00:33:58,984
remember in junior high
when l had that Halloween party...

457
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:01,350
and we all played Twister?

458
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,616
You started to fall...

459
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:06,056
and instead of taking the spot...

460
00:34:06,123 --> 00:34:08,059
Larry reached out to catch you.

461
00:34:09,493 --> 00:34:13,127
He let you win.
He never let anybody win.

462
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:18,694
That's when I knew
he was head over heels.

463
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:21,705
That was a long time ago.

464
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:25,639
You know what I thought then?

465
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,804
I thought...

466
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:31,476
l hope someday l have somebody
who loves me that much.

467
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:37,221
I know he loves you.

468
00:34:39,857 --> 00:34:42,419
I know he would kill tigers
for you.

469
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:22,798
Okay, Mr. Cronenworth.
Let's check out this big guy here.

470
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:24,391
He looks pretty good.

471
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:30,740
This is a very simple procedure.
Won't take but about five minutes.

472
00:35:30,806 --> 00:35:33,744
I'm just gonna make
a plaster mold of your foot.

473
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:35,745
Dwayne, I gotta talk to you.

474
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:39,342
- Larry, I'm plastering a foot.
- It'll just take a second. Excuse me.

475
00:35:39,415 --> 00:35:41,715
- Where's Faith?
- At a teacher's conference.

476
00:35:41,785 --> 00:35:43,721
- Get out!
- Did she mention Kate?

477
00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:46,121
- She talks about Kate all the time.
- I think they're together.

478
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:47,622
What?

479
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:49,920
Kate left me.

480
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:54,521
I got home and there was a note
saying "I'm leaving." That's it.

481
00:35:54,597 --> 00:35:56,658
- No explanation, no nothing.
- Jesus. What happened?

482
00:35:56,732 --> 00:36:00,763
She's been acting kinda weird lately.
I should've seen it coming.

483
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:03,535
Babbling on and on about communication,
like I don't know how to communicate.

484
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:05,542
Do you believe this woman?
I'm sorry.

485
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:07,008
Sorry, Mr. Cronenworth.

486
00:36:08,143 --> 00:36:10,113
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

487
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:12,011
That's what I'm saying.

488
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:18,549
- Have you been fooling around?
- No. Of course not.

489
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,056
Where you get that crazy idea?

490
00:36:21,122 --> 00:36:23,958
I've got to finish this foot mold.
I will call you tonight.

491
00:36:24,024 --> 00:36:25,961
You hear anything,
let me know.

492
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:27,257
Good luck, sir.

493
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,467
It's just my future
brother-in-law.

494
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,162
Sorry about that.

495
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:36,002
This is going to be
a very nice mold.

496
00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:14,241
Taxi!

497
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:18,138
- Get in.
- I got it. Go, go.

498
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:25,146
Not a monastery.
It's a store.

499
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:28,054
No priests.
You know where that is?

500
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,991
- He knows where it is.
- I'm just asking to make sure.

501
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:41,998
I don't know why we had to return
the rental car. I would've found it.

502
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:45,007
We had to return the rental car
because you had us lost.

503
00:37:46,373 --> 00:37:49,106
- What?
- We're here already?

504
00:37:49,176 --> 00:37:51,270
- I told you we were close.
- Some trip.

505
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:52,778
Don't tip him.

506
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,757
Oh, good.

507
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:11,630
I'm looking for a woman
named Anna.

508
00:38:11,698 --> 00:38:13,634
I am Anna.

509
00:38:15,268 --> 00:38:18,833
Hi. I'm Faith. You don't know
how happy I am to meet you.

510
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:22,469
You see, I'm looking for somebody
and I was hoping someone here--

511
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:25,571
Well, you-- might know him.

512
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:26,738
Damon Bradley.

513
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:35,888
You know him?

514
00:38:37,156 --> 00:38:39,457
Okay, slow down.
What's going on?

515
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,088
- What's she saying?
- Something about a pig.

516
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:46,557
May l be of assistance?

517
00:38:46,632 --> 00:38:48,226
Yes!

518
00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:50,794
We're looking for somebody
named Damon Bradley.

519
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,309
Yes. Could you ask her
if she knows where we could find him?

520
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:06,922
He thinks she's going to meet him
at Galeassi Ristorante...

521
00:39:06,986 --> 00:39:09,582
tonight at Piazza
Santa Maria Trastevere.

522
00:39:10,856 --> 00:39:13,588
But she has a prior commitment.

523
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:15,127
Yes!

524
00:39:15,193 --> 00:39:17,528
Thank you.
That's all I needed to know.

525
00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:18,690
Thanks.

526
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:21,968
You are looking for
a place to stay, no?

527
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:24,663
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

528
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:27,799
Perhaps I can help.
I am Giovanni.

529
00:39:27,872 --> 00:39:30,274
- And you are?
- Kate.

530
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:34,309
I know a pensione. Bellissima.
And it's very close.

531
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:35,677
- Really.
- Kate.

532
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:37,776
- Let's go.
- Faith.

533
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:39,181
What?

534
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:44,352
I'm tired. I'm hung over.
I haven't eaten or slept for two days.

535
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,359
So back off.
I want a room.

536
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,858
- You were saying?
- It's this beautiful pensione.

537
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:54,867
I will take you there.
It's close.

538
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,868
- Well, thank you.
- Yes.

539
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:11,984
It's beautiful.

540
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:16,488
It's like the Trevi fountain.

541
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:27,566
Listen, Kate,
I must leave town for two days.

542
00:40:27,631 --> 00:40:30,899
I must go to my other shop in Milano.
It was unavoidable.

543
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:33,997
But the day after tomorrow
I return...

544
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:36,565
and I hope
you'll still be here.

545
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:22,889
Faith, whatever happens tonight
you're gonna be okay.

546
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:47,504
Why couldn't we just have
arranged marriages in America?

547
00:41:47,577 --> 00:41:51,517
Then you could spend your life blaming
your parents instead of yourself.

548
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:19,208
Go on up there and ask the maitre
if he's here. I'll wait.

549
00:42:19,274 --> 00:42:22,213
There he is. The maitre d'.
Go ask him. Go on.

550
00:42:22,277 --> 00:42:26,218
I will. I wanted to see
if maybe he'd notice me first.

551
00:42:27,516 --> 00:42:28,849
What?

552
00:42:28,918 --> 00:42:31,855
- I wanted to see if--
- Yeah, I heard you, Faith.

553
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,020
You waited since you were a kid to meet
this guy. Don't play hard-to-get now.

554
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:44,461
Could you go ask?

555
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:46,024
Me?

556
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:49,996
Oh, all right.
I'm going.

557
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:52,372
I'm gonna go.
All right.

558
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:55,070
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

559
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:12,693
- Okay.
- He's here.

560
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,252
- Him?
- Take it easy.

561
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:16,196
He's right inside,
by the door.

562
00:43:16,264 --> 00:43:19,361
Right-hand side, back to us,
navy jacket.

563
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:22,837
lf you turn around now...

564
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:25,602
you can see part of his left elbow.

565
00:43:30,812 --> 00:43:32,906
Oh! I can see his sleeve!

566
00:43:33,748 --> 00:43:36,720
Very exciting. Progress.
This is good.

567
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:41,423
I guess I should just
go introduce myself, huh?

568
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:45,360
You've traveled 4,000 miles.
What's 15 more feet, right?

569
00:43:46,093 --> 00:43:47,527
This is it!

570
00:44:16,656 --> 00:44:18,285
Uh-oh.

571
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:26,833
Sorry.

572
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:30,235
Kate!

573
00:46:06,899 --> 00:46:09,563
What happened?
Are you okay?

574
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:12,331
Where's your shoe?

575
00:46:12,404 --> 00:46:14,339
- I don't know.
- Okay, okay.

576
00:46:14,406 --> 00:46:15,840
Sit down.

577
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,971
Everything's okay.

578
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:22,380
- You can't say we didn't try, right?
- Right.

579
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,580
- Here's what I think.
- What?

580
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:31,921
We rent a truck or a car,
either one...

581
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,929
we set up a loudspeaker,
drive through the surrounding areas...

582
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,758
and page him.

583
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,429
- Oh. How nice.
- Yes.

584
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,196
Oh. Americans.
Allow me.

585
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,604
Thank you.

586
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:50,535
So, what do you think?

587
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:54,880
It's kinda sweet, huh?

588
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:58,417
I meant about my idea.

589
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:02,890
Oh. Well, I think it's time
we got some professional help.

590
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:06,051
- Like a detective.
- Like a psychiatrist.

591
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:08,116
How's a psychiatrist
going to find him?

592
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,661
Oh, dear.

593
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,161
Thank you...

594
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,931
very much.

595
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:18,126
8-B?

596
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:20,502
Yes. Exactly.
How'd you know?

597
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,541
Well, it's my life.

598
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:26,444
In the shoe biz, the foot is our naked
canvas. I could tell you some things.

599
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,245
For instance, this is a Stephane Kelian
knockoff made in Jersey.

600
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,250
I know the family.
Good quality control.

601
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,755
It's impetuous, fun, elegant.

602
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,755
Not much for cross-training.

603
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:41,590
I hope it brings you to whatever it was
you were running after just now.

604
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:43,593
Her destiny.

605
00:47:44,727 --> 00:47:47,665
Find your destiny.
Have you found it yet?

606
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,999
Excuse me. I have to go buy a book
and look up every hotel in Rome.

607
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:53,162
Okay. Excuse us.
I'm sorry.

608
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,236
Is your friend okay?

609
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:56,739
I don't know.

610
00:47:56,806 --> 00:47:59,141
She's looking for the man of her dreams.
He's around here someplace.

611
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:02,545
She's never met him, never seen him.
If you consider that all right.

612
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,147
Well, if she's never met him,
how does she know he's perfect for her?

613
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:10,415
Oh, I don't know.

614
00:48:10,486 --> 00:48:12,752
- He's some kind of celebrity, right?
- No, no.

615
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:14,758
Is he a hero, a mentor?

616
00:48:14,824 --> 00:48:17,887
No, she got his name
off a Ouija board when she was 11.

617
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:20,253
Let's get to a phone.

618
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:22,265
- Staying in Rome long?
- Taxi!

619
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:25,566
I'd better come along. I speak Italian.
I have a friend at the embassy.

620
00:48:25,634 --> 00:48:28,573
- I'm gonna help you out. Okay?
- This is a personal matter.

621
00:48:28,637 --> 00:48:31,576
- What's his name? I'll look into it.
- It's nice of you to offer, but--

622
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,474
Just tell me his name.

623
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:34,977
Damon Bradley.

624
00:48:36,912 --> 00:48:38,677
I'm Damon Bradley.

625
00:48:38,747 --> 00:48:40,274
You're--

626
00:48:42,618 --> 00:48:44,416
What?

627
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:51,928
Well, that's a first.
Uh, got a minute?

628
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:03,069
- What were you going to say?
- No, what were you going to say?

629
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:05,472
I don't know. I forget.

630
00:49:06,842 --> 00:49:09,574
- Are you too cold?
- No. I'm perfect.

631
00:49:09,644 --> 00:49:11,580
- Okay.
- It's perfect.

632
00:49:13,281 --> 00:49:14,613
- Are you?
- What?

633
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:16,652
Too cool?
No, I'm fine.

634
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:32,433
Thank you.

635
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:34,970
That was a blessing.

636
00:49:35,036 --> 00:49:38,498
She gave us a blessing.
An Italian Gypsy blessing.

637
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:47,516
- Isn't it amazing how--
- Isn't it amazing how--

638
00:49:47,581 --> 00:49:50,314
You're too pretty,
and I'm too nervous.

639
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:52,819
What?
Don't pinch me.

640
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:55,323
I want to see--
You are here.

641
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:57,825
Yes, I'm here.
I'm very real.

642
00:49:59,826 --> 00:50:03,790
What am I trying to think of?
There's this poem by Goethe.

643
00:50:03,864 --> 00:50:05,163
Yeah, Goethe.

644
00:50:05,232 --> 00:50:07,669
It's about two people
who come from different places...

645
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:09,671
but they hear
the same bird singing.

646
00:50:09,736 --> 00:50:13,074
"Perhaps the same bird
echoed through both of us yesterday...

647
00:50:13,141 --> 00:50:15,407
separate, in the evening."

648
00:50:15,476 --> 00:50:17,206
That's it. Exactly.

649
00:50:18,278 --> 00:50:19,712
Wow.

650
00:50:22,182 --> 00:50:24,881
Yeah. It was Rilke.

651
00:50:24,952 --> 00:50:27,013
Rilke. Oh.

652
00:50:27,087 --> 00:50:29,421
Well, same country.
Right?

653
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:31,152
How'd you know that?

654
00:50:31,224 --> 00:50:34,162
I could tell you some things.

655
00:51:07,827 --> 00:51:11,494
Some enchanted evening

656
00:51:13,066 --> 00:51:16,505
You may see a stranger

657
00:51:17,837 --> 00:51:20,239
You may see a stranger

658
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:24,610
Across a crowded room

659
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,276
I love trees.

660
00:51:58,544 --> 00:52:01,880
I could do nothing for the rest
of my life, just grow trees.

661
00:52:03,448 --> 00:52:06,512
The ancients believed that gods
dwelled in them. Did you know that?

662
00:52:08,654 --> 00:52:10,749
Maybe they're watching us now.

663
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:33,308
- Do you know where you are?
- No.

664
00:52:34,545 --> 00:52:37,712
You're at La Bocca Della Verita.
Ooh.

665
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:43,285
"The Mouth of Truth."

666
00:52:44,856 --> 00:52:47,885
Gregory Peck.
Roman Holiday.

667
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:50,954
Legend has it--

668
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:54,125
That if you tell it a lie...

669
00:52:54,198 --> 00:52:56,635
and you put your hand in there--

670
00:52:56,701 --> 00:52:58,637
It will be bitten...

671
00:53:00,003 --> 00:53:01,564
off.

672
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:05,409
And then Audrey Hepburn says,
"Oh, what a horrible idea."

673
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:11,382
Gregory Peck says,
"Let's see you do it."

674
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,581
Yes.

675
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,187
Let's see you do it.

676
00:53:18,422 --> 00:53:21,691
Let's do it together.

677
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:23,155
I was born to kiss you.

678
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:31,162
Oh, there's--

679
00:54:32,261 --> 00:54:34,960
Oh, God, there's--

680
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,731
There's something
I have to tell you.

681
00:54:40,803 --> 00:54:44,072
There's nothing you could tell me
that would change how I feel about you.

682
00:54:48,812 --> 00:54:51,180
I'm engaged.

683
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:54,276
We're supposed to be married
in nine days.

684
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,185
Oh, whoa!
Except possibly that.

685
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,951
Wait. What?

686
00:55:00,021 --> 00:55:02,721
- You're what?
- He's a friend of yours.

687
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:05,786
- What?
- It's Dwayne.

688
00:55:05,861 --> 00:55:07,854
- Dwayne?
- That's how I knew you were here.

689
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,802
It was me on the phone
from the airport.

690
00:55:11,867 --> 00:55:14,862
- I thought I'd never find you.
- I understand. I know.

691
00:55:16,505 --> 00:55:18,441
It's okay.

692
00:55:20,743 --> 00:55:23,943
I gotta--
I gotta call him.

693
00:55:24,012 --> 00:55:26,381
No, that's not
such a good idea.

694
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,112
- Don't call him.
- I gotta call him.

695
00:55:29,184 --> 00:55:32,179
- Trust me.
- I gotta call him.

696
00:55:32,254 --> 00:55:35,090
- I gotta.
- Are you sure?

697
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:39,296
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

698
00:55:41,429 --> 00:55:42,522
Wait.

699
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:44,658
Oh, okay.

700
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,662
- Want some more champagne?
- Mm-mm.

701
00:56:04,451 --> 00:56:07,754
- Can l use the phone?
- No, not really.

702
00:56:09,724 --> 00:56:12,126
Look.

703
00:56:12,192 --> 00:56:14,630
- I have a confession to make too.
- Yeah?

704
00:56:14,695 --> 00:56:16,791
Yeah.

705
00:56:16,864 --> 00:56:19,096
- You can tell me.
- Are you sure?

706
00:56:20,435 --> 00:56:23,930
Yeah.
We found each other, didn't we?

707
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:31,146
So this is our destiny.
So you can tell me anything.

708
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,307
Okay.

709
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:36,352
Um, it's just that--

710
00:56:36,417 --> 00:56:39,321
- The thing is, I'm not exactly--
- Yeah?

711
00:56:39,386 --> 00:56:41,720
Only in the most literal sense...

712
00:56:41,788 --> 00:56:43,051
I'm not Damon Bradley.

713
00:56:44,124 --> 00:56:46,061
- What?
- My name's not Damon Bradley.

714
00:56:46,126 --> 00:56:48,723
- I just told you it was.
- What is it?

715
00:56:48,795 --> 00:56:51,232
It's Peter Wright.

716
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:55,729
Obviously you're very upset.
That's natural. That's okay.

717
00:56:55,802 --> 00:56:57,932
I'm sorry!

718
00:56:58,005 --> 00:57:00,770
Everything else is true!
I'm from Boston. I'm single.

719
00:57:00,841 --> 00:57:04,041
I love trees. Mea culpa.
I lied about one little thing!

720
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,580
Your identity is one little thing?

721
00:57:06,645 --> 00:57:09,584
- Get out of my way!
- You said you'd understand.

722
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:12,485
That was before
I knew what it was!

723
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,450
- Come on.
- Open.

724
00:57:16,522 --> 00:57:19,289
Let's calm down, okay?
let's put this in perspective.

725
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,452
Jesus!

726
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:24,524
I can't believe you're gonna let a few
letters of the alphabet keep us apart.

727
00:57:24,598 --> 00:57:26,534
It is a detail.

728
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,298
- Call me Damon. It'll be a nickname.
- How could you do this to me?

729
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:30,997
Because I'm in love with you!

730
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,531
What kind of excuse is that?

731
00:57:35,308 --> 00:57:36,833
Sociopaths.

732
00:57:36,909 --> 00:57:39,608
They find out what you want them to be,
then they act that way.

733
00:57:39,678 --> 00:57:41,740
But how could he know?

734
00:57:41,814 --> 00:57:44,114
He only just met me.

735
00:57:44,183 --> 00:57:47,418
Men have ways.
That's all I know.

736
00:57:47,487 --> 00:57:48,921
Here.

737
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:58,832
You know what my theory is?
Men should all get team jerseys.

738
00:57:58,898 --> 00:58:01,301
On the front,
they can write "liars."

739
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:04,532
On the back, their name.
Their real one.

740
00:58:08,206 --> 00:58:10,507
Yeah.

741
00:58:13,746 --> 00:58:15,339
Look at me.

742
00:58:16,314 --> 00:58:18,148
I married a liar.

743
00:58:18,216 --> 00:58:21,713
Why?
'Cause I married a man.

744
00:58:42,374 --> 00:58:44,310
Here. Throw these in.

745
00:59:07,598 --> 00:59:11,129
So you're saying you think
I should call him, huh?

746
00:59:12,836 --> 00:59:15,433
- It's your husband, no?
- Yes.

747
00:59:16,507 --> 00:59:19,776
But he was having an affair.

748
00:59:22,046 --> 00:59:25,679
I don't think you understand.
He was sleeping with another woman.

749
00:59:29,453 --> 00:59:31,686
He was having sex
with another woman.

750
00:59:31,756 --> 00:59:33,315
Sex.

751
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:38,921
She was your best friend, eh?

752
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:41,593
- She wasn't my best friend.
- Your sister?

753
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:44,158
No, of course not.

754
00:59:44,234 --> 00:59:46,467
His first wife?

755
00:59:46,537 --> 00:59:49,441
No one like that.
Not a friend, relative or anything.

756
00:59:49,507 --> 00:59:51,500
Just some woman I don't know.

757
00:59:51,575 --> 00:59:54,011
I've never met her or anything.

758
01:00:11,094 --> 01:00:14,123
Hey, Marty! Wait up!

759
01:00:14,197 --> 01:00:16,360
- You're going on the south side.
- I got it.

760
01:00:16,432 --> 01:00:18,630
Don't get up on that roof
till it stops raining.

761
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:21,172
Should let up any minute now.

762
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:25,503
Oh, damn. The phone.

763
01:00:30,413 --> 01:00:32,349
Larry's Roofing.

764
01:00:36,919 --> 01:00:39,185
Kate?

765
01:00:39,255 --> 01:00:41,282
Is that you?

766
01:00:41,356 --> 01:00:44,261
Kate, where are you?

767
01:00:44,326 --> 01:00:46,854
Kate, are you all right?

768
01:00:52,268 --> 01:00:53,703
Jesus!

769
01:01:16,725 --> 01:01:19,697
Yes. Could I get
the long-distance operator again?

770
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:21,697
Forget it.

771
01:01:24,466 --> 01:01:26,595
Coming.

772
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:30,106
- I just wanted... Is she here?
- No.

773
01:01:30,172 --> 01:01:32,939
- Oh, we've gotta talk.
- I was just on my way out.

774
01:01:33,008 --> 01:01:35,605
We can work this out.
Is she okay?

775
01:01:35,677 --> 01:01:38,912
She's fine. She went to get
our airline tickets home.

776
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,781
Is this a genetic thing?
Men say anything just to get laid?

777
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:44,480
Not fair.
A: I didn't get laid.

778
01:01:44,552 --> 01:01:47,889
B: The reality is, some metaphysical
wires got crossed somewhere.

779
01:01:47,956 --> 01:01:50,153
I don't have the right name,
but I am the guy.

780
01:01:50,225 --> 01:01:53,061
I was there. I know it.
Please, do not let her go.

781
01:01:53,128 --> 01:01:55,531
She's going, and she's
going to marry the podiatrist.

782
01:01:55,597 --> 01:01:57,999
- Podiatrist? That's deep.
- How could you lie to her like that?

783
01:01:58,066 --> 01:02:00,366
It was an emergency.
I literally had to.

784
01:02:00,435 --> 01:02:04,170
It was the only way to stop her.
If I didn't, I'd never see her again.

785
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:07,303
- A lie's a lie.
- Please! Please?

786
01:02:07,376 --> 01:02:09,869
Will you sit down
for one second?

787
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:14,409
Thank you.

788
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:18,411
I am not supposed to be in Rome.

789
01:02:18,486 --> 01:02:22,016
I'm supposed to be in Boston,
leading a really boring life...

790
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:26,622
working my can off for my boss
so he can spend half the day in the gym.

791
01:02:26,694 --> 01:02:28,288
But I'm here.

792
01:02:28,363 --> 01:02:30,595
He was not supposed
to get measles.

793
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,768
Measles at 43 years of age.

794
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:36,670
But he did,
so they sent me--

795
01:02:36,737 --> 01:02:39,174
a guy who's never been anywhere
except maybe Mazatl\E1n...

796
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,175
for spring break.

797
01:02:41,241 --> 01:02:44,509
And someone gave me an Italian
phrase book the week before I left.

798
01:02:44,577 --> 01:02:47,345
I was not supposed to be
in the piazza that night...

799
01:02:47,414 --> 01:02:48,507
but I was.

800
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:50,917
I went to see a movie,
but in my opinion...

801
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:53,752
Woody Allen is not funny
when it's dubbed in Italian.

802
01:02:53,821 --> 01:02:56,816
So I left
and I was just wandering.

803
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,825
And then someone bumped into me.

804
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:10,905
And then I saw her.
I looked into her eyes and--

805
01:03:10,971 --> 01:03:13,669
Wow, something happened
that's never happened to me before.

806
01:03:14,674 --> 01:03:18,842
- Something so familiar.
- Mania?

807
01:03:18,912 --> 01:03:22,875
Whatever. She fell in love
with me too, by the way.

808
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:25,978
I said, "Please, God, give me a sign,
some way of making sure...

809
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:30,084
this woman does not get into that cab
and disappear from my life forever.

810
01:03:30,157 --> 01:03:32,923
She's the one."

811
01:03:32,992 --> 01:03:35,520
And He did,
'cause she told me the name.

812
01:03:35,595 --> 01:03:38,624
It wasn't my name,
but it was a start.

813
01:03:38,698 --> 01:03:41,568
lf that's not destiny...

814
01:03:41,634 --> 01:03:44,367
then I don't know anything.

815
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,341
That's really romantic.

816
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:53,246
- Is it a lie?
- Come on!

817
01:03:53,312 --> 01:03:55,909
It is a name, for Christ's sake.
This whole thing is ludicrous.

818
01:03:55,982 --> 01:03:59,148
You know she's out of her mind,
chasing some guy around.

819
01:03:59,218 --> 01:04:01,313
This guy, by the way,
could happen to be...

820
01:04:01,387 --> 01:04:03,881
the biggest loser
on the face of the Earth.

821
01:04:03,957 --> 01:04:06,895
He could be a grump, a jerk,
a pervert, a cynic...

822
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,421
some guy whose mind is infested
with dark thoughts, a criminal.

823
01:04:11,664 --> 01:04:13,601
He could be...

824
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:15,602
truly sick.

825
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:19,298
Realistically,
what are the odds...

826
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:23,004
that he's some extra-super,
double-terrific guy?

827
01:04:25,176 --> 01:04:27,808
- Ten billion to one.
- Exactly!

828
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,816
Do I have an ally?

829
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:31,250
I have returned.

830
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,946
I have returned.

831
01:04:33,018 --> 01:04:36,719
Faith's friend, Peter.
Giovanni. Hi.

832
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:41,495
I thought we could see Roma today,
but if you are busy--

833
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,430
No! Faith's friend.
Let's go.

834
01:04:44,497 --> 01:04:45,931
Good.

835
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:57,736
And my husband Larry,
he's a roofer.

836
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,780
Roofing contractor, actually.

837
01:05:00,846 --> 01:05:02,782
I mean, thank you.

838
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:06,887
Before that,
when he was younger, he painted.

839
01:05:06,952 --> 01:05:09,013
Not houses but pictures.

840
01:05:09,087 --> 01:05:11,319
Yeah. But...

841
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:14,122
you can't raise a family
on paintings.

842
01:05:17,862 --> 01:05:20,230
I guess you have to
go back to work now, huh?

843
01:05:20,297 --> 01:05:23,098
Oh, no. It's siesta.

844
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:24,431
Oh.

845
01:05:24,502 --> 01:05:27,838
You see, at home only the kids
take naps in the afternoon.

846
01:05:27,905 --> 01:05:29,966
Adults go straight through.

847
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:33,446
Me, I don't even lie down
at all...

848
01:05:33,511 --> 01:05:35,242
during the day.

849
01:05:35,313 --> 01:05:38,217
Yes. In America,
you care for work.

850
01:05:38,283 --> 01:05:40,253
You live to work.
You stop for nothing.

851
01:05:41,586 --> 01:05:42,747
But in Italy...

852
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:45,917
we care for food,
for pleasure...

853
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:49,294
for love.

854
01:05:51,228 --> 01:05:53,698
- Biscuit?
- Yes.

855
01:06:10,081 --> 01:06:11,344
It's crunchy.

856
01:06:14,518 --> 01:06:16,454
Mm, thank you.

857
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:49,751
I was able to get us out
on the first flight tomorrow morning.

858
01:06:49,818 --> 01:06:51,880
8:00 a.m.

859
01:06:51,954 --> 01:06:54,187
8:00 a.m.?

860
01:06:54,257 --> 01:06:57,559
- So soon?
- The sooner the better.

861
01:06:59,129 --> 01:07:03,069
You were right about this whole thing
from the beginning.

862
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:06,071
Stupid. Chasing a name.

863
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:12,000
- I had to try.
- What about Peter?

864
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:15,406
- Peter?
- Yeah.

865
01:07:15,478 --> 01:07:17,745
- Peter was a mistake.
- I don't know.

866
01:07:18,648 --> 01:07:20,641
Thought he was kinda fun, huh?

867
01:07:20,716 --> 01:07:23,414
He was eccentric at best...

868
01:07:23,485 --> 01:07:25,011
and not in a good way.

869
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:27,615
- You mean, like your way?
- Yeah.

870
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:29,717
No. Very funny.

871
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:41,028
What?

872
01:07:41,103 --> 01:07:43,266
You're crazy about him.

873
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:44,773
I am not.

874
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,366
You are too.

875
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:48,275
I hate him.

876
01:07:48,344 --> 01:07:52,579
That's a strong response for someone
you said you didn't even like.

877
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:55,483
I hated what he did.

878
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:59,251
Good, 'cause that's what I told him
when he dropped off the flowers.

879
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:02,088
You told him
that I hated him?

880
01:08:02,157 --> 01:08:04,389
Can't stand him, huh?

881
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:15,469
Hey, Katarina.
La bella Italia, she's waiting.

882
01:08:15,537 --> 01:08:18,168
- Let's go.
- I'll be right down.

883
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:24,109
You better start packing.
Our cab's coming at the crack of dawn.

884
01:08:24,178 --> 01:08:26,478
He promised to take me
on a tour of the fountains.

885
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:30,843
But I'll stay.

886
01:08:30,918 --> 01:08:33,151
I'm not gonna go.
If you want me to stay, I'll stay.

887
01:08:36,758 --> 01:08:40,197
He knows I'm married.
I'll be back before dawn.

888
01:08:46,267 --> 01:08:49,262
The 16th century
exalted the human tigure.

889
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:52,777
It was their way
of glorifying the human spirit.

890
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:56,040
But it's an ancient preoccupation.

891
01:08:56,109 --> 01:08:58,478
You see, the female body...

892
01:08:58,546 --> 01:09:01,712
has always been the essence...

893
01:09:01,782 --> 01:09:04,686
the mystery of human life.

894
01:09:04,752 --> 01:09:08,692
So someday I'll visit you
in Pittsburgh...

895
01:09:08,756 --> 01:09:11,694
and you'll show me
all her beauties, hmm?

896
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:48,223
Oh, Marcello.

897
01:09:48,295 --> 01:09:52,999
I'll need a taxi tomorrow morning
at 6:30 to go to the airport.

898
01:09:53,066 --> 01:09:55,628
- Okay. Thank you.
- Ah, Signorina Faith.

899
01:09:55,701 --> 01:09:58,902
- Yes?
- Peter Wright left messages for you.

900
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:02,433
- He calls all the time.
- No phone calls for me.

901
01:10:02,508 --> 01:10:05,242
Thank you. Ow!

902
01:10:07,447 --> 01:10:10,214
You stubbed your toe.

903
01:10:10,283 --> 01:10:12,219
I know I stubbed my toe.

904
01:10:13,386 --> 01:10:14,877
Well?

905
01:10:14,954 --> 01:10:17,755
- Go away.
- Don't you think that's a sign?

906
01:10:17,824 --> 01:10:20,193
- Oh! A sign.
- It's obvious.

907
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:23,164
He's a foot doctor, pain is your body's
way to tell you something's wrong.

908
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:25,359
Your toe's trying to tell you
not to marry Dwayne.

909
01:10:25,432 --> 01:10:28,562
My toe is telling me
I've been hurt by a shoe salesman.

910
01:10:28,634 --> 01:10:31,731
- What about last night?
- What about, you're a liar?

911
01:10:31,803 --> 01:10:34,468
- What about "I was born to kiss you"?
- What about--

912
01:10:34,539 --> 01:10:37,877
Oon't you have to work?
Maybe you're not a shoe salesman.

913
01:10:37,944 --> 01:10:40,745
The truth is, you came here looking
for something and you found it.

914
01:10:40,813 --> 01:10:43,010
It's right in back of you.
You're frightened.

915
01:10:43,082 --> 01:10:46,282
That's understandable.
I couldn't even sleep last night.

916
01:10:46,352 --> 01:10:48,949
Peter, stop.

917
01:10:49,021 --> 01:10:51,014
Last night was an illusion.

918
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:55,326
You weren't who you said you were,
so I wasn't who I thought I was...

919
01:10:55,394 --> 01:10:57,728
so neither of us were there.

920
01:10:57,796 --> 01:11:00,768
It wasn't real.
It didn't happen.

921
01:11:00,832 --> 01:11:02,130
I don't know you.

922
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,794
Get to know me.

923
01:11:04,936 --> 01:11:06,872
- We're not supposed to be.
- Yes, we are.

924
01:11:06,938 --> 01:11:09,637
Don't throw your life away
on someone you don't love.

925
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:11,905
Who says I don't love him?

926
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,517
Uh, all right.

927
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:22,588
Go home and marry your podiatrist.

928
01:11:23,922 --> 01:11:26,485
I hope you'll be
very happy together.

929
01:12:09,567 --> 01:12:11,503
Oh, I'm sorry.

930
01:12:13,337 --> 01:12:15,638
Oh, okay. All right.

931
01:12:22,012 --> 01:12:23,538
Faith!

932
01:12:29,353 --> 01:12:31,323
Wait, wait!

933
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,492
You can't go.

934
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:40,398
- Why can't I go?
- Because I found him.

935
01:12:40,464 --> 01:12:41,557
Stop the car.

936
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,002
Whoa! I'm okay.

937
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:48,041
I couldn't sleep last night.
For some reason, I was a wreck.

938
01:12:48,105 --> 01:12:51,339
So what did I do? I went
to that restaurant, La Galeassi.

939
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:54,005
You want me to take that for you?
I had a chocolate gelato.

940
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,548
I talked to the waiter
asked him a couple of questions.

941
01:12:56,613 --> 01:13:00,884
Turns out-- I'll get it--
He knew the name of Damon's hotel.

942
01:13:00,951 --> 01:13:03,250
- You're kidding.
- No, it's right.

943
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:06,485
I call the hotel.
They say, "No, he left yesterday."

944
01:13:06,556 --> 01:13:09,926
But apparently he comes here every year
and always follows the same route.

945
01:13:09,993 --> 01:13:12,556
He always goes from Rome
down the coast...

946
01:13:12,629 --> 01:13:15,795
to La Sirenuse Hotel
in Positano.

947
01:13:15,865 --> 01:13:18,165
- Where's Positano?
- Three hours south.

948
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:20,933
- Did I do the right thing?
- Great! We can call Giovanni.

949
01:13:21,004 --> 01:13:22,871
- What? It's perfect.
- He can drive us.

950
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:25,638
- We can all go down together.
- It's really perfect.

951
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:27,702
I did the right thing.
She won't say it.

952
01:13:27,777 --> 01:13:29,212
You did.

953
01:13:54,003 --> 01:13:57,635
You know what I think?
Anything can happen here.

954
01:14:13,656 --> 01:14:16,628
Kate, look down there.
Magnifico.

955
01:14:16,692 --> 01:14:18,628
Oh, God.

956
01:14:50,592 --> 01:14:52,528
Oh. Is it over?

957
01:14:53,794 --> 01:14:55,731
Where's the guy
with the checkered flag?

958
01:14:58,533 --> 01:15:00,469
Okay, Faith. Hold on.

959
01:15:03,338 --> 01:15:06,002
Oh, my God.
Faith, Joan Collins stayed here.

960
01:15:29,964 --> 01:15:34,406
Well, right now
he's by the pooI.

961
01:15:34,469 --> 01:15:37,064
He says he wears
a gold medallion.

962
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,409
- Want to check out the pool?
- Mm-hmm.

963
01:15:44,578 --> 01:15:46,673
Let's go. This way.

964
01:15:54,321 --> 01:15:57,259
Oh, look at this.
Isn't this beautiful?

965
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:05,629
I hate men
that wear jewelry.

966
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:37,223
That's Damon Bradley?

967
01:16:45,338 --> 01:16:47,774
Aren't you going to
introduce yourself?

968
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,933
Of course.

969
01:16:51,043 --> 01:16:53,606
- Do you want me to do it?
- No.

970
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,615
Good luck.

971
01:17:19,271 --> 01:17:21,207
You're in my sun.

972
01:17:22,374 --> 01:17:25,039
Oh, I'm sorry.

973
01:17:26,378 --> 01:17:29,647
- I thought I...
- Damon!

974
01:17:29,715 --> 01:17:32,550
I'll see you tomorrow.
Ciao.

975
01:17:34,419 --> 01:17:35,683
Ciao, Amanda.

976
01:18:04,883 --> 01:18:07,218
- Damon?
- Uh-huh.

977
01:18:07,286 --> 01:18:09,813
- Damon Bradley?
- That's me.

978
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:14,183
Beautiful place.

979
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,858
You know, it sure is.

980
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:20,364
Yeah.

981
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:29,069
Been here long?

982
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,871
Since yesterday.

983
01:18:30,942 --> 01:18:33,037
I just got here too.

984
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:35,708
Not yesterday.
Just now. Just today.

985
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:38,911
With my sister-in-law,
my brother's wife.

986
01:18:38,983 --> 01:18:41,078
Wife. Yes.

987
01:18:42,854 --> 01:18:46,918
- I'm sure I'll see you around.
- Oh, I hope so.

988
01:18:49,326 --> 01:18:51,159
You know...

989
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:53,164
I was wondering.

990
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:58,094
Do you have dinner plans?

991
01:18:58,168 --> 01:19:00,298
Not exactly.

992
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:04,039
Would you be willing
to have dinner with me?

993
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:09,578
Sure.

994
01:19:09,647 --> 01:19:11,412
Really?

995
01:19:15,452 --> 01:19:17,285
Where?

996
01:19:17,354 --> 01:19:20,258
There's a restaurant
at the bottom of the steps.

997
01:19:20,323 --> 01:19:23,784
It's called
ll Covo del Sara-something.

998
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,830
It's great. 8:30?

999
01:19:25,895 --> 01:19:27,831
- Sounds good?
- Covo del Something.

1000
01:19:27,898 --> 01:19:30,870
I'll see you at 8:30
at the bottom--

1001
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:35,168
- Watch your step. You okay?
- I'm sorry. It's okay.

1002
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:39,178
- I'll see you there.
- What's your name?

1003
01:19:39,242 --> 01:19:41,178
Oh, Faith.

1004
01:19:41,244 --> 01:19:44,114
My name is Faith.

1005
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:46,150
Smooth.

1006
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:48,151
Very smooth.

1007
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,150
Corvatch.
C-O-R-V-A-T-C-H.

1008
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:56,986
That's right. Yeah.

1009
01:19:57,059 --> 01:20:00,327
My wife used her card yesterday
and I can't remember the amount.

1010
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:05,970
No, I can't wait for the statement.
That's why I'm calling you.

1011
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:10,534
All right. Hey, Pete!
Tell Roy to send up more shingles.

1012
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:14,011
Hey, Roy!
He wants some more shingles!

1013
01:20:16,246 --> 01:20:20,913
Four hundred dollars
from the La Sirenuse Hotel in Positano?

1014
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:24,080
Where is Positano,
in Mexico?

1015
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:28,025
Italy?
My wife's in Italy?

1016
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:31,756
What the hell's she doing in Italy?
She's only been gone 48 hours.

1017
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:35,528
Huh? I'm sorry, ma'am.
Have a nice day then.

1018
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,436
My wife's in Italy.

1019
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,308
What the hell's
she doing in Italy?

1020
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:46,206
Who's in Italy?

1021
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:47,971
Fellas, I gotta get out of here.

1022
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:50,708
You finish up this job here.

1023
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,908
Don't have too many beers
at lunch.

1024
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:56,385
- Yeah, okay.
- Make sure you quit by 4:00.

1025
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:59,014
Whoa!
All right. I'm fine.

1026
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:04,050
Have you seen this sunset
out here?

1027
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:09,897
Larry would love these rooftops,
you know?

1028
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:13,062
Did you see his eyes?

1029
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:18,167
They were beautiful.
Brown, with little flecks of green.

1030
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,835
Wasn't he nice?
He's really nice.

1031
01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:25,508
How old do you think Giovanni is?
No more than 40?

1032
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,516
Come in!

1033
01:21:34,655 --> 01:21:37,388
The stars will be jealous
of you tonight.

1034
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,223
You are a vision.

1035
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:44,232
Thanks. You certainly
know how to talk.

1036
01:21:52,606 --> 01:21:56,273
By the way, l invite you all
on your last evening in Italy.

1037
01:21:56,343 --> 01:21:58,575
A friend of mine has a yacht.
You can see it from the balcony.

1038
01:21:58,646 --> 01:22:01,276
I told him I would bring
all my American friends tonight.

1039
01:22:01,348 --> 01:22:03,477
So you must all come, hmm?

1040
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:06,785
Yeah, we'd love that.
Faith, you in?

1041
01:22:06,854 --> 01:22:09,324
Okay. Ciao. Have fun.

1042
01:22:13,327 --> 01:22:14,591
I'm sorry.

1043
01:22:14,662 --> 01:22:18,226
In another life or parallel universe,
we would have loved that. Better?

1044
01:22:18,298 --> 01:22:20,791
- I have to get ready.
- Okay. Sorry.

1045
01:22:21,968 --> 01:22:23,801
Wait, wait. Sorry.

1046
01:22:25,171 --> 01:22:26,902
- Here.
- What is it?

1047
01:22:26,973 --> 01:22:28,909
You'll see.

1048
01:22:31,178 --> 01:22:33,910
- Shoes!
- Yeah.

1049
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:37,715
They're bone, a good color
for a date with destiny.

1050
01:22:37,784 --> 01:22:40,654
It should be-- Don't worry
about those European sizes.

1051
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:43,283
It's perfect.
It should tit like a glove.

1052
01:22:43,357 --> 01:22:46,022
- They do.
- Yeah?

1053
01:22:46,093 --> 01:22:47,527
Good.

1054
01:22:52,731 --> 01:22:55,669
Could you hand me my dress?
It's over on the window--

1055
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:05,308
And my earrings?
Those little moon ones?

1056
01:23:05,378 --> 01:23:07,610
Yeah.

1057
01:23:07,681 --> 01:23:10,676
And could you get me
my little ankle--

1058
01:23:12,886 --> 01:23:14,320
Thanks.

1059
01:23:36,775 --> 01:23:40,442
Oh, you got the pictures back
from the place.

1060
01:23:42,715 --> 01:23:47,054
This one of us is great.
Did you see that picture that...

1061
01:23:57,295 --> 01:23:58,593
Oh, God.

1062
01:24:03,534 --> 01:24:06,234
Oh, you look great.

1063
01:24:07,806 --> 01:24:09,742
Thank you.

1064
01:24:18,049 --> 01:24:22,924
I just... I want to thank you
for making all of this possible.

1065
01:24:22,988 --> 01:24:25,219
Sure.
It's the least I could do.

1066
01:24:25,289 --> 01:24:28,318
I just hope you find
what you're looking for.

1067
01:24:42,173 --> 01:24:43,267
Stop.

1068
01:24:43,341 --> 01:24:45,868
Oh, Peter, stop.

1069
01:24:45,943 --> 01:24:48,608
No matter what happens tonight,
I love you.

1070
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,614
- I have to go.
- Yeah.

1071
01:24:52,684 --> 01:24:55,814
It's pumpkin time.

1072
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:18,642
Oh!

1073
01:25:23,715 --> 01:25:27,050
Wow. You look just like a goddess.

1074
01:25:27,116 --> 01:25:31,285
You really do.
I mean, it's... Whoa.

1075
01:25:31,354 --> 01:25:32,618
A lot of steps.

1076
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:55,646
- Want some wine?
- Yes.

1077
01:25:55,712 --> 01:25:58,274
Do you have a good house red?

1078
01:25:58,348 --> 01:25:59,782
Cool.

1079
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:05,550
Now, I know you're gonna think
this sounds crazy...

1080
01:26:05,621 --> 01:26:09,288
but I noticed you at the pool
even before we spoke.

1081
01:26:10,226 --> 01:26:13,027
I could sense
a chemistry between us.

1082
01:26:14,497 --> 01:26:17,697
- Really?
- Truly.

1083
01:26:48,764 --> 01:26:51,030
So...

1084
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:54,095
you're probably wondering
why I asked you to dinner.

1085
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:58,908
No, not really.
It happens all the time.

1086
01:27:02,043 --> 01:27:04,344
Right.

1087
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,416
What looks good?

1088
01:27:08,683 --> 01:27:10,778
I think I'm gonna have the scampi.

1089
01:27:10,852 --> 01:27:13,619
Oh, you like shrimp?
I like shrimp.

1090
01:27:13,688 --> 01:27:16,421
Get out of town.
Come on.

1091
01:27:16,491 --> 01:27:18,427
Put her there.

1092
01:27:45,687 --> 01:27:48,625
Do you believe in destiny?

1093
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,346
It is written...

1094
01:28:12,546 --> 01:28:13,809
on the stars.

1095
01:28:58,258 --> 01:29:02,198
My son Kyle is in the third grade.
He's really the smart one.

1096
01:29:02,262 --> 01:29:04,254
My other son is very...

1097
01:29:04,329 --> 01:29:08,100
physical, I guess,
would be the term.

1098
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:11,299
You think I'm just
one of those men...

1099
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:14,502
who tries to seduce
every woman he meets.

1100
01:29:14,574 --> 01:29:17,044
Oh, I know that's what you are.

1101
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:20,747
Does it matter?

1102
01:29:31,824 --> 01:29:33,817
I've told you all about me.

1103
01:29:33,893 --> 01:29:36,557
- I want to hear about you.
- All right.

1104
01:29:36,628 --> 01:29:40,432
What kind of books do you like?
What music do you listen to?

1105
01:29:40,499 --> 01:29:44,200
I like action films.

1106
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:47,640
I like Van Damme movies.

1107
01:29:47,706 --> 01:29:50,770
I love martial art films.

1108
01:30:06,891 --> 01:30:09,385
Really?
You don't like opera?

1109
01:30:09,461 --> 01:30:11,123
I'm surprised to hear that.

1110
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:18,172
- Giovanni, I'm sorry.
- What?

1111
01:30:18,236 --> 01:30:20,935
You're very kind and gentle,
and I'll never forget you...

1112
01:30:21,006 --> 01:30:23,443
but I can't do this.

1113
01:30:23,509 --> 01:30:24,602
I'm married.

1114
01:30:33,619 --> 01:30:36,056
- That makes me uncomfortable.
- I'm sorry.

1115
01:30:36,122 --> 01:30:38,489
- How bout that?
- Come on. Stop it.

1116
01:30:38,556 --> 01:30:41,187
- Is this what you want?
- I said stop!

1117
01:30:41,259 --> 01:30:43,320
- Okay.
- Stop it.

1118
01:30:50,635 --> 01:30:52,833
I'll kill you!

1119
01:30:52,904 --> 01:30:54,874
- You crossed the line, you jerk!
- You crossed the line.

1120
01:30:54,939 --> 01:30:58,174
- You blew it from the get-go!
- I did you a favor.

1121
01:30:58,242 --> 01:31:00,008
I said to turn her off
not molest her!

1122
01:31:00,078 --> 01:31:02,571
I was improvising.

1123
01:31:04,549 --> 01:31:08,114
Are you not Damon Bradley?

1124
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:13,117
No, I am not Damon Bradley.

1125
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:16,527
Look, I'm real...
Damn it!

1126
01:31:17,761 --> 01:31:20,255
I'm really sorry.
You're very sweet.

1127
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:22,358
- I'm sorry it went this far.
- Shut up, Harry! You've done enough!

1128
01:31:22,433 --> 01:31:25,803
- You shut up.
- So you're probably really upset.

1129
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:28,273
- Just be a little bit rational.
- Rational!

1130
01:31:29,307 --> 01:31:32,005
Hit him!

1131
01:31:32,076 --> 01:31:34,343
- Let it out.
- Stop it!

1132
01:31:37,014 --> 01:31:40,384
Okay, what's with
the bald guy, huh?

1133
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:43,286
- Faith, I can explain!
- Great.

1134
01:31:43,353 --> 01:31:45,118
Okay, slow down.

1135
01:31:45,189 --> 01:31:46,623
Oh, God.

1136
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:48,626
Oh, dear. Oh, my.

1137
01:31:51,061 --> 01:31:54,192
Faith, I was afraid
of losing you!

1138
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:55,630
Let's go.

1139
01:31:55,699 --> 01:31:58,797
You are so ungrateful. Do you know
what kind of planning this took?

1140
01:31:58,869 --> 01:32:02,706
This was a major production.
I did it all for us!

1141
01:32:02,773 --> 01:32:06,041
Thank you very much.
I hope you're very happy!

1142
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:08,707
I don't believe in anything anymore!

1143
01:32:08,779 --> 01:32:11,682
I don't believe in the moon or stars
or the sun or destiny...

1144
01:32:11,748 --> 01:32:14,014
or magic or men!

1145
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:18,183
Why won't you accept the fact that
I'll do anything to keep us together?

1146
01:32:18,254 --> 01:32:20,190
You've outdone yourself!

1147
01:32:21,558 --> 01:32:23,892
You're gonna miss me
when I'm gone.

1148
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,330
You're nuts about me!
We're made for each other!

1149
01:32:38,541 --> 01:32:40,842
Haven't they ever heard
of escalators?

1150
01:32:49,418 --> 01:32:53,153
You didn't mean what you said about not
believing in the stars and the moon?

1151
01:32:53,222 --> 01:32:55,158
- You?
- I...

1152
01:32:57,793 --> 01:32:59,729
I can't.

1153
01:33:00,897 --> 01:33:02,833
I can't now.

1154
01:33:04,801 --> 01:33:08,205
I'm sorry for dragging you here.

1155
01:33:08,271 --> 01:33:11,175
No, don't say you're sorry...

1156
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:14,872
'cause this has been the best weekend
of my entire life.

1157
01:33:21,382 --> 01:33:25,289
I guess sometimes life just doesn't
turn out the way we imagined it.

1158
01:33:31,392 --> 01:33:33,329
Look at the stars.

1159
01:33:33,395 --> 01:33:36,128
They come out every night.

1160
01:33:37,766 --> 01:33:40,636
To almost love a woman
and then lose her.

1161
01:33:43,838 --> 01:33:45,774
Enjoy the pain.

1162
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:51,315
It's like losing at roulette.
There's that sweet sting.

1163
01:33:56,417 --> 01:33:58,354
Oh, Jesus, Harry.

1164
01:34:01,889 --> 01:34:03,825
There's only one woman...

1165
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,896
and she's gone.

1166
01:34:16,436 --> 01:34:18,532
Are you all right?

1167
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:21,601
- Yes.
- Can I get you something?

1168
01:34:21,676 --> 01:34:23,873
No, thank you.

1169
01:34:23,944 --> 01:34:27,680
I just would like you
to send this very quickly.

1170
01:34:28,983 --> 01:34:30,850
Yes.

1171
01:34:35,823 --> 01:34:39,318
I'm calling off my wedding.

1172
01:34:42,597 --> 01:34:44,328
Sorry.

1173
01:34:52,739 --> 01:34:54,868
I'll send it immediately.

1174
01:35:01,315 --> 01:35:02,749
Thanks.

1175
01:35:21,067 --> 01:35:22,535
Just go.

1176
01:35:45,258 --> 01:35:46,420
I'm sorry.

1177
01:35:46,493 --> 01:35:48,621
I wanna...

1178
01:35:48,694 --> 01:35:50,630
Come on. Let's go.

1179
01:36:12,718 --> 01:36:15,155
Larry?
What are you doin' here?

1180
01:36:17,457 --> 01:36:21,590
What am I doin' here?
What the hell are you doin' here?

1181
01:36:22,627 --> 01:36:25,224
You came all the way here
just to ask me that?

1182
01:36:27,099 --> 01:36:29,365
No, I...

1183
01:36:29,434 --> 01:36:32,565
I came all the way here
to tell you...

1184
01:36:32,637 --> 01:36:34,129
I love you and I...

1185
01:36:35,273 --> 01:36:36,606
miss you.

1186
01:36:38,678 --> 01:36:41,240
I've been miserable
without you, Katy.

1187
01:36:41,313 --> 01:36:43,978
Oh, Larry, I've missed you too.

1188
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:54,192
You're gonna be okay?

1189
01:36:54,258 --> 01:36:57,425
I'm gonna be okay.
I want you guys to have a great time.

1190
01:36:57,496 --> 01:36:59,294
- Did you call Mom?
- Yeah.

1191
01:36:59,364 --> 01:37:01,162
- Did you call Dwayne?
- Yeah.

1192
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,259
What'd they say?
What?

1193
01:37:03,335 --> 01:37:05,737
Everybody is worried about you,
you understand?

1194
01:37:05,803 --> 01:37:08,503
- I'm all right. Thanks.
- You got everything?

1195
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:14,103
Listen, what time is your flight?

1196
01:37:14,179 --> 01:37:16,741
- You got your passport?
- Yeah.

1197
01:37:16,814 --> 01:37:18,010
Your ticket?

1198
01:37:50,248 --> 01:37:51,876
I'm Damon Bradley.

1199
01:37:51,949 --> 01:37:54,351
You're Damon Bradley?

1200
01:37:54,417 --> 01:37:56,888
I mean, off the Ouija board,
when we were kids.

1201
01:37:56,954 --> 01:37:59,254
I made the whole thing up.
I was pushing the arrow.

1202
01:37:59,322 --> 01:38:02,089
- I wanted to get to the next question.
- You made the whole thing up?

1203
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:05,826
- Damon Bradley never existed?
- He was a kid in Little League.

1204
01:38:05,896 --> 01:38:08,390
- He was a real jerk.
- What about the fortune teller?

1205
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:10,766
- That fat gypsy woman?
- Don't say that.

1206
01:38:10,834 --> 01:38:13,397
I slipped her two bucks.
The whole thing was a joke.

1207
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:16,443
Larry, this is bad.
You have to tell Faith.

1208
01:38:16,507 --> 01:38:18,670
I am not going to tell Faith.
She'll never speak to me again.

1209
01:38:18,742 --> 01:38:21,578
- She called off her whole wedding.
- Because she's in love.

1210
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:24,673
Why would she call off her wedding
if she was in love?

1211
01:38:24,747 --> 01:38:26,614
Because it's not Dwayne.

1212
01:38:26,682 --> 01:38:31,022
What do you mean?
Then who is she in love with?

1213
01:38:35,125 --> 01:38:37,061
- Spanish?
- How'd you know that?

1214
01:38:37,127 --> 01:38:39,825
It's very nice suede.
How much you pay for them?

1215
01:38:39,896 --> 01:38:42,663
87.50, American.

1216
01:38:42,732 --> 01:38:44,930
- Wow. Could've done better.
- Better?

1217
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,869
I'll give you a card.

1218
01:39:11,861 --> 01:39:14,424
Passengers on TWA flight
to New York...

1219
01:39:14,497 --> 01:39:17,298

at gate number ten.

1220
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:25,805

1222
01:39:30,712 --> 01:39:34,948
Mr. Damon Bradley, please come

1223
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:44,521
I'll be in touch.

1224
01:39:47,096 --> 01:39:49,032
Excuse me.

1225
01:39:52,869 --> 01:39:55,339
Excuse me.

1226
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,671
- I'm Damon Bradley.
- Oh, yes.

1227
01:40:02,744 --> 01:40:05,544
- You have a message for me?
- Yes, I have a message.

1228
01:40:05,614 --> 01:40:09,212
Mademoiselle Plantard will meet you
directly at your hotel in Geneva.

1229
01:40:09,283 --> 01:40:11,687
Ah, thank you very much.

1230
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,196
Shall we?

1231
01:40:34,642 --> 01:40:36,339
I'm Peter. This is Faith.

1232
01:40:37,978 --> 01:40:41,918
We're a bit strange. She's been
Iooking for you her whole life.

1233
01:40:41,982 --> 01:40:44,180
Basically.

1234
01:40:44,252 --> 01:40:48,420
As a matter of fact,
she thinks she wants to marry you.

1235
01:40:48,489 --> 01:40:51,256
Yeah.
Are you married?

1236
01:40:51,325 --> 01:40:53,728
- No.
- Oh, good. Whew.

1237
01:40:53,794 --> 01:40:56,391
- Do you have a good job?
- Of course.

1238
01:40:56,464 --> 01:40:58,456
- Who are you?
- I'm sorry. Peter, Faith.

1239
01:40:58,531 --> 01:41:01,060
We're just friends.
He's available.

1240
01:41:01,135 --> 01:41:02,832
This is good.

1241
01:41:02,903 --> 01:41:05,373
She thinks that you two
are meant to be.

1242
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:07,375
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1243
01:41:07,441 --> 01:41:09,844
The only problem is me,
because I'm in love with her.

1244
01:41:11,178 --> 01:41:13,615
I love her more
than she'll ever know.

1245
01:41:13,681 --> 01:41:15,115
But...

1246
01:41:16,751 --> 01:41:20,417
You're a lucky man.
You've got the right name.

1247
01:41:25,559 --> 01:41:28,224
Good-bye, Faith.

1248
01:41:28,295 --> 01:41:30,458
I hope you work it out.

1249
01:41:32,999 --> 01:41:34,434
Hope we work what out?

1250
01:41:40,573 --> 01:41:42,510
What's going on?

1251
01:41:44,144 --> 01:41:45,442
He loves me.

1252
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,416
I can see that.

1253
01:41:48,482 --> 01:41:50,679
The question is: Do you love him?

1254
01:41:51,884 --> 01:41:52,978
What?

1255
01:41:53,053 --> 01:41:55,387
I said, the question is:
Do you love him?

1256
01:41:55,455 --> 01:41:57,721
What?

1257
01:41:57,791 --> 01:42:00,557
Do you love him?

1258
01:42:02,061 --> 01:42:05,465
- Last call for boarding.
- I do.

1259
01:42:10,003 --> 01:42:12,132
I do.

1260
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:18,403
Good.

1261
01:42:19,646 --> 01:42:22,310
I have a plane to Geneva
to catch...

1262
01:42:22,381 --> 01:42:26,446
and you have a plane to catch.

1263
01:42:35,227 --> 01:42:38,530
Is this the flight to Boston?
I have to get on that flight.

1264
01:42:38,597 --> 01:42:41,124
- The flight is closed.
- Excuse me?

1265
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:44,536
You don't understand.
The man I love is on that plane.

1266
01:42:44,603 --> 01:42:47,404
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

1267
01:42:47,473 --> 01:42:50,343
Please, can you help me?
You understand.

1268
01:42:50,409 --> 01:42:52,208
Don't you?

1269
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,017
Do you got a ticket?
This is to New York.

1270
01:43:21,774 --> 01:43:22,867
Okay.

1271
01:43:24,276 --> 01:43:26,804
Oh, my God!

1272
01:43:48,766 --> 01:43:50,702
Thank you!
