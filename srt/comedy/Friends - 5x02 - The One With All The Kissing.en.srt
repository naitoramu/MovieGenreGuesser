1
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,847
You look cute in bubbles.

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,018
You're just all liquored up.

3
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:23,232
Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.

4
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,740
I've had a very long, hard day.

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,283
Want some chicken?

6
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,121
No, thanks. No chicken.
Bye-bye.

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,957
You sure?
Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?

8
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,501
For the last time, no!
Get out, Joey!

9
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,671
All right.

10
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,175
Are you okay?
He wouldn't leave.

11
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,928
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.

12
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,347
Chicken?

13
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,809
I could eat some chicken.

14
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:07,526
Could I get a three-piece,
some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?

15
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,737
Diet Coke.

16
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,119
The One With
All the Kissing

17
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,532
- Morning, Pheebs.
- I have to tell you this story.

18
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,034
I was coming over
and this cabdriver...

19
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,913
Was his name Angus?

20
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,039
What?

21
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,084
He was a cabdriver
we had in London.

22
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,211
All right. Anyway...

23
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,714
What was that pub he took us to?

24
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,132
The Wheat Sheaf!

25
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,925
And they had that beer...

26
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,304
Boddington's!

27
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,099
Pheebs was going to tell a story.

28
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,061
So, he had a really funny hat.

29
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,148
I don't want to talk about it.

30
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,317
Hey Ross!

31
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,360
Boddington's!

32
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,072
Oh, man!

33
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:39,493
I'd walk back to London for another
frosty one of those bad boys.

34
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,829
They have them at the
British pub by the Trade Center.

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,332
Later!

36
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,084
Shouldn't Rachel be back?

37
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,836
Her plane got delayed.

38
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,838
But she should be here by now.

39
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,008
So you talked to her?
Did she sound mad?

40
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:57,094
No. But she likes me.

41
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,096
You abandoned her
on a plane to Greece.

42
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,224
I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?

43
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,309
Emily showed up at the airport.

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,646
I had to go after her.
I did what I had to do.

45
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,357
She's my wife.
Rachel is my wife.

46
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,318
Emily!

47
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,697
Emily is my wife.

48
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,700
Man, what is that?

49
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,785
You haven't heard from Emily?

50
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,120
Not since I lost her at the airport.

51
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,373
I can't believe she can outrun you.

52
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,417
Hey! She's fast, okay?

53
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:34,840
You think you can beat me?
Let's go! Outside!

54
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,308
Rach, I am so sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

55
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,645
Come on.
You just did what you had to do.

56
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,942
That's it? You're not mad?
It must've been terrible.

57
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:56,153
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!

58
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:00,198
There was a nice hotel, nice beach,
met the nice people.

59
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,203
It's not too shabby for Rachel.

60
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,916
So, what, that's it?

61
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,169
We're cool. Totally cool.

62
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,129
Thanks, Rach.
You're the best.

63
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,924
Oh, no. You're the best.

64
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,470
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,348
No one will tell me where Emily is...

66
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,727
...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red
roses to her parents' house.

67
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,855
One for each day
I've known and loved her.

68
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,732
That should get her talking.

69
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:39,863
When you make out the card,
be sure to make it out to "Emily".

70
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,745
It's good that you had
such a good time in Greece.

71
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,664
What?

72
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,542
I didn't have a good time in Greece!

73
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,962
Ross abandoned me!

74
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:59,425
I couldn't get a plane out.
I had to stay in their suite!

75
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:04,805
People came up to me going,
"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"

76
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,267
I mean, it was so humiliating!

77
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,602
I felt like such an idiot!

78
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,147
It's all my fault.
You know why?

79
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,734
Because I make very bad decisions.

80
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,194
Oh, that's not true.

81
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,905
Yes, it is true.
I went after Ross in stupid London!

82
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,493
London is stupid! Stupid!

83
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,412
I should've never gone to London.

84
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:32,332
From now on, you make
all my decisions for me.

85
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,086
Oh, no.
I did that for someone once.

86
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,256
I'm not comfortable having
that power over someone's life.

87
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,967
I'll do it.

88
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:46,888
Fine. Monica, you are now
in charge of my love life.

89
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,392
Okay. I got to go to work.

90
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:03,072
And Rachel, great to have you back.

91
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,710
Always a pleasure.

92
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,136
Rachel? Sweetie, look.

93
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,847
Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.

94
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,348
He's married.

95
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,894
Ross is married.
I still can't believe it.

96
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,813
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.

97
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,732
I'll just have to accept it.

98
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,984
I mean, it's my fault.

99
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,237
Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!

100
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,991
Oh, my God!

101
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,497
That's okay. I know that
you're very upset right now.

102
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,582
I know that wasn't about me.

103
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,043
I bet it was about her a little.

104
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,545
If you'd stop thinking about Ross...

105
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,632
...you'd notice there are
great guys everywhere.

106
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,551
Look. Gunther.

107
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,763
He's nice. He's cute.

108
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,224
Yeah. I guess Gunther is...

109
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,310
What about that guy over there?

110
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:19,565
That's the guy you flirted with
at the counter.

111
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,608
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

112
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:22,943
You'll too talk to him.

113
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:27,489
I make your decisions,
and I say you'll too talk to him.

114
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,865
All right.

115
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,286
You're the boss.
I got to do what you tell me.

116
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,290
Say that to him, and you're golden.

117
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,714
Hey, Pheebs.
We got our pictures back from London.

118
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,884
Here's all of us
at the Tower of London...

119
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,969
Here we all are.

120
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,265
There's Ross and Joey and you and...

121
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,851
And me.

122
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,645
We've been talking about
London too much.

123
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,690
Sorry, it's just because
I couldn't be there.

124
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,402
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.
It bums me out.

125
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,904
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

126
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,241
- What happened?
- A little of this, a little of that.

127
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,159
I got myself a date tomorrow.

128
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,957
See? Didn't I tell you?
You're getting over Ross already.

129
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,585
Get out.

130
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,100
What took so long?

131
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:42,189
I got caught up at work.
But I'm quitting tomorrow.

132
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,446
So, thanks for having me over.

133
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,966
See you, man.

134
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,510
What the hell was that?

135
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:17,057
Probably some European
goodbye thing he picked up in London.

136
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,476
That's not European.

137
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,854
It felt French.

138
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,318
I really had a good time.

139
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,489
Yeah, me too.

140
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,118
I guess this is it.

141
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,872
Unless you want to come inside?

142
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:47,129
Wait a minute. You know what?
I can't decide this.

143
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,467
Okay. Just hold on a second.

144
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,933
Where's Monica?
I have to ask her something.

145
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,893
Doing her laundry.

146
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,936
What's that?

147
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,399
It came in the mail today.

148
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,025
It's 72 long-stemmed, red roses.

149
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,154
One for each day
I've known and loved Emily...

150
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:16,116
...cut up into mulch.

151
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,245
Honey, that's awful.

152
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,412
It's not so bad.

153
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,583
Monica's going to make potpourri.

154
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,506
I think I'm going to go
wander out in the rain for a while.

155
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:31,799
It's not raining.

156
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,719
I can't catch a break!

157
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,222
You're not going anywhere.
Sit right here.

158
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,559
I'll make you some tea
and we'll talk this out.

159
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,437
All right?

160
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,524
Hey, Dave.

161
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:53,737
I need to take a rain check.
My roommate is really sick.

162
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,531
Okay. Bye!

163
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,744
Honey, listen.

164
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,039
I know things seem so
bad...

165
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,875
...and that they won't get any...

166
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,878
Could I talk to you?

167
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,256
I dropped some socks.

168
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,061
What is the matter with you?
Do you want to fall into the trap?

169
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,189
You did not drop any socks!

170
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,608
I saw Dave, and he said
you blew him off!

171
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:32,777
You listen to me!

172
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,905
I'm calling the shots!
I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.

173
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,239
What are you doing?

174
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,078
Well, ultimately I was trying,
you know, I wanted...

175
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,039
...to tell him that
I'm still in love with him.

176
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,293
What? You cannot tell him that!

177
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,878
Why? Why not?

178
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:54,757
People love to hear that!

179
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,883
I make the decisions and I say no!

180
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,763
You know what? No, you don't
make my decisions, because...

181
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,515
...you're fired.

182
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,432
You can't fire me.

183
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:10,731
I make your decisions,
and I say I'm not fired! Ha!

184
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,151
Well...

185
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,328
Come on, let me in!

186
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,039
Having some trouble?

187
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,582
Rachel locked the door.

188
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:33,378
I'll kick that door in
if you give me some sugar.

189
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,303
Rachel! Let me in!

190
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,563
Thank you.

191
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:56,110
Rachel? Can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

192
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,029
We really need to talk.

193
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,114
Well, then talk.

194
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,535
Okay, I will.

195
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:10,332
Remember that thing we just discussed
that you wanted to do?

196
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,085
What thing?

197
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:18,215
Rachel wants to take
swing dance lessons.

198
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,968
Which I think is a really stupid idea.

199
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:24,304
It's dangerous.
She won't get what she wants.

200
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:29,101
And who knows who she might
end up hurting?

201
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:38,819
Monica's right.
Swing dancing can be tricky.

202
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,737
I have to use the phone.

203
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,909
I got to cancel those five, giant
teddy bears I sent to Emily.

204
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,495
My God! Think of the massacre.

205
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,913
I'm going to do it.

206
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,915
I know you think I'm crazy.

207
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,251
But before you tell him,
try to find one person...

208
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,796
...who thinks it's a good idea.
I bet you can't.

209
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,674
Please?

210
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,219
All right. Fine.

211
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,100
Joey! I'm in!

212
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,978
All right. Good deal.

213
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,953
You know how you were saying
you didn't get to go to London...

214
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,955
...and you were feeling left out?

215
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,083
Well, we all felt really bad
about that...

216
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,920
...so we decided to
take a little trip together!

217
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,130
Oh, that's so nice!

218
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,424
How great!
Where's the trip?

219
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:46,636
Well, we thought we would all
go to a picnic...

220
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,222
...in Central Park!

221
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,557
Central Park?

222
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,726
All of us. All day.

223
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,145
That sucks!

224
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,731
That's not a trip!
I just came from there.

225
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,859
What'll we high-five about
at the stupid park?

226
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:05,572
It's right by my house.
All right!

227
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:10,744
I'm going home to bask in the
triumph of my Central Park idea.

228
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,623
Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.

229
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,583
I wanted to talk to you about...

230
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:20,004
...this whole new European thing
you've got going on.

231
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:23,382
And I need to say
it makes me very uncomfortable...

232
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:27,052
...and I just, you know, just stop it!

233
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,930
Just bringing some culture
to the group.

234
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,392
That's fine.
Just don't bring it in my mouth.

235
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,979
It makes me want to puke.

236
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,321
Hey, everybody!
Pheebs is here!

237
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,785
- Phoebe! Woo!
- Okay. Woo! Hi!

238
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:54,788
Pheebs, we decided that
the picnic idea was a little...

239
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,959
It didn't have any...
Well, it blew.

240
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:04,340
We thought that this afternoon we'd
all go away for the whole weekend...

241
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,883
...to Atlantic City.

242
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:10,512
Atlantic City! Oh, that's
a great plan! Whose plan was that?

243
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,472
Mine!

244
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,726
- Wait. It was my plan.
- No...

245
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,270
...I said we needed a new plan.

246
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,522
And I came up with Atlantic City.

247
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,317
Which is the new plan.

248
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:29,823
Why don't we all
meet upstairs in an hour.

249
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm going to go pack.
I'm going to go pack my ass off.

250
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,414
Let's go.

251
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,458
You know what?
I'll meet you in a minute.

252
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,296
Rachel, you didn't find anyone,
so you can't tell him.

253
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,549
You know what?
That doesn't matter.

254
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,553
Do you know how painful it is
to tell someone you love them...

255
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:55,181
...and not have them say it back?

256
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:58,977
I don't care.

257
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,525
I can't watch.

258
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,498
What you reading?

259
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:21,583
Paper.

260
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:25,212
Yeah? What's it about?

261
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:29,883
The events from around the globe.

262
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:36,140
There's something
I have to talk to you about.

263
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,058
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.

264
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,561
But I think they're wrong.
People can be wrong.

265
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,063
Once at work...

266
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,899
...I thought carbon dating
is fossilized...

267
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:50,445
I'm really trying to tell
you something here.

268
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,949
Go ahead.

269
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,410
I think I'm just going to say it.

270
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,621
I'm just going to say it.

271
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,799
I'm still in love with you.

272
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:30,527
I'm not sure what to do
with that right now.

273
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:39,077
What? Was that a joke?
Because it's mean.

274
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,831
I'm so dead serious!

275
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,583
I'm totally serious!

276
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,669
Why are you laughing?

277
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,797
Because I just heard it!

278
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:53,050
I heard it! And it's ridiculous!

279
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,426
I mean...

280
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,969
You're married!

281
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,597
You're married,
and it's just ridiculous!

282
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:02,351
When I said it, I sort of
floated up out of my body.

283
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:08,857
And then I heard myself say it,
and then the floating Rachel...

284
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:14,988
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"

285
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,577
- Well, I am married.
- I know.

286
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:25,457
Though I haven't spoken to her
since the wedding.

287
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,795
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

288
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:35,634
Actually, it kind of is.

289
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,430
My wife won't return my calls.

290
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:45,978
I don't know where my wife is.

291
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:52,442
"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?"
"Don't know!"

292
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,071
Oh, God!

293
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,162
You know what?
Could you forget I told you this?

294
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,414
Well, I kind of have to.

295
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,416
Because the thing is...

296
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:12,963
The thing is, you know,
that you're married to Emily.

297
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:17,635
That is what the thing is.

298
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,598
Oh, God.

299
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:27,144
Things won't be weird between us,
right? Was that stupid?

300
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,062
Me telling you that?

301
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:32,691
I'm glad you did.

302
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,443
If nothing else...

303
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:38,655
...it's always great when someone
tells you they love you.

304
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,951
That's what I said!

305
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:48,332
- Thank you for being so nice.
- No. Thank you for...

306
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,669
Thank you.

307
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:55,047
- Okay, let's go!
- Yeah, Atlantic City!

308
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,256
Come on!

309
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:59,343
Atlantic City, baby!

310
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,428
Let's roll some bones.
Hey, Joey!

311
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,806
High-five for rolling bones.

312
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,229
Pheebs, you're leaking.

313
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:14,024
Oh, my God! Your water broke!

314
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,528
Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.

315
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,908
Pheebs, we have to take you
to the hospital now.

316
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,577
Pheebs, the babies are coming now.

317
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:29,873
Honey! High-five!
The babies are coming!

318
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,835
Remember when my water broke?

319
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,800
Phoebe's going to have her babies!

320
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,888
I know.
It's beautiful and amazing.

321
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:54,564
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel
every time I left the room.

322
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,319
It's too bad they didn't
see us having sex.

323
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:02,281
Do you know anything about women?

324
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:06,368
- It's all right.
- Okay.
