00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,964
Chandler, Mon, there's only one
banana-nut muffin left.

4
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:07,341
I ordered mine first.

5
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,178
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,262
Give it to me.

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,723
No.

8
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,765
Give it to me!

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,269
Okay, you can have it.

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,945
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

11
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:33,033
That was there when I got here.

12
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,788
Hey, you'll never guess
who's coming to New York.

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,290
Quick, tell us before he swallows.

14
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,961
Ryan, that guy I dated
who's in the Navy.

15
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,338
You went out with a guy in the Navy?

16
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,007
I met him while playing guitar
in the park.

17
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,553
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy
because he didn't have change.

18
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:57,433
Is that when you wrote
<i>Saltwater Taffy Man?</i>

19
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,520
No, he's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces every couple years...

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,398
...and we have an amazing
three days together.

21
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:10,904
Only this time, he's coming for 2 weeks.
Two whole weeks, which means "yea"!

22
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,701
So this guy goes down
for, like, two years at a time?

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,414
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

24
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,419
Hi.

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,838
Oh, no. What happened?

26
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,507
I just spoke to Carol.
Ben's got chickenpox.

27
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,716
Oh, no.

28
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,304
Yeah, so if you haven't had it,
chances are you'll get it.

29
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,181
- I've had it.
- I've had it.

30
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,349
- Had it.
- Had it.

31
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,479
I've never had it. I feel so left out.
Oh, look!

32
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,775
The One With the Chicken Pox

34
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,534
Honey, you made the bed again.

35
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,997
I told you, you don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.

36
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:48,878
Then I guess the panty raid last night
was totally uncalled for.

37
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:55,050
I'm taking a shower. Today I'll
sing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown".

38
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,147
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

39
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,275
Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whole damn town...

40
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,194
...or the fattest man?

41
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:19,199
The baddest. Otherwise, the song
would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown".

42
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,910
What are you doing?

43
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:26,748
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

44
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,335
Are you remaking the bed?

45
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,756
I'm sorry. The way you did it,
it was just fine.

46
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,383
Then you're redoing it
because...?

47
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,218
You'll think I'm crazy.

48
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,806
You're pretty much
running that risk either way.

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,392
Okay. You see...

50
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,562
...the duvet tag shouldn't be
at the top left corner...

51
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,107
...it should be at the
bottom right corner.

52
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,485
- That's not so crazy.
- I'm just easing you in.

53
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,154
All right.

54
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,489
You see these little flower blossoms?

55
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,742
They should be facing up not down...

56
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:07,206
...because the head of the bed
is where the sun would be.

57
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,919
You don't love me anymore, do you?

58
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,174
Actually, if it's possible,
I love you more.

59
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,801
Really?

60
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,388
Wow. Well, then, come on!

61
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:27,434
I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.

62
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,189
If you need something
to hold you over...

63
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,317
...I can get you a job here
as an entry-level processor.

64
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,402
Don't you need experience?

65
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,988
It's not hard to learn.

66
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,950
As for people realizing you don't know
what you're doing, you're an actor.

67
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,830
Act like a processor,
people will think you're a processor.

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,374
Here's this morning's projections.

69
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,418
Thanks.
Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

70
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,714
Joey is a fellow processor.

71
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,592
No kidding?

72
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:06,974
I process. People want the processing,
I'm the one they call.

73
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,477
- Where do you work?
- Well, I'm in between things.

74
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,022
You know, one day you're processing,
the next day...

75
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,942
...you're not so much
processing anymore.

76
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,653
I told Joey about the opening
in Fleischman's group.

77
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,530
Fleischman's group.

78
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,410
Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.

79
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,790
Are all you processors dorks?

80
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,423
This lipstick looks just great on you.

81
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,633
You look fabulous.
You really do.

82
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,970
Yeah, are you sure?
Really?

83
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:51,310
See, you look beautiful.
For God sakes, dim the lights.

84
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,479
I'm hideous!

85
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,105
It's gonna be okay.

86
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,857
Ryan's been underwater.

87
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:02,237
He's just gonna be glad you don't
have barnacles on your butt.

88
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,417
Come in.

89
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,169
Hey, baby, I'm back...

90
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,839
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

91
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,175
What's going on?

92
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,178
No, no.
You have to stay back.

93
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,348
I have the pox!

94
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,809
Chicken or small?

95
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,023
Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.

96
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,694
- Why aren't you home in bed?
- My grandmother's never had chickenpox.

97
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:47,199
Please tell me you have, because
oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

98
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,869
I'm sorry, I never had them.

99
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:55,332
If I had one wish,
I'd go back to when I was 7...

100
00:06:55,582 --> 00:07:00,420
...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,
and rub that kid all over my face.

101
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,341
Yeah, or you could wish
that I didn't have them now.

102
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,842
Can I see your face?

103
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,887
No. You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.

104
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,557
It could be lox, I wouldn't care.

105
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,894
And you hate fish.

106
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,188
So sweet. All right.

107
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,274
Okay, all right.
You can see.

108
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,903
This is me.

109
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,075
Sorry!

110
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,535
I am scary!

111
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,998
The lightening was
an unfortunate coincidence.

112
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,375
You look lovely!
Lovely!

113
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,085
I hate this.

114
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,380
I had the most amazing
two weeks planned for us.

115
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,677
And everything I had in mind,
we had to be a lot closer than this.

116
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:54,182
I've spent the last eight months
in a steel tube with men...

117
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,894
...thinking about this moment.

118
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,605
I am not gonna let a bunch...

119
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:03,609
...of itchy spots stand between us.

120
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:14,495
Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.

121
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,378
- How's the first day?
- Good. It's like you said.

122
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,548
It's putting numbers
from one column into another.

123
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,840
There you go.

124
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,803
And everybody's nice. I just had
a good talk with that lady Jeannie.

125
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:35,516
Jeannie? The head of
East Coast operations, Jeannie?

126
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:39,770
Turns out our kids go
to the same school.

127
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,316
Yeah. Small world, huh?

128
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,818
Weird world.

129
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,028
Your kids?

130
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,782
I figure my character has kids.

131
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:56,203
There isn't a part of that sentence
I don't need explained.

132
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,414
When you're acting, you need
to think about that stuff.

133
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,960
My character,
Joseph the processing guy...

134
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,923
...has two little girls,
Ashley and Brittany.

135
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,718
Ashley copies everything
Brittany does.

136
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:20,394
Well, invisible kids
can be that way sometimes.

137
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:25,065
You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,
are thinking of having a third kid.

138
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,150
You know what?

139
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,029
Just did.

140
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:35,492
That's some pretty powerful
imaginary sperm you must have there.

141
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,254
Know what makes the itching worse?

142
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,049
That you don't stop talking about it?

143
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,053
- Fine.
- Let's just play, okay?

144
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,346
Good, okay.

145
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,890
Here we go, double sixes.

146
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,226
Here we go...

147
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,435
Here we go...

148
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:06,273
Come to Mama.
Getting ready to roll the dice...

149
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,608
What are you doing?
Are you scratching?

150
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:12,529
No. This is what I do
for luck, okay?

151
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,155
You're scratching.

152
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,532
Give me the dice.

153
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,326
- Give me the dice.
- No! Here. There!

154
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,580
Look, double sixes!

155
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,999
We can't scratch. We'll scar.

156
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,919
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.

157
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,507
I wanna grab these houses
and rub them all over my body.

158
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,300
- No!
- Give it!

159
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,801
Come on!

160
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,721
You know you want it.
You know you want it too.

161
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,432
Let's just be bad.
It'll feel so good.

162
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,185
Come on.

163
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,772
Oh, God, help me.

164
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,108
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, good. Now do me.

165
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,152
Do my back.
Oh, come on. Harder!

166
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,278
There you go.

167
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,405
- Don't move.
- Why?

168
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:58,242
- Don't move.
- What are you...?

169
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,330
Stop that.
Stop that right now.

170
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,336
I might've expected this of Phoebe.
But, Ryan, you're a military man.

171
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,009
You and Milton have to join us
on the boat. Bring the kids.

172
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,720
We'll make a day of it.

173
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,639
That sounds lovely.
We'll have to set it up.

174
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,558
I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.

175
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,477
Thanks.

176
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,230
- Bye-bye, Jeannie.
- Bye-bye, Joseph.

177
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,608
What a phony.

178
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:38,073
You'll teach her a lesson when she
steps off the dock onto nothing.

179
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,866
- Hey, Mr. Douglas.
- Sir.

180
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:44,455
Bing, I got your memo. We're not gonna
see the report until next Friday?

181
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,291
My group wants to spend
the holiday with family.

182
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,294
I have a family.
I'm gonna be here.

183
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,298
Yeah, Bing.
What's that about?

184
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,762
It's about cutting them
a little slack for morale.

185
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,849
Look, I can get some
rough numbers by Wednesday.

186
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,935
Rough numbers?

187
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:11,607
This company wasn't built
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

188
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,651
Have the final numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.

189
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,571
If you say so, sir.

190
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:21,408
Joseph's good, isn't he?

191
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,495
I'm going to kill you.

192
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:29,124
Hey, I just figured Joseph's
the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.

193
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:33,587
You know, get in there,
ruffle some feathers.

194
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,548
Why?

195
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,511
Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.

196
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,972
Okay? If you try to pull something...

197
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,141
...he'll call you on it.

198
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,394
"What are you trying to pull?"
He'll say.

199
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,441
Duct tape.

200
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,111
Was I supposed to bring something too?

201
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:02,907
This is for the scratchy twins.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

202
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,576
You're strict.

203
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,661
Well, it's for their own good.

204
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:11,458
You know, I like the way you have
efficiently folded this tab under.

205
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:17,255
See, in a tape emergency you could
shave valuable seconds off your time.

206
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,550
Exactly!

207
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,263
God, I love that I can be
totally neurotic around you now.

208
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:25,556
Tell me the truth.

209
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,976
Don't you like having everything
on your desk perpendicular?

210
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:33,063
If it's not a right angle,
it is a wrong angle.

211
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,397
- Very good.
- Thank you.

212
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,026
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.

213
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,196
You're gonna do what to my clocks?

214
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,365
Set them to my time.

215
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,451
I'm confused.

216
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,579
I thought we shared time.

217
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:53,167
No. See, in my bedroom
I set my clock six minutes fast.

218
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,251
Wanna know why?

219
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:59,006
Because it's in a slightly different
time zone than the kitchen?

220
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,215
Forget it.

221
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,716
No, come on, tell me.

222
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,719
- You don't understand.
- Come on.

223
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,054
You don't have any obsessive things.

224
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,057
No, that's not true.

225
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:11,894
Oh, yeah?
Tell me one of yours.

226
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,945
One of my things is
I always separate my sweat socks...

227
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:26,117
...from my dress socks.

228
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,036
What if they get mixed up?

229
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,039
Boy, I would just...

230
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,083
I would freak out.

231
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,169
You would not.

232
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:41,006
I can't believe this.
I hate this. You're too normal.

233
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,300
I can't believe you
don't have a "thing".

234
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,094
My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing".

235
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:51,100
See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off well.

236
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,070
- Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
- Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

237
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:08,450
He suspects you dropped the ball
on the Lender project.

238
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,162
Why? Why does he suspect that?

239
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,706
At first, he thought it was Joseph...

240
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:20,004
...but after he asked Joseph about it,
turns out it was you.

241
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:23,966
- Anyway, I thought you should know.
- All right. That's it.

242
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,467
Look, Joey...

243
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,553
...I realize this is the role
of a lifetime for you...

244
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:32,933
...and if I could just fire Joseph,
I would. But that's not possible.

245
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,436
So I have to let you both go.

246
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,981
What? Everybody loves Joseph.

247
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,359
I don't. I hate Joseph.

248
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,279
I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.

249
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:51,993
You can't fire Joseph.
He's not in your department.

250
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:59,251
All right, okay.
So I can't fire Joseph...

251
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,754
...but I can sleep with his wife.

252
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:05,549
Not Karen!

253
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,094
Yeah, I'm thinking about
having an affair with her.

254
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,096
You know what?

255
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,723
I just did.

256
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,519
What the hell are you doing?

257
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,020
Oh, it's not me.

258
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,315
It's my character!

259
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,650
Chandie.

260
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:27,154
The rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives...

261
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,364
...and then laughs about it.

262
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:33,035
In fact, I have her panties
right there in my drawer!

263
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:37,289
- Really?
- No, freak show, she's fictional!

264
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,707
Take it easy.

265
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:44,129
If it means that much to you,
I'll go find something else.

266
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,173
Thank you.

267
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,470
It's just that
I'm gonna miss Joseph.

268
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,972
I liked him. His wife.

269
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:57,017
She was hot.

270
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,107
Please take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.

271
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:07,027
No, sorry, hon.
Monica's orders.

272
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:10,739
Well, that wasn't easy.

273
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,325
Okay, dinner's on.

274
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,786
There's a peach cobbler
warming in the oven.

275
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:21,667
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that
shouldn't be a problem for you.

276
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,710
All right, you kids.
Bye, now.

277
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,796
- Bye.
- Oh, look, look.

278
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,424
A low-budget puppet show.

279
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,680
A shame you can't see
what finger I'm holding up.

280
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,978
- Wine?
- Please.

281
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,407
- Spilled some.
- I got it.

282
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,961
You look beautiful tonight.

283
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,588
What?

284
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,550
Sorry.

285
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,804
You look beautiful.

286
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:35,323
You know what? That's it.
That's it.

287
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:44,249
Oh, yes.

288
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,544
Good.

289
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,635
You guys, did you...?

290
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:03,768
<i>Monica...</i>

291
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,188
...wake up.

292
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,648
What's up?

293
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,776
I thought of a thing.

294
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,072
Yeah?

295
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:21,912
I have to sleep, have to,
on this side of the bed.

296
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:25,374
No. You have to sleep
on this side of the bed...

297
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:30,087
...because I have to sleep
on this side of the bed.

298
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,674
Or so I would have you believe.

299
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:40,180
So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.

300
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,475
Hey, come on. You haven't
heard my reason yet.

301
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,519
All right, go on.

302
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,106
I have to sleep on the west side...

303
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,401
...because I grew up in California...

304
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,528
...and otherwise...

305
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:59,408
...the ocean would be on the wrong side.

306
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,163
Oh, my God.

307
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,082
You're a freak!

308
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,252
How about that?

309
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,882
Where're you shipping off to?

310
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,258
I really can't say.

311
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,177
Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?

312
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:20,638
I can't say.

313
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,641
Do you get to look through
a periscope thingy?

314
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,726
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

315
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:29,396
Wow, it's neat learning
about submarines.

316
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,440
- I better not miss my flight.
- I'll walk you out.

317
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:36,612
- Bye, Ryan.
- Pleasure. Take care.

318
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:46,288
So do you think we could get you
one of those uniform things?

319
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,165
You like that, do you?

320
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,625
Oh, yeah.

321
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,795
I'll make some calls.

322
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,173
Can you believe that's how
we spent our two weeks?

323
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,216
We didn't do the romantic
things I'd planned...

324
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:03,055
...like having a picnic in Central Park
and coffee at Central Perk.

325
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:06,350
Oh, I just got that!

326
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,943
Taxi!

327
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:24,117
Bye, you.

328
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,966
I'm sorry, we're...

329
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,095
Hey, sailor.

330
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:46,473
Is this what you had in mind?

331
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,934
I'll say.

332
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,732
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

333
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,861
Well, then...

334
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:03,032
...we better make this night count.

335
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:08,286
Wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.

336
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,713
Anchors aweigh.

337
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:23,551
Oh, wait, wait!
My purse, my purse!

338
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,434
I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

339
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:34,271
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?

340
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,235
Honey!
