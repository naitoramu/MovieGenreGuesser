1
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,007
You can't just cut off my power!

2
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:10,633
How much do I owe? Only $700!

3
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,097
How long will it take? You're joking!

4
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:58,161
"Bad luck" by Luna Ng

5
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:01,687
What bad luck. My power got cut!

6
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:04,194
I have no heat, no light.

7
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:07,820
And I forgot to backup my columns.

8
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,388
So they're all gone.

9
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:12,684
There's a local saying,
"Stepping on poop".

10
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:16,690
Have you worn shoes with grooved soles.

11
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,057
And stepped in a soft pile?

12
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,155
If so, you understand.

13
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,689
Hello? Susan!

14
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:32,393
I'll write it when I get home.

15
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:35,959
My power was cut off!

16
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,995
Really!

17
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:41,892
It will take another hour.

18
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,588
All right... goodbye!

19
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:28,560
I'll bring it to you.

20
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,688
No, thanks!

21
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:33,455
I'm unlucky today. I'll break it!

22
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,113
Then I'll sell it to you cheaper.

23
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:37,620
I am afraid of that.

24
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,347
Broken pieces are useful, too.

25
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:44,712
I made this. So nice.

26
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:46,181
Right!

27
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:48,948
It is pretty!

28
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:52,684
Not for sale!

29
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:56,919
Vinyl records? People want these?

30
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:00,914
This is great stuff. Nat King Cole and.

31
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:03,112
Frank Sinatra's classic collections.

32
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:06,648
My first boyfriend loved these.

33
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:09,415
I gave him a limited edition
once for his birthday.

34
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:10,913
He was so happy...

35
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm holding this for someone.

36
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,576
This is the one, I gave it to him!

37
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:28,374
My first boyfriend!

38
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:32,010
That's my signature, I'm Luna!

39
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,647
Why is it here?

40
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:36,515
You're a Virgo?

41
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:38,712
How did you know?

42
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:42,968
You should stay home today, you know.

43
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:46,314
He can do this because I'm a Virgo?

44
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:47,682
That's too cruel!

45
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:50,579
It took me forever to find this.

46
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,075
I can't let anyone else have it.

47
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:56,972
It's already been bought!

48
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:59,739
He didn't have enough cash,
he'll be back.

49
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,176
Trust is important in business, see?

50
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:05,643
Please, I'll give you more money.

51
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:07,001
Call him!

52
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:13,973
I understand.

53
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:15,871
I see!

54
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,378
I sympathize with you.

55
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:20,606
Let me speak to the boss lady.

56
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:24,472
I don't care who she is.

57
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,340
That record is mine.

58
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,497
I'm coming to get it now, thanks.

59
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,973
He said no.

60
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:34,670
He did?!

61
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,107
He pretended to sympathize with me!

62
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:39,405
He said he's coming now.

63
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:41,203
Wait here and beg him face to face.

64
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:42,771
Me, beg him?

65
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:43,471
Yes!

66
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,269
I can tell from his voice he's nasty!

67
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:48,665
All men are cold-blooded!

68
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,475
I hope the record is mouldy and scratchy.

69
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:15,135
Where are you?

70
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,862
In a taxi, on my way
to pick up something.

71
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,129
I just want to see where are you now.

72
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,135
When will you come back?

73
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:25,294
Don't be late.

74
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:27,232
Last time I played two songs
before you arrived.

75
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:28,770
They made me write a report.

76
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,029
I know!

77
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:32,896
I don't want to seem to be defending you.

78
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:36,232
My fans are the ones defending me.

79
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:38,260
Without fans, they can go to hell.

80
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:56,070
Why is the beer warm?

81
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,998
I told you about the power cut.

82
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:15,059
Don't throw my things away.

83
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,919
C.H. Yuen, you come out here now!

84
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,328
You have two choices.

85
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,425
First, hire a maid.

86
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:31,351
Second, move in with me!

87
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,328
Rent-free?

88
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:36,485
Pay just a little!

89
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:39,861
You're paying so much for this space!

90
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:42,958
But it's still my own place!

91
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:45,086
If I move in with you.

92
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,724
I have to tolerate you and your buddies.

93
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:51,189
My side of the bed is in demand.

94
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:52,917
I've warned you.

95
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:55,254
If you can rent it out.

96
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:57,222
You have to return my...

97
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:05,123
I never gave you anything.

98
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:08,979
Let's go eat.

99
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,287
I'm meeting my buddies
at Luk Yew Tea House.

100
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:12,955
No, thanks.

101
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,613
I don't want to listen to men to gossip.

102
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:17,819
Which beauty queens being with whom.

103
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:25,021
That's why you can't think of any topics.

104
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:29,017
You have to meet people to find topics.

105
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,815
Sorry, I don't write gossip columns.

106
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:32,623
Nor do free advertising.

107
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:35,919
Aren't you noble.

108
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,086
You'll be living off me, anyway.

109
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:05,606
C.H. Yuen!

110
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:08,583
If I had money I'd sue you!

111
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:44,243
Ready!

112
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:49,937
Vinyl Record Courier,
your host Cheung Yung.

113
00:10:58,018 --> 00:10:59,846
There's something called
"The Beauty of Imperfection".

114
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:04,281
When we listen to Zhou Xuan
of Edith Piaf.

115
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,399
Both women have.

116
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,946
Girlish singing voices.

117
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:12,642
I feel this is
"The Beauty of Imperfection".

118
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:15,539
Then there's "The Beauty of Regret".

119
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:18,136
What is that?

120
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:20,933
I'll tell you later.

121
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,938
First let's listen to an Edith Piaf song.

122
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:25,471
I still miss him.

123
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:27,898
I don't know how to forget him.

124
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:31,205
I make myself very busy.

125
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:34,571
Like now, I'm still at work.

126
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:37,468
I called you so I wouldn't think of him.

127
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,935
Doing two things at the same time.

128
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,563
You're still at work?

129
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:46,797
We'll talk softly so you boss won't hear.

130
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,764
Ask you boss if he can hear us now.

131
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:53,031
You men have no sympathy!

132
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,598
Rich girls have taken
the sympathetic ones.

133
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:58,325
Vinyl record lovers have cold hearts.

134
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:00,662
The more pity I show,
the worse you'll feel.

135
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:02,200
But I make fun of you.

136
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,297
You get angry, throw a fit,
curse me to hell.

137
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,763
Turn your anger around and feel better.

138
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,598
Some say my voice is harsh.

139
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:15,665
I understand that.

140
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,792
You're tired after a hard day.

141
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:21,689
You get home, put down you things.

142
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:24,955
You want a drink, and get into your slippers.

143
00:13:27,402 --> 00:13:28,731
No way.

144
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,827
Your wife has to cook, and is a nag.

145
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:33,895
Your husband has to socialize.

146
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,223
The kids want to watch TV.

147
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:38,290
The maid won't get off the phone.

148
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:44,394
You seek comfort from a soothing voice.

149
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:48,619
But that's like whoring.

150
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,916
I don't want to induce
indecent behaviour.

151
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:53,693
So I'll continue using.

152
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:56,320
This voice on my show.

153
00:13:58,258 --> 00:14:02,523
I just mentioned "The Beauty of Regret".

154
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:06,089
You like something, can't have it.

155
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:08,527
That's "The Beauty of Regret".

156
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,024
Not everyone is intelligent enough.

157
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:12,882
To appreciate it.

158
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,047
Today a woman begged me.

159
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:19,215
To let her have a vinyl record.

160
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,290
Saying it was a gift to her first love.

161
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,586
Of course I didn't, for my own good.

162
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:31,252
Hoping she can feel
"The Beauty of Regret".

163
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:32,960
It's not always good to posses.

164
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:36,356
First loves leave
the deepest impressions.

165
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:40,252
Mementos from those cause sadness.

166
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,820
Why keep them?

167
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,979
I'm played this duet.

168
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:46,145
For the woman I just met on the phone.

169
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:49,182
An Armstrong and Fitzgerald song.

170
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,747
Mrs. Yuen, this is Luna.

171
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,053
Remember? I used to visit!

172
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,920
Luna! How are you?

173
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:01,478
Is C.H. there?

174
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:03,985
He went to Canada years ago.

175
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,142
Do you have his number?

176
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,579
You're looking for him?

177
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:11,517
Yes!

178
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,652
It's midnight there.

179
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,387
I'll wait to call in the morning.

180
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:23,314
Well, let me ask him.

181
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:26,181
I'll have him call you.

182
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,808
What, he's a movie star now?

183
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:40,405
Susan, it's me.

184
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:43,042
I'm writing a piece
I want to run tomorrow.

185
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:44,740
Can you let Layout Dept. Know?

186
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:47,976
Please help me with this, okay?

187
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:06,736
"Regret"

188
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:09,113
Regret starts with cold-heartedness.

189
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:12,879
A lawyer friend tells me.

190
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:17,034
Some criminals are born without shame.

191
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:18,542
Once, he heard.

192
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:22,049
A man accused of cheating the elderly.

193
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:24,236
Defending his actions by saying.

194
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:28,641
"He'll be cheated anyway, why not by me?"

195
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,079
If you were in the jury.

196
00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:35,374
Would you acquit him for his honesty?

197
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,840
Sir, your dish of steak.

198
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,877
Some people are worse.

199
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:43,914
They do brutal things.

200
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:49,398
Then openly flaunt it on the radio.

201
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,375
That man's name is Cheung Yung.

202
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:00,336
What qualifies him to be a DJ?

203
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:01,635
It's noise pollution.

204
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:03,812
Bending logic to justify his actions.

205
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:06,309
I ordered it medium; look.

206
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:08,207
There's no blood at all.

207
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,706
Sorry, I'll get you another.

208
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:13,002
Are you listening to this?

209
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,369
Every word. And getting hungrier.

210
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,126
She's naming you in her column.

211
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:20,873
My boss is her loyal fan.

212
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,528
He's a fool, you'll soon take his place.

213
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,894
Others read her, too; so do I!

214
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:32,970
How did you offend her?

215
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,036
But you do that every day.

216
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:39,603
What's her name?

217
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:41,870
Luna Ng!

218
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:45,196
Let me see it!

219
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:50,930
"Luna Talks" (Menstrual Cycle)?!

220
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:55,295
No wonder she's like this, she's...

221
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:06,692
Good, it bleeds.

222
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:19,758
Oscar wouldn't come in with me.

223
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:22,565
He was afraid of the cat on your sign.

224
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:24,523
Right, Oscar?

225
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:27,300
Then I gave him some counseling.

226
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,196
Bought him a Hello Kitty chew toy.

227
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:33,263
So he stopped fearing cats.

228
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,130
Bad boy, you chewed up Hello Kitty?

229
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:37,698
He's not a bad boy.

230
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:40,924
He's such a good boy.

231
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,760
When I'm sad and crying alone.

232
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,018
He licks away my tears.

233
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:48,856
Because they taste like beef.

234
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:52,122
Of course not; we're both vegetarians.

235
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:59,054
Oscar lights up my life.

236
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:04,388
I don't wait for the phone
to ring any more.

237
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,784
Or wait for dates,
forcing myself to smile.

238
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:13,628
You should get a dog.

239
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:14,787
But I'm not gay.

240
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:16,125
But you're lonely.

241
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,323
It shows?

242
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:21,430
More so than your pimples.

243
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:23,317
It'll be more obvious with a dog.

244
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,284
But you won't feel it.

245
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:30,190
Take him with you to work.

246
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,727
Train him to watch your customers.

247
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:35,824
Take him to the park.

248
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:38,650
Sleep with him when it's cold.

249
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,948
The best way is to adopt.

250
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:44,854
Orphans are so eager to please.

251
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:47,391
Look at my Oscar.

252
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:49,189
Where can I get one?

253
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:52,985
You can get one from the SAA.

254
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:55,452
They have all kinds of dogs there.

255
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:03,343
Oscar, let me look at you... Oscar.

256
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:05,521
He's licking my acne cream.

257
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:07,648
It must taste like veggies.

258
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:10,845
Holy shit!

259
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:12,713
Acne cream will kill him!

260
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:14,790
What can we do? Shit!

261
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,977
I'll bring you to the vet, to Dr. Mario.

262
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:23,581
Dr. Mario?

263
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:41,211
You again?

264
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,748
Yes, me again!

265
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:47,214
I've been here the past few days.

266
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,602
But not tomorrow.

267
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:54,316
That pathetic woman yesterday...

268
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,574
She wasn't pathetic.

269
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:57,972
Is she an old customer?

270
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:00,520
You feel bad and wish
to return the record?

271
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:02,917
- Do I look like that?
- No!

272
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:03,736
Correct!

273
00:21:03,816 --> 00:21:05,005
What do you want?

274
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:06,373
Just looking.

275
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,081
Pimples get worse with squeezing.

276
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,641
I shouldn't have sold you that record.

277
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,207
A dog must be better than men like you.

278
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:34,112
I think that caller is going nowhere.

279
00:21:34,182 --> 00:21:36,580
A man beat her, she doesn't do anything.

280
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:38,437
All she does is cry.

281
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,136
Maybe she did hit back.

282
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,194
Calling to complain.

283
00:21:41,374 --> 00:21:43,712
Is an obvious way to get pity.

284
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,899
Women shouldn't do that.

285
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:47,098
This is the 21st century.

286
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:53,241
But women lose control sometimes...

287
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:55,668
Listen to him!

288
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:57,676
Think up a good story tonight.

289
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,603
And tear him to shreds.

290
00:22:00,673 --> 00:22:02,441
An American woman.

291
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:04,469
Killed a man, blamed it on PMS.

292
00:22:04,678 --> 00:22:06,796
And was acquitted. Can you believe it?

293
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:11,501
So a local woman writer copied her.

294
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,438
Calls her column
"Luna Talks" (Menstrual Cycle).

295
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:17,165
A cheap gimmick to get attention.

296
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:18,733
Take me to the radio station!

297
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:21,600
You're crazy!
You're walking into his trap.

298
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,107
She has a period daily, what can you do?

299
00:22:26,374 --> 00:22:29,631
As a man, I've never suffered from this.

300
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,096
I pity the women who have periods daily.

301
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:36,993
Besides telling them to see a doctor.

302
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:41,837
I can only play them this song.

303
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:47,401
"The Lady is a Tramp"!

304
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:55,162
Done? Have some more.

305
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,300
No, I can't...

306
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,827
I have to write tomorrow.

307
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,795
Forget it!

308
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:03,593
Wash your face, have another drink.

309
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,061
Come here.

310
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:11,694
Happy birthday!

311
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:13,202
Thank you.

312
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:15,200
Why are you so late?

313
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:26,128
We don't have you after-dinner habits.

314
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:27,397
Meaning what?

315
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:30,433
Shopping at Prada, Gucci!

316
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:36,257
I only go to Ferragamo.

317
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,393
Of course, you're old-fashioned.

318
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:17,221
Drunk already?

319
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,249
What?

320
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,588
She's drunk, we're going home.

321
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:22,216
Going so soon?

322
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:30,347
Luna Ng!

323
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:33,653
Come back here now!

324
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:35,251
You can't leave yet!

325
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:39,187
Come back, don't go.

326
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:51,254
Let me introduce you.

327
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,390
Academic genius Luna Ng.

328
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,356
I don't read newspapers
but she's a famous columnist.

329
00:24:58,585 --> 00:25:01,492
My classmate, Denise Ma.

330
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:07,745
He's your equal in the radio world.

331
00:25:07,825 --> 00:25:08,944
He's...

332
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:11,511
I'm Cheung Yung.

333
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,717
Sorry, excuse me.

334
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:32,308
Big or small?

335
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:35,245
Big!

336
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:37,213
Male or female?

337
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:41,947
Whatever can protect me.

338
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,645
Male, then.

339
00:25:45,284 --> 00:25:47,042
Do many people leave their dogs here?

340
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:51,007
Lots of dogs, and cats.

341
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:54,403
And birds, hamsters, turtles, mice...

342
00:25:54,483 --> 00:25:57,810
Lizards, snakes, anything that moves.

343
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,847
Especially after Christmas.

344
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:01,116
Why?

345
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,983
People buy pets as gifts.

346
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:06,240
Good for about two months.

347
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,299
Come with me!

348
00:26:11,844 --> 00:26:14,751
My horoscope's lucky number today is 9.

349
00:26:30,813 --> 00:26:31,782
This one?

350
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,840
He's good, his name is Mo Mo.

351
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:38,335
Here's Mommy!

352
00:26:45,707 --> 00:26:47,974
Here you are.

353
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:52,829
There's plenty for everyone.

354
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,035
I just want to know if it's true.

355
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,903
What?

356
00:26:58,073 --> 00:27:00,470
Did you throw urine on Cheung Yung?

357
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,799
Urine?

358
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:04,296
I wish, but I didn't have enough.

359
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:09,470
So I used red wine. Who said urine?

360
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,937
The gossip rag from next door.

361
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:14,105
You're truly my idol.

362
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,663
I hate that guy.

363
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:17,761
You must have called his show.

364
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:18,860
And he embarrassed you.

365
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,767
No, all women I know hate him.

366
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:23,774
But you listen anyway.

367
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:27,600
You should keep writing bad about him.

368
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,108
Clobber him while you're ahead.

369
00:27:29,168 --> 00:27:30,397
Yes, by popular demand.

370
00:27:30,477 --> 00:27:33,304
Many readers will write to support you.

371
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:34,502
No need for that.

372
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:37,799
I personally attacked him, good enough?

373
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:39,996
Why didn't you take photos?

374
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,563
See how aggressive you are.

375
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:44,701
Are you afraid he'll sue you?

376
00:27:44,771 --> 00:27:45,760
He'll sue you.

377
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:48,127
Sure!

378
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:51,673
Ask your boss
if he'll pay for my lawsuit.

379
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,272
Please don't!

380
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,899
Boss is a horny goat.

381
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:00,364
No, that's free publicity. Sue him.

382
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:03,830
I don't think he'll sue you.

383
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,397
Don't say I never warned you.

384
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:10,133
Be careful. There's bound to be more.

385
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:01,925
Hello?

386
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:03,254
What are you doing?

387
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:05,651
I was just about to go out.

388
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:09,017
I'm free after my meeting, and you?

389
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:10,815
Laundry!

390
00:29:11,525 --> 00:29:13,922
And planning long-range strategies.

391
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:17,258
Why blow it out of proportion?

392
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:21,384
I know what I'm doing.

393
00:29:47,455 --> 00:29:49,223
"I love Robots"

394
00:29:49,293 --> 00:29:52,849
Blue-collar robots,
the ones in factories.

395
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:54,887
Have been around for a long time.

396
00:29:55,156 --> 00:29:58,423
Why isn't there
a domestic assistant robot?

397
00:29:58,822 --> 00:30:00,880
Every time I take my clothes
to the laundry.

398
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,147
I hope it will come rescue me.

399
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:06,284
I don't want to carry my heavy laundry.

400
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:08,511
And I must remember my ticket.

401
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,147
I want a new dog.

402
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:13,326
What's wrong?

403
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:16,223
He ignores me when I call.

404
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:17,551
Did you use an anger voice?

405
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:19,709
No! I was so gentle.

406
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:24,084
Mo Mo, come here, Mo Mo.

407
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:27,850
You're using the wrong tone. It's Mo Mo.

408
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,317
- Mo Mo...
- Isn't it similar.

409
00:30:30,387 --> 00:30:31,516
Not at all!

410
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:33,384
Dogs have very sensitive ears.

411
00:30:33,454 --> 00:30:36,780
He thinks you're calling someone else.

412
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,776
Okay. He peed three times
on my leg today.

413
00:30:41,984 --> 00:30:45,251
Why? My leg is not that thin,
or straight.

414
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,719
Not like a street lamp.

415
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:48,377
Do you know why dogs pee?

416
00:30:49,186 --> 00:30:50,155
They need to.

417
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,551
Yes, but also to claim territory.

418
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:56,638
He establishes his territory by scent.

419
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:58,546
Today, of all things.

420
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:00,314
He peed on your leg three times.

421
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:01,712
That means he likes you.

422
00:31:01,882 --> 00:31:03,970
He wants to include your leg
in his territory.

423
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,816
If he's lost
he follows the smell back to you.

424
00:31:08,245 --> 00:31:09,144
Are you serious?

425
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,941
Yes, be patient.

426
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:14,109
Dogs are like this. When he feels secure.

427
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:15,337
He'll stop.

428
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:18,674
The more you give, the more you receive.

429
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:19,972
And the more he pees?

430
00:31:20,851 --> 00:31:23,338
Give him some time.

431
00:31:23,418 --> 00:31:25,936
Look, he can't bear to part with you.

432
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:27,873
He loves you. Look!

433
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,542
Go home with her.

434
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:32,948
Go home now, bye.

435
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,175
Goodbye, Mo Mo, goodbye.

436
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:39,510
I'd like to look at the old newspapers.

437
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,669
Sure!

438
00:31:56,342 --> 00:31:58,240
"Old Loves".

439
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,567
I have a white umbrella.

440
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:03,374
When it was new, it was beautiful.

441
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:07,499
Long and slim, like an outstanding woman.

442
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:11,405
Unfortunately, her beauty faded quickly.

443
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:14,801
After a while the white became yellowed.

444
00:32:14,971 --> 00:32:17,069
And stains appeared like freckles.

445
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,906
Besides, length is not an advantage.

446
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:22,563
Not as understanding
as folding umbrellas.

447
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,999
So I began to create opportunities.

448
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,067
To take it out on rainy days.

449
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:31,932
Hoping I'd leave it behind.

450
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:34,769
Let it disappear, a painless separation.

451
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:37,566
A perfect excuse to buy a new one.

452
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:38,865
Won't that be nice?

453
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:42,001
The unloved are sensitive.

454
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:44,898
One day, it just disappeared.

455
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:47,096
Without wasting my energy.

456
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,273
Umbrellas have their dignity, too.

457
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:53,428
But wait, I'm not ready.

458
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:56,835
It can't disappear without my permission.

459
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,961
I became determined to get it back.

460
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:04,296
Thought about where I had left it.

461
00:33:04,736 --> 00:33:09,131
Bookstore? Restaurant? Subway?

462
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:10,669
Went all over the place.

463
00:33:11,768 --> 00:33:13,966
Finally I found it in the cinema.

464
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:18,021
It was pouting, waiting for me.

465
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:20,498
I recovered my lost love, all was well.

466
00:33:34,103 --> 00:33:35,562
But from another angle.

467
00:33:35,632 --> 00:33:37,530
If I had really lost it.

468
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,928
It would be gone forever.

469
00:33:39,897 --> 00:33:43,563
Would that touch of regret
suit me better?

470
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:49,666
All lover's reunions are beyond words.

471
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,695
Right?

472
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:59,096
Last week I mentioned
"The Beauty of Regret".

473
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:02,182
I was attacked by a woman writer for it.

474
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:06,657
She said I was brutal,
nearly deported me.

475
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,156
And later even.

476
00:34:10,163 --> 00:34:13,420
My listeners know
I seldom read the papers.

477
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:16,726
Especially those whiny columns.

478
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:20,112
I wasted precious time just now.

479
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:23,429
To read up on this woman's works.

480
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:26,225
And I discovered.

481
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:28,313
Someone changed their tune.

482
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:31,020
I know some of you.

483
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,717
Are cursing me as you're listening.

484
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,315
But!

485
00:34:35,555 --> 00:34:39,491
Judge this case with fairness.

486
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,486
Listen as I read this, it's quite long.

487
00:34:45,394 --> 00:34:47,122
The title is "Old Loves"

488
00:34:47,991 --> 00:34:50,189
I have a white umbrella...

489
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,654
If I'd really lost it.

490
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:56,242
It would be gone forever.

491
00:34:56,322 --> 00:35:00,418
Would that touch of regret
suit me better?

492
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:02,485
Touch of regret!

493
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:07,180
I bought a second-hand vinyl record.

494
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,786
An ex-boyfriend trying to lose it.

495
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:14,812
This "love gift"
he never wants to see again.

496
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:17,948
As the host of Vinyl Record Courier.

497
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:20,915
Don't you think
I should rescue the record.

498
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,643
And share it with you all?

499
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:24,211
Think about it.

500
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,718
If this "love gift".

501
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:29,515
Was returned to an ill-tempered giver.

502
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:34,520
Goodbye, see you at the incinerator.

503
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:39,844
But although I despise this rough woman.

504
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:43,749
And believe me, she is very rough.

505
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:49,343
She is quite a good writer.

506
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:53,309
In spite of all the nagging,
it's not bad.

507
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:56,545
If she can just control herself.

508
00:35:56,855 --> 00:36:00,251
I promise I'll buy that paper every day.

509
00:36:00,321 --> 00:36:02,479
And stop stealing it from my neighbour.

510
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:05,645
I'm getting thirsty,
let's listen to a song.

511
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:18,541
"I have a gift of love."

512
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,745
"I want to give it to you."

513
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:27,711
"It is my heart!"

514
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,575
"My deep love for you will never change."

515
00:36:32,645 --> 00:36:36,601
"I have a gift of love."

516
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:41,535
"I want to dedicate it to you."

517
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:45,241
"My true love to you lasts forever."

518
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:49,706
"Until the end of the world."

519
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:52,673
See, the ratings doubled.

520
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:56,838
Our competitors are so nervous.

521
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,665
Strike while the iron is hot.

522
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:03,711
Have that Lunar Cycle woman as a guest.

523
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:11,662
You must accept!

524
00:37:11,742 --> 00:37:13,610
It's great publicity, Miss.

525
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,366
He has tens of thousands of listeners.

526
00:37:18,075 --> 00:37:20,562
I'm not falling into this trap.

527
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,530
He wants to use me.

528
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,566
Use him back, silly.

529
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,863
Your book is coming out, publicize it.

530
00:37:28,943 --> 00:37:31,670
This is called revenge.

531
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:35,176
He talks dirty, I'm afraid...

532
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:38,362
You're already, thrown wine on him.

533
00:37:38,442 --> 00:37:39,671
You're just as bad.

534
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,958
Max is putting together a website.

535
00:37:42,038 --> 00:37:44,735
And wants a "Lovers' Mailbox" chat room.

536
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,363
He wants you to host it.

537
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:50,259
Practice on the radio first.

538
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:53,036
Isn't that great? Do it!

539
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:58,130
Me, on camera? I only know how to write.

540
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,098
Why not? It just the same.

541
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:03,434
It's hip to be multimedia these days.

542
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:05,662
How much can you make just writing?

543
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:07,860
Cockroach!

544
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:12,564
You'll have rats soon;
this is a junkyard.

545
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,300
Books and papers attract roaches.

546
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,799
You're a coward.

547
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:20,665
Forget it, you're hiring a maid.

548
00:38:28,936 --> 00:38:30,494
Mo Mo! Dumb dog!

549
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:34,560
Mo Mo!

550
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,488
Know your limitations, idiot!

551
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,118
Mo Mo!

552
00:39:32,196 --> 00:39:33,984
Mo Mo!

553
00:39:36,092 --> 00:39:37,390
Mo Mo!

554
00:39:40,157 --> 00:39:41,626
Mo Mo!

555
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,088
Mo Mo!

556
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:52,653
Horny Goat!

557
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,349
Horny Goat!

558
00:39:57,088 --> 00:40:00,285
Since you don't answer to your name,
Horny Goat!

559
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:07,547
Good boy!

560
00:40:07,886 --> 00:40:10,753
Great. Daddy found Mo Mo!

561
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:12,112
Horny Goat!

562
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,077
Not only are you horny, but...

563
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,752
What are you talking about?

564
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:22,890
Don't touch my dog.

565
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,318
Your dog?

566
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:26,406
Where did you find him?

567
00:40:27,055 --> 00:40:28,613
Mo Mo! Come with me!

568
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,377
He doesn't know you.

569
00:40:34,457 --> 00:40:35,346
Right, Mo Mo?

570
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,475
Dumb dog!

571
00:40:36,555 --> 00:40:39,541
Don't conspire with others against me.

572
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:42,878
If not for me you'd be dead.

573
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:44,376
Dumb dog!

574
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:46,713
Heartless beast!

575
00:40:50,189 --> 00:40:51,238
Pretty Babe!

576
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:05,013
I had a crush, on her.

577
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:10,177
I found out she was sad;
her dog had died.

578
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:13,913
I spent a fortune, bought a similar dog.

579
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:15,342
To make her happy.

580
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:18,548
I even trained him well for a month.

581
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:20,905
I'm not good with people.

582
00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:22,534
But okay with dogs.

583
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:28,107
But she changed jobs, changed her number.

584
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,075
And the dog...

585
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:33,871
Of course, you're short and bad.

586
00:41:34,181 --> 00:41:36,438
And you called me "witch".

587
00:41:36,648 --> 00:41:38,576
It's because you called me "horny goat".

588
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,512
The word "loyal"
is written on my forehead.

589
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,010
You can see it
under an ultraviolet light.

590
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,238
It's very clear.

591
00:41:45,308 --> 00:41:48,145
Too bad it's not the word "handsome".

592
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:51,871
Or we'd have the dog
to thank for our love.

593
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:55,437
Look in the mirror, Pretty Babe.

594
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,769
Welcome, Miss Ng.

595
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:04,637
Denise will take care of you for me.

596
00:42:04,707 --> 00:42:07,574
Please don't be polite, blast him away.

597
00:42:08,043 --> 00:42:10,011
The more "wewungwung" the better.

598
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,729
Okay? Thanks.

599
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,364
What's a "wewungwung"?

600
00:42:17,113 --> 00:42:20,839
In old movies, when fighters face off.

601
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,607
Each radiates weapons from his palms.

602
00:42:22,677 --> 00:42:24,864
"Wewungwung" is the sound
when they clash.

603
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:27,032
It's okay. Generation gap.

604
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:28,470
You don't have one with him.

605
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,009
I work for him.

606
00:42:34,703 --> 00:42:37,430
Cheung Yung has prepared some questions.

607
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,768
Just pretend you're talking normally.

608
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:43,833
Talk about your questions.

609
00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:52,034
Have a drink.

610
00:43:20,073 --> 00:43:22,970
It's not drugged.

611
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,326
I have my first guest in two years.

612
00:43:44,696 --> 00:43:48,561
She has it coming 36 days a year.

613
00:43:49,031 --> 00:43:50,759
Miss Luna Ng.

614
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,666
Why is your column called "Luna Talks"?

615
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:57,751
How disappointing: I knew you'd ask this.

616
00:43:57,961 --> 00:44:00,298
And so I decided I won't answer.

617
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:02,116
No?

618
00:44:02,196 --> 00:44:03,994
Criminals have the right
to remain silent.

619
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:06,192
Will you remain silent
to all my questions?

620
00:44:06,262 --> 00:44:08,250
Depends on my mood.

621
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:11,057
Do you mind if I ask the questions?

622
00:44:11,766 --> 00:44:12,954
Stealing my spot?

623
00:44:13,034 --> 00:44:15,552
Yes, or taking calls for you.

624
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:17,989
I can be crude, too.

625
00:44:18,398 --> 00:44:20,956
Crudeness requires skill.

626
00:44:21,165 --> 00:44:23,063
Like going to a massage parlour.

627
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:25,990
It takes the right masseuse.

628
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,257
Sure, try it!

629
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:31,624
Miss Ng, I have a question for you.

630
00:44:31,694 --> 00:44:33,122
Are you married?

631
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:33,991
No!

632
00:44:34,061 --> 00:44:35,819
Not every woman is wanted.

633
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:38,986
Right, especially Hong Kong women.

634
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:42,891
So arrogant, crude, and self-righteous.

635
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:46,018
Tell a joke, and it's sexual harassment.

636
00:44:46,098 --> 00:44:47,786
Look at her and you're horny.

637
00:44:47,856 --> 00:44:49,654
Ask for a date
and she pretends to be busy.

638
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:52,491
You always pay for dinners.

639
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,388
Despises your Japanese car, really...

640
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,786
Mr. Chou, I think you are...

641
00:44:57,155 --> 00:44:58,784
You women are all alike.

642
00:44:58,853 --> 00:45:00,452
Ignorant, and love to interrupt.

643
00:45:00,522 --> 00:45:02,459
You've heard of President Clinton?

644
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:04,178
A very capable man.

645
00:45:04,258 --> 00:45:07,624
Got in trouble, nearly impeached. Why?

646
00:45:07,893 --> 00:45:09,152
Bad wife!

647
00:45:09,222 --> 00:45:12,049
Doesn't cook, talking all the time.

648
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:14,057
Makes a husband lose dignity.

649
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:16,184
He needs to cheat to tolerate that.

650
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:18,691
That stupid woman should be sent home.

651
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:20,090
For doing damage to her husband!

652
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,448
Who knew...

653
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:25,114
I feel we can no longer discuss this.

654
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:27,552
You think you're so wonderful.

655
00:45:27,622 --> 00:45:30,708
Rude, bitchy, tyrannical and opinionated.

656
00:45:30,788 --> 00:45:32,756
Just like my ex-wife.

657
00:45:32,826 --> 00:45:36,052
Working, not staying home
with the kids...

658
00:45:36,122 --> 00:45:37,281
If you don't hang up, I'm leaving!

659
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:39,179
No, our buddy is a bit temperamental.

660
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:40,977
But what he says makes sense.

661
00:45:41,286 --> 00:45:44,483
Feminist activists
only harm fellow women.

662
00:45:44,653 --> 00:45:47,589
What does a woman most care about?

663
00:45:47,649 --> 00:45:50,276
What do you most often write about?

664
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:52,254
It's love, isn't it?

665
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:55,111
You can't just talk about love.

666
00:45:55,181 --> 00:45:56,879
You must back it up with action.

667
00:45:56,949 --> 00:45:59,916
Cooking, housework are big parts of love.

668
00:45:59,986 --> 00:46:01,144
Right?

669
00:46:02,053 --> 00:46:03,542
Did you pay off that guy?

670
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,578
Women often imagine these things.

671
00:46:18,815 --> 00:46:20,403
She's gone?

672
00:46:20,683 --> 00:46:22,940
I think so, let's enjoy a song.

673
00:46:23,919 --> 00:46:25,707
Miss Ng, please listen: I'm sorry.

674
00:46:25,777 --> 00:46:28,404
He was out of line, don't blame him.

675
00:46:28,484 --> 00:46:29,813
Sorry, please listen to me.

676
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:31,141
Miss Ng!

677
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:40,241
You were right leaving like that.

678
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,937
Too bad you didn't talk about your book.

679
00:46:44,746 --> 00:46:46,944
I'm going to put
a cockroach in your mouth.

680
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:49,511
You got it made.

681
00:46:49,581 --> 00:46:52,268
The gossip pages will carry your picture.

682
00:46:52,547 --> 00:46:54,735
I should have taken some good PR photos.

683
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:59,170
It's okay,
I'll bring this tape to Claudia.

684
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,765
You know who she is? Chair of the EOC.

685
00:47:04,174 --> 00:47:08,170
He's dead meat.

686
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,587
You asked for more "wewungwung"

687
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:16,554
It depends on the situation.

688
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:19,320
I thought you had a brain.

689
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,792
Now the EOC is on our back.

690
00:47:25,062 --> 00:47:27,718
Saying we let our DJs chew out women.

691
00:47:27,798 --> 00:47:29,415
What shall we do?

692
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:34,148
Did you find that guy?

693
00:47:34,957 --> 00:47:39,081
If so, kill and silence his whole family.

694
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:46,450
I don't have to work here.

695
00:48:05,712 --> 00:48:08,937
Poetess Li Qing Zhao.

696
00:48:09,946 --> 00:48:14,899
Widowed and alone in her middle years.

697
00:48:15,837 --> 00:48:22,498
Was a refugee when her country fell.

698
00:48:23,037 --> 00:48:26,662
And felt she was getting older.

699
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,065
In looking back, she wrote.

700
00:48:31,365 --> 00:48:37,196
"Slow Sounds", now a classic.

701
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:42,518
Where is the Vinyl Records show?

702
00:48:42,728 --> 00:48:44,056
Programming changes?

703
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:45,524
Thanks!

704
00:48:57,656 --> 00:49:00,482
Searching, finding.

705
00:49:01,381 --> 00:49:04,716
Cold, quiet.

706
00:49:06,014 --> 00:49:11,276
Pathetic, woeful, lonely.

707
00:50:14,813 --> 00:50:15,942
Mo Mo, come!

708
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:17,449
Get the ball, Mo Mo!

709
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,314
Mo Mo, catch!

710
00:50:21,384 --> 00:50:22,871
Catch!

711
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:27,295
Mo Mo, over here.

712
00:50:27,814 --> 00:50:31,399
What happened? Throwing a fit?

713
00:50:34,744 --> 00:50:37,829
Every letter is demanding your return.

714
00:50:40,276 --> 00:50:42,033
Too bad your boss didn't say anything.

715
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:47,166
He sent me to tempt you to return.

716
00:50:47,565 --> 00:50:48,594
Really?

717
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,631
So this lunch is a company expense?

718
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:54,655
Excuse me, the wine list, please.

719
00:50:55,763 --> 00:50:57,750
Wine is big part of temptation.

720
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,525
Boss is being very humble.

721
00:51:01,695 --> 00:51:04,091
He didn't blow when you stormed out.

722
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,388
And defended you in front of the press.

723
00:51:06,957 --> 00:51:10,122
Tell him another station made an offer.

724
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,211
Really?

725
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:13,787
Would I still eating with you then?

726
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,352
I thought I could cross over with you.

727
00:51:21,116 --> 00:51:24,052
If they did, you wouldn't eat with me?

728
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,505
Eat. That grass is
less digestible than meat.

729
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,702
Cows have four stomachs,
you only have one.

730
00:51:37,382 --> 00:51:38,271
Hello? Yes!

731
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,568
The reception is bad, wait a moment.

732
00:51:41,346 --> 00:51:42,635
Yes...

733
00:51:48,376 --> 00:51:51,671
Hello, may I borrow your paper?

734
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:53,838
Thanks!

735
00:51:55,606 --> 00:51:58,192
"Luna Ng's column will return tomorrow"

"Lung Ng to Star in Chatroom"

737
00:52:32,052 --> 00:52:33,710
All right, let's go!

738
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:37,944
Countdown,, 4, 3, 2, 1!

739
00:52:43,815 --> 00:52:45,802
Hello, I'm Luna Ng!

740
00:52:45,882 --> 00:52:48,778
Welcome to "Love Chatroom"

741
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:07,001
This caller has an extramarital problem.

742
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:11,055
Guess if she's the wife or a concubine.

743
00:53:15,229 --> 00:53:17,665
Miss Ng, I want to die!

744
00:53:18,135 --> 00:53:21,260
I joined this company as a secretary.

745
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,786
Never thinking a year later,

746
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:26,762
I would be pregnant with my boss's child.

747
00:53:27,531 --> 00:53:28,889
- I love him...
- Cut!

748
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,387
Tell her to react!

749
00:53:34,061 --> 00:53:36,388
Miss Ng, Director told you.

750
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:38,255
You have to react more.

751
00:53:38,455 --> 00:53:42,179
Like, "You're pregnant? Congratulations!"

752
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:43,577
And so on!

753
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:46,214
I'll interrupt her reading.

754
00:53:46,283 --> 00:53:48,980
It's boring if you don't interact.

755
00:53:49,049 --> 00:53:50,208
Try again.

756
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:51,576
Action!

757
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,607
Not one good-looking one.

758
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,638
This one's not bad.

759
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:17,638
Just because she exposes flesh?

760
00:54:17,707 --> 00:54:19,695
Buck teeth, thin as a rail.

761
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,098
Nasty man!

762
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:39,555
- Save it!
- What?

763
00:54:41,363 --> 00:54:44,488
Capable men don't have to be handsome.

764
00:54:44,558 --> 00:54:46,955
But an ugly woman...

765
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:48,153
You're capable?

766
00:54:48,223 --> 00:54:51,678
Ever see K.S. Li chatting
in the daytime? Fat guy!

767
00:54:52,087 --> 00:54:53,315
Don't despise me because I'm fat.

768
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:55,612
Fat people are useful in cold weather.

769
00:54:55,682 --> 00:54:59,247
"Hugging a fat man
beats wearing a fur coat"

770
00:54:59,317 --> 00:55:01,683
Women diet,
they have cold hands and feet.

771
00:55:01,753 --> 00:55:02,941
Frozen meat!

772
00:55:08,483 --> 00:55:11,938
Where's my dictionary?

773
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:15,673
After this, I can't spell any more.

774
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:18,099
Why did you take my dictionary?

775
00:55:18,508 --> 00:55:20,935
I was being nice and handed it to you.

776
00:55:21,204 --> 00:55:22,732
Without a "thank you".

777
00:55:22,812 --> 00:55:26,537
Thanks; tell them to leave me alone.

778
00:55:26,607 --> 00:55:28,294
I've had it!

779
00:55:28,674 --> 00:55:30,231
They won't try you again.

780
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:31,789
You embarrassed Max.

781
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:35,763
I'm embarrassed!

782
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:39,028
I told you I can't handle it.

783
00:55:39,338 --> 00:55:41,425
But you promised to do the audition.

784
00:55:41,864 --> 00:55:44,520
You must refuse all the way.

785
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,587
I asked you to prepare but you refused.

786
00:55:46,797 --> 00:55:50,282
If it worked, you won't still be,

787
00:55:50,362 --> 00:55:52,419
Patching your column together.

788
00:55:52,489 --> 00:55:54,046
Look at Chua Lam, the famous columnist.

789
00:55:54,326 --> 00:55:56,623
Flying first class all over, every month.

790
00:55:56,693 --> 00:55:59,209
You're shut in here every day.

791
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:04,651
Let me do what I know how to do.

792
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,348
If you love me.

793
00:56:06,718 --> 00:56:09,274
I do, so I'm thinking for you.

794
00:56:09,354 --> 00:56:11,711
I even bought champagne.

795
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,338
It's useless now.

796
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:36,235
"A face I don't want to see."

797
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:38,461
"Keeps returning to me."

798
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:42,066
"I hope it will soon pass me by."

799
00:56:43,174 --> 00:56:45,331
"Extra roads I have walked."

800
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,628
"Won't bring me back to the start."

801
00:56:47,698 --> 00:56:51,362
"How did I ever meet you?"

802
00:56:51,732 --> 00:56:54,059
"If I told you all my troubles."

803
00:56:54,128 --> 00:56:56,395
"It would be pointless as shower gel."

804
00:56:56,565 --> 00:56:59,121
"Cleaning the memories."

805
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:00,629
"Exposing love and envy."

806
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,255
"Who is wrong, wrong becomes right."

807
00:57:03,325 --> 00:57:05,592
"My heart wants this precious love."

808
00:57:05,662 --> 00:57:07,519
"Why did you go far away."

809
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:15,916
"Without saying "no": I feel a loss."

810
00:57:16,556 --> 00:57:20,989
"Ten yesterdays. Bring nine memories."

811
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:25,283
"Without you,
I struggle with confusion."

812
00:57:25,453 --> 00:57:29,976
"One more day,
love will bring us together."

813
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,143
"I feel it's getting closer."

814
00:57:32,213 --> 00:57:36,806
"Remembering yesterday,
it will come true."

815
00:57:36,876 --> 00:57:41,369
"Without you,
I struggle with confusion."

816
00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:43,536
"One more day,
love will bring us together."

817
00:57:43,606 --> 00:57:44,834
Thanks!

818
00:57:46,572 --> 00:57:49,697
This is mine,
that's for my boyfriend.

819
00:57:49,777 --> 00:57:52,862
Lucky you,
a boyfriend who reads with you.

820
00:57:52,942 --> 00:57:55,129
He doesn't, but I try.

821
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,896
So I'm getting him one.

822
00:57:57,066 --> 00:57:59,333
Be careful when shopping for a boyfriend.

823
00:57:59,403 --> 00:58:01,590
I understand.

824
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:04,126
I know about you fight with Cheung Yung.

825
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:06,962
Well, his show is cancelled.

826
00:58:07,032 --> 00:58:08,999
- No, he's returning tonight.
- Really?

827
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:11,655
There's an advert in today's paper.

828
00:58:11,994 --> 00:58:13,552
Really?

829
00:58:14,431 --> 00:58:16,218
Beware of his attacks.

830
00:58:16,298 --> 00:58:17,386
That's right.

831
00:58:39,484 --> 00:58:41,781
It's me again.

832
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:47,502
Do you watch X-Files on TV?

833
00:58:48,082 --> 00:58:52,605
One character is very evil!

834
00:58:53,044 --> 00:58:56,130
He dies, but returns
after a few episodes.

835
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:58,536
To continues to wreak havoc.

836
00:58:59,405 --> 00:59:02,231
I am that character.

837
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,697
What do you hear?

838
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:07,493
Humble pie? No!

839
00:59:07,803 --> 00:59:09,770
It's a new invention, Arrogant pie.

840
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,285
You'll hear how well it works.

841
00:59:13,504 --> 00:59:15,052
But first, a song.

842
00:59:42,821 --> 00:59:46,476
Your stomach's growling.

843
00:59:46,855 --> 00:59:48,783
I just exercised.

844
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,608
Let's go eat.

845
00:59:51,678 --> 00:59:55,203
You're so fat, let's not.

846
01:00:00,745 --> 01:00:03,681
You're like a stove, and sticky, too.

847
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:07,595
You bit the hand that fed you.

848
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:12,738
A friend promised
to introduce me to a guy.

849
01:00:12,807 --> 01:00:14,635
But she never does so.

850
01:00:14,805 --> 01:00:15,963
How rude?

851
01:00:16,043 --> 01:00:20,057
Once, when we were both drunk.

852
01:00:20,506 --> 01:00:22,933
I asked "What about your promise?"

853
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:27,556
She drunkenly explained.

854
01:00:27,636 --> 01:00:31,061
"You will both hate me for life."

855
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,588
Why?

856
01:00:32,898 --> 01:00:35,824
I asked, and she said.

857
01:00:36,463 --> 01:00:39,259
"Because you're both so ugly."

858
01:00:39,329 --> 01:00:40,487
Stop laughing!

859
01:00:41,525 --> 01:00:45,749
I was sympathizing with you.

860
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:47,816
You? Sympathize with me?

861
01:00:48,385 --> 01:00:49,753
I understand, okay?

862
01:00:49,823 --> 01:00:53,408
We both have the same problem.

863
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,374
So, what's her name?

864
01:00:56,454 --> 01:00:57,422
Why?

865
01:00:58,281 --> 01:00:59,948
To see if I know her.

866
01:01:00,148 --> 01:01:03,373
Maybe she wanted to introduce me to...

867
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:04,671
You!

868
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,945
Of course not, I'm so handsome.

869
01:01:09,245 --> 01:01:11,442
Where? Who?

870
01:01:11,511 --> 01:01:14,996
Right here!

871
01:01:15,076 --> 01:01:16,404
Shameless!

872
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:28,497
Want to go eat?

873
01:01:29,236 --> 01:01:30,294
Whatever!

874
01:01:31,532 --> 01:01:32,361
What's this?

875
01:01:32,441 --> 01:01:34,628
Reception said someone left it for you.

876
01:01:34,897 --> 01:01:35,996
Open it!

877
01:01:43,335 --> 01:01:47,489
"Congrats on new start, leave me alone"

878
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:49,656
"From new moon to full moon"

879
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,158
Yes?

880
01:02:49,538 --> 01:02:50,926
You eat, don't you?

881
01:02:51,994 --> 01:02:54,331
How did you get my number?

882
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,148
You eat, don't you?

883
01:03:02,828 --> 01:03:07,352
Depends on mood, weather, with whom.

884
01:03:07,821 --> 01:03:11,755
It's a dark, cloudy day.

885
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:16,419
Perfect for a duel with your nemesis.

886
01:03:18,855 --> 01:03:22,939
2 p.m., Times Square taxi stand.

887
01:03:28,281 --> 01:03:29,749
Bring your white umbrella.

888
01:04:08,263 --> 01:04:10,190
I said we'd meet there.

889
01:04:10,659 --> 01:04:13,595
So why do I see you here?

890
01:04:14,294 --> 01:04:15,762
Been here long?

891
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:18,478
Thinking I'd stand you up?

892
01:04:20,395 --> 01:04:24,119
I sincerely asked you out to talk.

893
01:04:24,189 --> 01:04:25,517
About what?

894
01:04:27,884 --> 01:04:29,482
The sun came out!

895
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:32,248
Wrong weather for dueling, let's eat.

896
01:04:33,186 --> 01:04:36,551
First, let me explain
our misunderstanding.

897
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,718
Will you listen?

898
01:04:38,778 --> 01:04:40,945
Spare me!

899
01:04:41,015 --> 01:04:44,410
You smile now, but you may cry later.

900
01:04:45,578 --> 01:04:46,906
You hated me.

901
01:04:47,076 --> 01:04:50,301
Because I wouldn't return
your "love gift".

902
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:52,408
Actually.

903
01:04:53,676 --> 01:04:56,332
I have a personal, distressing reason.

904
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,237
Let's walk and talk.

905
01:05:21,026 --> 01:05:25,649
In high school,
I fell in love with a girl.

906
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:28,256
This was over 10 years ago.

907
01:05:30,063 --> 01:05:34,956
The Discman just came out,
cost a fortune.

908
01:05:36,294 --> 01:05:39,020
I wanted to get her one for her birthday.

909
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:43,283
So I took on extra tutoring jobs.

910
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:45,111
Till I got hoarse.

911
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,248
But...

912
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:51,881
She was walking,
listening to the Discman.

913
01:05:53,778 --> 01:05:55,376
When she crossed the street.

914
01:05:57,243 --> 01:05:59,180
A truck crashed into her.

915
01:06:02,106 --> 01:06:04,233
She lasted four days in the hospital.

916
01:06:06,779 --> 01:06:08,437
But in the end...

917
01:06:21,168 --> 01:06:25,602
It was here, at Hui's Fruits.

918
01:06:28,098 --> 01:06:30,624
She was crossing the road to come here.

919
01:06:30,994 --> 01:06:33,929
Listening to the Discman I gave her.

920
01:06:38,093 --> 01:06:39,990
So you should understand.

921
01:06:41,888 --> 01:06:43,485
I do!

922
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:48,049
I understand Hui's Fruits
was not here then!

923
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:51,743
I grew up here!

924
01:06:52,552 --> 01:06:54,379
I tell you my tale of woe.

925
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:56,476
While you defeat it with logic.

926
01:06:56,556 --> 01:06:57,575
How heartless of you.

927
01:06:57,655 --> 01:06:58,813
May I go now?

928
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:00,980
I wanted to take you to lunch.

929
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:04,245
How can you eat when you're so sad?

930
01:07:04,415 --> 01:07:06,002
Sad people eat, too.

931
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:10,336
Only if you apologize,
and say the tale was.

932
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:12,273
False, empty lies.

933
01:07:13,382 --> 01:07:17,006
Well, I was joking...

934
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:20,511
False, empty lies... say it!

935
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:25,204
You...

936
01:07:25,604 --> 01:07:26,902
Did you really grow up here?

937
01:07:26,972 --> 01:07:28,100
Of course not.

938
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:31,465
Causeway Bay is too loud for authors.

939
01:07:32,034 --> 01:07:35,230
You should work in Social Services,
deny pensions.

940
01:07:35,399 --> 01:07:37,666
Save the city
billions of dollars every year.

941
01:07:39,663 --> 01:07:41,221
Let's go eat.

942
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:04,317
You have snot on your nose.

943
01:08:05,286 --> 01:08:06,713
I do not!

944
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:10,618
Don't you get tired of joking?

945
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:12,275
Was I joking?

946
01:08:12,884 --> 01:08:15,580
This is to thank you for the book.

947
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:19,575
Which is an appetizer,
the note is the entree.

948
01:08:21,112 --> 01:08:22,810
I hope you understand.

949
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,805
My job is to upset people.

950
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:28,532
Upset others,
there are seven million of them.

951
01:08:39,905 --> 01:08:41,992
I finished your book.

952
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:44,858
Really?

953
01:08:45,537 --> 01:08:48,263
It'll give me
much to talk about this week.

954
01:08:49,601 --> 01:08:52,257
The listeners must be bored with this.

955
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:54,923
In the X-Files, some characters just die.

956
01:08:55,292 --> 01:08:56,590
You've been listening?

957
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,058
I didn't want...

958
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:11,688
I have to greet a friend.

959
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:17,280
Hello, it's you.

960
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:20,116
I'm meeting some buddies to talk.

961
01:09:20,386 --> 01:09:21,943
Look like I'm in the wrong place.

962
01:09:22,353 --> 01:09:23,980
I must go, enjoy.

963
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,109
Bye!

964
01:09:26,547 --> 01:09:28,673
The food is bad here, let's go.

965
01:09:31,579 --> 01:09:32,737
Goodbye!

966
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:40,107
Don't feel bad, maybe...

967
01:09:41,205 --> 01:09:44,700
You...

968
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:47,236
You asked me here for this?

969
01:09:47,306 --> 01:09:48,774
You think I have psychic power?

970
01:09:50,202 --> 01:09:53,537
You've gone too far this time!

971
01:10:02,234 --> 01:10:05,929
The curry is too spicy, get the bill.

972
01:10:09,464 --> 01:10:11,361
Open up!

973
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:15,485
I said sorry, please open up!

974
01:10:15,565 --> 01:10:18,251
Listen, open the door.

975
01:10:21,955 --> 01:10:24,981
You were with the DJ, and that was okay?

976
01:10:25,251 --> 01:10:27,847
Is that fair, man? No!

977
01:10:27,917 --> 01:10:28,885
Open up!

978
01:10:39,779 --> 01:10:42,306
Pick up the phone.

979
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:43,943
We're waiting for your column.

980
01:10:44,013 --> 01:10:47,877
The Boss is really mad, hurry.

981
01:11:50,346 --> 01:11:55,908
Boss is mad;
says don't bother! Sorry! Susan.

982
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:08,599
You?!

983
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:12,903
You want? Headache?

984
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:15,669
Are you sick, or did I scare you?

985
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:17,966
I've been calling you for an hour!

986
01:12:18,035 --> 01:12:19,363
I was afraid something happened.

987
01:12:19,433 --> 01:12:20,462
C.H. Yuen!

988
01:12:21,231 --> 01:12:22,629
You horrible man!

989
01:12:24,067 --> 01:12:27,462
You waited till I'm dying to come.

990
01:12:28,131 --> 01:12:31,616
I'II... I'll kill you.

991
01:12:32,195 --> 01:12:36,458
This is what I get
after all these years?

992
01:12:38,865 --> 01:12:40,353
But that's just like before.

993
01:12:45,755 --> 01:12:49,350
My mum said you called.

994
01:12:50,987 --> 01:12:54,352
I was just thinking of you then.

995
01:12:56,988 --> 01:13:01,282
I've missed you after all these years.

996
01:13:04,278 --> 01:13:06,045
I've finally found.

997
01:13:06,814 --> 01:13:10,798
I still love you the most.

998
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:16,869
Thank goodness I showed up in time.

999
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:19,066
You would have died in there.

1000
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,831
You'll have me to be with in Vancouver.

1001
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,435
You won't drink
a whole bottle of whiskey.

1002
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:28,992
Who's going to Vancouver with you?

1003
01:13:29,301 --> 01:13:33,355
You threw out my gift of love.

1004
01:13:33,435 --> 01:13:35,861
That wasn't my fault.

1005
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:38,627
We were moving to a new home.

1006
01:13:38,697 --> 01:13:42,791
Mum gave away all my records.

1007
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:44,419
She says no one uses them any more.

1008
01:13:46,326 --> 01:13:50,350
It's true, everyone has CDs now.

1009
01:13:51,129 --> 01:13:55,523
The record made us find each other.

1010
01:13:55,962 --> 01:13:57,220
So it's good thing.

1011
01:13:57,919 --> 01:13:59,287
I don't care.

1012
01:13:59,357 --> 01:14:01,684
You broke up with that guy.

1013
01:14:02,323 --> 01:14:04,410
And I with Irene.

1014
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:08,713
That's too much of a coincidence.

1015
01:14:13,586 --> 01:14:15,414
We're an old couple.

1016
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:18,908
We know each other well.

1017
01:14:19,518 --> 01:14:23,701
Isn't it like an old sofa.

1018
01:14:23,781 --> 01:14:25,838
Extra comfortable.

1019
01:14:28,404 --> 01:14:31,770
My house in West Van.

1020
01:14:32,508 --> 01:14:34,406
Is very quiet and comfortable.

1021
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:40,766
I'll turn the basement into your office.

1022
01:14:41,206 --> 01:14:46,688
Squirrels will knock on you window.

1023
01:14:48,265 --> 01:14:53,717
They have Chinese papers and magazines.

1024
01:15:23,414 --> 01:15:25,810
- Thanks, go ahead!
- You...

1025
01:15:26,779 --> 01:15:29,006
Remember to take this four times a day.

1026
01:15:29,086 --> 01:15:31,742
I'll go get plane tickets,
then help you pack.

1027
01:15:33,849 --> 01:15:34,967
Go on!

1028
01:15:37,314 --> 01:15:38,771
To Central, please.

1029
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:40,968
Remember your medicine!

1030
01:16:26,721 --> 01:16:28,978
I didn't know you knew Sabrina.

1031
01:16:29,058 --> 01:16:31,175
- I know her husband well.
- Really?

1032
01:16:31,255 --> 01:16:34,080
She always tells me to see your antiques.

1033
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:36,976
It's all just junk, not antiques.

1034
01:16:37,046 --> 01:16:40,172
I used to go to
the flea markets in Europe.

1035
01:16:40,251 --> 01:16:41,240
- Really?
- Yes.

1036
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:44,276
I often found things full of stories.

1037
01:16:44,345 --> 01:16:45,104
Really?

1038
01:16:45,174 --> 01:16:46,772
Yes. Let me show you something.

1039
01:16:46,842 --> 01:16:47,780
All right!

1040
01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:56,807
The Duchess of Windsor's husband's pen.

1041
01:16:56,877 --> 01:16:58,135
You mean the Duke of Windsor.

1042
01:16:58,475 --> 01:17:01,870
No, her former husband, Mr. Simpson.

1043
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,296
You mean O.J. 's cousin?

1044
01:17:06,972 --> 01:17:08,520
You're so funny!

1045
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:10,627
It's so nice to talk to you.

1046
01:17:10,697 --> 01:17:11,855
Really?

1047
01:17:11,935 --> 01:17:12,904
Let's have dinner together.

1048
01:17:12,964 --> 01:17:13,832
Sure!

1049
01:17:13,902 --> 01:17:15,230
What do you like to eat?

1050
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:16,688
Cutie pie!

1051
01:17:16,768 --> 01:17:18,455
I like to eat cutie pie.

1052
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:19,953
You are cute.

1053
01:17:22,729 --> 01:17:24,247
So, tomorrow night?

1054
01:17:24,327 --> 01:17:25,315
Sure!

1055
01:17:25,795 --> 01:17:27,482
- I'll pick you up.
- Sure!

1056
01:17:27,892 --> 01:17:29,549
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

1057
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:42,340
Sure!

1058
01:17:46,784 --> 01:17:47,713
Hello!

1059
01:17:47,783 --> 01:17:48,841
Hello!

1060
01:17:55,651 --> 01:17:56,869
How are you?

1061
01:17:58,547 --> 01:18:00,134
Long story!

1062
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:04,208
Sorry I couldn't help last time.

1063
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:08,502
So much has happened since then.

1064
01:18:08,942 --> 01:18:11,907
It's a long story.

1065
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:15,502
Do you take used books?

1066
01:18:15,572 --> 01:18:18,088
We don't sell books here.

1067
01:18:18,298 --> 01:18:20,854
Can't sell new books,
much less used ones.

1068
01:18:22,032 --> 01:18:23,121
True!

1069
01:18:23,201 --> 01:18:24,389
Do you have a lot of them?

1070
01:18:24,469 --> 01:18:26,696
Yes, I'm immigrating.

1071
01:18:26,765 --> 01:18:28,563
Can't take them all.

1072
01:18:29,232 --> 01:18:31,788
I know someone who buys used paper.

1073
01:18:31,858 --> 01:18:34,554
But it's by the pound,
he doesn't pay much.

1074
01:18:34,624 --> 01:18:38,458
For recycled paper? No thanks!

1075
01:18:38,528 --> 01:18:40,186
You can't give them away.

1076
01:18:46,986 --> 01:18:49,013
Well, let me think about it.

1077
01:18:49,193 --> 01:18:50,241
Thank you.

1078
01:18:53,257 --> 01:18:54,345
Good luck!

1079
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,388
It's me, Susan!

1080
01:19:40,468 --> 01:19:41,826
It's been a long time.

1081
01:19:41,895 --> 01:19:45,590
Boss says sorry,
please write for us again.

1082
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:47,647
So do him a favour.

1083
01:19:48,156 --> 01:19:51,521
Call me, bye.

1084
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:55,725
It's Susan again.

1085
01:19:55,795 --> 01:19:59,050
Boss says he'll run you piece tomorrow.

1086
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,956
Are you home? Call me, bye.

1087
01:20:03,684 --> 01:20:06,879
It's Susan; where are you?

1088
01:20:07,049 --> 01:20:08,816
You don't return calls,
turned off your pager.

1089
01:20:08,886 --> 01:20:13,339
It will be empty here,
where will you hide?

1090
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:18,612
Hi, it's Cheung Yung!

1091
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,677
I often talk in front of a microphone.

1092
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:24,773
This is my first time solo on the phone.

1093
01:20:25,342 --> 01:20:26,830
I'm actually nervous.

1094
01:20:29,506 --> 01:20:33,100
Somehow we've been fighting
since day one.

1095
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,828
Like we were enemies in out past lives.

1096
01:20:35,777 --> 01:20:37,963
I want to talk to you
about yesterday's lunch.

1097
01:20:38,742 --> 01:20:40,430
I really didn't know it would happen.

1098
01:20:40,699 --> 01:20:42,357
I'm a bad, nasty guy.

1099
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:44,733
But not as evil or powerful as that.

1100
01:20:44,963 --> 01:20:46,431
You may not believe this.

1101
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:50,994
Maybe I've become
a Godzilla in your mind.

1102
01:20:51,064 --> 01:20:54,589
I was trying to become your friend.

1103
01:20:55,128 --> 01:20:58,993
I've fought with you, read your essays.

1104
01:20:59,432 --> 01:21:01,519
I feel like I've known you a long time.

1105
01:21:02,058 --> 01:21:05,423
But we've never talked calmly.

1106
01:21:06,492 --> 01:21:08,079
I won't waste any more of your tape.

1107
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:13,092
When you have time,
I mean you really have time.

1108
01:21:13,152 --> 01:21:16,147
Call me at 9271-4193.

1109
01:21:16,217 --> 01:21:19,183
Also, I've subscribed to that paper.

1110
01:21:19,253 --> 01:21:21,739
I hope to see your column every day; bye.

1111
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,666
She was asking where Golden Mall was.

1112
01:21:37,746 --> 01:21:39,973
I mimed it out,
but she didn't understand.

1113
01:21:40,042 --> 01:21:42,099
I couldn't understand
her Italian English.

1114
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:44,336
So I brought her there.

1115
01:21:44,636 --> 01:21:46,263
And after buying pirate CDs?

1116
01:21:46,343 --> 01:21:49,638
We went to the Night Market, had a drink.

1117
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:50,637
And then?

1118
01:21:50,707 --> 01:21:51,965
And then...

1119
01:21:56,668 --> 01:21:58,465
Did she give you anything?

1120
01:21:58,535 --> 01:22:02,400
I don't even discuss that with men.

1121
01:22:02,569 --> 01:22:04,117
How can I tell you?

1122
01:22:04,197 --> 01:22:05,755
I told you everything.

1123
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:09,989
You stopped before you got to the bed.

1124
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,695
He didn't ask me to bed.

1125
01:22:13,593 --> 01:22:16,649
That's all the same anyway.

1126
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:18,886
No people do martial arts first.

1127
01:22:21,052 --> 01:22:23,449
A Caucasian girl, she must be tall.

1128
01:22:23,519 --> 01:22:25,955
Was she a head taller than you?

1129
01:22:26,155 --> 01:22:27,483
Just perfect!

1130
01:22:27,653 --> 01:22:29,710
Really... very tall.

1131
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:33,215
Right here, that must have been a great.

1132
01:22:33,854 --> 01:22:35,112
That time with you was great, too.

1133
01:22:35,282 --> 01:22:37,368
You looked so funny.

1134
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,575
And you didn't laugh?

1135
01:22:40,484 --> 01:22:42,171
Stop laughing.

1136
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,207
Mo Mo!

1137
01:22:45,846 --> 01:22:46,904
Oh, no!

1138
01:22:48,312 --> 01:22:49,141
What shall we do?

1139
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:50,969
Let's go home and look there.

1140
01:23:09,831 --> 01:23:11,389
It's dawn!

1141
01:23:11,628 --> 01:23:13,565
Don't worry, he knows his way.

1142
01:23:13,635 --> 01:23:15,992
He may not, after flirting with girls.

1143
01:23:16,801 --> 01:23:19,696
Mo Mo is better than that.

1144
01:23:21,294 --> 01:23:22,383
I thought you hated him?

1145
01:23:22,462 --> 01:23:24,829
He pees on your leg,
can't guard the house.

1146
01:23:24,889 --> 01:23:26,726
I've developed feelings for him.

1147
01:23:27,954 --> 01:23:30,081
What? Picking on me?

1148
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:31,709
What, taking it out on me?

1149
01:23:31,959 --> 01:23:35,014
It's your fault, you were talking.

1150
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:36,282
Or he wouldn't have run off!

1151
01:23:36,352 --> 01:23:39,288
If we lose him,
I'll never speak to you again.

1152
01:23:39,757 --> 01:23:41,085
That would be great.

1153
01:23:45,948 --> 01:23:49,004
Mo Mo, where have you been?

1154
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:52,309
You scared Mommy, you bad boy.

1155
01:23:52,379 --> 01:23:54,146
Must you do that?

1156
01:23:54,346 --> 01:23:56,333
Do you still want this bad boy?

1157
01:23:57,281 --> 01:23:58,370
Go away!

1158
01:23:58,809 --> 01:23:59,967
Don't elbow me!

1159
01:24:00,347 --> 01:24:02,674
Can you? When we're this close?

1160
01:24:02,743 --> 01:24:03,672
This close...

1161
01:24:03,742 --> 01:24:05,569
You're bad!

1162
01:24:23,403 --> 01:24:25,300
Remember Luna Ng?

1163
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,056
My guest last month, the columnist who.

1164
01:24:28,126 --> 01:24:30,653
Stormed out and lost all dignity?

1165
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:34,717
Unpredictably,
she's back at her own will.

1166
01:24:34,996 --> 01:24:36,254
Hello!

1167
01:24:36,324 --> 01:24:38,761
It's such a surprise you wanted to come.

1168
01:24:38,831 --> 01:24:42,056
I can't find
that woman-bashing guy for you.

1169
01:24:42,126 --> 01:24:44,812
Sorry, my schedule is erratic.

1170
01:24:44,892 --> 01:24:46,290
My Cycles have stopped.

1171
01:24:46,589 --> 01:24:48,147
I mean my column.

1172
01:24:48,656 --> 01:24:50,454
How did that happen?

1173
01:24:50,523 --> 01:24:53,150
Now I can't bear to attack you.

1174
01:24:53,948 --> 01:24:58,442
Go ahead, it's your last chance.

1175
01:25:00,419 --> 01:25:01,817
I'm getting married.

1176
01:25:02,785 --> 01:25:05,142
What? Really?

1177
01:25:06,151 --> 01:25:08,837
Yes, I'm going to get married.

1178
01:25:10,474 --> 01:25:11,742
Congratulations.

1179
01:25:12,381 --> 01:25:13,899
Thank you!

1180
01:25:14,638 --> 01:25:17,334
I wanted to come to thank you.

1181
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:21,368
May I say a few words?

1182
01:25:24,204 --> 01:25:27,469
Months ago, I was in a junk shop.

1183
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,625
I found a record
I had given my first love.

1184
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:34,769
The first gift I had ever given a man.

1185
01:25:35,138 --> 01:25:36,157
If I were you.

1186
01:25:36,237 --> 01:25:39,162
Something so important, in a junk shop.

1187
01:25:39,232 --> 01:25:40,590
What would you do?

1188
01:25:41,399 --> 01:25:44,025
Someone else got it before me.

1189
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:45,583
A DJ bought it.

1190
01:25:45,992 --> 01:25:48,089
But he wouldn't let me have it.

1191
01:25:48,259 --> 01:25:50,885
And said rude things on the air.

1192
01:25:51,225 --> 01:25:53,691
I still think it was for your own good.

1193
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:59,023
Yes, now I agree.

1194
01:25:59,952 --> 01:26:01,180
If not for you.

1195
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:04,775
I wouldn't have called my boyfriend.

1196
01:26:06,682 --> 01:26:08,310
And if not for that.

1197
01:26:08,389 --> 01:26:11,215
I would not have reunited
with my first love.

1198
01:26:12,613 --> 01:26:14,241
You're marrying him?

1199
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:15,938
Yes!

1200
01:26:16,917 --> 01:26:18,465
So I want to thank you!

1201
01:26:19,783 --> 01:26:23,507
You forgave him for selling your gift?

1202
01:26:26,173 --> 01:26:29,568
I accepted his explanation.

1203
01:26:32,344 --> 01:26:34,272
You're so easy-going?

1204
01:26:36,808 --> 01:26:40,033
Maybe, I believe in destiny.

1205
01:26:44,536 --> 01:26:48,331
Yes, women tend to believe that.

1206
01:26:52,495 --> 01:26:56,449
"All lovers reunions are beyond words"

1207
01:26:59,225 --> 01:27:02,161
I think you wrote that
in your column once.

1208
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:06,484
I think it was called "Old Loves"

1209
01:27:06,994 --> 01:27:09,460
About an umbrella, right?

1210
01:27:14,992 --> 01:27:17,478
No matter what, I congratulate you.

1211
01:27:17,918 --> 01:27:19,216
Luna.

1212
01:27:22,581 --> 01:27:26,275
If I can find "As time goes by".

1213
01:27:26,445 --> 01:27:29,471
I'll dedicate it to you.

1214
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:31,598
Let's go to commercials.

1215
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:34,833
Luna Ng.

1216
01:27:48,942 --> 01:27:51,698
I'm immigrating, flying tonight.

1217
01:27:53,505 --> 01:27:55,403
Keep it as a memento.

1218
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:02,195
C.H.

1219
01:29:02,275 --> 01:29:04,032
Yes sugar.

1220
01:29:05,001 --> 01:29:09,055
Or there's "honey",
"sweetheart", "darling".

1221
01:29:09,604 --> 01:29:12,330
Remember why we broke up?

1222
01:29:16,035 --> 01:29:17,822
No, I don't!

1223
01:29:17,892 --> 01:29:19,949
Was it because of a fight?

1224
01:29:23,723 --> 01:29:27,917
No, because we stopped fighting.

1225
01:29:29,056 --> 01:29:32,351
And quietly went to dinner, movies.

1226
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:38,082
Then quietly didn't call each other.

1227
01:29:38,921 --> 01:29:40,149
You like to fight?

1228
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:43,145
That's easy, when we get to Canada.

1229
01:29:43,514 --> 01:29:46,001
We'll fight about everything, okay?

1230
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:47,379
It's hard on you.

1231
01:29:47,449 --> 01:29:48,847
I don't mind.

1232
01:29:50,245 --> 01:29:52,232
- But...
- But what?

1233
01:29:53,979 --> 01:29:55,167
Nothing!

1234
01:30:22,637 --> 01:30:25,822
A new nemesis is immigrating tonight.

1235
01:30:26,661 --> 01:30:28,758
I wonder if she's on the plane yet?

1236
01:30:29,567 --> 01:30:32,583
In any case, I'm giving her.

1237
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:34,620
This song.

1238
01:30:39,293 --> 01:30:45,344
(I wish you bluebirds in the spring)

1239
01:30:45,424 --> 01:30:50,646
(To give you heart a song to sing)

1240
01:30:50,816 --> 01:30:55,769
(And then a kiss, but more than this)

1241
01:30:56,318 --> 01:30:58,784
(I wish you love)

1242
01:31:00,911 --> 01:31:06,743
(And in July, a lemonade)

1243
01:31:07,282 --> 01:31:12,674
(To cool you in some leafy glade)

1244
01:31:13,113 --> 01:31:17,906
(I wish you health, and more than wealth)

1245
01:31:18,445 --> 01:31:21,461
(I wish you love)

1246
01:31:23,608 --> 01:31:28,261
(My breaking heart and I agree)

1247
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:33,094
(That you and I could never be)

1248
01:31:33,533 --> 01:31:39,195
(So with my best, my very best)

1249
01:31:39,395 --> 01:31:43,329
(I set you free)

1250
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:50,449
(I wish you shelter from the storm)

1251
01:31:50,658 --> 01:31:56,110
(A cozy fire to keep you warm)

1252
01:31:56,420 --> 01:32:03,679
(But most of all, when snowflakes fall)

1253
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:09,511
(I wish you love)

1254
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:40,335
Why must you always do this to me?

1255
01:32:42,772 --> 01:32:44,060
Why?
