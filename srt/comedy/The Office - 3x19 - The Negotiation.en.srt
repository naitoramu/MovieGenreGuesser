1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,880
<i>So, do you wanna see it or not?</i>

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,760
I don't know. It'll be like, 
friday night crowd...

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,520
Oh my god. 
You're like agoraphobic.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,840
- Agoraphobic. 
- Yeah!

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,080
- Really? 
- Yeah!

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,360
You would rather sit on your couch 
and watch a Phillies game

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,440
than go out to a movie with 
your awesome girlfriend.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,400
Absolutely correct.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,320
Later, Jim.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,480
Kev, have a good weekend.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,640
Bye

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,200
Okay, So, It's what's gonna happen.
You'are gonna suck it up,

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,680
Here we go.

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,040
- And we're gonna go to dinner,
- Okay

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,720
- And then, we're gonna go to the movie. 
- Sounds good.

16
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,560
Hey, Halpert!

17
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,560
Hey.

18
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,280
Roy!

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,680
Pam. Please call security!

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,120
Every day, for eight years,

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,000
I have brought pepper spray 
into this office

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,800
to protect myself 
and my fellow employees.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
And every day, for eight years,

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,320
people have laughed at me.

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,720
Well. Who's laughing now?

3x19 "The Negotiation"
Original Air Date: Apr 5, 2007 (NBC)

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,120
No need for consternation.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Everything is under control.

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,840
<i>Michael, last Friday one of your employees 
attacked another employee in your office!</i>

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,800
It was a crime of passion, Jan.

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,600
Not a disgruntled employee.

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,000
Everyone here is extremely gruntled.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,240
<i>Is Toby there?</i>

37
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,640
- No.
- I'm here, Jan.

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,560
<i>What- What's the situation, Toby?</i>

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,760
We fired Roy, obviously.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,840
And Jim won't press charge 
against Roy or the company.

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,120
- Thank God!
- Yeah.

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,600
But, now apparently 
Darryl has some issues...

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,480
No, he has been wanting a raise 
for couple of months,

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,040
And he's just using 
this Roy thing as leverage.

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,920
<i>Are you going to take care of this?</i>

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,840
Yeppers.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,280
<i>What did I tell you about "Yeppers"?</i>

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,360
I don't remember.

49
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,680
<i>I told you not to say it. 
Do you remember that?</i>

50
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,720
Ye-sh.

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,440
<i>I really don't want to talk about it.</i>

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,520
I don't mean to be rude, but

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,400
I just, I don't want to 
comment on what happened.

54
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,480
It sucked.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,480
I guess, all things considered,

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,560
I was lucky Dwight was there.

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,800
And Roy was lucky that 
Dwight only used pepper spray.

58
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,720
<i>And not the nunchucks 
or the throwing stars.</i>

59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,880
Hey man, I never 
got a chance to thank you.

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,240
For stopping Roy.

61
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,640
Thank you.

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,560
"Thank you" not necessary, 
and thus not accepted.

63
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,120
I saw someone breaking the law 
and I interceded.

64
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,040
Okay.

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,320
I've got you something.

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Don't want it.

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,400
You don't wanna know what it is?

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,520
Don't want it. Won't open it. 
Don't need it. Won't take it.

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,440
Citizens do not accept prizes 
for being citizens.

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,880
It was a little glass display case 
for his bobblehead.

71
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,600
That would have made us even, I think.

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,000
He saves my life, 
I get him a box for his desk toy.

73
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,960
Even Steven.

74
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,040
No, don't call me a hero.

75
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,080
Do you know who the real heroes are?

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,800
The guys who wake up every morning 
and go into their normal jobs,

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,200
and get a distress call 
from the commissioner,

78
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,120
and take off their glasses 
and change into capes,

79
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,960
and fly around fighting crime.

80
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,920
Those are the real heroes.

81
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,320
Angela, Roy's check.

82
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
He's coming in later to pick it up.

83
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,280
Man, I cannot believe that 
I missed the fight.

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,360
It was crazy.

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,880
You saw it?

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,600
Describe it please.

87
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,880
Well, I heard some shouting,

88
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,720
and I looked over 
and Roy was by reception

89
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,200
And you could tell 
he's gonna punch somebody.

90
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,960
Jim says something, 
Roy stops over there,

91
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,920
All of a sudden, "Bam!"

92
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,960
And Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing 
there looking like an action hero.

93
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,040
Insane.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,880
Well ... good for Dwight.

95
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,360
Okay, I want you to be Darryl, 
and ask me for a raise,

96
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,600
Because I need to try out 
somebody's negotiation tactics on you.

97
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Where did you get that?

98
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,600
Wikipedia

99
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,920
Wikipedia is the best thing ever.

100
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,720
Anyone in the world can write anything 
they want about any subject.

101
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,240
So you know you are getting 
the best possible information.

102
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,840
Okay, Darryl. Ask me for a raise.

103
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,760
Hey, Mike. Since Roy left, 
I've been doing a lot of work and I need raise.

104
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,560
Hm, that's interesting Darryl.

105
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
I think...

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
Can't hear you.

107
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,840
What I'm saying is that...

108
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,600
Still nothing.

109
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,440
- Okay, see what I did?
- No.

110
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,440
By leaning back, 
and by whispering,

111
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,160
I established a 
dominant physical position.

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,440
- Nice. 
- Okay, let's try another one.

113
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,240
Walking out of the room unexpectedly.

114
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
And what happens in this one?

115
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,520
- That's surprise. 
- Okay.

116
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,200
Go ahead. Ask for a raise.

117
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,280
Can I have a raise?

118
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,400
Sex. Steve Martin. Teri Hatcher.

119
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,640
- What? 
- What?

120
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,080
No, what did you say?

121
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
I didn't say anything.

122
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,400
I was waiting to see what happened.

123
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,240
It's interesting.

124
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,760
It's all the perpetrators' advance
toward the victim at high-rated speed

125
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,320
His head was thrown back, 
his shoulders were on arm cocked,

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,280
Getting in attack position, 
perp grabbed the victim

127
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,480
I removed my weapons 
from its secure hiding place.

128
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,560
Oh, which is where?

129
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,520
Irrelevant.

130
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,400
Discharged at a distance of 
little over a meter

131
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,840
And to the perpetrator's eyes, 
nose, and face area,

132
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,400
rendering him utterly 
and completely disabled.

133
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Then I contacted the authorities.

134
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,600
The end.

135
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,560
Thanks, Dwight.

136
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
That is the bravest thing 
I have ever heard.

137
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,800
I can't imagine 
what I would've done.

138
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,040
I can.

139
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,080
You would have left me to 
fend for myself.

140
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,640
Like the time 
we were on the ferris wheel

141
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,520
and that kid dropped a milkshake 
on me and you just laughed.

142
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,920
Well that was funny, that's why.

143
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,760
Oh it was?

144
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,600
Okay, well the next time 
that you get scared

145
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,560
that you think a murderer is in 
your apartment in the middle of the night ...

146
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:56,880
Okay

147
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,480
<i>- and you call me to calm down. 
- You know what, I didn't...</i>

148
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,400
<i>- Can you stop? 
- You can just call somebody else</i>

149
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,240
<i>because I'm not doing it 
anymore, Ryan, I'm not.</i>

150
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,040
<i>- Well don't talk to me about calling people...
- There's a bunch of people back here maybe ...</i>

151
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,440
<i>I call you in the middle of the night</i>

152
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,840
<i>- to tell you tell that I love you.
- Guys ...</i>

153
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,960
<i>I don't think Michael intended to punish me 
by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.</i>

154
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,280
But, if he did intend that ... wow.

155
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,320
Genius.

156
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,640
- Yeah. 
- You ready for me?

157
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,480
Yes, yeah. Absolutely. Have a sit.

158
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,240
You know what? Actually,
let's go into the conference room.

159
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
- Okay. 
- Nah! You know, let's stay here.

160
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,360
Let's go.

161
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,120
Yeah, let's go over.

162
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,320
Tactic number six.

163
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,000
Change the location of the meeting 
at the last second.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,240
Totally throws 'em off.

165
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,560
Number 14.

166
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,520
Declining to speak first.

167
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,440
Makes them feel uncomfortable, 
puts you in control.

168
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,520
I am declining to speak first.

169
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,200
Okay, I'll start.

170
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,600
It's pretty simple, 
I- um think I deserve a raise

171
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,680
I'm on schedule to get one of six months, 
but I like that to be moved up to now.

172
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,160
Darryl, you are good worker 
and good man.

173
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,640
I just- you know-

174
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,960
Times are tight

175
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,840
I just don't think corporate 
are going for this right now.

176
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,480
Are you wearing lady clothes?

177
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,440
What?

178
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,560
Are you wearing lady clothes? 
Those look like lady pants.

179
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,640
No. This is a power suit.

180
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,320
That there's a woman's suit.

181
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,040
I do not buy women's clothes.

182
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,520
Would not make that mistake again.

183
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
I'm gonna call Roy, man.

184
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,400
- O-kay. 
- This's gonna make him feel better anyway.

185
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,680
- This is stupid. 
- You know what?

186
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,600
Pam, would you please tell Darryl 
that this is not a woman's suit.

187
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,120
Oh my God! 
That's a woman's suit!

188
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,360
You're wearing a woman's suit?

189
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,720
No, I do- I wear man's suit, okay?

190
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,040
I've got this out of bins

191
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,480
There were these huge bins of clothes.

192
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,920
And everybody was rifling 
through them, like crazy.

193
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,000
And I grabbed one.

194
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,200
And it fit.

195
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,040
So I don't think that this is 
totally just a woman's suit.

196
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,960
At the very least, it's bisexual.

197
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,560
Who makes it?

198
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
Um, MISSterious.

199
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,320
And it is mysterious, because 
the buttons are on the wrong side.

200
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,200
That's the mystery.

201
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
He's got shoulder pads,

202
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,320
And do you see that lines?

203
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,600
Okay, would you stop it, please?

204
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,240
Oh, know that tip you off

205
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,720
It's European, ok.

206
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,760
It's European cut.

207
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,920
Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.

208
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,600
No, they don't, see?

209
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,200
Italians don't wear pockets.

210
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,400
It's been a really rough couple of days.

211
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
This helps a little.

212
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,960
Hey, you maybe wanna come over 
and rave my closet.

213
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,880
No, I don't wanna do that, 
because I'm twice your size anyway.

214
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,560
Yeah, he looks like Hillary Clinton.

215
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
Let's just do this in 15 minutes, okay?

216
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
Can you stand right there 
for one second?

217
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
I gotta send some emails.

218
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,840
Negotiation is all about 
controlling things.

219
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,880
About being in a driver seat.

220
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,440
And, make one tiny 
mistake, you're dead.

221
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,360
I made one tiny mistake.

222
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,200
I wore women's clothes.

223
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,480
So Karen,

224
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,120
how do you feel that Roy tried to kick 
your boyfriend's ass over another woman?

225
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,240
I feel great, Kevin. Thank you.

226
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,200
You must been scared out of your mind.

227
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,200
Well, you know, it happened so fast, 
I didn't really have time to be scared.

228
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,320
What happened? Exactly?

229
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,520
I wasn't here. So, I haven't 
really heard the whole story.

230
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,440
Um, well, Jim and I were talking.

231
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,680
And, Roy walked in, 
looking super angry.

232
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,840
And, he's big dude, you know?

233
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,200
And, all of a sudden, 
Jim pushed me out of the way,

234
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
And, Roy cocked his fist,

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,760
And then, Bam! Dwight sprays 
and knocks them on his butt.

236
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,440
Goodness.

237
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,800
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed,

238
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,480
my reaction was to have lots of long talks 
with Jim about our feelings.

239
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,800
Roy just attacked him.

240
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,280
I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.

241
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,440
Let's get down to business.

242
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,600
Why don't you tell me 
why you think you deserve a raise?

243
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,720
Well, it's simple, Mike.

244
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,040
I mean, we merged two branches, right?

245
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,840
Now, we're shipping twice 
as many orders as we used to

246
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,080
With Roy going, 
we got a smaller crew.

247
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,920
And I'm picking up all of his slack

248
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,360
So I think I should be compensated 
fairly by getting a raise.

249
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
What? I can't hear you.

250
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,240
I can't Mike, are you...

251
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,520
You make very compelling argument.

252
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,320
Sorry I almost got you killed.

253
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,400
Yeah. That was nuts.

254
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,400
He could have broken 
your nose or something. Crazy.

255
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,440
It's just so stupid.

256
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,760
I mean, getting back 
with Roy and everything.

257
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
I mean, what was I thinking, right?

258
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,120
No, I mean you guys really 
seem to have a strong connection.

259
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,240
Not anymore.

260
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,520
It's um, it's completely over now.

261
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,560
We'll see.

262
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,120
I'm sure you guys'll find your way 
back to one another someday.

263
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,720
Jim ... I am really sorry.

264
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,520
Oh yeah, don't worry about it.

265
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,960
I'm going to give you a peace of paper.

266
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,760
I want you to write down 
how much you want,

267
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,440
And I want you to slide it back 
across the desk to me.

268
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,040
Why can't I just tell you?

269
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,320
Because, that is the way 
these things are done.

270
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,920
In films

271
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,760
Slide, slide

272
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,560
Oh, God!

273
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,600
Come on, be serious.

274
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,400
I'm serious, Michael. It's a 10% raise. 
That's what I want.

275
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,320
I can't give you that.
I don't make this much.

276
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,960
Come on. Be for real, Mike.

277
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
I don't. I'll prove it to you.

278
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,680
Here is- pay stub

279
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,840
Are you serious you're earning this?

280
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,560
Plus perks, yes.

281
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,200
Michael, this is barley more than I make.

282
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,120
You've been here 10 years, dawg!

283
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,920
14 years.

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,960
No, please, please.

285
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,400
I'm sorry. Some old folks got to hear about this.

286
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,560
Okay, let's take 15 again.

287
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,280
A boss' salary isn't just about money.

288
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,720
It is about perks.

289
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,960
It is- for example,

290
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,560
every year, I get a $100 gas card.

291
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,640
Can't put a price tag on that!

292
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,960
Okay, if you don't want a gift, 
at least let me buy you a beer.

293
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,160
Or lunch, at least.

294
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,400
When Han Solo returns to the Death Star 
in the Millennium Falcon,

295
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,160
and shoots down the TIE fighters 
and saves the rebel cause,

296
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,400
do you think he does so for a free beer?

297
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,480
- Boy, I-  
- No

298
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,240
Why you're so interested in buying me 
something, Jim, what's your angle?

299
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,320
It's like when he annoys me,

300
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
and I want to screw with him 
to get him back.

301
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,480
He never sees it's coming.

302
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,560
But now, I want to be nice to him, 
and actually give him something,

303
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
and he's like an eel.

304
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,240
I just can't grab onto him. 
It's infuriating.

305
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,280
Maybe you just feel 
guilty about all the pranks.

306
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,960
Well ... yes, that's probably what it is.

307
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,120
So what do I do?

308
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,720
I don't know.

309
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,840
Maybe you should go back out there 
and sell paper so we can go on a trip.

310
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,640
Michael, here is $15 I owe you.

311
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,320
- Ah, thank you.
- Yeah

312
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,400
I heard you might need it, so...

313
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,840
Here's the $40 you gave me.

314
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,240
I didn't give you $40.

315
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,840
In a way you did.

316
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.

317
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,840
I still think he's way overpaid.

318
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,600
14 years. 14

319
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,640
I know.

320
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,480
Okay, alright. I gotta go, later.

321
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,920
Okay, here's the straight dope.

322
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,640
No tricks, no Wikipedia.

323
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,880
I talked to corporate and they told me 
that I can only give you a 5% raise.

324
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,160
That's because of you, Mike?

325
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,200
They're not gonna give 
the working man more than a boss?

326
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,480
What am I supposed do?

327
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,360
Get your own raise!

328
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,920
You gotta get out there and earn, son.

329
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,720
I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.

330
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,840
That is ridiculous.

331
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,560
Well, when they merged 
two branches together,

332
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
they put YOU in charge,

333
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,080
Okay? We're shipping 
more now We ever have.

334
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,480
- That's true. 
- Yeah, that's true.

335
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,960
You gotta call your girl

336
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,160
and get paid.

337
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,880
Show who wears the pants in the relationship.

338
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,640
- You know what? I should. 
- Yeah, you should!

339
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,760
I've been a loyal employee 
for a long time.

340
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,160
14 years long.

341
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
You know what? I deserve a bump.

342
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,480
Make it happen, Captain!

343
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,560
I'm making it happen. Sergeant.

344
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,760
I remember it was very 
late night, like 11 or 11:30.

345
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,080
Big fella comes in 
screaming about God-knows-what.

346
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,440
I think maybe Halpert 
had stolen his car

347
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,880
Something like that.

348
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,400
So the big fella pulls out 
a sock filled with nickels.

349
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,680
Then Schrute grabs 
a can of hairspray and a lighter.

350
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,960
You're useless.

351
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,160
<i>Why don't we talk next month? 
After the quarter in.</i>

352
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
No, Jan.

353
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,000
I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.

354
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,920
This is long overdue.

355
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,560
I wanna do it today.

356
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,400
<i>Today? Alright, well.</i>

357
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,840
<i>You wanna do it today, 
uh- we should do it in person.</i>

358
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,760
<i>And can you get here by 5?</i>

359
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,320
Yeah- um, yeah.

360
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,400
I'll leave right away.

361
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,440
<i>Wait, and listen.</i>

362
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,680
<i>Because of our- you know- situation, 
we're gonna have a third party present.</i>

363
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,360
Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.

364
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,880
<i>Darr- Darryl from the warehouse?</i>

365
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,440
<i>No, Michael, we need an HR rep.</i>

366
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,680
<i>So, you should just bring Toby.</i>

367
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,760
Hey, I rather kill myself.

368
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,400
<i>- Michael, he is your rep in HR
- No.</i>

369
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,480
<i>- And, we need him in the room
- Toby is terrible.</i>

370
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,200
<i>- because of our relationship. you know that.
- Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.</i>

371
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,720
Either Toby comes with you, 
or we don't do it.

372
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,600
Fine.

373
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,880
You are so mean.

374
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

375
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,880
Yes you do, 
Ryan Bailey Howard.

376
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,840
You called me stupid.

377
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,560
<i>- No, I said your idea was stupid.
- Toby, come on, let's go.</i>

378
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,800
- Where? 
- Where?

379
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,360
I'm gonna smack you 
in the head with a hammer.

380
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,240
Come on, let's go.

381
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
<i>What is so stupid about 
wanting to name a baby Usher?</i>

382
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,920
All right.

383
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,520
<i>Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.</i>

384
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,240
<i>Don't you see why that's insane?</i>

385
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,680
<i>Oh, so I'm crazy now?</i>

386
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
- Comfortable, Mike? 
- Yeah.

387
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,160
- How about you?
- No.

388
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,760
Don't ever touch a black man's radio!

389
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,200
Chris Tucker. Rush Hour

390
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,880
I won't touch yours, by the way.

391
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,560
Thank you.

392
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,680
Haven't been in New York in a long time.

393
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,560
Big apple.

394
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,960
Maybe I'll stay over night.

395
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,360
I got cousins down there.

396
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,280
How do we get home?

397
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,360
Ah, you could stay, too. 
He's got a big place.

398
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,800
Maybe I'll stay.

399
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,240
It's not that big.

400
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,000
Buses are gonna get you come quick.

401
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,480
And then, all of a sudden, 
Dwight stood up, he was like

402
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,760
Then what did he do?

403
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,320
You should just read the report that Toby did.
He took off everyone's stories.

404
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,560
<i>Dunder Mifflin Customer Service, this is Kelly.</i>

405
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,960
<i>Oh yeah, I can totally help you with that.</i>

406
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,880
<i>Okay, let me just get the folder out.</i>

407
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,920
<i>Okay, it seems here that 
you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.</i>

408
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,640
<i>Oh, twelve reams...</i>

409
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,880
Hey, guys. Jan is ready for you.

410
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,040
Okay, bring it home now.

411
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,000
And don't forget the new 
black man phrase I taught you.

412
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
Pippity poppity, 
give me the zoppity.

413
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Yes sir! Remember that!

414
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,560
- I'll be right outside if you need me.
- Alright!

415
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,520
<i>Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.</i>

416
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,320
I want him to get the raise.

417
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,760
I ... just can't help myself.

418
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Hey, man. I'm sorry.

419
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,240
Thanks.

420
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,800
Can I like-

421
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,840
see you after work for coffee or something?

422
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,160
I don't know.

423
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,320
Please.

424
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,280
I just got some stuff 
I gotta say to you.

425
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,480
Jim!

426
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,200
Roy. Look out!

427
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,840
Thanks Kev! I'm good, though.

428
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,800
Thank you, Andrew.

429
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,200
Hello, come in.

430
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,200
Who's the boy toy?

431
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,320
That's my new assistant.

432
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,960
Were you going to tell me that 
you hired James Van Der Beek?

433
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,640
I have to call you at the second 
I got a new assistant, now?

434
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,360
It'd be nice to get a memo. 
We are lovers.

435
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,760
Hi, Jan.

436
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,920
Hi, Toby.

437
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,080
First...

438
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,640
First off, Michael, 
this is salary negotiation.

439
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,320
All matters regarding our personal relationship 
have to be set aside. Are we clear.

440
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,800
Pippity poppity

441
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,600
Right now, we can offer you a 6% raise.

442
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,400
6%? After all we've been through?

443
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,520
- My God. 
- I've got

444
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,840
- You jade earrings.
- Michael.

445
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,720
No! No! No! 
You're gonna play like this?

446
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,280
You give me a good raise,

447
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,200
or no more sex.

448
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,640
What are you writing, perv-ball?

449
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,320
Just preparing for the deposition.

450
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
This may be the first time 
that a male subordinate

451
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,200
has attempted to get 
a modest, scheduled raise

452
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,040
by threatening to withhold sex 
from a female superior.

453
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,880
It will be a groundbreaking case,

454
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,960
when it inevitably goes to trial.

455
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,840
I'm so sorry, Pammy.

456
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,760
I wasn't gonna 
do anything, but then...

457
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,240
I've kept thinking about 
you two together...

458
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,040
I just thought you guys were 
really good friends, or

459
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,920
maybe he was gay or something.

460
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,800
Not that that's wrong.

461
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm sorry, too.

462
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,520
I just- I think that 
we both made some bad choices.

463
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,680
So, you gonna start
dating Halpert, then?

464
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,480
No.

465
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,800
No. He has a girlfriend.

466
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
Oh, yeah.

467
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,920
Hey babe, you broke up 
our wedding for the guy.

468
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,280
No, there were a lot of reasons.

469
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,480
You mean you're not even gonna 
try to go out with him?

470
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,680
I don't get you, Pam.

471
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,840
I know.

472
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,840
What's this?

473
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,080
- What's what?
- Certificate of bravery.

474
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
From the Scranton police department.

475
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,320
Recognizing outstanding citizenship
from a very brave young man,

476
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,600
Dwight K. Schrute...

477
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,800
Wow, nice words around.
that's how a nice honor.

478
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,960
Please, they hand it out to little kids.

479
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,440
Look, there's a teddy bear 
in a policeman's cap.

480
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,560
I didn't think you'd notice...

481
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,200
Why don't you just take that pen 
and stab me in the heart?

482
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
This is me, Jan. This is ME!

483
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,080
Okay, Michael, please.

484
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,680
You know, why don't we just take a break?

485
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,000
Okay, no, no, no, no.

486
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
You do not try tactic number 8 on me.

487
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,040
I invented the tactic number 8.

488
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,960
I'm not going anywhere.

489
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,200
Okay, Toby. 
How about if you... Great.

490
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,600
What's wrong with you?

491
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,000
It was a weird day.

492
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,280
I accidentally cross-dressed.

493
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,600
And then, Darryl made me feel bad 
for not making any money.

494
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,080
And then, I drive up here 
with stupid Toby.

495
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,520
And then, your assistant is 
all young and hot, and I-

496
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,040
Okay, Michael.

497
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,360
I can offer you a 12% raise, but

498
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,320
You have got to ask for 15.

499
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,760
That's ridiculous. 
I'm never ganna make that money...

500
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,600
Nope. Just...

501
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,720
I just need you to ask for it.

502
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,720
So I can record that 
you asked for it, okay?

503
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,040
Ah- So...

504
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,320
All right, Levinson. Here's the rub.

505
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,160
I would like a 15% raise.

506
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,480
No! We can offer you 12%!

507
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,960
But you just said 15

508
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,120
<i>Negotiation is an art.</i>

509
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,360
<i>Back and forth, give and take.</i>

510
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,080
<i>And today, both Darryl and I took something.</i>

511
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,200
<i>Higher salaries.</i>

512
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,680
<i>Win-win-win.</i>

513
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,400
But, you know, life is about 
more than just salary.

514
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,960
It's about perks.

515
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,120
Like having sex with Jan.

516
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,000
Michael!

517
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,440
So you wanna buy it for 
your new house, perhaps?

518
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,640
Yeah, bedrooms.

519
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,640
- How many bedrooms...
- Four

520
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,640
Dwight!

521
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,600
I've been doing some 
very interesting reading.

522
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,640
Really?

523
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,640
Tales of bravery.

524
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,160
Good stuff.

525
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,920
You know, I was thinking, 
tonight we could read it together.

526
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,600
That sounds...

527
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,200
Fun.

528
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
I will never say a word.

529
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,520
And now, we are even.

530
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,560
I graduated from anger management
the same way I graduated from Cornell

531
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,520
on time.

532
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,840
Now I'm back,

533
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,800
got a second chance, 
and I'm not going to blow it.

534
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,920
So look out, Dunder Mifflin!

535
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,160
I mean "look out" in a fun way.

536
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,200
You know, not like, "I'm going to hurt you."

537
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,640
Hey guys! Guess who's back!

538
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,080
No need to thank me.

539
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,120
I am not a hero.

540
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,520
I am a mere defender of the office.

541
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,680
You know who's a real hero?

542
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,600
Hiro, from Heroes.

543
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,240
That's a hero.

544
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,400
Also, Bono.

545
