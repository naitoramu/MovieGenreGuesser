1
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:37,571
<i>That exhilarating morning, 
I could hear the birds in the city...</i>

2
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,682
<i>...from my privileged, 
impregnable position.</i>

3
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:48,294
<i>I thought of the luck, the courage and...</i>

4
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:52,598
<i>...the stroke of genius 
that had brought me here...</i>

5
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:56,814
<i>...where my active imagination alone
could never have brought me.</i>

6
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:12,919
<i>Six weeks earlier, I was an ordinary man
only focused on my family...</i>

7
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,237
<i>...with no interest in other women.</i>

8
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:14,828
- Sixth floor.
- Me too.

9
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,809
- Well... it's that way.
- Do you think?

10
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,437
Excuse me.

11
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:05,938
Come pick me up.
I'll leave the car here.

12
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:10,432
Yes... me too.

13
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:14,989
<i>You love me, right?</i>

14
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:19,964
Undeniably... yes.
I really don't have time, Marthe.

15
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:30,916
Are you going to give that to
the minister every morning?

16
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:34,040
Is something wrong with you?

17
00:03:34,238 --> 00:03:36,845
The minister asked for it again.
He lost it.

18
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:40,307
Excuse me.
It's alright, dear.

19
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,736
- Are you afraid of me?
- No.

20
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:45,463
Shit.

21
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,593
Hello.

22
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:46,712
Hello.

23
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:50,679
Let's have dinner.

24
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,558
What?

25
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:59,937
Tonight at the Récamier.

26
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:03,762
I recognize your voice.

27
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,588
Nine o'clock?

28
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,975
Why?

29
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,320
Just because.

30
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:16,577
I can't at nine.

31
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,451
Ten past nine?

32
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:44,964
Why do you speak English?

33
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:51,672
I was told you... were
a British citizen.

34
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:53,547
No.

35
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:57,897
Let me check.
I'd be surprised, because...

36
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,606
Wait... what time is it?

37
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:03,936
Where am I going?

38
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:38,661
Why do you look at other cars
like this?

39
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:40,712
To see them.

40
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,733
I see.

41
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:47,357
Why are you looking at me?
How do I look?

42
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:49,672
Seductive.

43
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:53,161
No, I'll just be working hard.

44
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:57,866
These hurt.
Here, I don't have a handbag.

45
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:04,674
At 41 years old, she'll be working hard
at uni. When are your exams?

46
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:07,744
You're terrible... in 23 days.

47
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:11,180
- Is it all under control?
- Yes.

48
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:35,678
Do you have a newspaper here?
I wouldn't mind seeing a movie.

49
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:39,047
- It's all been arranged.
- What?

50
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:44,348
You'll be going at 8 o'clock,
with the girls. I promised them.

51
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:48,257
- That's alright, isn't it?
- Great.

52
00:07:58,114 --> 00:08:01,815
Don't lose my earrings!

53
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:13,909
Good service. 30 - 30.

54
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:25,580
Out.
- Yes, just.

55
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:29,398
Shut up,
you're distracting me.

56
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:34,081
- Ready?
- Ready!

57
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,741
An Elephant Can Be Extremely
Deceptive

58
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:50,088
I was wrong - footed. He doesn't
shut up. It's getting on my...

59
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:55,101
What, I'm not saying anything.

60
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,694
- How are you?
- And you?

61
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:02,639
I'll tell you later.

62
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,217
Guys.
My ball, please, madam.

63
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,794
She missed.

64
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:16,381
Damn!
Did you see those legs?

65
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:23,505
Do you like buns, guys?

66
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,714
Stop it. It's embarrassing
when you act like that.

67
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:30,687
Do you live in the area?
I think I've seen you both before.

68
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:34,382
If he comes to the net, play in his
feet. Don't try a lob.

69
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:35,664
Why?

70
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:37,892
Not today.
Your lobs are too short.

71
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:41,440
- Are those Peugeot rackets?
- No, Montanas.

72
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:46,456
They're terrible.
I think I pulled a muscle.

73
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,765
Go, Simon!

74
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,774
And no foot fault!

75
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,946
Are you messing with me?

76
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,159
Yes, an ace!

77
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:05,669
15-0. Bravo, Mr Bouly.

78
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:17,068
Great passing!

79
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,549
Well done, Mr Bouly.
I don't need to do anything.

80
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:24,700
Do you have a smoke, Simon?

81
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:28,173
Ok, 30-30.
Here we go.

82
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:34,330
Hurry, hurry!

83
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:40,908
Don't mind him, Miss.
They have no manners.

84
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:44,609
You play very well.
Are you ranked?

85
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,319
- What were you trying to do?
- A lob with topspin.

86
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:51,981
Funny, you can't do topspin.
I asked you not to play any lobs.

87
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,427
What do you want from me?
And my shoulder hurts.

88
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:57,020
Let's play mixed doubles.

89
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:58,847
We're losing.

90
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:01,455
- What's the score?
- 40-0 and match point.

91
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:09,186
Yes!

92
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:12,112
- Sorry, guys.
- You're just not in good shape.

93
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:14,408
We'll see on Sunday.

94
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:20,295
I didn't know she had a sister,
but yesterday she introduced Carmen.

95
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,432
Are they Spanish?

96
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:29,280
I don't know.
I didn't ask for her papers.

97
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:33,603
No, because the tall one's called
Esther.

98
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,293
Well then... Esther's not...

99
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,150
It's not really Iberian.

100
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:40,028
Hey... pretty?

101
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,004
I'd give the tall one 12. I'll tell you
tomorrow about the other one.

102
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:44,765
I'm going out with her tonight.

103
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:48,084
Simon!

104
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,502
I bet he forgot his towel.

105
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:54,056
Your turn.
You can have my shower!

106
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:57,635
Simon!

107
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,643
I can't.
I don't have a towel.

108
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,302
Phone call for Boulifet!

109
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:14,472
Bouly!
A phone call for you.

110
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:18,049
Can't you go for me.
Because I... you know.

111
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,432
If it's the Seita, I'll call them back.
We have problems with maize paper.

112
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:25,602
- Bad?
- A director died.

113
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:30,206
- Did he smoke maize cigarettes?
- No, but the family's suing us.

114
00:12:30,873 --> 00:12:32,863
- And Marie-Ange?
- What about Marie- Ange?

115
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:38,266
Does she never notice...
all that stuff... Carmen for instance?

116
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,307
- Or that pharmacist...
- Snow- white!

117
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:44,336
- No!
- Jocelyne!

118
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,392
Marie- Ange has the kids,
the TV, the house. She's 38...

119
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:53,737
I don't like clichés, but she's
a happy woman.

120
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:57,419
- And how about her?
- What?

121
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,141
Is she perfect?

122
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:08,592
Wait a moment...

123
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,505
He's stupid!

124
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:14,907
Marie- Ange...

125
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:18,828
- Are you having lunch here, doctor?
- No!

126
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:20,699
Bouly...

127
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:02,535
It can't be.

128
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,623
This can't be.

129
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,937
Didn't she say anything on
the phone?

130
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:20,645
Mrs Philippot? She came to do
the ironing.

131
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:24,337
She saw them all on the staircase,
Marie- Ange, the children and...

132
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,925
...the furniture.

133
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:30,068
- Why did you carry your bag upstairs?
- So they won't steal it.

134
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:32,822
I don't believe it.

135
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:43,599
This is crazy, guys.
She took everything.

136
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:48,510
Yes, even the wallpaper.

137
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:51,282
The two shepherdesses with
the flutes.

138
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:55,240
Did you have a prenuptial
agreement?

139
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,353
That determines if she has the right
to take everything.

140
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,322
Can I make a phone call?

141
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:09,770
There's a letter there.

142
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,974
What... where?

143
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:18,588
- Isn't that a letter?
- It's a letter.

144
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,598
Mouchy, I wanted to call you from
the tennis club, but I couldn't.

145
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:32,426
No, no.

146
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:36,626
How did he say that?

147
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:39,167
That's quite something.

148
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:43,402
I wouldn't have expected that
from Charles.

149
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:46,143
No, I can't talk to him now.

150
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:51,037
Why do you say I'll be rid of you
when you're in hospital?

151
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:54,176
Doesn't she say where they've gone?

152
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:58,433
No, you're fine.
It's psychosomatic.

153
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:01,342
Doesn't she say why?

154
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:05,383
Yes... she...

155
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:09,136
...she found a photo.

156
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,872
Of me and a woman.

157
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:15,648
Naked?

158
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:19,356
No, in a booth.

159
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,403
My kids.

160
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:33,792
What did he say?

161
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:35,927
My kids...

162
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:38,130
But you said you hated them.

163
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:43,660
He was tired.
He loves his children.

164
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:45,715
This can't be happening, guys.

165
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,354
This isn't happening! Shit!

166
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:08,235
And I also cut myself,
like an idiot.

167
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:22,512
The kids might be at school.

168
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:25,067
No, it's Whitsun holiday.

169
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:31,283
- Marie- Ange...
- She'll come back.

170
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:34,723
No, I don't think so.
They never come back.

171
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:39,923
They leave in the morning and by noon
they don't recognize you anymore.

172
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:44,787
You have to admit Bouly has been
going too far for years.

173
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:51,126
If a guy has a very nice dinner
with another woman...

174
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:56,436
Does anything happen afterwards?
I don't know.

175
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:59,997
But his wife won't leave the next day
with the kids and the furniture.

176
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:03,134
Yes, she will. They're capable
of anything!

177
00:18:11,805 --> 00:18:13,781
- What about Mrs Lubéron...
- Same thing.

178
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:16,058
Who's Mrs Lubéron?

179
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,238
You were in Iran.

180
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:21,412
The professor's wife.
Your boss, right?

181
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:23,832
I can only go there at night.

182
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:26,842
And only during emergencies.

183
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:33,654
It depends on the severity.
I won't go for an appendicitis.

184
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:38,920
But she will call me for a peritonitis.

185
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:44,701
Because to drive there and back
is 25 minutes by car.

186
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:51,690
The time it takes him to wash his
hands and put on his gloves...

187
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:56,963
"Darling, he's taking off two legs."
"I'm on my way!"

188
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:16,119
Tell me...
Are you home this afternoon?

189
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:19,569
- Yes, I'm seeing patients until 6.
- Can I drop by?

190
00:19:20,204 --> 00:19:22,997
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, I need a favour.

191
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:25,509
But it's personal.

192
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:30,428
Hurry. I have to return the car
by 3 o'clock.

193
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,382
- Is the owner of the Rolls here?
- No, not yet.

194
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:55,656
I'll wait here and...

195
00:20:15,956 --> 00:20:20,501
That afternoon I submerged myself
in my work like a man taken...

196
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:22,351
by surprise by a twist of fate.

197
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:28,346
For the first time ever, I was prepared
to cheat on Marthe.

198
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:31,322
And I hated that thought.

199
00:20:32,202 --> 00:20:38,452
The looks of my colleagues, unaware of
the drama that was about to unfold...

200
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:43,341
hurt me as if they were already
blaming me for what was about to happen.

201
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:46,895
I respected the morals of our
society...

202
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,598
but I have to admit that the young
woman in red occupied my thoughts.

203
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:55,486
Hello... hello?

204
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:20,294
That's enough, Lucien.
I'm fed up, do you understand?

205
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:24,146
- Why don't you reply to my letters?
- Which letters? I didn't get any.

206
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:27,978
I've sent 14 letters and they all
didn't arrive, unheard- of.

207
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:31,774
I love your breasts.
I can't live without them.

208
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:33,064
My breasts?

209
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,753
When I came to see Delphine,
I saw them through the open door.

210
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:39,175
- Which door?
- Of your room.

211
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:41,450
I love your breasts.
Especially the left one.

212
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:43,788
I'm going to talk to your parents.

213
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:47,496
I told them.
That I'm going to marry a married woman.

214
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,796
Totally sick!

215
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:54,347
What did they say?

216
00:21:54,723 --> 00:21:57,166
The old fools won't face reality.

217
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,802
We can do without their permission,
my love.

218
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:07,306
Listen, Simon, you're the only one
I can ask this of.

219
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:11,516
Yes, but what will you reply?

220
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,532
I'll reply: "Can't you cope, Deschanels?
Should I come over?"

221
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,555
"You're really a pain, Deschanels."

222
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,639
- Who is Deschanels?
- Someone from work.

223
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:28,959
Ok, goodbye, doctor, thank you.

224
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:37,444
At 9 o'clock.
Don't get it wrong.

225
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:41,925
- Are you going home?
- No, we're going out with Bouly.

226
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:48,006
Mr Daoud!

227
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,614
Come in Mr Jouglen.
I'll see you in a moment.

228
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,317
Is this about a woman?

229
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,425
Are you crazy?

230
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:04,928
Politics?

231
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:07,458
Bye, buddy.

232
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:13,797
Did you receive your results,
Mr Jouglen?

233
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:20,493
Didn't the lab call you about
the results?

234
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:22,014
No.

235
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,036
That's strange.

236
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:27,040
No, it's not.

237
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,076
Well?

238
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:34,346
The last time, you got me all
worried, doctor.

239
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:40,968
- What is it?
- No, no... nothing.

240
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:43,851
Then why did you go...

241
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:55,572
Call Lavallée and ask if they've made a
mistake with the results of Mr Jouglen.

242
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:04,931
I don't know what I have,
but it hurts.

243
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:09,856
Must be a pulled muscle.

244
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:14,282
Barney Bigard on clarinet.

245
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:17,169
Cozy Cole on drums.

246
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:19,737
Not Cozy Cole, Gene Krupa!

247
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:23,009
Want to bet?
Typically Cozy Cole.

248
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:28,659
Recorded on April 20, 1950.
He left Benny Goodman in '39...

249
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:33,976
I'm fed up with your clarinets.
Get off my bed, I'm studying.

250
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:37,106
Do you study in your bed?
That explains a lot.

251
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:39,864
- Get out.
- Ladies.

252
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:43,731
Do you have a cigarette?

253
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:47,942
Stop smoking.
You don't even know how.

254
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:51,564
I don't smoke anymore.
Makes it harder to get a tan.

255
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,748
Why do you care about that?

256
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,549
I've decided to look after my body.

257
00:24:57,693 --> 00:25:00,296
- Don't you have your keys?
- Yes, but...

258
00:25:01,478 --> 00:25:03,137
Didn't they come for the elevator?

259
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,025
I don't know.
I always take the stairs.

260
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:10,291
- Did it break down?
- It doesn't stop at our floor anymore.

261
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:18,276
Lucien! Delphine told me you passed.
How old are you?

262
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:22,771
17, but this year, I'm motivated.

263
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:25,664
What time are we leaving?

264
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:27,471
Where?
To the cinema.

265
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:33,554
We're not going.
They gave me this at the last moment.

266
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,805
Of course!

267
00:25:36,487 --> 00:25:40,244
Don't act like that.
I have enough on my plate.

268
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:43,145
Today I'd like to talk about...

269
00:25:43,898 --> 00:25:47,689
- Hello.
- Hello.

270
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,971
I'd like to talk about a case...

271
00:25:57,338 --> 00:26:01,180
Hi, can you get us a beer?

272
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,633
Mind if I put down my things?

273
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:18,272
Are you going through my pockets?

274
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:21,722
No, I need 1000 francs.
I have to repay Catulle.

275
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,069
- Is he the one with the hair?
- Yes, that's him.

276
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:28,471
He wants to have their glasses
filled up.

277
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:33,741
What's wrong?

278
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,444
Oh, nothing.

279
00:26:35,754 --> 00:26:37,171
Nothing.

280
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:43,503
I was leaving after talking to
Deschanels, when I walked into Hawkeye.

281
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:47,251
"Hello, Minister."
"Hello, Dorsay."

282
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:51,022
You're going home. Good, have a look
at this before tomorrow.

283
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:54,095
So now I've got my work cut out
for me.

284
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,441
The one time you were doing something
with the girls.

285
00:26:57,974 --> 00:27:00,399
That hurts me the most.

286
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:03,079
Is it that much work?

287
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:10,382
It's 600 pages, but I gave half
to Deschanels.

288
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,064
But will Deschanels be able
to cope?

289
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:19,207
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes, I do.

290
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:24,187
Oh, I'm so...

291
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,572
...tired.

292
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,969
Why are you shaving?

293
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:18,739
Yes, why am I shaving?

294
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:24,762
What's that?

295
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:29,045
What that is? Bouly's kid.

296
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:32,431
I know, but what is he doing here?

297
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,971
You... don't know?

298
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:43,637
Yes I am but is Marie- Ange here?

299
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:48,144
Just for one night.

300
00:28:48,508 --> 00:28:50,983
Where is Marie- Ange?

301
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:54,806
- I asked where she is.
- I understood, but I don't know.

302
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,119
- Come on.
- I swear.

303
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:12,485
- What do you want, André?
- A pastis.

304
00:29:13,137 --> 00:29:14,616
Two pastis.

305
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:17,404
- René!
- Yes.

306
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:20,453
I feel good!

307
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:28,700
I'll be back.

308
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:30,535
Do you want one?

309
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,040
What's that?

310
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:34,225
Nothing, I gave you your pastis.

311
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:38,360
- René!
- He said he'll be back.

312
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,077
René!

313
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,718
René!

314
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:52,543
- You find that funny?
- Yes.

315
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,877
Not this way.
Follow me, please.

316
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:22,932
- What an idiot.
- Yes, he's an idiot, but it's funny.

317
00:30:38,323 --> 00:30:39,689
Hey, André.

318
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:45,580
Why did you leave me?
Never leave me again.

319
00:30:47,704 --> 00:30:52,585
Sorry, he can't...

320
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,278
You're sick.

321
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:12,530
That time in the Coupole
was better.

322
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,700
No, no.

323
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,947
I like telephone pranks because they
can't see you.

324
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:25,355
I called her family.
They don't know where she is.

325
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,723
Don't think about it.
Stop thinking about it.

326
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,875
You made me laugh.

327
00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:34,401
Want me to do the cop?
Give me the kepi.

328
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,060
Thanks, you're great.

329
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,091
If you want, we'll go to a brothel.

330
00:31:40,813 --> 00:31:42,613
Let's not go anywhere.

331
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,406
Go to sleep. When you wake up,
your mother will come.

332
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:51,783
Goodnight, little fellow.

333
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:55,926
I heard you're really bad
at tennis!

334
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:58,146
What did he say?

335
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:03,458
Now you have to go to sleep.
It's late.

336
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:08,107
You always want to play a smash,
but you're no good at it.

337
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:11,783
- Who says that?
- My father.

338
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:15,307
He always beats you.

339
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,695
That's crazy.
Give him a kiss.

340
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,349
Asshole.

341
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:28,527
She takes off with the other 2 and
we get the ugliest one.

342
00:32:28,937 --> 00:32:32,211
She said it was only for one night.

343
00:32:32,775 --> 00:32:34,257
And what do we say to Bouly?

344
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:37,706
Nothing!
She doesn't want it and neither do I.

345
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,912
Does she need your opinion now?

346
00:32:41,634 --> 00:32:45,617
She doesn't need anyone and
especially not him.

347
00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:52,990
What an asshole!
Really, if it had been me...

348
00:32:53,762 --> 00:32:55,082
What if it had been you?

349
00:32:57,293 --> 00:33:03,856
I'm warning you, Etienne. If it happened
to us, I'd show no class at all.

350
00:33:04,978 --> 00:33:08,563
Anyway, let's not...

351
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:11,871
We can talk about it calmly.

352
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:20,460
Protect me, Etienne.
I may seem strong, but in reality...

353
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,570
not with everything...

354
00:33:24,238 --> 00:33:25,671
Why do you say that?

355
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:28,005
Because you asked.

356
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,651
But Marthe...

357
00:33:30,106 --> 00:33:31,961
Where did I put it?

358
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,641
But you're completely insane!

359
00:33:36,176 --> 00:33:38,068
Who gave you this?

360
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,834
- Mummy... back when...
- Back when?

361
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:44,798
When they moved, they gave
everything away to their children.

362
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:47,794
You could have shot me.

363
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,101
I wouldn't shoot you,
because you haven't hurt me.

364
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:53,287
You're not Bouly.

365
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:58,048
Do you know what he did to Marie- Ange?
Last Thursday, I was there.

366
00:33:58,672 --> 00:34:02,267
He called her at 10pm to say he had
to stay and work.

367
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:07,386
Did he do that?
Does that trick still work?

368
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:09,551
No, it doesn't work anymore.

369
00:34:10,037 --> 00:34:13,196
- What was that noise
- Nothing.

370
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:17,687
- You could have knocked.
- The door was open.

371
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,158
I'll go back to work.

372
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:24,749
Go to sleep!

373
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,778
Walking around at this hour...

374
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:40,378
Hello? Yes.
Deschanels!

375
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:52,092
Hello... yes... what?

376
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,065
What?

377
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,447
Why on earth do you call me
at home?

378
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:03,238
I told you to?
I told you to?

379
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:06,463
I didn't tell you anything!

380
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:09,277
No, I'm not coming over.

381
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:19,418
No, Deschanels, I'm not coming over!
No, Deschanels, goodbye!

382
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:23,698
What's wrong with him?

383
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:32,776
Oh no!

384
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:36,154
What's wrong?

385
00:35:37,915 --> 00:35:41,134
This is crazy. Shake hands.

386
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:17,373
Hello?
A haemorrhage, are you sure?

387
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:21,159
Ok, I'm coming, sweetheart.

388
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:35,027
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry, I'll be back.

389
00:36:35,171 --> 00:36:36,977
It's 1:20am.

390
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:41,235
- Who was that on the phone, Marie- Ange?
- No.

391
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,259
Esperanza!

392
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:12,691
- Hello, Mrs Esperanza.
- Hello, Mr Deschanels.

393
00:38:13,112 --> 00:38:15,493
- Hello, Dorsay.
- Hello, Mr Deschanels.

394
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:20,944
Wasn't I supposed to get the list for
Mauretania last night?

395
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:24,562
The copier was broken, but I've
got it here.

396
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:28,040
No, I don't have time.

397
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,833
Thank you, Mr Deschanels.

398
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,110
Tell me, Esperanza, what did
the doctor say last time you saw him?

399
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:40,527
Hurry,
it's starting 15 minutes earlier.

400
00:38:41,148 --> 00:38:44,759
Why is that?
Nobody ever tells me anything.

401
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:23,215
What's this?

402
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,261
The test prints for the advertising
campaign.

403
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,507
Who is she?

404
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:31,717
Who?

405
00:39:35,195 --> 00:39:37,020
Her.

406
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,549
You should ask the minister.
He found her.

407
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:43,044
Where?

408
00:39:43,527 --> 00:39:45,906
On a horse in Saint- Germain.
He goes every Thursday.

409
00:39:46,657 --> 00:39:52,004
And what does Hawkeye see galloping
through the fog?

410
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:56,807
She's not...

411
00:39:57,623 --> 00:39:58,585
No...

412
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:17,900
The next day it was Thursday.
I ignored Marthe's questions...

413
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:22,654
...and pulled out my riding boots, from
the bag they had been in since 1958.

414
00:40:23,027 --> 00:40:25,447
The year when General De Gaulle
came back to power.

415
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:29,301
Not that those events had anything
to do with each other.

416
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:36,770
That summer I had practiced a bit
of horse riding.

417
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:40,878
A sad event that led to a rift between
this kind of animal and me.

418
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:46,581
Marthe didn't fail to comment on
that fact.

419
00:40:47,346 --> 00:40:53,142
I replied that she had picked up her
studies after 20 years.

420
00:40:58,381 --> 00:41:03,302
Then I kissed her and regretted
my behaviour.

421
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,576
I left the house, all dressed up,
accompanied by my godmother.

422
00:41:13,982 --> 00:41:18,631
I always had lunch with her
on Thursdays.

423
00:41:19,261 --> 00:41:24,471
I didn't look back, but knew
that Marthe was watching me leave.

424
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,791
She kept wondering...

425
00:41:28,421 --> 00:41:31,902
...just like the first horse that had
to deal with me.

426
00:41:40,604 --> 00:41:45,551
I took it easy on the horse.

427
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,090
But soon its lively character took over.

428
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:00,873
I realised that women are beautiful,
horses are high and forests are deep.

429
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,130
It's personal.

430
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,260
- Hello?
- Shall we smoke a peace pipe?

431
00:42:09,512 --> 00:42:16,555
Who's on the phone? Someone who
dined alone at the Récamier restaurant.

432
00:42:19,132 --> 00:42:21,540
Is it you?

433
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,017
It's you.

434
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:29,128
My mother had an attack.
I spent that night in hospital.

435
00:42:29,785 --> 00:42:32,046
You couldn't know that of course.

436
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:34,799
Better... thank you... yes.

437
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,122
She trots.

438
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:43,845
Do you know the Ascot?
An American bar at the Champs- Elysées.

439
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:48,059
Six o'clock.

440
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,696
Alright?

441
00:42:52,163 --> 00:42:56,457
Hello.
Le Pavillon du Régent?

442
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:02,484
Would you have a table for 2
tonight?

443
00:43:03,675 --> 00:43:06,204
Nine o'clock, yes.

444
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:13,892
Blaumet... Mr Blaumet.

445
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:24,500
I was also told that you have
little bungalows.

446
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:28,198
The girls aren't here, Lucien.
What do you want?

447
00:43:28,893 --> 00:43:31,332
You can't come in.

448
00:43:31,823 --> 00:43:34,090
What's with the skis?

449
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:37,979
I'm selling them to a friend,
so we'll have some money.

450
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,011
I said you can't come in.

451
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:41,688
Have you been vaccinated against
smallpox?

452
00:43:42,075 --> 00:43:46,800
Why?
Leave me alone.

453
00:43:47,445 --> 00:43:51,855
In order to go to Mexico, like I wrote,
you need to be vaccinated.

454
00:43:52,614 --> 00:43:57,117
I won't go to Mexico with you, Lucien.
Lucien!

455
00:43:57,598 --> 00:44:00,068
There are other options...

456
00:44:00,731 --> 00:44:04,038
No... no!

457
00:44:04,749 --> 00:44:06,570
I'm married, I have children.

458
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,732
That may sound stupid and
conventional.

459
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:16,464
You're 17 and I'm 41.
Poor idiot!

460
00:44:17,284 --> 00:44:19,260
Go away!

461
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,977
But have you been vaccinated against
smallpox?

462
00:44:22,081 --> 00:44:25,194
You need a vaccination in
your brain!

463
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:33,453
Hello? Yes, I had to run.
The phone rang as I came home.

464
00:44:34,176 --> 00:44:36,490
No, no.

465
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,597
At the ministry or at his place?

466
00:44:40,298 --> 00:44:44,700
Don't worry about me.
We're working here, with 15 people.

467
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:50,708
I need a vaccination in the brain,
that wasn't funny.

468
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:53,052
You must be so unhappy
to say that.

469
00:44:53,994 --> 00:45:00,844
Why do you tell me all these details?
I trust you.

470
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:09,496
- Lucien, I'll scream.
- Me too. You'll be more embarrassed.

471
00:45:10,382 --> 00:45:14,316
Just call Simon.
He's expecting you for dinner.

472
00:45:14,952 --> 00:45:16,802
I told him I couldn't make it.

473
00:45:16,907 --> 00:45:19,973
Mum!

474
00:45:21,904 --> 00:45:25,812
Must be about Bouly's kid.
Yes, she came.

475
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:28,191
What are you doing here?

476
00:45:28,808 --> 00:45:33,068
For your mother. Her dryer wasn't
working. It was the fuse.

477
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,041
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

478
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:01,194
- Bye.
- Bye.

479
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:58,685
I don't get it.
Last summer, with Mouchy, it worked.

480
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,683
I'm not going to make soufflés.

481
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:05,835
Dinner's served, boy scouts.

482
00:47:08,163 --> 00:47:11,802
Don't you have something to remove
the stones from the olives?

483
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:18,711
Everything's in that bag.
Plates, bowls, camping table...

484
00:47:19,582 --> 00:47:21,624
What time is it?

485
00:47:22,388 --> 00:47:25,416
Dinner's served.
Serve yourself.

486
00:47:25,883 --> 00:47:30,694
- What kind of totem were you?
- Cut it out, I was never a boy scout.

487
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,245
Look at my stone removal
technique.

488
00:47:42,806 --> 00:47:46,082
- Artistic, ain't I?
- You're disgusting.

489
00:47:46,737 --> 00:47:48,421
You finally showed up.

490
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:53,717
Yes, that idiot didn't...

491
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:59,013
We waited and waited...

492
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,297
My sister recommends getting
a legal statement drawn up.

493
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:17,145
What does your sister know?

494
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,511
Hey, she studied law.

495
00:48:22,294 --> 00:48:24,441
I don't think you need to do that.

496
00:48:24,834 --> 00:48:28,871
Unless you want her to pay you
alimony.

497
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:34,193
Sorry, but I have to laugh.

498
00:48:34,886 --> 00:48:38,145
Simon, talk to him!

499
00:48:38,868 --> 00:48:40,841
Please, Mouchy, can't you see...

500
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:45,129
Talk to him! Or would you rather
I kill myself?

501
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:50,146
Hello, Etienne. Don't get up.
Don't get up.

502
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:57,450
Hello Bouly. Simon told me.
So you're all alone?

503
00:48:58,064 --> 00:49:00,885
You had a haircut.

504
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:05,389
- Still as beautiful.
- He's such a flatterer.

505
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:11,506
Listen, I received a letter,
very innocent. You'll read it.

506
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:16,370
I met this guy.
What's wrong with a letter?

507
00:49:16,701 --> 00:49:18,276
Mummy.

508
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:23,650
He creates such a drama.
What right does he have?

509
00:49:23,652 --> 00:49:26,079
Know what he said?

510
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:29,819
But why do you tell us this?

511
00:49:29,995 --> 00:49:34,748
Can't I find some warmth with my son?
Would you rather be rid of me?

512
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:41,887
You come barging in here.
We were relaxing...

513
00:49:42,361 --> 00:49:48,079
Do I have to inform you before I visit?
Do I have to make an appointment?

514
00:49:48,434 --> 00:49:52,392
But look at them...
They're looking at you...

515
00:49:52,604 --> 00:49:55,047
Don't you have any pride?

516
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:12,074
Don't think I don't know what
you're doing!

517
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:17,280
Women liked Simon,
but they had to like him in secret.

518
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:21,062
Simon had had this relationship with
his mother for 35 years.

519
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:24,752
She was the centre of his universe
and his tormentor.

520
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:29,248
The man who lived with her was
Charles Du Tillet.

521
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,169
We respected his light- hearted
stoicism.

522
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:38,344
Mouchy said he was the international
king of sports shoes.

523
00:50:38,672 --> 00:50:42,645
He looked much older than he was.
Not without reason.

524
00:50:43,363 --> 00:50:47,588
My friends had too many things
on their mind to realise...

525
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:52,231
...that I, in spite of a missed
appointment...

526
00:50:52,589 --> 00:50:57,203
...was getting ready to enter an unknown
world, inhabited by just one woman.

527
00:50:58,034 --> 00:51:01,825
In the meantime, I made precarious
progress in equestrian matters.

528
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,213
The animal seemed to empathise with
my problem and helped me spy...

529
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:12,786
...on the dressing rooms, but there
was no sign of the woman in red.

530
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:19,780
At the ministry, no one paid attention
to my transformation into a sportsman.

531
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:26,732
Only the behaviour of Mrs Esperanza
remained extremely strange.

532
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:33,534
I had many questions for her
but didn't dare ask them.

533
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:39,891
Could her female intuition have noticed
the intrigue I was involved in...

534
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:44,837
...since the day I called the woman in red
at her office?

535
00:51:45,331 --> 00:51:50,200
It seemed that Mrs Esperanza, herself
a loyal wife and mother...

536
00:51:50,439 --> 00:51:53,781
...was defending Marthe against me,
without ever having met her.

537
00:51:54,776 --> 00:52:01,911
I decided to ignore her deliberate
provocations.

538
00:52:02,906 --> 00:52:07,043
I did, however, suffer a short
period of depression.

539
00:52:08,377 --> 00:52:14,941
Hey, forward!
Hey!

540
00:52:24,127 --> 00:52:27,533
The fact that all my searching was in
vain didn't make me less patient.

541
00:52:27,763 --> 00:52:31,143
But my physical condition
suffered seriously.

542
00:52:31,586 --> 00:52:38,573
I had to continue playing tennis,
because Marthe knew how much I loved it.

543
00:52:39,088 --> 00:52:47,015
Yet I couldn't call myself unhappy
compared to the suffering of a friend...

544
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:50,300
...whose smile couldn't hide
that he was worrying.

545
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:57,952
Marie- Ange gave no sign of life. Bouly
lived alone with Simon's camping gear.

546
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:06,599
Then, just when I was about to give up
hope, my life became a fairy tale.

547
00:53:48,116 --> 00:53:50,541
Stop, Belle- de- Jour...

548
00:53:58,794 --> 00:54:00,991
Hello.

549
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,074
Hello.

550
00:54:08,047 --> 00:54:12,450
He's beautiful.
I know about horses.

551
00:54:14,629 --> 00:54:20,227
He's fantastic!
He's super!

552
00:54:20,653 --> 00:54:23,898
Yes, she's beautiful.

553
00:54:38,961 --> 00:54:40,565
Haven't we met before?

554
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:47,699
At the ministry, when I signed
my contract, right?

555
00:54:47,986 --> 00:54:49,456
You think?

556
00:54:50,216 --> 00:54:53,262
- Do you go riding often?
- Every day, for years. You?

557
00:54:53,366 --> 00:54:56,166
Since 4 or 5 years only.

558
00:54:56,597 --> 00:54:59,369
You must have started as
a child then.

559
00:55:04,194 --> 00:55:08,329
About the other night...
Cruel, but well played.

560
00:55:09,048 --> 00:55:12,804
- Which night?
- Alright.

561
00:55:14,294 --> 00:55:16,375
My riding crop.

562
00:55:42,912 --> 00:55:45,499
Careful, Belle- de- Jour.

563
00:55:46,752 --> 00:55:49,356
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

564
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:57,432
Don't move, alright?

565
00:56:02,836 --> 00:56:04,350
Hey, where are you going?

566
00:56:05,149 --> 00:56:07,057
You're forgetting something.

567
00:56:08,522 --> 00:56:10,253
What?

568
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,758
Excuse me.

569
00:56:41,059 --> 00:56:45,003
- Hello.
- Hello.

570
00:56:48,087 --> 00:56:51,519
Take your time.

571
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,463
Sorry, I had a flat tire.

572
00:56:53,754 --> 00:56:55,053
Again?

573
00:56:55,822 --> 00:57:00,017
- Use another excuse or get another tire.
- Did a woman bite your knees?

574
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:02,818
- No.
- Don't you believe me?

575
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:07,605
- How do we play?
- Like last time, the decider.

576
00:57:08,288 --> 00:57:11,322
Give him a few minutes to warm up.

577
00:57:11,865 --> 00:57:14,788
He'll warm up while he's playing.

578
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:21,041
Did you know I found the kids?

579
00:57:21,145 --> 00:57:23,278
You tell me this like that?

580
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:25,394
Sorry, I should have sung it.

581
00:57:25,754 --> 00:57:28,520
- Where are they?
- With an uncle in Dunkirk.

582
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:31,232
We don't even get time to warm up.

583
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:32,466
What about Marie- Ange?

584
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,724
She's still missing in action.

585
00:57:38,232 --> 00:57:41,172
What should I do when she
comes back?

586
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,836
I guess that's up to...

587
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:46,366
Simon!

588
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:51,602
Don't pay any attention to me, boys.
I have to say something to Simon.

589
00:57:52,238 --> 00:57:54,180
Simon, come here!

590
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:56,797
What are you doing here?
Why are you wearing your fur coat?

591
00:57:57,191 --> 00:57:59,064
I'm leaving.
Do you know what he said last night?

592
00:57:59,472 --> 00:58:01,764
He actually woke me up to tell me...
Guess.

593
00:58:02,233 --> 00:58:03,120
You have to guess.

594
00:58:03,529 --> 00:58:05,665
I don't know. You're not going to
tell me now, are you?

595
00:58:06,036 --> 00:58:07,375
When can I tell you then?

596
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,170
I was at your place this morning.
That crazy woman wouldn't let me in.

597
00:58:11,561 --> 00:58:14,864
Mrs Paquet? Of course!
I was talking to Mr Simoni!

598
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:18,882
Why do you talk to Mr Simoni
when your mother's close to suicide?

599
00:58:19,142 --> 00:58:20,252
Mummy!

600
00:58:20,641 --> 00:58:22,217
Besides, he's fine.
He's a play- actor.

601
00:58:22,563 --> 00:58:24,204
He's fine?

602
00:58:24,595 --> 00:58:26,500
Do you want to see his X- rays?

603
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:29,333
He's fine.
Ask Mrs Paquet.

604
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:32,492
But he pays you.
So you receive him with a smile.

605
00:58:32,725 --> 00:58:36,318
If I have to pay, tell me how much
I owe you..

606
00:58:36,495 --> 00:58:39,067
Stop, stop!

607
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:45,536
Don't talk like that to your mother.
I'll slap you in public!

608
00:58:45,743 --> 00:58:49,796
What did I do?
Listen, mummy!

609
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:53,133
Goodbye or farewell.
Bye, Bouly. Don't look for me.

610
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,653
Where are you going?
Where is she going?

611
00:58:56,945 --> 00:59:00,756
I won't leave you my address,
so you won't have to buy a stamp.

612
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:03,557
Stop it!

613
00:59:09,893 --> 00:59:12,970
- Goodnight, sir.
- See you tomorrow, Pintard.

614
00:59:13,414 --> 00:59:15,967
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight, Delpech.

615
00:59:37,595 --> 00:59:40,376
Dorsay, I wanted to talk to you.
The telex...

616
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,369
Hello.

617
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:02,657
I came to bring you your earring.

618
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:04,610
My what?

619
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:08,224
I picked it up after your
horse freaked out.

620
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:16,667
Yes, but it's not mine.
I don't understand...

621
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:20,587
vHow are you?
- Fine.

622
01:00:21,283 --> 01:00:25,051
- Shall we have dinner?
- No, thanks.

623
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:28,042
Tomorrow? I know a really nice
Chinese restaurant. Lunch?

624
01:00:28,804 --> 01:00:32,452
Tomorrow, I'm not available for lunch.
Or for dinner.

625
01:00:33,186 --> 01:00:34,877
Or a drink?

626
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,315
You're all wet.

627
01:00:37,819 --> 01:00:41,857
Whereas you seem a bit dry.
Why?

628
01:00:45,132 --> 01:00:46,450
You confuse me.

629
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,806
I'm sorry.

630
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:55,532
I do that well, don't I?
But I'm late.

631
01:00:55,857 --> 01:01:00,091
No, no!
That's impossible!

632
01:01:00,454 --> 01:01:02,254
What's impossible?

633
01:01:02,714 --> 01:01:04,307
I have to tell you something,
I've never told anyone.

634
01:01:04,713 --> 01:01:06,088
Your name, perhaps?

635
01:01:06,634 --> 01:01:08,313
Etienne Dorsay.

636
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:13,253
- How old are you? 40?
- Just about.

637
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:17,254
Tomorrow, 4:40pm at the Rhumerie.

638
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,319
Will you be there?

639
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:23,853
Affirmative.

640
01:01:37,773 --> 01:01:40,416
Have they still not fixed
the elevator?

641
01:01:41,308 --> 01:01:42,673
Hello, young folk!

642
01:01:42,987 --> 01:01:44,875
Hello, old man!

643
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:47,414
Did you fall in a puddle?

644
01:01:47,755 --> 01:01:49,957
No, the water fell on me.

645
01:01:50,294 --> 01:01:52,278
What about your raincoat?

646
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,483
My raincoat...
My raincoat?

647
01:01:56,821 --> 01:01:59,151
I had left it at Bouly's.

648
01:02:01,172 --> 01:02:06,054
What a day...
I lost an earring.

649
01:02:06,704 --> 01:02:08,127
What?

650
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:19,482
I don't think horses get more attached
to people than dogs.

651
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:25,194
Dogs are more... horses are colder.

652
01:02:26,146 --> 01:02:29,152
But I don't mean to say that...

653
01:02:29,961 --> 01:02:31,168
No.

654
01:02:31,785 --> 01:02:35,967
You may think it's a cliché,
but when you get on a horse...

655
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:40,200
...do we ask its opinion?

656
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:41,518
No.

657
01:02:43,934 --> 01:02:47,143
You see, Charlotte, maybe it's because
I never married...

658
01:02:47,481 --> 01:02:51,118
...or because I want to have
children...

659
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:55,319
...but without the friendship of animals...
some nights... when life's...

660
01:02:56,268 --> 01:03:01,268
Oh, I hate sentimentality!

661
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:04,809
Where did you get your suit?

662
01:03:07,762 --> 01:03:10,460
Yes, that's it.

663
01:03:11,064 --> 01:03:16,566
Because that photo at the ministry,
where you're all on the steps...

664
01:03:19,394 --> 01:03:21,606
- How many pairs of pants?
- How many? One.

665
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:24,650
No, get two.
You're sitting all the time.

666
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,859
So one with lapels and one without.
And no pockets.

667
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:33,232
Would you like a half belt?

668
01:03:33,974 --> 01:03:36,399
Yes, do you want a half belt?

669
01:03:37,185 --> 01:03:38,948
To be honest... I don't know.

670
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:43,542
Did she just say it like that?
That you're badly dressed?

671
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:47,650
No, she's not like that.
You know Marthe.

672
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:51,937
She looks at you without talking.
So you say...

673
01:03:52,564 --> 01:03:55,004
"What is it?
What are you looking at?"

674
01:03:55,605 --> 01:03:59,828
And then she'll say:
"How old are your suits?"

675
01:04:00,327 --> 01:04:04,785
Hyenas!
They're all hyenas!

676
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:10,688
With all these young people in the
house... if I want to stay up to date...

677
01:04:11,783 --> 01:04:16,440
- Hairspray or loose?
- Completely loose.

678
01:04:17,497 --> 01:04:20,282
You can look now.

679
01:04:22,182 --> 01:04:23,627
Well...

680
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:26,832
What? Hey... Errol Flynn!

681
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:36,909
Hello, godmother.

682
01:04:38,342 --> 01:04:40,685
Hello, girls.

683
01:04:45,816 --> 01:04:48,763
- Good evening, Marthe.
- Good evening.

684
01:05:01,343 --> 01:05:05,025
Hello.

685
01:05:06,374 --> 01:05:16,750
Sorry I'm late. I was...
What was I going to say?

686
01:05:39,443 --> 01:05:42,954
How do you do?

687
01:05:47,385 --> 01:05:50,199
Hello, the Pavillon du Régent?
Hello.

688
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:54,416
Mr Chabert speaking.

689
01:05:56,237 --> 01:05:57,725
Chabert.

690
01:06:17,857 --> 01:06:19,799
Stay on the line.
I'll have a look.

691
01:06:29,434 --> 01:06:30,948
Mr Dorsay.

692
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:43,404
Hello? Yes, if you want.
Miss Charlotte who?

693
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:46,394
It's for me!

694
01:06:49,707 --> 01:06:53,395
Hello Charlotte, Etienne speaking.
Aren't you coming?

695
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:56,228
- I'm in London.
- Why are you in London?

696
01:06:56,749 --> 01:06:59,962
For work. I called you but it was
busy all the time.

697
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:03,316
Yes, the Minister of Justice kept
me busy for an hour.

698
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:06,104
- Come here, Etienne.
- Where?

699
01:07:07,007 --> 01:07:10,956
There's a plane at 10pm.
I'll wait for you at the airport.

700
01:07:12,218 --> 01:07:13,846
In London?

701
01:07:14,215 --> 01:07:15,388
Yes.

702
01:07:15,941 --> 01:07:22,861
We'll spend the evening together
and we'll come back at 10am.

703
01:07:24,486 --> 01:07:26,065
Tomorrow morning?

704
01:07:27,014 --> 01:07:30,414
Yes... hello?

705
01:08:15,623 --> 01:08:17,317
Have they still not been?

706
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:20,088
- What's that?
- A little party.

707
01:08:20,627 --> 01:08:22,629
- But why?
- For fun.

708
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:28,824
I thought we'll have a little party
at home. It'll be fun.

709
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:35,053
See what daddy gave me: an orchid.

710
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:59,644
What would you like?
A whiskey?

711
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,876
Yes, for instance.

712
01:09:03,509 --> 01:09:05,456
And take the phone of the hook.

713
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:10,039
You don't want to make love now,
do you?

714
01:09:10,539 --> 01:09:14,362
I said: Take the phone off the hook.

715
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:18,099
What's that?

716
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,066
- I don't know.
- Are you answering the door?

717
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:22,523
Yes.

718
01:09:33,446 --> 01:09:34,782
- A telegram.
- Telegram?

719
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:37,260
- For whom?
- For you.

720
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:39,453
Open it.

721
01:09:41,258 --> 01:09:44,731
- It's the ministry.
- You're kidding.

722
01:09:44,835 --> 01:09:46,450
I'm not kidding.

723
01:09:46,752 --> 01:09:48,383
Who's Martin Guillot?

724
01:09:48,774 --> 01:09:54,845
He's the head of... what's the word...
of the entire floor.

725
01:09:55,252 --> 01:09:56,390
Is he your superior?

726
01:09:56,771 --> 01:10:00,002
Not for much longer,
but at the moment... yes.

727
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:03,589
Are you going to read it?

728
01:10:03,928 --> 01:10:12,544
Presence required- Tonight.
Brussels- Back tomorrow 12pm.

729
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,611
No.

730
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:22,467
No!

731
01:10:23,008 --> 01:10:25,201
This time it's no! No!

732
01:10:26,754 --> 01:10:28,101
I won't go!

733
01:10:28,285 --> 01:10:29,989
Etienne!

734
01:10:30,342 --> 01:10:33,838
I'm not a puppet!
This is the limit.

735
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:35,866
I'm not their hostage!

736
01:10:35,918 --> 01:10:38,861
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.

737
01:10:39,509 --> 01:10:43,964
Call him at the ministry.
I have his private number: Balzac 14- 39.

738
01:10:44,424 --> 01:10:47,077
Tell him to go to Brussels
with his servants.

739
01:10:47,454 --> 01:10:50,010
But that I stay home!

740
01:10:50,168 --> 01:10:53,163
With my wife!
And my children!

741
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:58,528
Listen, Etienne, you have to go.
Don't be a child.

742
01:10:58,866 --> 01:11:00,116
No!

743
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:04,758
Wait for me!

744
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:16,845
Bloody hell, Marie- Ange!

745
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:21,112
Marie- Ange!

746
01:11:29,029 --> 01:11:32,839
Mrs Philippot! Did she go upstairs?
- Non.

747
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:36,735
- What did she want?
- Her mail.

748
01:11:37,136 --> 01:11:39,862
- Did she have any?
- No.

749
01:11:42,874 --> 01:11:44,436
Driving school...

750
01:12:03,008 --> 01:12:04,461
There's this guy.

751
01:12:04,869 --> 01:12:08,412
- What? What guy.
- Well, a guy.

752
01:12:08,706 --> 01:12:14,884
When I rang, a guy opened.
Blue T- shirt with stripes.

753
01:12:15,285 --> 01:12:18,057
I don't care about a T- shirt.
Did you see Marie- Ange or not?

754
01:12:18,281 --> 01:12:19,131
No.

755
01:12:19,617 --> 01:12:21,866
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

756
01:12:22,186 --> 01:12:26,226
When I saw the guy, I said
I rang the wrong doorbell.

757
01:12:30,316 --> 01:12:34,323
I'll drag Marie- Ange out by her dress.
You'll see.

758
01:12:34,627 --> 01:12:37,980
Be careful, because that guy's
not very nice.

759
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,216
Hey.

760
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:46,009
Bouly can come get her himself.

761
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:51,083
She's not our wife.

762
01:12:59,784 --> 01:13:08,463
We're about to land in London.
Fasten your seatbelt.

763
01:13:20,676 --> 01:13:28,504
The weather doesn't allow us to land
in London.

764
01:13:28,957 --> 01:13:35,744
We'll be landing in Brussels instead.
We'll soon give you more information.

765
01:13:39,376 --> 01:13:43,635
I closed the roof. It started to rain.
What's wrong?

766
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:49,104
He'd be a guest of honour at
the Assholes Ball.

767
01:13:49,815 --> 01:13:54,240
I can't control myself with guys
like that.

768
01:13:54,974 --> 01:13:56,394
Give me a Kleenex.

769
01:13:57,077 --> 01:14:00,316
- Want me to fix you up?
- He scratched me.

770
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,466
Asshole!

771
01:14:04,078 --> 01:14:05,543
Did you see Marie- Ange?

772
01:14:05,927 --> 01:14:08,407
What?
Sort of... yes.

773
01:14:08,886 --> 01:14:10,786
She sure won the lottery!

774
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:14,472
To take 3 kids away from their dad to...
Hyenas!

775
01:14:15,297 --> 01:14:16,893
But what did you say to her?

776
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:21,809
What? Nothing.
I was working on that dwarf.

777
01:14:22,203 --> 01:14:23,394
What dwarf?

778
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:25,216
That guy.

779
01:14:33,907 --> 01:14:39,931
- What will we say to Bouly?
- I don't know. We'll have to be tactful.

780
01:14:40,673 --> 01:14:44,998
- What if we write to him?
- No, no.

781
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:51,007
We'll say that there was a driving
school, because we can't...

782
01:14:51,784 --> 01:14:58,884
That Marie- Ange wasn't there...
and then we'll think of...

783
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,730
We won't mention the dwarf.

784
01:15:02,181 --> 01:15:03,304
No, exactly.

785
01:15:06,165 --> 01:15:11,756
Welcome to Brussels. Passengers from the
Paris- London flight are invited...

786
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:17,905
...to go to the airport restaurant, where
refreshments will be served.

787
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:23,841
They will receive more information
later.

788
01:15:33,955 --> 01:15:40,045
Hello... yes...
Why are you calling?

789
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:45,550
Yes, I like it, but I know
you're in Brussels.

790
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:58,083
That's not it. I mean...
I wasn't worried.

791
01:16:00,301 --> 01:16:05,442
You're so sensitive.

792
01:16:06,225 --> 01:16:09,351
I was asleep.
I took something because...

793
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:13,777
Yes, yes.
No, you hang up.

794
01:16:14,165 --> 01:16:16,825
Last time I hung up.

795
01:16:17,066 --> 01:16:19,702
Yes, I love you.

796
01:16:20,379 --> 01:16:23,371
1, 2, 3.

797
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:50,752
I know he's not home.

798
01:16:52,927 --> 01:16:54,581
Mum?

799
01:16:55,453 --> 01:17:00,308
Now what? Turn off the light!
Understood?

800
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:11,210
You're not going to ring all night,
are you?

801
01:17:11,457 --> 01:17:12,448
Yes, I am.

802
01:17:12,851 --> 01:17:14,580
What do you want?

803
01:17:14,891 --> 01:17:16,357
It's now or never, my love.

804
01:17:16,855 --> 01:17:18,907
Now or never what?

805
01:17:21,993 --> 01:17:23,523
Go away.

806
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:25,928
Leave me alone.

807
01:17:26,786 --> 01:17:28,305
Leave me alone!

808
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:35,253
I lack the perseverance of Frédéric
Moreau in Sentimental Education.

809
01:17:35,849 --> 01:17:36,923
I see.

810
01:17:37,548 --> 01:17:42,313
I'll be hard, very hard. It's no fun
to be abandoned at 40 years of age.

811
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:45,873
But you have to forget about me.

812
01:17:46,172 --> 01:17:47,958
It's better that way, Lucien.

813
01:17:48,426 --> 01:17:52,099
Are you for or against the ban on heavy
vehicles on the banks of the Seine?

814
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,518
Why do you ask me that?

815
01:17:55,814 --> 01:18:01,576
I'm conducting a survey for an agency.
Are you for or against?

816
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:04,559
I don't know... against.

817
01:18:05,224 --> 01:18:12,059
Right, bye Madam.
Anyway, you made me lose my head.

818
01:18:14,973 --> 01:18:21,114
When I think of my past,
I remember more beautiful nights.

819
01:18:21,703 --> 01:18:27,475
Yet, in this foreign land,
where I'd ended up by coincidence...

820
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:32,226
I could feel the wind of adventure
in my neck.

821
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:40,071
One woman was waiting for me in London,
the other in Paris, and I'm in Brussels.

822
01:18:40,846 --> 01:18:45,309
The next day, Charlotte braved the fog
and flew back to Paris.

823
01:18:45,858 --> 01:18:53,709
We spent a series of intense moments,
every day between 4:55pm and 5:52pm.

824
01:18:54,172 --> 01:18:58,183
That was the time when Marthe would come
home with or without her friends.

825
01:18:58,523 --> 01:19:04,733
During these short hours, Charlotte
and I burnt the candle both ways.

826
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:09,626
We made exciting little trips
and had lovely meetings.

827
01:19:10,124 --> 01:19:13,772
Charlotte and I
cherished the mystery of Charlotte.

828
01:19:14,326 --> 01:19:19,048
She spoke little about herself
and I respected her silence.

829
01:19:22,573 --> 01:19:31,171
To hide my real intentions,
I didn't suggest meeting at night.

830
01:19:32,252 --> 01:19:35,670
We'd separate without exchanging
addresses.

831
01:19:36,435 --> 01:19:42,462
She would be speechless with joy
and my face would be marked by desire.

832
01:19:43,682 --> 01:19:47,559
During that time, Marthe passed
her dreaded exams.

833
01:19:48,437 --> 01:19:51,833
She only failed one oral exam.

834
01:19:52,508 --> 01:19:56,034
I admired her.

835
01:19:56,683 --> 01:19:59,804
I got promoted, without any
further exams or intrigue.

836
01:20:00,103 --> 01:20:05,674
I got the job of Martin Guillot,
who was entitled to retirement.

837
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:13,226
So I was in charge of the entire floor.
My promotion didn't lead to jealousy.

838
01:20:13,501 --> 01:20:18,992
On the contrary, even the most
aggressive characters relaxed.

839
01:20:19,546 --> 01:20:27,825
I was too busy to wonder what
had brought about this change.

840
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:33,828
I wasn't the only one to see
their life take a positive turn.

841
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:37,764
Simon gave his mother away.

842
01:20:38,191 --> 01:20:43,855
He was over the moon and so were we for
him. Charles Du Tillet was on his guard.

843
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:49,276
But as Mouchy put it:
"It's the end result that counts."

844
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:57,431
The wedding was chaotic,
noisy and a big success.

845
01:21:06,576 --> 01:21:08,008
Who's is this?

846
01:21:08,464 --> 01:21:09,995
Mine.

847
01:21:11,982 --> 01:21:13,801
Don't lose your stuff.

848
01:21:24,137 --> 01:21:33,255
But the best surprise was the return
of Bouly's wife and furniture.

849
01:21:36,426 --> 01:21:45,407
Why she came back was unclear. Simon and
Daniel said it had to do with a dwarf.

850
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:50,205
But their reports were confusing
and contradictory.

851
01:21:50,909 --> 01:22:01,007
Bouly thought he was so charming
his wife couldn't stay away any longer.

852
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:12,479
Unfortunately, the next day he
returned to his old ways.

853
01:22:17,602 --> 01:22:21,356
Don't do that. You don't even
know her first name.

854
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:23,671
What's her first name?

855
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:25,771
- Tell us!
- Come on!

856
01:22:26,745 --> 01:22:27,711
Hyacinthe.

857
01:22:32,088 --> 01:22:35,784
We're laughing because we're stupid.
It's not a bad name: Hyacinthe.

858
01:22:36,854 --> 01:22:40,472
Hey guys, who wants to play
checkers?

859
01:22:41,078 --> 01:22:43,846
You're terrible, Bouly.
Do that at home.

860
01:22:44,257 --> 01:22:47,105
I can't do that at home.

861
01:22:47,705 --> 01:22:51,954
Hello, do you also have
the pieces to play with?

862
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:53,542
And then you're surprised...

863
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:55,086
- Surprised about what?
- Nothing.

864
01:22:55,391 --> 01:22:57,461
- Tell me.
- No, nothing.

865
01:22:57,689 --> 01:22:59,142
Hey, that's my glass.

866
01:22:59,563 --> 01:23:01,127
Did you see the legs on the
one on the right?

867
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,410
Can we get our coffees, please?

868
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:10,966
She wasn't wearing a bra.

869
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:14,292
I don't care, stop it.

870
01:23:16,934 --> 01:23:18,851
Bitch.

871
01:23:56,076 --> 01:23:57,621
Goal.

872
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,921
Say, Daniel.

873
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,661
What about my car?

874
01:24:24,294 --> 01:24:27,551
I should get it today, but the
guy's not there.

875
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:31,798
Because I'm fed up with this one.

876
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:08,231
The key's in the door.

877
01:25:17,301 --> 01:25:18,690
Oh, it's you.

878
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:21,663
How have you been
since we last saw each other?

879
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:38,173
Are you painting everything?
- Yes, I started on it.

880
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:48,950
You can stain that floor.

881
01:25:52,144 --> 01:25:54,405
- Shall we have a drink?
- Yes.

882
01:25:55,132 --> 01:25:58,203
Let me see what I still have.

883
01:26:04,681 --> 01:26:06,794
Do you like Chartreuse?

884
01:26:13,179 --> 01:26:17,375
I wanted to tell you that my life
isn't all that simple.

885
01:26:21,893 --> 01:26:25,901
I also have as secret.

886
01:26:28,117 --> 01:26:33,755
Feel that dashboard, Etienne.
Excuse me, Charlotte.

887
01:26:35,686 --> 01:26:39,841
Do it.
Tell me what you think.

888
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:42,981
Why are you showing it off?
I'm buying it anyway.

889
01:26:43,555 --> 01:26:46,611
Where do I drop you two off?

890
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:49,999
At the Puy de l'Ermite.
Since we're close.

891
01:26:51,676 --> 01:26:53,928
Are you seeing your godmother?

892
01:26:54,321 --> 01:26:56,512
Yes, like every Thursday.

893
01:26:58,777 --> 01:26:59,853
Does she know you?

894
01:27:00,182 --> 01:27:01,380
No.

895
01:27:03,526 --> 01:27:05,808
What will you tell your poor
godmother?

896
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,722
Nothing, it's a surprise.

897
01:27:09,729 --> 01:27:13,117
Well, I'll be...

898
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:20,770
That's saying something. Us guys have
never been to see your godmother.

899
01:27:21,685 --> 01:27:27,696
- Come up for a drink. She'll like that.
- Quickly then.

900
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:40,494
You can't park here.

901
01:27:40,975 --> 01:27:42,994
It's only for 5 minutes.
Give me a break.

902
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:47,112
This is a crossing.
You have to move.

903
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:51,229
Etienne, go upstairs.
I'll park at the corner.

904
01:27:55,357 --> 01:27:57,978
Press the 7th floor.

905
01:27:59,495 --> 01:28:09,143
She's a piano teacher. She lives alone.
She has a son, Claude, in Italy.

906
01:28:17,213 --> 01:28:18,566
You're beautiful.

907
01:28:18,954 --> 01:28:21,744
You smell very nice.
What is it?

908
01:28:22,113 --> 01:28:24,023
Sandalwood.

909
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:29,659
- Hello, Etienne!
- You're in the dark, godmother.

910
01:28:31,511 --> 01:28:37,678
Happy birthday to you!

911
01:28:51,287 --> 01:28:53,230
Claude!

912
01:28:57,464 --> 01:29:01,223
- I thought you were in San Remo.
- That's the surprise.

913
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,780
- And Yaya.
- Not Yaya anymore, but Christian.

914
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:10,274
Marthe, my darling.

915
01:29:16,753 --> 01:29:19,295
Wait, let me introduce...

916
01:29:20,191 --> 01:29:23,005
I'm so emotional that...

917
01:29:23,314 --> 01:29:26,835
Let me introduce a friend...

918
01:29:27,283 --> 01:29:32,016
Hello, godmother. You didn't tell me.
What's happening?

919
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,573
We organised a surprise
for Etienne.

920
01:29:35,163 --> 01:29:37,491
Hello, children.

921
01:29:37,886 --> 01:29:42,899
I'm not staying. I just wanted to thank
godmother for the beautiful jumper.

922
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:46,713
- Did Etienne give it to you?
- Yes, it was a bit big for me.

923
01:29:47,064 --> 01:29:49,294
He means to say you need to be
broad shouldered for it.

924
01:29:49,945 --> 01:29:51,503
Say hello, Mimi.

925
01:29:52,886 --> 01:29:54,250
Hello.

926
01:29:55,315 --> 01:29:57,290
Get glasses, Claude.

927
01:29:57,569 --> 01:30:00,009
No, we won't have a drink.
We're leaving.

928
01:30:00,407 --> 01:30:03,253
I spent a bit of money, didn't I,
baby?

929
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:07,402
I've got two concert tickets.

930
01:30:08,044 --> 01:30:09,913
But you must have two minutes.

931
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:15,154
No, out of the question...

932
01:30:16,748 --> 01:30:17,941
Say goodbye, Mimi.

933
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,856
Well... bye.

934
01:30:20,516 --> 01:30:21,785
Bye.

935
01:30:22,243 --> 01:30:24,251
Happy birthday, Etienne.

936
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:53,134
Why do you want me to change them?
It's a great gift.

937
01:30:53,808 --> 01:30:57,556
Marthe, is Etienne with you?
I need to see him right away.

938
01:30:58,188 --> 01:31:00,725
Etienne, Etienne...
I don't know what to do anymore.

939
01:31:01,546 --> 01:31:05,498
He's going bonkers. He wants to
kill her, he wants to kill himself.

940
01:31:05,602 --> 01:31:07,958
He hit me in the face, look.

941
01:31:08,027 --> 01:31:09,654
But... who... what... how?

942
01:31:10,125 --> 01:31:11,753
Bouly.
Marie- Ange left again.

943
01:31:12,004 --> 01:31:13,408
Marie- Ange?

944
01:31:13,921 --> 01:31:15,742
He's in the car. Have a look.

945
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:21,680
You know... Etienne's the eldest
and Bouly looks up to him.

946
01:31:25,108 --> 01:31:29,024
I'll kill her!

947
01:31:31,763 --> 01:31:34,363
- Stop it, Bouly!
- Shut up, Daniel!

948
01:31:35,704 --> 01:31:37,066
Don't be a pain.

949
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:43,015
- It's getting out of hand, Bouly.
- I'll kill you!

950
01:31:44,694 --> 01:31:48,913
Etienne, I'm going home... or what?

951
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:50,634
Yes, go home.

952
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:52,234
Have you got the key?

953
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,977
Yes!

954
01:31:55,169 --> 01:31:56,560
Come.

955
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,293
My kids!

956
01:32:04,121 --> 01:32:06,077
- I'm bleeding.
- No, get in.

957
01:32:07,134 --> 01:32:09,289
Find me a bridge to jump off.

958
01:32:09,644 --> 01:32:10,929
That's enough.

959
01:32:11,322 --> 01:32:12,894
He's crazy.
I'm deaf in my right ear.

960
01:32:13,172 --> 01:32:15,619
You're alright, Simon. Get in.

961
01:32:16,153 --> 01:32:18,808
- Bouly, listen.
- No, shut up.

962
01:32:22,205 --> 01:32:23,740
Apologies.

963
01:32:51,418 --> 01:32:53,486
You're quite something!

964
01:32:57,596 --> 01:33:00,926
We didn't know what to give you.

965
01:33:03,086 --> 01:33:05,695
I don't know where she lives.

966
01:33:06,171 --> 01:33:09,087
Number 72, she told me, 8th floor.

967
01:33:09,572 --> 01:33:10,827
What did she tell you?

968
01:33:11,174 --> 01:33:13,190
She told me she'd tell you.

969
01:33:13,803 --> 01:33:18,598
- You really hurt me.
- I was pretending.

970
01:33:19,104 --> 01:33:23,843
- I'm sorry.
- It sucks, I can't hear anything.

971
01:33:29,013 --> 01:33:30,751
Here it is.

972
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:35,501
Happy birthday, Etienne.

973
01:33:44,328 --> 01:33:45,437
Yes?

974
01:33:46,176 --> 01:33:48,040
Etienne Dorsay.

975
01:34:09,088 --> 01:34:12,312
Listen, Etienne Dorsay.

976
01:34:13,094 --> 01:34:21,214
A month ago, I met a man with no wife,
no children, who liked horse riding.

977
01:34:21,854 --> 01:34:30,380
In a month's time, you got married
and had two 14 year old girls.

978
01:34:31,194 --> 01:34:35,077
You don't ride horses,
they ride you.

979
01:34:35,618 --> 01:34:40,011
The way you dress, children in the
countryside would throw rocks at you.

980
01:34:40,388 --> 01:34:43,871
Your plane lands in Belgium
when I'm waiting in London.

981
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:47,929
Stop looking at your shoes and
look at me.

982
01:34:48,967 --> 01:34:52,075
I want you...

983
01:34:52,581 --> 01:34:55,614
the way I've never wanted anyone
before.

984
01:34:57,190 --> 01:34:58,537
How do you explain that?

985
01:34:59,122 --> 01:35:00,489
I don't know.

986
01:35:00,846 --> 01:35:02,116
I want your hands...

987
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:04,906
I want to see your undressed
body.

988
01:35:05,308 --> 01:35:09,217
You mean... naked?

989
01:35:11,348 --> 01:35:12,830
Why?

990
01:35:17,093 --> 01:35:19,829
I think you shouldn't explain.

991
01:35:22,059 --> 01:35:25,998
I suggest you take off your
bow tie.

992
01:35:34,796 --> 01:35:40,761
Hello, Titou? Marthe speaking.
Are your parents home?

993
01:35:41,225 --> 01:35:43,305
No, they're both gone.
I'm home alone.

994
01:35:44,097 --> 01:35:49,826
Simon's not home either.
Nobody's home.

995
01:35:50,436 --> 01:35:53,674
Do you know when they'll be back?

996
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:55,957
No and dad broke a chair.

997
01:35:56,744 --> 01:36:02,656
If fate had wanted me to be a person
of national importance...

998
01:36:03,243 --> 01:36:07,724
...this night would have gone into
the history books.

999
01:36:08,141 --> 01:36:15,227
Charlotte said to me in 1 second, what
I had been unable to say for a month.

1000
01:36:17,412 --> 01:36:19,026
Come.

1001
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:23,441
A beautiful imperative that
set my life on fire.

1002
01:36:23,977 --> 01:36:32,248
However, the male soul is so ugly, that
I never considered leaving Marthe.

1003
01:36:32,604 --> 01:36:37,641
Not even after giving her an allowance
consisting of 35.8% of my salary...

1004
01:36:37,745 --> 01:36:41,949
...after subtraction of benefits.

1005
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,553
Hello?

1006
01:36:52,021 --> 01:36:53,177
Simone?

1007
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:56,561
Simone?

1008
01:36:57,816 --> 01:36:58,727
Yes.

1009
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:06,479
What's going on?

1010
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:09,409
Nothing, it's my husband.
He's downstairs.

1011
01:37:09,709 --> 01:37:11,788
- Your husband?
- Yes, hurry! Hurry!

1012
01:37:12,361 --> 01:37:15,932
- Hurry, why? Which husband?
- Come on, get out of the bed.

1013
01:37:17,597 --> 01:37:21,195
He was supposed to be gone
all week.

1014
01:37:21,604 --> 01:37:23,595
But it's only Friday.

1015
01:37:23,916 --> 01:37:26,462
We'll have to ask him for an
explanation, won't we?

1016
01:37:27,504 --> 01:37:29,246
Your watch.

1017
01:37:59,706 --> 01:38:01,920
But... what are you doing?

1018
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:04,293
Leave it to us, Charlotte.
I'll talk to him from man to man.

1019
01:38:04,644 --> 01:38:06,365
You're crazy.
You have to go.

1020
01:38:09,807 --> 01:38:13,797
- No, that's the window.
- You can't go through the door.

1021
01:38:14,468 --> 01:38:15,811
Don't worry.

1022
01:38:16,353 --> 01:38:21,673
Get on the ledge.
He won't stay long.

1023
01:38:23,095 --> 01:38:26,757
Wait for me there.

1024
01:38:27,951 --> 01:38:29,369
Where are your things?

1025
01:38:29,777 --> 01:38:32,163
In the bathroom.
I put them there last night and...

1026
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,943
I'm coming!

1027
01:38:39,067 --> 01:38:41,472
The doorbell rings,
I have to hang up!

1028
01:38:44,869 --> 01:38:49,885
I was on the phone with Jeanette.
Hello, darling.

1029
01:39:19,155 --> 01:39:21,404
- Did you see that?
- Damn!

1030
01:39:32,924 --> 01:39:35,942
There's a man up there.

1031
01:39:46,227 --> 01:39:49,226
No, he's not here.

1032
01:40:04,511 --> 01:40:07,111
Do you think he'll jump?

1033
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:18,680
- I'll land in Marrakech at 3:10pm.
- Yes, but I have to work on Monday.

1034
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:21,816
Take the plane on Sunday evening.

1035
01:40:21,817 --> 01:40:24,329
- You're beautiful.
- What?

1036
01:40:24,433 --> 01:40:28,533
You're beautiful.
You heard what I said.

1037
01:41:14,422 --> 01:41:21,649
Can we call the fire brigade?
There's a guy about to jump.

1038
01:41:30,199 --> 01:41:33,374
There he is!

1039
01:42:21,458 --> 01:42:22,776
Come on.

1040
01:42:23,069 --> 01:42:25,105
I'm not playing along.

1041
01:42:25,382 --> 01:42:27,106
What's wrong now?

1042
01:42:27,608 --> 01:42:29,564
After all our fooling around,
she left for real.

1043
01:42:30,073 --> 01:42:31,470
Marie- Ange?

1044
01:42:32,096 --> 01:42:35,459
It got so late, she thought I was
spending the night with someone.

1045
01:42:36,117 --> 01:42:37,933
With the furniture?

1046
01:42:38,854 --> 01:42:40,491
What's wrong with you?

1047
01:42:41,268 --> 01:42:46,689
When the prof arrived at the hospital,
the guy had died, so he went back home.

1048
01:42:46,690 --> 01:42:47,732
And he finds Simon...

1049
01:42:49,701 --> 01:42:54,005
He was nice about it. He drove me
to the hospital to get the bullet out.

1050
01:42:54,457 --> 01:42:55,540
What a guy...

1051
01:42:55,989 --> 01:42:57,403
Is Etienne not at your place?

1052
01:42:57,864 --> 01:42:59,901
Why would he be at my place?

1053
01:43:04,137 --> 01:43:06,862
No ladder! That scares them!

1054
01:43:07,131 --> 01:43:09,578
It always makes them jump.
Or think about it.

1055
01:43:39,849 --> 01:43:43,204
Didn't she say if she'd be back?

1056
01:43:43,868 --> 01:43:47,141
If only to see the children.

1057
01:43:48,878 --> 01:43:50,412
Alright...

1058
01:43:51,004 --> 01:43:55,511
... at the corner of the Rue de Tilsitt
and the Avenue de la Grande Armée...

1059
01:43:56,782 --> 01:44:00,494
Hey, guys!

1060
01:44:01,321 --> 01:44:06,698
Commander Gaudion of the 5th
Brigade and his men are at the scene.

1061
01:44:07,177 --> 01:44:10,547
They're trying to intervene
from the roof.

1062
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:15,843
- Who moved the antenna?
- Not me.

1063
01:44:18,046 --> 01:44:21,336
...a desperate man whose identity
is not known...

1064
01:44:21,998 --> 01:44:25,686
He looks like dad.

1065
01:44:32,236 --> 01:44:33,539
But, Etienne...

1066
01:44:35,651 --> 01:44:37,602
Be reasonable, sir!

1067
01:44:41,385 --> 01:44:44,033
Jump in the canvas!

1068
01:45:29,792 --> 01:45:37,289
<i>With Charlotte gone, I realised that if
Marthe would leave me too...</i>

1069
01:45:37,290 --> 01:45:42,253
<i>...it would be for good reason.</i>

1070
01:45:47,364 --> 01:45:52,151
<i>I decided to fall carefully...</i>

1071
01:45:52,461 --> 01:45:58,306
<i>I counted the number of women in
the crowd who could catch me.</i>

1072
01:45:59,054 --> 01:46:08,792
<i>I noticed a platinum blonde
who took my picture.</i>

1073
01:46:11,327 --> 01:46:17,511
<i>To be honest, I was only at the
beginning of my ascent.</i>
