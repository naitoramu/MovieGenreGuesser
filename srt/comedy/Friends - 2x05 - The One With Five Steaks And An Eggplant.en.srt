I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,801
Man, I sure miss Julie.

Spanish midgets.

00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:16,058
Spanish midgets wrestling...

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:20,479
Julie!
Okay, I see how you got there.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,903
You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

8
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,030
I'm trying this screening thing.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,117
If I always answer the phone,
people will think I have no life.

10
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,453
My God!
Rodrigo never gets pinned!

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,164
<i>At the sound of the beep,</i>
<i>you know what to do.</i>

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,291
<i>Hello. I'm looking for Bob.</i>

13
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,752
<i>This is Jade.</i>

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,922
<i>I don't know if you're still</i>
<i>at this number, but I was thinking...</i>

15
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,467
<i>... about how great it was.</i>
<i>I know it's been three years...</i>

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,053
<i>... but I was hoping</i>
<i>we could hook up again.</i>

17
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,306
<i>I barely had the nerve</i>
<i>to make this call...</i>

18
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,684
<i>...so you know what I did?</i>
- What?

19
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,894
<i>I got a little drunk...</i>

20
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,103
<i>... and naked.</i>

21
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,148
Bob here!

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,657
So what have you been up to?

25
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,576
<i>Oh, you know, the usual.</i>

26
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,786
<i>Teaching aerobics...</i>

27
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,331

28
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,249
<i>And in case you wondered...</i>

29
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:09,963
<i>... those are my legs on</i>
<i>the new James Bond poster.</i>

30
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,801
Can you hold on?
I have another call.

31
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,971
- I love her!
- I know.

32
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,057
- I'm back.
<i>- So are we gonna get together?</i>

33
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,767
Absolutely.

34
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,560
How about tomorrow afternoon?

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,479
Do you know Central Perk?
Say, five-ish?

36
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,400
<i>Great. I'll see you then.</i>

37
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:37,032
Having a phone has finally paid off.

38
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,035
You do a good Bob impression...

39
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,953
...but when she
sees you tomorrow...

40
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:46,125
...she's gonna realize
you're not Bob.

41
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,127
I'm hoping that when
Bob doesn't show up...

42
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,257
...she'll seek comfort in the arms of
the stranger at the next table.

43
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,344
Oh, my God.
You are pure evil.

44
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,763
Okay, pure evil...

45
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,141
...horny and alone.

46
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,562
I've done this.

47
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,070
Yeah, everybody's here.

48
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,990
Hey, everybody!
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico!

49
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,286
Hi, Julie.

50
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,538
While Ross is on the phone...

51
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,708
...everybody owes me
62 bucks for his birthday.

52
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,754
Is there any chance that
you're rounding up from...

53
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,922
...you know...

54
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,592
...from like 20?

55
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,720
Hey, we got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

56
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,223
Do we need a cake?

57
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,351
I know it's a little steep.

58
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,772
But it's Ross.

59
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,734
It's Ross.

60
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,653
See you later.
I gotta go...

61
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,697
...do a thing!

62
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,074
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll call you later.

63
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,994
You're not going
through with this, are you?

64
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,998
You know, I think I might just.

65
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,711
What are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

66
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,631
Well, I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

67
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,843
I guess I'll just stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

68
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,721
Can you believe
how much this costs?

69
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,891
Do you guys ever
get the feeling that...

70
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,851
...Chandler and those guys...

71
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,439
...don't get that
we don't make that much money?

72
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,233
They always say
let's go here, let's go there.

73
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,612
Like we can afford to go
here and there.

74
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,991
Yes, and we always have to go to,
you know, someplace nice.

75
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:48,080
And we can't say anything about it,
because this is a birthday thing...

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,665
...and it's "for Ross".

77
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,918
For Ross.

78
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,797
Oh, my God!

79
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,507
I'm at work...

80
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,931
Suddenly, Leon, the manager,
calls me into his office.

81
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,142
They fired the lunch chef,
and guess who got the job?

82
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:13,314
If it's not you,
this is a horrible story.

83
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,608
Fortunately, it is me.

84
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,277
And they made me head of purchasing,
thank you!

85
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,404
That's so cool!

86
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,532
Anyway, I think we
should go out and celebrate.

87
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,202
You know, someplace nice.

88
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,958
Someplace nice.

89
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,295
How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

90
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,929
You can't do this.

91
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,474
I can't get a girl like that
with conventional methods.

92
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:49,683
It doesn't matter.

93
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:54,813
She wanted to call Bob. Bob could be
who she was meant to be with.

94
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,941
You may be destroying
their chance for happiness.

95
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,486
We don't know Bob.

96
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:05,241
We know me. We like me.
Please let me be happy.

97
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,327
Go over there
and tell that woman the truth.

98
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,122
All right.

99
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,666
Go.

100
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,261
Listen, I have to...

101
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,681
I have to confess something.

102
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,308
Yes?

103
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,395
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

104
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:39,275
- How did you...
- I don't know.

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,697
I just had this weird sense.
But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

106
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,285
Tissue?

107
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,912
Thanks.

108
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,248
No, you keep the pack.

109
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,584
I'm all cried out today.

110
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,310
Here is to my sister,
the newly appointed head lunch chef.

111
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,480
Also in charge of purchasing.

112
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,649
Head lunch chef,
also in charge of purchasing...

113
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,611
Who has her own little desk
when Roland's not there.

114
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,741
Lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk
when Roland's not there...

115
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:33,621
...here's to my...
- Wait! And I got a beeper!

116
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,541
That's fine, I'll just wait.

117
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,252
Sorry.

118
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,213
Monica!

119
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,091
Are we ready to order?

120
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,968
We haven't even looked yet.

121
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,803
When you do, let me know.

122
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:54,266
I'll be over there
on the edge of my seat.

123
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,855
Look at these prices!

124
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,609
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching".

125
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,863
I know! What are these,
famous chickens?

126
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,699
Sorry I'm late.
Congratulations, Mon.

127
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,828
I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible
was my afternoon with Jade?

128
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:19,124
Pretty incredible, according to
the message on my machine.

129
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:23,545
Why is this woman leaving a message
for you on my machine?

130
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,672
I told her that
my number was yours...

131
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,883
...because I couldn't
tell her it was mine...

132
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,137
...because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

133
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:37,434
Tell me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

134
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,644
Do I dare ask?

135
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,272
I'll start with the carpaccio,
and then the grilled prawns.

136
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,233
Great, same for me.

137
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,818
And for the gentleman?

138
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,695
I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

139
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:51,031
But if I get it without
the nuts and leeks and stuff...

140
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,200
...is it cheaper?

141
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,204
You'd think, wouldn't you?

142
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,666
I will have the side salad.

143
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,878
And what would that
be on the side of?

144
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:05,962
I don't know.

145
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:10,759
Just put it right here
next to my water.

146
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,804
And for you?

147
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:19,768
I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup and...

148
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,356
...take care.

149
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,818
I will have the Cajun catfish.

150
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:28,860
Anything else?

151
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:33,699
Yes, how about a verse of
<i>Killing Me Softly?</i>

152
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:38,120
You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

153
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,836
Plus tip, divided by six...

154
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,715
Everyone owes 28 bucks.

155
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,758
Everyone?

156
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,345
Oh! You're right, I'm sorry.

157
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,387
Thank you.

158
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,516
It's Monica's big night.
She shouldn't pay.

159
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,227
So five of us is...

160
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,145
...33.50 a piece.

161
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,858
No. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

162
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,486
Prom night flashback.

163
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,907
Sorry, Monica.
I'm happy you got promoted...

164
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:18,327
...but cold cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks?

165
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,704
No!

166
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,457
Rachel just had that little salad...

167
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:27,336
...and Joey with his teeny pizza!

168
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,505
Okay, Pheebs.

169
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,424
How about we'll each
pay for what we had?

170
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,925
It's no big deal.

171
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,637
Not for you.

172
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,892
All right, what's going on?

173
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,227
I don't wanna get
into this right now.

174
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:48,107
It'll make everybody uncomfortable.

175
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,150
You can tell us.

176
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,779
Yeah, hello? It's us.
We'll be fine.

177
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:01,953
We three...

178
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,415
...feel like that...

179
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:09,628
...sometimes you guys don't get that...

180
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,430
We don't have
as much money as you.

181
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,643
I hear you.

182
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,687
We can talk about that.

183
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,732
Well, then...

184
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,652
...let's.

185
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:39,116
I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

186
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,036
- Because you have it.
- Good point!

187
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:47,583
So how come you guys
haven't talked about this before?

188
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,545
Because it's always something.
Like with Monica's new job...

189
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:56,008
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

190
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:00,846
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative...

191
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,516
There's gonna be a hoopla?

192
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,606
Basically there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing...

193
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,734
If it makes anybody feel better,
forget the thing...

194
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,986
...and we'll just do the gift.

195
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,573
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

196
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,617
No, we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

197
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,286
Hootie and the...

198
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,581
I can catch them on the radio.

199
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,959
No. Now I feel bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

200
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,587
No, look. It's my birthday...

201
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,965
...and the important thing
is that we're all together.

202
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,134
- All of us.
- Together.

203
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,720
Not at the concert.

204
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,641
Thank you.

205
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:56,401
So, the Ebola virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

206
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,990
Gee, Monica.
What's in the bag?

207
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,744
I don't know, Chandler.
Let's take a look.

208
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,413
Oh, it's like a skit.

209
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,292
Why, it's dinner for six.
Five steaks...

210
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:15,379
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

211
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,841
We switched suppliers at work, and
they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

212
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:25,848
But wait, there's more.
Chandler, what is in that envelope?

213
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:30,311
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the hall.

214
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:35,024
Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the Blowfish!

215
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,653
The Blowfish!

216
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,656
It's on us. So don't worry.
This is...

217
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,283
...our treat.

218
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,995
Thank you.

219
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,289
Could you be less enthused?

220
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,959
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

221
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,253
But it just feels like...

222
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,005
Like?

223
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,047
Charity.

224
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,424
Charity?

225
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,968
We're just trying
to do a nice thing here.

226
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:07,305
But you have to understand, your
"nice thing" makes us feel about this big.

227
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:12,019
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

228
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,273
I don't understand.
We can't win with you guys.

229
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,609
If you guys feel this big,
maybe that's not our fault.

230
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,238
Maybe that's just how you feel.

231
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,326
Now you're telling us how we feel.

232
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,495
We never should have talked about this.

233
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,872
I'm gonna pass on the concert.

234
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:36,543
I'm just not in a very
"Hootie" place right now.

235
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,005
- Me neither.
- Me too.

236
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,299
Guys, we bought the tickets.

237
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:47,137
Then you'll have extra seats
for all your tiaras and stuff.

238
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:52,183
Why did you look at me
when you said that?

239
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,770
So I guess now we can't go.

240
00:14:56,021 --> 00:15:01,109
Do what you want. Do we always
have to do everything together?

241
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,362
You know what? You're right.

242
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:07,032
Fine.

243
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,494
All right.

244
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,081
We're gonna go.

245
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:22,089
It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

246
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,726
Are you ready?

247
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:38,898
Just let me grab my jacket
and tell you I had sex today.

248
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,900
What? You had sex today?

249
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,321
It sounds even cooler
when somebody else says it!

250
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:52,286
I was awesome. She was biting her lip
to stop from screaming.

251
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:57,249
I know it's been a while,
but I took that as a good sign.

252
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,755
Still doing the screening?

253
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,341
I had sex today.

254
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:08,552
I never have to
answer that phone again.

255
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,388
<i>At the sound of the beep,</i>
<i>you know what to do.</i>

256
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,931
<i>Hey, Bob. It's Jade.</i>

257
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:17,019
<i>I wanted to tell you I was really hurt</i>
<i>when you didn't show up yesterday.</i>

258
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:22,316
<i>And just so you know,</i>
<i>I ended up meeting a guy.</i>

259
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,611
Bob here.

260
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,821
So you met someone, huh?

261
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,531
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

262
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:34,828
<i>In fact, I had sex</i>
<i>with him two hours ago.</i>

263
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,208
So how was he?

264
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:53,972
<i>Oh, Bob, he was nothing</i>
<i>compared to you.</i>

265
00:16:55,641 --> 00:17:00,229
<i>I bit my lip to keep from</i>
<i>screaming your name.</i>

266
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,483
Well, that makes me feel so good.

267
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:08,904
<i>It was just so awkward and bumpy.</i>

268
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,159
Maybe he had some kind of new style
that you're not familiar with.

269
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,827
You have to get used to it.

270
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,372
<i>There wasn't much time</i>
<i>to get used to it...</i>

271
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:22,126
<i>... if you know what I mean.</i>

272
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,512
You know what? I'm not gonna
be able to enjoy this.

273
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:37,516
I know. It's my birthday.
We all should be here.

274
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,811
So let's go.

275
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:48,152
Well, maybe we should stay
for one song.

276
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,196
It would be rude to them
for us to leave now.

277
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:55,700
The guys are probably
having a great time.

278
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:01,373
Come on, you guys.
One more time.

279
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,251
One.

280
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,970
- Amazing!
- Excellent!

281
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,888
I can't believe the guys missed it!

282
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:20,559
What guys?
Oh, yeah.

283
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,603
Excuse me.
Aren't you Monica Geller?

284
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,899
- Do I know you?
- You were my baby-sitter!

285
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,360
Oh, my God!
Little Stevie Fisher?

286
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,112
How have you been?

287
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,363
Good. I'm a lawyer now.

288
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,200
You can't be a lawyer.
You're 8.

289
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,827
It was nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

290
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,161
Wait, backstage?

291
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:43,582
My firm represents the band.

292
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,379
You guys wanna meet the group?

293
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:49,463
Come on.

294
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:54,509
Are you one of the ones
that fooled around with my Dad?

295
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,347
Hey, you guys!

296
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:00,474
Happy birthday!

297
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,894
Oh, thank you.

298
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,606
How was your night last night?

299
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:11,318
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

300
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,236
Ours pretty much sucked too.

301
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,906
But I ran into Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?

302
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,241
Oh, yeah!
I used to baby-sit him.

303
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,537
Hey, how's his dad?

304
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,581
Good.

305
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,042
Aside from that, the evening
was pretty much a bust.

306
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,128
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

307
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:34,133
Yeah, we were just saying,
this whole thing is so stupid.

308
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:39,722
We just have to really, really
not let stuff like money, get like...

309
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,433
Is that a hickey?

310
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,852
Oh, no, I just...

311
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,397
I fell down.

312
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,984
On someone's lips?

313
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,861
Where'd you get the hickey?

314
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,404
You know, a party or...

315
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:56,446
What party?

316
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,200
It wasn't a party
so much as a...

317
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,494
...a gathering of people.

318
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,955
With food and music and...

319
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,999
...and the band.

320
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,377
You partied with
Hootie and the Blowfish?

321
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,673
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie
are like this.

322
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,050
Who gave you that hickey?

323
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:20,971
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

324
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,517
I can't believe it!
I can't believe this!

325
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:31,856
We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

326
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,528
...and you're partying
and having fun and all:

327
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:39,447
"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!"

328
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,078
Don't blame us.
You could've been there.

329
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:48,958
What? As part of your
"poor friends outreach program"?

330
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,459
Oh, great. It's work.

331
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:54,338
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry we make more than you.

332
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,841
But we're not gonna feel guilty.
We work really hard.

333
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,551
And we don't work hard?

334
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,386
It's Monica. I got a page.

335
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:05,599
It's just that sometimes we like
to do stuff that costs a little more.

336
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,478
And you feel like we hold you back.

337
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:14,942
Leon, wait.

338
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,694
Guys!

339
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,028
I don't understand.

340
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,447
The steaks were a gift
from the meat vendor.

341
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,616
That was not a kickback.

342
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:27,746
I'll just replace them,
and we can forget the whole thing.

343
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,959
What corporate policy?

344
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:47,474
I just got fired.

345
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,439
Here's your check. That'll be $4,12.

346
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,401
Let me get that.

347
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,448
You got 5 bucks?

348
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:15,001
<i>Here comes the beep.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

349
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:18,881
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

350
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,552
<i>Listen, Bob.</i>
<i>I'm probably way out of line here.</i>

351
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,597
<i>It's been three years, and you're</i>
<i>probably seeing someone else now...</i>

352
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:31,643
<i>... but if we could have one night</i>
<i>together, for old time's sake...</i>

353
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:36,148
<i>One hot, steamy, wild night...</i>
