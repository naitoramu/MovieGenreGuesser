1
00:00:00,658 --> 00:00:02,941
So the figures show improvement
right there, Michael.

2
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:04,251
And again...

3
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:09,011
I'll call back.

4
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:11,462
You never call back.

5
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:14,258
Every time Michael's in a meeting,
he makes me come in

6
00:00:14,418 --> 00:00:17,081
and give him a post-it note
telling him who's on the phone.

7
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:18,955
I did it once, and he freaked out.

8
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:20,583
He loved it so much.

9
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:23,068
The thing is,
he doesn't get that many calls.

10
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:26,176
So he has me make them up
every ten minutes.

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,767
Tell him I'll call him back.

12
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:32,535
- You can't just work 200 days a...
- Sorry.

13
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:34,996
No, no.
I don't have time for this.

14
00:00:35,646 --> 00:00:37,496
Tell him I'm in a meeting.

15
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:39,901
So...

16
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:42,700
You have to know how to work this.
There's no excuse for this.

17
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:44,823
I can get you a tutor if you need...

18
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:48,635
This is a very important client.

19
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:53,619
But I have the most important client
sitting right in front of me... my boss.

20
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:55,242
- So I'll call him back...
- No.

21
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:57,426
Customer service
is obviously priority one.

22
00:00:57,586 --> 00:00:59,020
- You take the call.
- N...

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,993
No, money isn't everything, Ryan.

24
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:03,191
And you're my friend,
and I don't wanna be rude.

25
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:04,484
Take the call, friend.

26
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:07,005
I refuse. No.
My house, my rules... I insist.

27
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,690
I insist you take your work calls.

28
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,534
Okay. All right, Pam,
would you put the call through.

29
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,154

"THE DEPOSITION" (1.00)

65
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:56,775
I don't know, I just...
I never felt welcomed there, you know?

66
00:01:56,935 --> 00:01:59,395
- That's...
- It's such a boys' club.

67
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:01,957
Yeah, I hate that.
So here's the deal.

68
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,658
I am on my way to New York
to be deposed

69
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:07,848
as part of Jan's
wrongful termination lawsuit.

70
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,158
The company fired her
for having the courage

71
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:12,772
to augment her boobs.

72
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:17,336
And they displayed a pattern of
disrespect and inappropriate behaviors.

73
00:02:17,496 --> 00:02:18,890
Yes, yes.

74
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:21,270
Pat-tern.
Patt-ern.

75
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,947
My friend friend Pat took a turn.
That's how I remember that.

76
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,765
Could we pull over and put down the top?
My...

77
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:31,302
- I'm feeling a little queasy.
- No, I want it up. My hair.

78
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:35,253
Remember, it's not just a pattern.
It's a pattern of disrespect...

79
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:38,285
and inappropriate behaviors.

80
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:42,097
Disree.
My friend Disree got new specs.

81
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:43,583
Disree spect.

82
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:45,759
My friend Inapro

83
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,505
drives a Prius
with his behind neighbor.

84
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:51,257
- Does this work for you?
- Yep!

85
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,559
Tell 'em how much
you're gonna get if you win.

86
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,461
- Michael, that's tacky.
- $1 million!

87
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:58,269
- That's 4 million.
- $4 million! Man!

88
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,226
That is a lot of guacamole.

89
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:01,697
Lot of green.

90
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,464
Lotta green. That is why
I have memorized Jan's answers.

91
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,484
And I've also thrown in some ers and ahs

92
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:12,348
just to make it seem
like it's not memorized. Perfect crime.

93
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,887
Stop saying ridiculous things.
He's gonna tell the truth.

94
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:17,136
The truth is very,
you know, complicated.

95
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:18,783
So we went over it carefully,

96
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:21,667
and just not to leave anything up
to chance or Michael's judgment.

97
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,795
Could we please pull over
and pull down the top?

98
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:27,251
- I don't feel good.
- I told you. I'm not putting it down!

99
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:31,798
- I'm gonna puke. I'm gonna throw up.
- Fine, just a second. Hold on.

100
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:39,191
Schneider, real quick. What is a butt
load of lawyers driving off a cliff?

101
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:40,517
A good start.

102
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:42,141
And I think it's "busload."

103
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,800
Yeah, but rich lawyers took the bus.

104
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,518
Where'd you find this guy?

105
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,234
- Hey, there he is. Hey, hey.
- Hey, Michael. Jan.

106
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm glad you're here.
I need to talk to you.

107
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,039
Can we talk off the record?
As friends.

108
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,299
I would love that.

109
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:01,856
Jan...

110
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:05,373
has put the company
in a very tough position here.

111
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:08,334
You're with us for a long time.
Over ten years, right?

112
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:10,673
We just wanna be sure
you won't do anything

113
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,172
to hurt us with your testimony.
Do you understand?

114
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:14,791
Abso...
Really, yeah.

115
00:04:15,307 --> 00:04:17,579
I'll...
I'll do anything for the company.

116
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:18,740
Good.

117
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,485
That is great to hear.

118
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:21,679
It is.

119
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:25,881
Game, son!

120
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:28,038
Okay, let's run it back.

121
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:30,348
The warehouse got
a ping-pong table last week.

122
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:32,475
Now Jim comes down
and plays with Darryl.

123
00:04:32,635 --> 00:04:34,563
Sometimes, I bring him juice.

124
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,321
My boyfriend is 12.

125
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,096
What has two skinny chicken legs
and sucks at ping-pong?

126
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:46,062
- Hi, Kelly.
- Guess whose boyfriend it is?

127
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:48,190
- I don't wanna guess.
- I'll give you a hint.

128
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:49,852
It's not my boyfriend.

129
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:52,003
I think it's the guy over here.

130
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,568
I don't talk trash, I talk smack.

131
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,190
They're totally different.

132
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,075
Trash talk is all hypothetical,
like,

133
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,133
"Your mom is so fat,
she could eat internet."

134
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,880
But smack talk is happening,
like, right now.

135
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,968
Like, "You're ugly,
and I know it for a fact,

136
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:06,768
'cause I got the evidence right there."

137
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:09,908
Jim...

138
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:11,539
Can I see you for a second?

139
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:12,747
Sure.

140
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:19,641
Okay, it's not regulation size,
but it'll do.

141
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:22,825
You have to practice. You've to get
really good and beat Darryl.

142
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,452
I can't beat Darryl.

143
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:27,580
Please? Kelly's trash talking me
because Darryl's beating you.

144
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,749
What? Seriously?
What is she saying?

145
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,418
Your boyfriend is so weak,

146
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:33,544
he needs steroids
just to watch baseball.

147
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:36,255
Jim couldn't hit a ping-pong ball
of the size of the moon.

148
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:39,592
Were Jim's parents first cousins
that were also bad at ping-pong?

149
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:42,161
So you're asking me to defend
your honor against Kelly?

150
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,373
Sorta, yes.

151
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,257
- Bring me players.
- Okay.

152
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:50,909
Hi, everyone, Diane Kelly.
I'm the company's chief legal counsel.

153
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:53,214
Hi.
No, no.

154
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,316
Absolutely not.
What is he doing here?

155
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,486
Are you renewing your divorce vows
before my deposition?

156
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:00,989
Michael, I'm your H.R. rep.
I'm on your side.

157
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,478
No.
I want him... gone.

158
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:05,942
- I don't talk until he leaves.
- Michael, just relax.

159
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:07,745
I think they're ready for us now.

160
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:09,664
- Okay.
- Thank you.

161
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:11,785
Mr. Scott,
do you swear to tell the truth,

162
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:14,313
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

163
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:15,523
"Yesh."

164
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,035
Mr. Scott,
can you describe the circumstances

165
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,177
of Ms. Levinson's termination?

166
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:21,945
Well, it was not just a termination.

167
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:25,430
It was a pattern of disrespect
and inappropriate behavior.

168
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:28,497
Very good.
Well put.

169
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:30,411
People underestimate Michael.

170
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:33,490
There are plenty of things
that he is well above average at.

171
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,233
Like... ice skating.
He is a very good ice skater.

172
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,322
Hey, Kevin.
Jim needs to see you.

173
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:44,824
- About what?
- He needs help

174
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,743
balancing some travel receipts.

175
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:48,726
Are you sure he wants me?

176
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:51,497
Because I have Oscar
balance my travel receipts.

177
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:53,421
Yeah, no,
he asked for you specifically.

178
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,685
He's in the conference room.

179
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:03,731
Awesome!

180
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:09,682
How long have you known the plaintiff?

181
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:11,975
I haven't actually seen it.

182
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:15,438
But I have seen <i>The Firm</i>,
and I plan on renting <i>The Pelican Brief</i>.

183
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:18,649
How long have you known Ms. Levinson?

184
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:20,068
Six years and two months.

185
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,403
And you were directly
under her the entire time?

186
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,655
- That's what she said.
- Excuse me?

187
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:26,029
That's what she said.

188
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:28,785
Ms. Levinson told you
that she was your direct superior?

189
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,624
- Why would she say that?
- Can we move on to another question?

190
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:35,872
I don't understand.
Who's on record as saying this?

191
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,600
With all due respect,
I'm the middle of a line of questioning.

192
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,890
Now, Mr. Scott,
what did you say Ms. Levinson said

193
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,510
regarding your employment status
with respect to her corporate position?

194
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:48,297
Come again? That's what she said.
I don't know what...

195
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:52,323
If I may, he was telling a joke before.
So can we move on to another question?

196
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:54,352
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

197
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,968
Can you go back to where
this digression began?

198
00:07:57,347 --> 00:08:00,656
Mr. Schneider: "And you were
directly under her the entire time?"

199
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:02,840
Mr. Scott: "That's what she said."

200
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:04,896
Well...

201
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,164
Delivery's all wrong.
She's butchering it.

202
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:19,774
Yeah, that's what I thought.

203
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:26,088
Did Ms. Levinson ever say
why she thought she was being fired?

204
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:29,021
She thought it had to do with the twins.

205
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:31,597
- That's what I call them.
- Can you be more specific?

206
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:33,044
Who are the twins?

207
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:34,703
To be delicate,

208
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,270
they hang off milady's chest.

209
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:41,923
- They... make milk.
- You don't need to go any further.

210
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,395
- Her breasts.
- Yes.

211
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:46,476
She thought it had something to do
with her recent breast surgery.

212
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:48,197
Yes, and, frankly,

213
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,809
the timing was nothing
short of predominant.

214
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:56,122
What about your romantic relationship
with Ms. Levinson?

215
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:58,661
Could that have played
a part in her termination?

216
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,171
Well, if it did,

217
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,350
then the company
is breaking its own rules.

218
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,047
Interesting.
How so?

219
00:09:05,622 --> 00:09:07,837
Because before we started dating,

220
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:11,841
we disclosed our relationship to H.R.

221
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:14,812
And I have the proof right...

222
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:15,928
here!

223
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:20,952
Okay, the company has just
a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott,

224
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:23,242
- if that's okay with you.
- I will allow it.

225
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,569
Would you mind, please, just...

226
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:27,483
taking a quick look at...

227
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:30,329
this photograph, please?

228
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:37,163
That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica.
Is that correct?

229
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:39,816
And that photograph
was taken more than two months

230
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:41,709
prior to the start of your relationship.

231
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,247
Does that sound right?

232
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:45,816
Mr. Scott, the time line here
is actually very important.

233
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,341
Please, when did
your relationship actually begin?

234
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,385
Well, depends on how you define "began."

235
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,804
If it was from the first time
we shook hands, it's like six years ago.

236
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:57,114
The first time we kissed,
it's like two years ago.

237
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:00,144
- Excuse me?
- From the first time we kissed sober,

238
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:01,687
it was four months after that.

239
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,649
- Could we take a short break?
- No.

240
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,938
Are you telling me that
your relationship began two years ago

241
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:09,904
and not in february,
as you previously testified to here?

242
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:14,140
- Line.
- I'm sorry, what?

243
00:10:14,318 --> 00:10:16,944
He asked for a line, like in a play.

244
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:23,408
"Mr. Scott, do you realize
you just contradicted yourself?"

245
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:24,647
"I did?"
"Yes."

246
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,084
"Can I go to the bathroom?"

247
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,464
"I really have to.
I've been drinking lots of water."

248
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:31,042
"You went 5 minutes ago."
"It wasn't to go to the bathroom.

249
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:33,636
"but to get out of a question."
"You've to answer it."

250
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,138
"First, can I go to the bathroom?"
"No."

251
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:42,567
Good game, Meredith.

252
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:44,730
- Don't patronize me.
- All right.

253
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,857
- What is going on here?
- Dwight!

254
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,257
Thank god you're here.

255
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:51,694
It turns out one of our biggest clients
is a ping-pong master.

256
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:54,225
And I have to play him tomorrow,
or we lose the account.

257
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:56,534
Can you help me out?
Will you help me practice?

258
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:05,459
- What the hell?
- I told you.

259
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:08,022
All of my heroes
are table tennis players.

260
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:11,735
Zoran Primorac,
Jan-Ove Waldner, Wong Tao,

261
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,336
Jorg Rosskopf,
and, of course, Ashraf Helmy.

262
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:17,125
I even have a life-size poster
of Hugo Hoyama on my wall.

263
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,873
And the first time I left Pennsylvania

264
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:22,184
was to go to the hall of fame
induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.

265
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:29,781
Jan and I had an on-again,
off-again relationship for two years.

266
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:33,040
And I know this destroys her case.

267
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,371
And I am sorry.

268
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,890
But I throw myself
at the mercy of the deposition.

269
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,703
Thank you, Mr. Scott.
That's all we needed to know.

270
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:42,588
Wait...

271
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:46,722
We'd like to enter in the record a page
from Michael Scott's personal journal.

272
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:49,673
What are you doing with my diary?

273
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,051
This is plaintiff's exhibit 107.

274
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:56,542
I quote from an entry
dated January 4 of this past year.

275
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:58,827
"Just got back from Jamaica.

276
00:11:58,987 --> 00:12:00,473
"Tan almost everywhere.

277
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,425
"Jan almost everywhere.

278
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:03,554
"Hee hee.

279
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:05,181
"Oh, diary, what a week.

280
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:07,056
"I had sex with my boss.

281
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,131
"I don't know
if it's going to go anywhere.

282
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,194
"Jan was very specific
"that this is not going anywhere.

283
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:13,944
"That it was a one-time mistake.

284
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:16,489
"But we had sex six times,
so you tell me.

285
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,279
I am definitely feeling very eerie."

286
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,951
Irie.

287
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:22,425
Irie, sorry.

288
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,186
"More tomorrow.
Xoxo, Michael."

289
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,958
It would appear
that neither you nor Ms. Levinson

290
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:30,632
considered you had a relationship

291
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,762
in any sense of the word,
is that correct?

292
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:35,195
We'll need to see a copy
of that entire journal befo...

293
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:38,078
I don't think anyone in this room
has a right to read my diary.

294
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:40,221
Basic discovery.
We've the right to review it.

295
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:43,066
Okay, let's make
ten copies of this diary.

296
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:45,521
Could you make it 11?

297
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,429
11, sure.

298
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:50,898
And we'll break for lunch
so everyone can have a look.

299
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,052
Can I sit here?

300
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,133
You know, I...

301
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,731
I know a little bit about
what you're going through, in a way.

302
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:36,773
When I was a kid,

303
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:38,683
my parents got divorced.

304
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,278
They both wanted custody.

305
00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:45,723
And they both asked me to testify
against the other one in court.

306
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:47,709
So, I don't know.

307
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,166
I didn't want them
to get divorced in the first place.

308
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:52,001
I loved them both so much.

309
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:55,134
I just wanted...

310
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:03,165
How could you give up my diary?

311
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:05,429
I had to.
I'm sorry, but I need to win this.

312
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:06,874
We need to win this.

313
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:08,368
How'd you even find it?

314
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:10,060
It's under my side of the mattress.

315
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,066
I don't like the lump.
I'm really upset.

316
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,890
All right, I stole your diary
and gave it to my lawyer.

317
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,214
You e-mailed a topless photo of me
to everyone in our company.

318
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:20,908
- Let's call it even.
- Fine. I love you.

319
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:22,497
I love you too.

320
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:25,159
Mr. Scott, who is this other woman...

321
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:27,760
Ryan, who you refer to here

322
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,319
as "just as hot as Jan,
but in a different way."

323
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:34,210
Not a woman, just a cool,
great-looking best friend.

324
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,376
We're trying to determine
whether Michael and Jan

325
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:40,326
were engaged in a romantic affair.
Not Michael and this Ryan person.

326
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,551
- Excuse me.
- All right.

327
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:44,291
This is the way I see it.

328
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,138
Yes, I had sex with Jan.

329
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:49,539
And, yes, I did consider Jan
to be my girlfriend.

330
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:52,770
However, Jan clearly did not consider me

331
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,104
to be her boyfriend.

332
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:58,651
- So her actions're completely rightful.
- Okay, Mr. Scott.

333
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:02,181
It's admirable,
the way you defend a woman

334
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:05,844
who is so obviously ambivalent
about her relationship with you.

335
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:07,829
Thank you.
You didn't have to say that.

336
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:11,437
Considering she consistently gave you
such poor performance reviews.

337
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:13,749
That was before our relationship.

338
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:16,011
She was going through a divorce.

339
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:18,380
And she was drinking a lot.

340
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:19,547
Okay.

341
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:21,121
Of water.

342
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,217
Mr. Scott, this is a...

343
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:27,025
copy of a particularly
negative performance review.

344
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,465
Would you mind...
reading the date on that, please?

345
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:34,979
March 17th.

346
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,318
And that would be a month after
your relationship became official.

347
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:39,838
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

348
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:43,237
You may read the highlighted portion
out loud, if you want to.

349
00:15:47,552 --> 00:15:49,037
"I'm out of carrots.

350
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,727
"I'm out of sticks.

351
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:53,351
"Mr. Scott has time and again
proven himself

352
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:56,248
"to be an unmanageable employee

353
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,167
"and a poor branch manager.

354
00:15:58,327 --> 00:16:00,737
"I recommend he
be removed from that position

355
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:03,436
and reassigned to sales,
where he belongs."

356
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:05,718
After hearing that,
wouldn't you say

357
00:16:05,878 --> 00:16:09,219
that Ms. Levinson's judgment
is at least...

358
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:11,046
very seriously flawed?

359
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:15,777
Mr. Scott?

360
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:24,153
How's it going?

361
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,155
Well, he has gone

362
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:28,991
from completely hopeless
to simply miserable.

363
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:31,327
Check this out, though.
Spin serve.

364
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:36,384
Wow, it works, like,
80% of the time, so...

365
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:37,544
Nice.

366
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:40,169
So should I schedule
the rematch with Darryl now?

367
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,545
I'm ready.

368
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,189
I'll make the call.

369
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:47,509
Wait a minute.
Darryl is the client?

370
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:50,934
Oh, no, no.

371
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:53,378
He works here, dumb-ass.

372
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:55,684
Right.

373
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,309
Spin serve.

374
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:05,230
How could you do that to me?

375
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:08,524
You can respond, but remember,
it's going into the record.

376
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:11,791
Michael, I'm not the enemy, okay?
Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.

377
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:13,301
Dunder Mifflin...

378
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,558
has always treated me
with the utmost respect...

379
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:18,037
with loyalty.

380
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,955
They were going to give me your job,
and I should have taken it.

381
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:23,852
Wait...
Before you go any further,

382
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:26,666
let me show you
what kind of loyalty they have, okay?

383
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:29,593
Lester, please read that part
of Wallace's deposition.

384
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:32,179
Starting at paragraph six.

385
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:35,220
Counsel:
"Mr. Wallace, regarding Michael Scott,

386
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,476
"was he a contender
to replace Jan levinson?"

387
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:39,019
David Wallace: "Yes."

388
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,719
See?

389
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,773
I was number one contender.

390
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:44,483
I was being groomed.

391
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:46,505
Counsel: "Was he your first choice?"

392
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:49,188
David Wallace:
"Michael Scott is a fine employee

393
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,446
"who has been with the company
many years."

394
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:54,576
Counsel:
"Was he in the top five of contenders?"

395
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,765
David Wallace:
"What do you want me to say?

396
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:58,288
"Come on.
He's a nice guy.

397
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:00,105
"I considered many people."

398
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:03,945
Counsel: "Was he being seriously
considered for the corporate job?"

399
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:05,713
David Wallace: "No."

400
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:13,529
I have one more question, Mr. Scott.

401
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:15,973
Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson

402
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:20,477
that the company exhibits a pattern
of disrespect toward its employees?

403
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:27,833
Absolutely not.

404
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,748
Yes! Way to go.
See that?

405
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:43,459
Yeah, the floppy-haired girl
you date won a point.

406
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,668
19, serving 4.

407
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,465
Nice, baby!

408
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:53,800
Nice one!

409
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,869
 Hey, hey, you, you 
 I don't like your boyfriend 

410
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:59,313
 'Cause, 'cause 
 'cause he sucks at ping-pong 

411
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,602
I'm sick of this!
Let's go, you and me!

412
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,438
- What?
- Let's go. Pick up a paddle.

413
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:06,648
- Okay. Bring it on.
- I am.

414
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,060
- Think you can handle this?
- In my sleep.

415
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,361
Okay.
Volley for serve. P.

416
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:12,717
O.

417
00:19:15,673 --> 00:19:16,674
P.

418
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,033
O.

419
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,258
Do you wanna go play
on the table upstairs?

420
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:22,667
Yes.

421
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
Michael...

422
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:35,333
I'm very sorry.

423
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,011
No biggie.
Just...

424
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:39,556
No. No, no, no.
Hey, this was rough.

425
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:42,165
We never meant for you
to get caught in the middle of this.

426
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:43,435
I'm very sorry.

427
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,663
Hey, David...

428
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:55,906
Yeah?

429
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:57,741
I think you're a nice guy too.

430
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,021
Thanks, Michael.

431
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:02,726
Why did I do it?
I don't know.

432
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,608
Jan said that...
it was because of the photo...

433
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,169
that she revealed the diary.

434
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:12,376
But she already brought
the diary with her to New York.

435
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:13,591
So...

436
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,046
You expect to get screwed
by your company.

437
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:20,317
But you never expect
to get screwed by your girlfriend.

438
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:28,662
What do you wanna do for dinner?

439
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:31,272
How 'bout chinese?

440
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:33,840
We should really try to save some money.

441
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:35,908
Get something cheap.

442
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,860
That was my cheap suggestion.

443
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:41,993
Chinese was my cheap suggestion.

444
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:43,512
Wanna do fast food?

445
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:45,826
Fine.
Fast food's fine.
