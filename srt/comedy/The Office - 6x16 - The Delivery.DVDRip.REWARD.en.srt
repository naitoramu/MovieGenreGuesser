Hello, Vancouver,
this is Michael Scott

calling from
the United States of America.

5
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,701
I have a reservation
in your fair city

00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,245

your information here.</i>

to have it, sir.</i>

12

What?

13
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,653
I'm not seeing anything
under confirmation...

14
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,782
No. No. Could it be under "affirmation?"

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,883
'Cause you have
thousands of those.

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,791
We're just trying to
look it up right now.

17
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,023
You did get the

Well, I have been booked for three
years, so you should have that.

23
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,233
I have always heard that British
Columbia is a very nice place,

from this conversation.

Pleasure to meet you,

Uh, that's Mrs. Bennett,
sweetheart.

My husband and I are divorced
but I kept the "missus"

50
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,858

(ALL LAUGHING) Well, let's
take a gander around this place.

They sure do.

You should take that

Oh, I do.

Do you always stay seated

I am treating you
the same as a man,

for whom I would
also not stand.

61
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,217
Unless it was the
president, or Judge Judy.

I like that.

GABE: This is Accounting.
JO: Uh-huh.

64
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,781
Hi.

65
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,950
Good-looking group.

Over here is Meredith
Palmer, Creed Bratton.

Who's this tall
drink of sun tea?

69
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,157
That is Jim Halpert. He is the
co-regional manager of this office.

70
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,759
I thought this guy
was the manager.

71
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,738
Oh, he is. He's the co-manager.
That's the other co-manager.

72
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,398
Two guys doing one job?

73
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,472
We gotta do something
about that. (CHUCKLING)

74
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,872
I've got some
Valentine's cards

What? No candy?

00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,617
ANDY: Valentine's Day.
Right around the corner.

79
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,557
Erin and I have been
on zero dates.

80
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,457
So I got her a
Valentine's Day card,

81
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,655
<i>but I didn't want
to seem too eager,</i>

82
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,721
<i>so I got cards for
everyone in the whole office</i>

83
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,767
<i>to kind of dilute
it a little bit.</i>

00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,927
Look alive.
(EXCLAIMS)

85
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,164
Jeez, you gave me
a paper cut on my throat.

86
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,271
Yeah, I have this thing
about men cutting

87
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,275
or threatening
to cut my throat.

88
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,208
Don't try to
cut my throat.

89
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,770
Jo, I don't know how things work in
Florida, which from your description

90
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,908
sounds like a colorful,
lawless swamp,

91
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,952
but here it takes
two men to do one job,

92
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,050
where in Florida,
it might take

93
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,285
one very strong
woman to do such a job.

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,725
Whoa. Whoa.

95
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:52,260
I'll take over. Um,
what we're doing here,

96
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,664
Michael handles more of
the big picture stuff,

97
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,134
and I handle more of
the day-to-day stuff.

98
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,500
Yeah.
JIM: So, together...

99
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,266
I think I understand.
All right.

100
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,331
Each of you is
doing half a job.

101
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,000
No. (CHUCKLES) And sometimes
I can hardly handle that.

102
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,203
(JO CHUCKLING)

103
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,179
Now this is knucklehead talk. I'm
not going to abide it, you know.

104
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,706
You can't give me gravy and tell me
it's jelly, 'cause gravy ain't sweet.

105
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,479
Is it, Jim? (SOFTLY) I don't think so.

106
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,645
Michael?

107
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,779
Forget the question.

108
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,254
I think one of you
should return to Sales,

109
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,349
and the other one
will be a manager.

110
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,452
I humbly accept
the management position.

111
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,621
Why would you just
automatically get it?

112
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,690
Because, well, Jim, where I'm
from, there are two types of folk,

113
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,568
those who ain't and those who
are knee-high on a grasshopper.

114
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:36,473
Which type ain't you ain't?
Y'all come back now.

115
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,244
Do you even know what that means? Yes.

116
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,474
Well, I'm gonna let this
marinate. So you can go.

117

Um...

118
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,446
You can go on.
Yeah.

I mean, what's going on now? I
mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin?

156
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,469
Right? I mean, Sabre?
What's that?

157
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,932
Some company we never heard
of from down in Tallahassee?

158
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,638
I mean, where is that?
Near Mars?

159
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,510
No, we know. Texas.

160
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,440
Now, Dunder Mifflin
has an arm's reach

161
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,112
into all these small businesses
all over the northeast,

162
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,687
and now we're gonna
take that arm

163
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:35,391
and we're going to
start selling printers.

164
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,894
I could manage my
way around that.

165
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,794
They're the easiest-to-use
printers in the market.

166
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,356
I will try to
manage my excitement.

167
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,465
I have been saying
the word "manager" a lot,

168
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,632
so whenever Jo thinks
manager, she thinks of me.

169
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,211
Camel cigarettes did the
same thing with Joe Camel

170
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,178
by making him
look like a penis.

171
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,011
I can't even go
near a cigarette now

172
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,574
without thinking of
a penis, and vice versa.

173
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,346
I think that's it.
So we're all good.

174
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,219
Okay.
Thanks, y'all.

175
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,763
Oh, my God.

176
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,963
I guess Andy likes me. I never
thought of him in that way.

177
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,968
But I guess in most
romantic comedies,

178
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,529
the guy you're supposed
to be with is the one

179
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,302
that you never
thought of in that way.

180
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:27,176
You might have even thought he was
annoying or possibly homosexual.

181
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,846
So check this out.

182
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,349
According to the handbook,
you could make more money

183
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,009
as a salesman
than as a manager.

184
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,144
They have all these
incentive programs.

185
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,779
I ran your numbers
from last year.

186
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,687
This is way more
than I make now.

187
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,919
I don't think I'm gonna
miss being manager.

188
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,790
You know how some people say
they're not in it for the money?

189
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,727
Well, with all due
respect to this job,

190
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,958
I think I'm definitely
in it for the money.

191
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,898
And, quite honestly,
the women.

192
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,301
Hey. Got a second?

193
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,462
Sure.
All right.

194
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,336
You here to tell me that you
think I would be a better manager,

195
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,933
and that you are sorry
for being such a jerk?

196
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,534
Actually, yeah.

197
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,544
What?
Exactly that.

198
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:07,018
I think that you absolutely deserve
the manager position more than I do.

199
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,588
What? Really?
Yeah.

200
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,224
(LAUGHING) Wow! Wow!

201
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,919
(VOCALIZING)

202
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,791
Hello, Oscar.

203
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,057
Michael, reading.

204
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,154
What are you reading?

205
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,256
<i>The Atlantic.</i>

206
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,528
Oh, that is my favorite
ocean. I love it.

207
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,663
I'm so happy right now. No, I
can't keep it a secret any longer.

208
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,270
Jim's stepping
down to salesman.

209
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,605
I am going to be the
sole manager once again.

210
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,644
(SIGHS) I should step
into Sales myself.

211
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,078
Why? Is there an
untapped gay market?

212
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,743
Sabre has no caps
on commissions.

213
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,944
He can make a lot
more money in Sales.

214
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,115
(SIGHING)

215
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,649
(CLICKS TONGUE)

216
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,720
Where did you get
that information?

217
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,192
Manual.
Manuel who?

218
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,797
Mmm-hmm. Well, according to the manual,

219
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,095
there is no cap
on commissions.

220
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,930
I have been hustled.

221
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,469
(SOFTLY) Son of a bitch.

222
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,405
JIM: This is...
Pardon me.

223
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,170
Speak of the devil. We
were just talking about you.

224
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,676
Have a seat.
Okay.

225
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,805
Now, Jim here is thinking
about taking himself

226
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,542
out of the running
for being manager. Yep.

227
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:14,677
Oh, really? (EXCLAIMS)
That is so sweet of you!

228
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:19,322
But I cannot accept, because
I have been thinking about it,

229
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,783
and I think I want
to go back to Sales.

230
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,089
Really?
JIM: Really?

231
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,993
Yeah, you can take the man
out of the salesman,

232
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,259
but you can't take
the sales out of salesman.

233
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,028
Well, I think you're both
being a little too modest.

234
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,867
No, I really, really think
Michael is better at being manager

235
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,429
for so many reasons.
Mmm-mmm.

236
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:39,638
No. I think I would be bad.
I would sleep in my office...

237
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,737
JO: Okay. ...and I would
sexually harass people.

238
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,714
Why would you do that? I'm
turning myself in right now.

239
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,980
You know, Michael, you have more
experience in sales and management,

240
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,748
so I'm going to defer
to your judgment.

241
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,845
Thank you.

242
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,413
I think you will
become the salesman,

243
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,686
and congratulations,

244
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,285
you're gonna be the new
manager of this branch.

245
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,027
That's great.
Congratulations.

246
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,300
Have fun signing my
commission checks, boss.

he's been promoted to sole manager.

00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:26,255
We have got to step this up. Meet
me behind the dumpster in 90 seconds.

You're 20 minutes late.

00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,198
Um, I was
at another dumpster.

255
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,767
Just admit you lost
track of time. (SIGHS)

<i>DWIGHT: Ryan and I have been meeting up
to work on our diabolical plot against Jim.</i>

Ryan is always late
for our meetings.

258
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,773
I wish I had a lair.

<i>Did you see Saw?</i>

260
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,707
Of course I seesaw. Mose
and I seesaw all the time.

261
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,581
<i>No, the movie. Did
you see the movie Saw?</i>

262
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,650
Oh. Yeah. Great film. Almost
as fun as going on a seesaw.

263
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,624
Okay. The reason these movies
are so popular... Mmm-hmm.

264
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,456
...is the element of
psychological torment.

265
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,756
I like where you're
going with this. Continue.

266
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,935
Could we lure him into an
old warehouse or something?

267
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,731
I have an old barn.
It's kind of smelly. Yes.

268
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,635
But that might be a
plus. And then what? Okay.

269
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,799
<i>We do what they
did in Saw.</i>

I mean, we don't
kill him, obviously.

I have ever heard in my life.

Well, suggest something
else then. Don't just...

to cut his leg off?

something then.

toys are gonna fit on your new desk.

How is that possible?

Nick.

I think he's the key. He's very
trusting. He's looking for friends.

295
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,838
He's been given an
awesome amount of power,

296
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,675
and does not know
how to wield it.

Well, I think he can be
corrupted. Like Gollum.

Smeagol was corrupted
and became Gollum.

always have me bring them in at 2:30

00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,805
and say, "Who's hungry?"

Thank you, though.

It's a thinking technique.
All the top executives do it.

It keeps the brain moving, and a

went by there the other day,

317

in. Not really my cup of tea.

00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:26,983
Yep.

464
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:31,692
Well, well, well.
Hmm. Boss for...

465
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,287
What was it? Oh.

466
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,630
Four-and-a-half hours.
New record. Low.

467
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,736
Previous record,
Henry Rostin.

468
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,535
Boss for nine years,
four months.

469
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,076
And he only left because he
had family matters to attend to,

470
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,701
and he... What?

471
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,602
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

472
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,779
DWIGHT: Michael!

473
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,717
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

474
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,621
I can't help but think that
something we did made this possible.

475
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:04,151
Jim dug his own grave, but
maybe we provided the shovel.

476
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:08,763
(EXCLAIMS) Temp, I like that. I'm
gonna engrave that into a piece of wood.

477
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,568
Care to celebrate
with a drink?

478
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,035
I would love to.

479
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,196
(CHUCKLING)

480
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:16,865
Why not?

481
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,773
Because martini bars
are pretentious.

482
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,334
No, thank you. I'm
sorry that I don't want

483
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,879
farm-boy swill
like you do, you know?

484
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,847
It is not farm-boy swill.
I will show you.

485
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,974
It is beet vodka
and it is delicious.

486
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,713
I'm not interested in
anything I have to make myself.

9999
