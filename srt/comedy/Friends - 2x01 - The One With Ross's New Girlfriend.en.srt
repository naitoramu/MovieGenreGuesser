I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:05,297
This is pretty much
what's happened so far.

4
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,341
<i>Ross was in love</i>
<i>with Rachel since forever.</i>

5
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,553
<i>Every time he tried to tell her,</i>
<i>something got in the way...</i>

6
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,638
<i>... like cats, Italian guys.</i>

7
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,975
<i>And finally, Chandler was,</i>
<i>like, "Forget about her".</i>

8
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:21,814
<i>When Ross was in China, Chandler</i>
<i>let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.</i>

9
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,857
<i>She was, like, "Oh, my God!"</i>

10
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,860
<i>So she went to the airport to meet him.</i>

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,906
<i>She didn't know Ross was getting</i>
<i>off the plane with another woman.</i>

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,618
That's pretty much everything
you need to know.

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,079
But enough about us.
How have you been?

17
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,095
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,763
Oh, my God!

19
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:37,806
Excuse me.

20
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,600
Move, move, move!
Emergency, please!

21
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,812
Excuse me, excuse me.

22
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,072
There you are!

23
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,909
So, so...

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,413
How was China? You!

25
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,582
It was great.

26
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,750
What happened?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,418
- You're bleeding.
- I am?

28
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,545
Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.

29
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,256
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

30
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:16,470
Come on, I wanna hear everything!
Everything!

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,223
Well, where do I start?

32
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:23,936
This is Julie.
Julie, this is Rachel.

33
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,398
These are...

34
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,692
These are...

35
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,653
...aren't for you.

36
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,446
These are for you.

37
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,950
Welcome to our country.

38
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:44,289
Thank you. I'm from New York.

39
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:49,336
No problem. We'll use them
to stop the bleeding.

40
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,423
Baggage claim?

41
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:03,350
She went to the airport, and
she's gonna go for it with Ross.

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,646
Oh, my God! This is huge!

43
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,065
This is bigger than huge.
This is...

44
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,110
All right, what's bigger than huge?

45
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,906
This?

46
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,407
Guys, you got new haircuts!

47
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:22,536
Yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

48
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:26,498
Because, you know, "If you don't
look good, we don't look good."

49
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,042
I love that voice!

50
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,670
You guys!

51
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,715
Airport. Airport. Ross.

52
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:35,966
Not alone.

53
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,592
Julie.

54
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,928
Arm around her!

55
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,015
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

56
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,768
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

57
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,479
Quick, get the verbs.

58
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,439
You! You!

59
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,649
You said he liked me!

60
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,776
You!

61
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,445
You slowpokes!

62
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,824
That's all right.
We got the bags.

63
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,079
This is my sister, Monica.

64
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,622
This is Chandler.

65
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,956
Phoebe, hi.

66
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,376
Joey.

67
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,711
Everyone, this is Julie.

68
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,338
Julie.

69
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,096
But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

70
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:26,183
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

71
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,602
- And bus.
- Oh, my God!

72
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,979
- With the screaming guy...
- And the spitting.

73
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,732
You gotta hear this story.

74
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,317
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

75
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,818
Two hundred, at least.

76
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,531
And the chicken poops in her lap!

77
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,913
I'm so sorry.

78
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,207
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

79
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,793
I just heard this story in the cab...

80
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:58,257
...and it is all I can think about.

81
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,052
This is amazing.

82
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,178
How did this happen?

83
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,055
We were in grad school together.

84
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,558
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

85
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,644
...guess who's in charge of the dig?

86
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,563
Julie!

87
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,441
Isn't that great?

88
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:21,780
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

89
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,908
It's an expression.

90
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,495
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

91
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,413
- Then we'll see the baby.
- Then get some sleep.

92
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,541
It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

93
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:37,671
Don't tell us what's gonna happen.
I like being surprised.

94
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,843
Bye!

95
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,065
- Can I get some coffee?
- Sure.

96
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,942
- Did you talk to him yet?
- No.

97
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,070
Then, no.

98
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,583
What the hell happened to you in China?

99
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,211
When last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

100
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,588
I know I was.

101
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,883
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

102
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:27,804
"It's never gonna happen. Move on."
You know whose voice that was?

103
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,099
God?

104
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,601
It was you, pal.

105
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:36,229
Maybe it was God doing me.

106
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:40,609
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

107
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,903
And then I met Julie...

108
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,030
...and we're having a great time.

109
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,826
I never would have gone for it,
if it hadn't been for you.

110
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,830
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

111
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,124
Your lemonade.

112
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,002
I didn't order it.

113
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,380
Then go take that back.
They'll charge you for that.

114
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,592
Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

115
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,846
So what did you find out?

116
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,431
He said...

117
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,684
He said...

118
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,604
They're having a great time.

119
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,149
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,068
But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

121
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,404
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

122
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,325
...without any outside help whatsoever.

123
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,828
How is that a silver lining?

124
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:37,291
You have to really wanna see it.

125
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,090
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

126
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,842
Hey, Pheebs.

127
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,429
You know what I'm thinking?

128
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,350
How...

129
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,187
...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

130
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,982
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

131
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:07,112
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

132
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,822
So what were you thinking?

133
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:14,035
You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you'd like to do mine.

134
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,371
No.

135
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,456
Why not?

136
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,458
Because I'm just...

137
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,086
I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

138
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,797
No, you're not.

139
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,216
I know I'm not, but you are.

140
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:31,512
I was trying to spare your feelings.

141
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,348
Hold on.

142
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,684
Ross, Julie for you.

143
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,775
Anybody know a good tailor?

144
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,443
You need clothes altered?

145
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,655
No, I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

146
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,951
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

147
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,078
He did my first suit when I was 15.

148
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,664
No, wait, 16.

149
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:03,377
No, excuse me, 15.

150
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:07,381
All right, when was 1990?

151
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,636
You have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance!

152
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,479
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

153
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,440
Okay, bye.

154
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:30,112
That is so sweet.

155
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,200
Okay. No, you hang up.

156
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,202
No, you...

157
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:41,790
One, two, three.

158
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,001
You didn't hang up either.

159
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,629
She didn't hang up.

160
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,760
No, you hang up.

161
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,805
You. You.

162
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,275
Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

163
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,277
Rachel.

164
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,905
I'll just call her back.

165
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,117
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

166
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,660
No, you hang up.

167
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,329
How did this happen to me?

168
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,415
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

169
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,293
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

170
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:30,505
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

171
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:34,927
...this really great guy
that I can't have.

172
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,554
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

173
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,223
I know you did.

174
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,978
I'm just gonna deal with it.

175
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:50,609
I gotta get out of here!

176
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:56,657
I don't care what you guys say,
something's bothering her.

177
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,789
You know, I think I was 16.

178
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,043
Please, just a little bit off the back.

179
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,129
I'm still on "no".

180
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,924
Morning.

181
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,093
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

182
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:21,056
No, no, no. I'm not
falling for that again.

183
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:22,641
What's going on?

184
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,060
I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

185
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,647
What stupid thing did you do?

186
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,159
Why don't you just go get dressed...

187
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:44,455
...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.

188
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,415
How did this happen?

189
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,750
I kind of ran into him last night.

190
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,211
- Where?
- At his apartment.

191
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,462
Is this juice?

192
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,425
And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

193
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:00,345
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

194
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,099
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

195
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,642
People do stupid things
when they're upset.

196
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:10,523
My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't...

197
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,154
But this is about your horrible mistake.

198
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:21,450
Sorry we're late.

199
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,951
We were...

200
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,747
Well, there was touching.

201
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,378
Hey, Ross!

202
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,257
What a...

203
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,467
What are you doing here?

204
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,220
I do Raquel!

205
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,685
So he's back?

206
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,480
Yeah, he's back.
Is that a problem?

207
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,523
No, not a problem.

208
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,110
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

209
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,739
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

210
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,037
Despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

211
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,789
...my pants need to be altered.

212
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,584
When you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

213
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,963
He'll know what it means.

214
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:20,092
You sure he'll crack that code?

215
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:25,306
It's funny. The last time Paolo
was here, my hair was so much cuter.

216
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,683
All right.

217
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:32,271
But you have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

218
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,691
...and all Monica about it.

219
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:36,984
I promise.

220
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,736
All right, let's see.

221
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:44,158
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

222
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:48,120
But I promise, none of you
will feel a thing.

223
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,760
- That's it. I quit.
- What? I didn't say anything!

224
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,515
But this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

225
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,725
This is the face of
a person who, you know...

226
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,854
...doesn't trust a person.

227
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,731
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

228
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:19,568
It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

229
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,280
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

230
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,701
This is how he wears it.

231
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,286
How who wears it?

232
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,747
Demi Moore.

233
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,749
Demi Moore is not a "he".

234
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,212
Well, he was a "he"
in "Arthur" and in "10".

235
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,339
That's Dudley Moore!

236
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,843
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

237
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,971
Oh, my God!

238
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,306
Oh, God!

239
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,850
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

240
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,476
Which one is Demi Moore?

241
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:58,482
She's the actress that was in
<i>Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!</i>

242
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,275
She's got gorgeous hair.

243
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,154
I know!

244
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,328
How long do you want the cuffs?

245
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,707
At least as long as I have the pants.

246
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,296
I just got that.

247
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:27,344
Now we'll do your inseam.

248
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,733
How is she?

249
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,903
It's too soon to tell.

250
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,739
She's resting, which is a good sign.

251
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,200
How's the hair?

252
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:54,037
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It doesn't look good.

253
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:59,209
I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

254
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,919
Can we see her?

255
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,423
Your hair looks too good.
It'd upset her.

256
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,426
Ross, you come on in.

257
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,141
Well, how you doing?

258
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,226
I'm okay.

259
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,979
That bad, huh?

260
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,524
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

261
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,860
It's one of my gifts.

262
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:33,368
Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

263
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:36,747
...I really thought
I just hit rock bottom.

264
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,375
But today, it's like
there's rock bottom...

265
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,545
...50 feet of crap...

266
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,297
...then me.

267
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,132
Tell Ross how you feel.

268
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,385
Come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

269
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:53,597
What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

270
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,559
Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

271
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,395
I don't know. I don't know.

272
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,357
I've been with my share of women.

273
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,236
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

274
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,196
But the point is...

275
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:14,952
...I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

276
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,496
Really?

277
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:26,922
Yo, paisan!

278
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,635
Can I talk to you for a sec?

279
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,055
Your tailor...

280
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:39,184
...is a very bad man!

281
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,270
What are you talking about?

282
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,982
Hey, what's going on?

283
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:51,238
Joey's tailor...

284
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:56,660
...took advantage of me.

285
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,747
No way! I've been going
to the guy for 12 years.

286
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,042
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

287
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,962
Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite...

288
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,880
What?

289
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:12,301
Cupping.

290
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,932
That's how they do pants!

291
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,475
First they go up one side,
they move it over.

292
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:26,315
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

293
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,569
Ross, tell him. Isn't that
how a tailor measures pants?

294
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,448
Yes, yes, it is.
In prison!

295
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,039
What's the matter with you?

296
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,833
What?

297
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,254
That's not?

298
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,054
Oh, my God!

299
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,106
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

300
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,692
I like it.

301
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:12,945
I do. I think it's a 10!

302
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:15,989
Thank you.

303
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,742
My hair is very amused.

304
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,785
Come on, things could be worse.

305
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:25,791
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

306
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,628
I know it's crazy, but it's true."

307
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,464
Thank you.

308
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,925
Well, I gotta go. Bye.

309
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,259
Bye, Rach!

310
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,053
Wait, are you leaving?

311
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,806
That's what I meant by "bye".

312
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:44,643
Can I talk to you for a sec?

313
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:50,566
When the doctor does
that hernia test...

314
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,902
That's okay.

315
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,282
What's going on?

316
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:02,161
Well, okay, first of all...

317
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:05,080
...Paolo and I are not back together.

318
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,332
That was a stupid thing I did.

319
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,628
If I could go back in time
and do it again...

320
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:14,423
...well, I wouldn't.

321
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,885
Second of all...

322
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,638
What?

323
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:25,935
Is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy...

324
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,561
...I tell you what I think...

325
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,272
...and the next day
you get back together with him...

326
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:34,317
...and I look like
a complete idiot?

327
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,238
Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

328
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:43,034
I hate him. I mean, I actually...
I physically hate him.

329
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,453
I always have.

330
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:49,291
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

331
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,959
Really?

332
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,004
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

333
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,173
...and who gets how funny...

334
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,926
...and sweet and amazing...

335
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,179
...and adorable and sexy you are.

336
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:06,058
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

337
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:09,853
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"

338
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,064
You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

339
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,902
Like the way I do with Julie.

340
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:25,118
Was there a "second of all"?

341
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:33,961
No, I think that was the whole "all".

342
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,297
I gotta go.

343
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,467
Thanks.

344
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,392
No, I swear to God, Dad!

345
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:52,271
That's not how they measure pants!

346
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:02,030
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

347
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,658
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Really?

348
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,245
- You wanna do it now?
- Great!

349
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,373
See you.

350
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:14,292
I just wanna make
really sure this time.

351
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:19,757
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
"Four Weddings and a Funeral", right?

352
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,551
No.

353
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:27,473
