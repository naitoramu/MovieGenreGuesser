Did you just invite me
to a party that's at my own house?

Of course not.
I'm inviting you to the VIP section.

So you'll have someone to talk to.

00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,458
What the slut?

331
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,333
[loud thump]

332
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,958
Oh, hi.

333
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,375
Hi. Hello. Hi.

334
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,666
Excuse me. Um, I'm not sure what happened,

335
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,166
but I think there's been a mistake,
and I've been put in the wrong room

336
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,166
'cause there's a bunch of birthday cards
for, like, a really old person.

337
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,708
And the TV's flat,
like the back of it is missing,

338
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,166
and I really need to see
who's number one on <i>TRL.</i>

339
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,250
Dr. Johnson to the third floor.
The cheerleader just woke up.

340
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,583
Oh, I don't mean to be a bitch,
but "cheer captain."

341
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,166
Cheer captain.

342
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,333
And do you have any Von Dutch jeans?
'Cause this is, like, really unflattering.

343
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,416
Oh crap.

344
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,125
What are you staring at?

345
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,958
Hello? It's very rude to be a stare bear.

346
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,208
[tense music plays]

347
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,333
Hello? Are you-- Stop… stop doing that!

348
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,250
Why are you doing that, you freaky old--

349
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,375
[tense music plays]

350
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,291
-[loud thump]
-[gasps]

351
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,416
And the cheerleader's back down.

352
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,125
Oh, cheer captain. Are you okay?

353
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,583
[finger taps]

354
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,750
This defies scientific explanation.

355
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,916
Being this hot?

356
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,666
No.

357
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,916
[sighs] Stephanie, it's 2022.

358
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,375
No way. [laughs]

359
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,500
Mm-hmm.

360
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,750
Are you sure I haven't been
Freaky Friday'd into some old lady's body?

361
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,541
You've been in a coma
for almost two decades.

362
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,583
That doesn't sound right.

363
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,916
I know this is a lot to process,
but we'll just take this nice and slow.

364
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,125
-[dad] Stephie?
-[woman] Stephanie!

365
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,291
-Oh my God.
-[woman] Stephanie!

366
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,875
Stephie, I can't believe this!
It's me. It's Dad!

367
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:10,833
[dad and woman laugh]

368
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,208
[woman squeals] Oh my God!

369
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,666
-Dad?
-Yeah!

370
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,333
How about me? Do you remember?
It's Martha, Martha Riser. [chuckles]

371
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,166
[dad] I never thought
I'd have this moment again.

372
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,250
I was this close to freezing you.

373
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,208
What do you mean, Dad?

374
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,333
Don't worry. I couldn't afford it.
I was only gonna freeze your head.

375
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,541
-[Martha] No!
-[doctor] We'll have to be gentle.

376
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,000
Physically she's aged,
but mentally she's still 17.

377
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,625
Of course. Yes, I see
how we came in a little hot.

378
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,541
[dad] Yeah.

379
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,500
Martha, you look like
an<i> Ally McBeal </i>character.

380
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,250
Oh my God. Thank you.

381
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, the good news is
nothing abnormal came up in her tests.

382
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,708
Stephanie, your physical
and mental resilience are remarkable.

383
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,958
Uh, let… let's go home.

384
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,125
[Martha laughs]

385
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,875
[upbeat music plays]

386
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,166
Marth, oh my God, what is that, a tiny TV?

387
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,250
[laughs] No. No, Steph,
this is my cell phone.

388
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,875
Oh my God. Whoa! Really?

389
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,125
-That is very cool.
-[laughs]

390
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,625
I always knew you'd be some high-powered,
<i>Sex and the City</i> businesswoman.

391
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,625
-Total Miranda, right, Dad?
-Oh…

392
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,541
[dad chuckles]

393
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,250
I'm actually
a high school principal at Harding.

394
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:21,416
[laughs] Oh my God, you still got
a good sense of humor.

395
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,750
[laughs]

396
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:32,291
That's… I mean, that's actually
a very cool and important job.

397
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,000
-So, whoo!
-[Martha] Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

398
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,041
Um, and they give you
a fancy cell phone for that?

399
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, they're common now. Even I have one.

400
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:40,916
Oh. Okay. [chuckles]

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,208
They do much more than just call people.
You could also watch the news.

402
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,875
Look, here's a news story
about you right now.

403
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,791
-What? No. Oh, about me? No, oh my God.
-Yeah, it's you!

404
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay, wait, show me.

405
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:56,416
[man] <i>Video edits of her infamous accident</i>
<i>went immediately viral on Instagram…</i>

406
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,041
Oh my God.
I went down like a bag of dicks.

407
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,875
Oh.

408
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,458
-Stephie!
-Wait. What does "viral" mean?

409
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,875
Well, "viral" just means everybody saw it.

410
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,583
Everybody's seen that?
I look retarded in those videos.

411
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,666
Now, Steph,
you… you cannot say the R-word anymore.

412
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,375
-What? Really? Why?
-[Martha] Mm-mm.

413
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,291
Because it's offensive
to people with intellectual disabilities.

414
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,958
But what if something
really is, like, "R-word,"

415
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,666
um, what do you call it?
Like, "super gay"?

416
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,458
No, no. You can't call things "gay"
anymore, either,

417
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,958
unless you use it
as a neutral-positive term

418
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,625
to refer to somebody
who identifies as homosexual.

419
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,500
-So you cannot say the "R-word."
-[Martha] Right.

420
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,541
And, um…

421
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,958
[moans] Sorry. Coma brain.

422
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,083
-What was the other word you can't say?
-"Gay."

423
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,291
Ha! Made you say it.

424
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,541
-[laughing]
-[sighs exasperatedly]

425
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,041
-Stephie.
-I-- That's…

426
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,791
-Still got it, Dad.
-You do.

427
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,416
Dad, um, can you take a left up here?

428
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,625
-Oh.
-To see--

429
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,291
No, no, no. No, um,
actually, you should get home and rest.

430
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,833
Rest? I've been asleep for 20 years.

431
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,458
-Dad, just take this left here.
-Jim, don't take the left.

432
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,083
Is there-- I don't understand…

433
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,291
-Indicator. Indicate left.
-Do not. Do not.

434
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,750
-[Steph] Thank God, it's still the same.
-Yep. There it is. Let's keep going.

435
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,916
[Steph] That's not Deanna Russo's husband.

436
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,375
-Who is that?
-[Martha] Um…

437
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,541
Oh my God.
I know that ass anywhere. That's Blaine.

438
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:20,916
Wait. Did he get me my dream house?
Stop the car! Why didn't you say anything?

439
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,916
-Don't stop the car.
-What are you talking about? Stop the car!

440
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,916
Don't stop the car.
No. He's probably sleeping.

441
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,125
-He walked into the house.
-You don't wanna wake him.

442
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,291
He looked tired!

443
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,041
-I don't know what to do. Ah!
-Just stop the car!

444
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,333
-[screams]
-[Martha] No!

445
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,625
[Steph grunts]

446
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,416
[panting]

447
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,083
Oh. You know what?

448
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,666
Someone from the shelter
already came by yesterday

449
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,208
to pick up our donations, so…
Thank you though.

450
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,291
Tiffany?

451
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,041
Shut up!

452
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,083
Stephanie?

453
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,916
-Oh my God, look at you!
-[groans]

454
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,666
-I can't believe this.
-What is happening?

455
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,208
I have so many things I… I want to say.

456
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,916
I've always felt terrible
about what happened.

457
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,500
I can't believe
you didn't land that stunt.

458
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:24,333
Wait, why are you living here with Blaine?
I don't get it. [chuckles]

459
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,375
This is mine and Blaine's dream house, so…

460
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,041
-Well, actually--
-Why are you here?

461
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,625
It's a long story.

462
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:33,625
Our parents got it for us
as a wedding gift and…

463
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,250
Well, that's it. The end. [chuckles]

464
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,791
No, you shut your face.

465
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,000
Um, where's Blaine? [chuckles]
Just get me Blaine, and, um--

466
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,041
I'm so sorry.
He is just so swamped right now with work.

467
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh.

468
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,916
I see what you did here.

469
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,041
Get rid of me
so you can steal my dream life.

470
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh… [chuckles]

471
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:53,791
Steph.

472
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,333
-No, no.
-[grumbles]

473
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,041
Look, I know
we never saw eye-to-eye back then,

474
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,083
but you know, the beautiful thing
about time is you move on.

475
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,083
[groans]

476
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:07,291
Okay, you know what? I need to go
because I am brining zucchini ribbons,

477
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,041
but I never let a guest leave
without a gift.

478
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,041
Um, so I'm just gonna give you…

479
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,250
-[Steph] What?
-Here.

480
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,208
Homemade from my own starter.
A peace offering.

481
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:21,166
I really look forward
to putting the past behind us.

482
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,208
You know, move past the past.

483
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:29,625
So, maybe when you're feeling better
and a little bit more stable,

484
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,125
we could do brunch sometime.

485
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,041
-Blaine!
-It's great to see you!

486
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,125
[Steph] Blaine!

487
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,375
-[video game sound effects play]
-Come on, come on, come on, come on.

488
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,833
Who's that at the door?

489
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,333
It was… Stephanie Conway.

490
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,041
She's awake?

491
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,125
Ah, yes.

492
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,541
Perfectly preserved.

493
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,916
-[scooter honks]
-[Jim] And here we are.

494
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,458
[Martha] Oh!

00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:01,166
[laughs] Hi!
[in Australian accent] G'day, mate!

665
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,583
I wanted to say hi in your native tongue.
'Cause you're Australian, right?

666
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,416
-Yes. Yeah.
-Oh, good, good, good!

667
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,625
Your friend, my boss, Principal Riser,
asked me to show you around

668
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,041
and give you a little orientation
here at Harding.

669
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,958
Oh, okay. I don't really need to.
I know my way around.

670
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:18,500
Oh, come on, it's fun.
I have nothing else to do.

671
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:22,291
I'm Mr. Tapper, the guidance counselor,
but you can call me Mr. T.

672
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,250
Is that because you… [mimics Mr. T]
…"pity the fool" who has a bad first day?

673
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,666
Oh. [chuckles]

674
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,250
Well, yeah. Yeah, I would feel…
I would feel terrible.

675
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:34,208
No. I meant, like,
you know, Mr. T. [chuckles]

676
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:37,208
[mimics Mr. T]
"I pity the fool. I pity the fool."

677
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:41,500
I've never said that before, but I guess
I could start if you wanted me to.

678
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:42,875
I pity the fool!

679
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,958
Mr. T is pitying fools over here.

680
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:50,000
[laughs] All right, let's, um…
let's… let's go on a little tour here.

681
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:53,291
I have your records here from 2002.
You were a cheerleader.

682
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:55,625
-Cheer captain.
-Ooh, cheer captain.

683
00:33:55,708 --> 00:34:00,125
Uh, president of the Fashion Club.
Whoa! Your grades were pretty good.

684
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:03,916
My God, shut up. Don't. I don't want
anybody here to think I'm a dork.

685
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,791
I'm saying
graduating shouldn't be a problem.

686
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:06,958
Wait. What happened?

687
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,875
Where are
all the prom king and queen winners?

688
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:13,875
Oh, um, Principal Riser felt
that it sent a bad message,

689
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,333
so she replaced it
with something more positive.

690
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,583
-That looks like a bunch of tampons.
-Yeah, it is.

691
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,375
But it's also found art.

692
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,250
So you're saying they're found tampons.

693
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,625
Oh, yes, I am.

694
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:30,125
[cell phone chimes]

695
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,333
[cell phones chiming]

696
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:44,083
If not, just pretend
it's fake history. [laughs]

697
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,333
Oh! I am so sorry.

698
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,583
Stephanie?

699
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,875
-Oh my God!
-It… it's… it's Seth!

700
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,291
-Seth?
-Yeah!

701
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:53,041
-Oh, Seth!
-Oh my goodness!

702
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,875
-[Steph] Oh!
-Wow!

703
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,666
Martha said that you were back,

704
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,500
and I guess, in my head,
I just couldn't make it real,

705
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:01,250
but look at you. You look great!

706
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,250
It's me! Like, look,
I'm walking and talking.

707
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,166
-Yeah. Doing all those things.
-Everything.

708
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,958
Just like you used to, walk and talk.

709
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,625
Well, look at you! Oh my God!

710
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:14,583
-You look so cool and suave and adult.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

711
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:17,708
Wow! What happened to that nerd
that used to just hang out in the library?

712
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,000
He became the school librarian.

713
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:21,916
Seriously?

714
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,083
-[Seth] Mm-hmm.
-Ah…

715
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:25,333
Seth, thank you so much for the yearbook.

716
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,458
Why didn't you just come in and say hi?

717
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:31,458
[splutters] You know,
I didn't wanna overwhelm you, you know.

718
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:33,958
Plus, I can't stay out so late
on a school night. [chuckles]

719
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:36,666
-[school bell rings]
-Ah, shit. Shoot. [splutters]

720
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,583
Dang!

721
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:42,083
I wish I could hang out and talk more,
but I gotta get back to work.

722
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,791
-Oh, yeah, I got to get back to class.
-[laughs] Yeah.

723
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,916
I don't wanna be
20 years and ten minutes late.

724
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,916
So, I will see you around.
You know where to find me.

725
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,416
Yeah, same.
You know where to find me, in the library.

726
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,666
-Some things never change, right?
-Bye, Seth. I'll call you.

727
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,833
Or you can do some long division, I guess.

728
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,958
Steph, how's your first day?

729
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:09,208
Oh my God,
it's just been, like, so amazing.

730
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:12,666
Like, just making new friends.
Everyone's already obsessed with me.

731
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,000
That's so great. We strive
for a welcoming environment here.

732
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:19,708
Um, listen, I need to talk to you
about rejoining the Bulldogettes.

733
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:23,000
Um, instead of cheer, I think
you should be focusing on your schoolwork.

734
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,125
Yeah. Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure!

735
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:28,541
Um, but who do I talk to about rejoining?

736
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,750
Well, you would talk to me.
I'm the cheer coach now.

737
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:35,000
Okay. Wait, I see your game.

738
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,375
You become principal

739
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:39,958
so then you can get real power
by running the cheer squad.

740
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:41,750
[exhales] That's smart. I respect that.

741
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:45,166
Yeah, that… that's not why
I got my master's in education.

742
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,666
Um, look, I don't think the cheer squad

743
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,208
needs a new member right now.

744
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,333
Well, that's wrong
'cause every cheer squad in the country

745
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:53,666
would love to have me.

746
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,583
There's only two performances left,
so I don't think it's worth it.

747
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:00,500
Marth, I only need
one performance to make a splash

748
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:02,541
if I have any chance
of becoming prom queen.

749
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,125
-Steph…
-This head still needs a crown.

750
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:09,916
[Martha chuckles] I'm so sorry.
It's not gonna get it.

751
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,875
Steph,

752
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:14,416
we do not have
prom queen at this school anymore.

753
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,833
Oh my God, are you having a mini stroke?

754
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,166
What?

755
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,666
Competitions like that, they're dangerous.

756
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,250
Winning things, it just…
it doesn't reflect our school values.

757
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,625
With no winners, there aren't any losers.

758
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:39,500
I've made a school with no losers.

759
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:43,208
But everybody was just talking to me
about how much they want prom queen.

760
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:47,291
Steph, if all the students want it back,
they know they can petition for it.

761
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,041
But so far no one has.

762
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:51,375
[boy] Oh, that was so close.
You were so close.

763
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:54,291
-[girl] Let me put it my mouth.
-One more. Ready and one…

764
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,500
[laughs] Yay!

765
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,333
Oh, hey, is this where the ho-bags sit?

766
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:02,375
<i>♪ Ho-ing down with the ho-bags, yeah ♪</i>

767
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,375
<i>♪ Ho…</i> <i>♪</i>
That's a fun way of saying "what's up?"

768
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,833
-I'm Janet.
-And I'm Yaz, and that's Neil.

769
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:10,208
I just have to say I'm living
for this little vintage fit.

770
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,458
-And I'm not even JK-ing. Okay?
-[chuckles]

771
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:16,250
Okay, what is with
this enormous lunch table?

772
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,541
How are we supposed to know
where the popular kids sit?

773
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:22,458
Well, when there's just one table,
we're all popular kids.

774
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:24,708
-Everybody.
-Oh no, no, no. That's not how life works.

775
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:26,791
There's only, like, three ways
to become popular,

776
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,458
to be a cheerleader,
to work at Abercrombie,

777
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,208
or to let guys go in the back door.

778
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,166
-What?
-Oh my God, I must be really popular then.

779
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,416
-[chuckles]
-What?

780
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,750
-Nothing.
-Anyways, um, Janet…

781
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,166
[Janet] Mm-hmm.

782
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,750
…I was wondering
if you would like to sign my petition.

783
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:46,041
It's to bring back
prom queen to Harding High.

784
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,541
-Oh my gosh!
-[gasps] No way!

785
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,583
Do I respect IRL grassroot efforts

786
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:53,083
to effect change
into societal systems? Yes.

787
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,750
It's also very refreshing
to see non-digital campaign strategy.

788
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,333
-It is.
-So I'll sign it.

789
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:01,791
I'll sign it too, but don't be surprised
if we're the only ones.

790
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,541
Why's that?

791
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,208
Because nobody's gonna sign this
unless Bri Luvs signs it.

792
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,125
-Who?
-Her.

793
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,458
Bri Luvs.
That's just her name on social media.

794
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:14,291
She's got, like,
three million Instagram followers.

795
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:18,791
And that 98 pounds of sexy is Lance,
her fine-ass boyfriend.

796
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,791
[Janet] Last year, <i>Vice </i>did a whole vlog
about their open relaish

797
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:24,666
and called it
the gold standard of the future.

798
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,166
Cool, cool, cool.
So, um, how do I get her to sign it?

799
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,208
Oh, you won't. She's untouchable.

800
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:33,250
Okay, everyone's friends with her,
but she's friends with no one.

801
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:34,166
Yeah.

802
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,125
-She's coming over here.
-No, she's not.

803
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,375
-Just act normal. Avoid eye contact and--
-Okay.

804
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:42,083
-[gasps] Yaz! Been a minute, huh?
-It has been so long.

805
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:46,500
So long! And Janet, loved your post about
alternative body positivity the other day.

806
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,375
You are so inspiring.

807
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,791
I was just showing off
my new bathing suit.

808
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,875
Hi, I'm Bri, and you must be Stephanie.

809
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,041
I heard about you.

810
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,750
Really? [chuckles]

811
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:57,791
I mean, um…

812
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,666
Yeah, obviously,
because I'm, like, the total shiznit,

813
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,541
and I basically used to be you
when I went here.

814
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:07,541
You know, the most popular girl in school
'cause we're the same.

815
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,875
I don't really think about popularity.

816
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,666
I'm just trying to build
my most authentic, socially conscious,

817
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,125
body-positive, environmentally aware,
and economically compassionate brand

818
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,500
that's a home for inclusion,
focused fashion, food,

819
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,958
and fun-filled lifestyles.

820
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,916
And if tons of people respond to that,
then, great.

821
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,750
Totally. [hesitates] Yes.

822
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:28,291
I mean, obviously.

823
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:31,333
Um, while I've got you here,
would you mind signing this?

824

I'm gonna stop you right there.

so I only deal with forms digitally.

I'm sure you understand.
But can we take an ussie?

827
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,791
Yes. Absolutely. [chuckles]

-[Janet laughs] Um… [clears throat]

-[Bri] Oh, before I forget.

832
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:54,375
My mom, Tiffany,
told me to tell you she says hi.

833
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,416
She said to remind you
she's married to Blaine

834
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,666
and lives in your dream house,
in case you couldn't place her.

835
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,666
[hesitates] Your mom, Tiffany.

00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,833
Nice meeting you, Stephanie. Bye.

-Bye.

Oh. Oh no. No.
We do not do stunts anymore.

-And also we don't do any sexy dancing.

We'd rather have people listen
to our words than just our bodies.

879
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:03,500
Okay, yeah, but this cheer
would be so much better

880

I'm saying don't do it.

-[Yaz] Okay, look.
-[Janet] Okay.

889
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:27,541
We would do that, but our freshman year,
Bri Luvs made an Instagram post

890
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:29,791
saying that cheerleaders
were anti-feminist.

891
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,291
The whole school turned against us,
and we had to recalibrate.

892
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,791
Her post got, like, seven million likes.

893
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,375
-Eight million.
-It was for the best.

894
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,166
Anyways, let's show her
our gun control routine.

895
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,833
-It's one of our best.
-[Steph] No, wait!

896

What even is this squad? Like…

897
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:46,791
Is there even a cheer captain?

898
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:49,041
-Yeah.
-Yeah, Stephanie, I am the cheer captain.

-I am the cheer captain.
-I am the cheer captain.

-And also the coach.
-You?

902
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:58,541
Martha, that's the most fucked up thing
I've ever heard.

Hey, what's up?

914
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,500
Um, seeing as you're my librarian now,

915
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,625
you're legally obligated
to help me research something, yeah?

916
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:32,541
Yeah, by law.

917
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:36,291
Yeah, I think the teachers union's
a real stickler about that sort of thing.

918
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:39,208
I'm just kidding.
I'm not in the union. What's up?

919
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:41,833
-[Steph] Oh, this is addictive.
-[Seth] Yeah.

920
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:45,083

-And it's also that.

925
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,791
Okay. All right.
I think I've worked this thing out.

926
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,708
Okay.

927
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,458
So, basically you get followers
by being somebody everybody likes.

928
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:00,375
Mm-hmm.

929
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:03,666
So it's a popularity contest,
but instead of just high school,

930
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,750
it's now the whole world,
and the whole world is your phone.

931
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,708
Yeah. I mean, that's exactly it.

932
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:10,541
-That's it.
-Yeah, it's pretty sad.

933
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:14,250
No! This is, like, amazing.
This is like a shortcut.

934
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:17,500
Wow, I immediately regret
showing you this.

935
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,750
Just to be clear,
this is a way for people to pretend

936
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:22,000
their life and skin texture
is better than it is.

937
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:25,708
Is that why you've posted this picture
of you with this random hot chick?

938
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:28,625
No, that's my ex-fiancée Diana.

939
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,458
-You were engaged?
-I was.

940
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,125
-Shut up! Seth.
- [chuckles] Uh-huh.

941
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,041
That's actually how I ended up here.

942
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,916
We both were working
at the National Archives in DC,

943
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,333
and when we split up, I needed a change.

944
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:42,958
So Martha got me a job at Harding,
and here I am.

945
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,583
Trust me, being close to 40
and back at my high school

946
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,208
isn't exactly where I wanted to be, but…

947
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:50,083
-Oh. [laughs] Tell me about it!
-[laughs] Yeah, right!

948
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:53,458
Uh, well, I should get back
to enriching young minds.

I will not go over the minutes.

Really, it's for my own personal safety,
'cause what happens if I get kidnapped?

958
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:21,250
I think if you get kidnapped, Stephanie,
they'll probably take your phone.

959
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,916
Not if I'd hidden it up my…
[clicks tongue]

960
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,416
Well, just to be safe,
it's probably a good thing.

01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,583
to do that to myself.

1312
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:05,458
Stop stroking your nipples.

1313
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:07,291
Marth, what is going on here?

1314
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,250
The cheerleaders aren't allowed to dance.

1315
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:10,833
You took away prom queen.

1316
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:13,833
You turned the cafeteria
into a Hogwarts without the magic.

1317
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:15,750
Are you trying
to make this place suck wiens?

1318
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:19,958
Number one, how dare you?
It is like Hogwarts with the magic.

1319
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:24,750
And number two,
it doesn't suck wiens. It's nice.

1320
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,791
It's… it's nice here.

1321
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:29,833
-I had more fun in a coma.
-You did not have more fun in the coma.

1322
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:32,250
I had more fun going like this.

1323
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:34,625
[snores]

1324
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:35,666
[Martha] Stephanie.

1325
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,333
That was way more fun
than this high school.

1326
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:43,166
Steph, this may come as a shock to you,
but for most kids, high school sucks.

1327
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,916
I don't know why you're acting
like we didn't have the same experience.

1328
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,583
High school was awesome!

1329
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:53,125
Freshman year, you bailed on Seth and I
to go be some popular girl.

1330
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:56,666
No, I didn't bail. I just got more friends

1331
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,916
and a really hot boyfriend.

1332
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,541
Seriously, if you'd had a boyfriend,
you would have understood.

1333
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:04,875
Stephanie, I wouldn't understand
because I'm gay.

1334
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:07,291
[gasps] Ooh, you can't say that word,
unless you're saying it

1335
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:10,708
in a neutral-positive way
to refer to someone that is…

1336
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,375
Mm-hmm.

1337
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,583
Oh.

1338
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:18,500
[Martha] Yeah.

1339
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:23,208
And it… it made high school
a living hell for me.

1340
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,708
Back then, I felt very alone

1341
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:32,375
and angry and so threatened

1342
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:38,083
that if I showed one iota of my real self,
then I would be ripped to shreds

1343
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:43,041
by Tiffany or Blaine or you.

1344
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:44,500
Me?

1345
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,875
No way. Why would you even say that?

1346
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:51,541
Because, Steph,
sometimes I didn't know who you were.

1347
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,833
Or… are.

1348
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,291
Look, let's…

1349
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,583
There's three weeks left
of the school year.

1350
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:03,000
So let's just get through those
as peacefully as possible,

1351
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:06,500
and then I can go
to my family's lake house for the summer.

1352
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:12,916
[teacher] The periodic table
is made up of 119 elements.

1353
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,666
<i>Oh, hey, space nerds. JK, JK.</i>

1354
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:20,000
<i>Any of you want to come see </i>Deep Impact
<i>with me and Blaine this weekend?</i>

1355
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:23,291
<i>As part of my collab</i>
<i>with the Natural History Museum,</i>

1356
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:28,166
<i>you will get 20% off ticket prices</i>
<i>and complimentary space ice cream.</i>

1357
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,833
<i>So come watch</i>
<i>the end of the world with us.</i>

1358
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:33,666
[teacher] Remember it just for me. Please.

1359
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,250
-[scanner beeps]
-No one's gonna read you.

1360
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,416
[chuckles] Oh boy,
no one's gonna read you.

1361
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:42,708
Are you talking to the books?

1362
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:46,416
-Oh, yeah, I find it helps them grow.
-Still a dork.

1363
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,375
-Huh.
-[Steph] So…

1364
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,333
Uh,

1365
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,041
do you, like, still wanna see <i>Deep Impact?</i>

1366
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:54,208
[scanner beeps]

1367
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,166
[Seth] I'm gonna get some popcorn.

1368
01:04:56,250 --> 01:05:00,875
Maybe some freeze-dried space ice cream.
Maybe some Milk Duds, some Whoppers,

1369
01:05:00,958 --> 01:05:04,083
some Juicy Fruit.
I gotta keep this girlish figure.

1370
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,708
You want anything, or…

1371
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:09,333
Um, oh, no, no, no, don't go just yet.
Just hang here for one second.

1372
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:10,375
Yeah, sure.

1373
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:14,791
Oh my God, Seth, you're such a gentleman
going to get the snacks.

1374
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:17,708
Oh my God, I swear,
you have such a massive dick.

1375
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:20,833
-What did you say?
-What? Oh, Blaine, Tiffany.

1376
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:22,958
-Hi!
-Hi! What are you doing here?

1377
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:24,458
What a coincidence.

1378
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:27,125
I'm, um, here on a date with Seth.

1379
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:29,416
He asked me out, and I said,

1380
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,958
"You know what? I am single
and so horny, so yes."

1381
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:34,875
-Isn't that right?
-Yep.

1382
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:35,833
Really?

1383
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:38,208
Wait, I'm sorry.
You are on a date with Sethany?

1384
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:40,916
-Well, it's just Seth.
-[Tiffany chuckles]

1385
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,041
Relax. I'm just joking. [chuckles]

1386
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:46,666
Well, yeah,
we're just here to see a movie.

1387
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,291
It's not like
we're gonna have hot, consensual sex

1388
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:50,583
when the lights go down.

1389
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:53,333
[coughs] Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm?

1390
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,041
Wow! Uh…

1391
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:58,541
Wow, Seth, it only took 20 years
and some brain damage,

1392
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:01,375
but she finally agreed
to go out with you. Way to go!

1393
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,250
Again, just joking. [laughs]

1394
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:06,333
[laughs sarcastically]

1395
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:08,166
-[Steph] Hilarious.
-Let's go find our seats.

1396
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,333
-Huh?
-Let's go find our seats.

1397
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,458
-We gotta go find our seats.
-Down in front, yep.

1398
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:15,416
Yeah.

1399
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,041
-Oh, yeah. [sucks teeth]
-"Sethany."

1400
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,958
[dramatic music plays]

1401
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,208
[whispers] Feed me some popcorn.

1402
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:31,750
Are you serious about that?

1403
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:36,666
Yeah, just be awesome.
Just… just toss some into my mouth.

1404
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,625
All right.

1405
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,708
[laughs]

1406
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:43,791
[Steph] Seth!

1407
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,833
Oh my God. It's stuck in my throat.
Oh, I'm choking.

1408
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:50,666
-No, I really… I just got a Milk Dud.
-Did you actually choke on that?

1409
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,958
Yeah, it's stuck right there,
but it's all right.

1410
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:54,875
I thought that was
a euphemism kind of thing.

1411
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:56,833
<i>-Fire tether pitons.</i>
<i>-Pitons fired.</i>

1412
01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:59,125
[spaceship whooshes]

1413
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:00,833
[straw creaks]

1414
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:05,125
[moans]

1415
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:09,875
[continues moaning]

1416
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:12,541
-[whispers] Stop it.
-[whispers] What?

1417
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:15,833
You're eye-fucking Stephanie so hard,
she'll need the morning-after pill.

1418
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:18,000
[Blaine] I am not eye-fucking anybody.

1419
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:21,916
It is embarrassing. Do you want me
to call Dr. Wilbin for more therapy?

1420
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,625
-Don't threaten me with a good time.
-Shut up!

1421
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,833
Bitch, turn your ugly face around
and watch the movie.

1422
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:29,833
[Blaine] Careful how you talk
to senior citizens.

1423
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:30,916
Shut up, Blaine.

1424
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,625
Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to ask you to be quiet.

1425
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:34,916
I am not the problem.

1426
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,416
There is a freaking porno
happening over there!

1427
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,041
-What?
-[Tiffany] Don't put that on my face.

1428
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:42,291
It is not my fault.
I am not doing anything.

1429
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:45,541
Be quiet. I'm trying to watch the movie.

1430
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:47,500
You're afraid you'll miss something?

1431
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,958
The asteroid hits,

1432
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:53,125
and Téa Leoni and her Austrian dad
get hit by a ginormous wave.

1433
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:54,416
-[crowd] Aw.
-What?

1434
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,375
Oh, come on! We all knew that!

1435
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:59,083
Can you… [hisses]

1436
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:00,833
-Sorry.
-Ma'am?

1437
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,041
I…

1438
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,708
-Ma'am, come with me.
-Okay, fine. Blaine?

1439
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:06,708
What is the name of your manager?

1440
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,416
Sir? I am going to have
to email your manager.

1441
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,541
[crowd applauding, cheers]

1442
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,416
-[Seth laughs]
-[Steph] Ah!

1443
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,625
Two decades later, and I still love
watching Tiff lose her mind.

1444
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:24,416
-I mean, that was incredibly satisfying.
-Mm-hmm.

1445
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,625
Okay, now I understand

1446
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:28,458
why you devoted so much of your time
on it in high school. [laughs]

1447
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:30,833
-Well, not the whole time.
-Oh?

1448
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:34,166
Just all of my junior,
sophomore, and most of my senior year.

1449
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,125
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1450
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:38,416
Anyways, Marth told me
something about you in high school.

1451
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,583
Oh God. What?

1452
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:44,166
She said that you had
a crush on me. [chuckles]

1453
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:45,875
Yes.

1454
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,208
When we were in high school,
I was very much in love with you.

1455
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,500
Seth!

1456
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,333
-Eh.
-You were? Really?

1457
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:55,916
-Eh.
-Why didn't you ever say anything?

1458
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,666
[hesitates] 'Cause, you know,
we were friends.

1459
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,375
-Yeah.
-And you were with Blaine.

1460
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:03,375
And, you know, we both know
what your answer would've been.

1461
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:07,208
Maybe, maybe not.
We're hanging out right now, aren't we?

1462
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:10,916
Yeah, but that's only because you thought
you could use me to make Blaine jealous.

1463
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:14,958
Steph, come on. I'm a full-blown adult.

1464
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:17,875
I think I can recognize
a teenage trick when I see one.

1465
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:20,791
That's not what's going on.

1466
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:24,500
Oh, come on, you used to pull this with me
and Marth all the time in high school.

1467
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:27,625
You'd use our attention
to make the popular kids crave yours.

1468
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,416
Um, did I?

1469
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:30,750
Yes.

1470
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:34,208
We always wondered
if those kids ever got to really meet you.

1471
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:35,833
Like, the real you.

1472
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,875
Well, I did have
