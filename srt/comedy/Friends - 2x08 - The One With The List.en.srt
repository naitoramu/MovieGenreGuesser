00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,674
Ross kissed me.

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,177
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,803
It was unbelievable!

6
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:15,057
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,767
Let's hear everything.

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,728
Monica, get the wine
and unplug the phone.

9
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:23,482
Rachel, does this end well
or do we need to get tissues?

10
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,568
It ended very well.

11
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,696
Do not start without me!
Do not start without me!

12
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,533
Okay. All right.
Let's hear about the kiss.

13
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,160
Was it a soft brush
against your lips...

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,247
...or was it a "I gotta have you now"
kind of thing?

15
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:43,585
Well, at first it was really intense,
you know? And then...

16
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:47,173
Oh, God. And then we just
sort of sunk into it.

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,009
So was he holding you?
Or were his hands on your back?

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,722
No, actually, first
they started out on my waist...

19
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:59,059
...and then they slid up
and were in my hair.

20
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:01,854
And...

21
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,355
...then I kissed her.

22
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,439
Tongue?

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,985
- Yeah.
- Cool.

24
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,155

26
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,491
All right, check out this bad boy!

27
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,037
Twelve megabytes of RAM,
500-megabyte hard drive...

28
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,039
...built-in spreadsheet capabilities...

29
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,210
...and a modem that transmits
at over 28,000 BPS.

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,796
What will you use it for?

31
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,383
Games and stuff.

32
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,344
There are no jobs.
There are no jobs for me.

33
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,888
Oh, wait, here's one.

34
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,267
- Would you be willing to cook naked?
- There's an ad for a naked chef?

35
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:27,231
No, but if you'll cook naked, then
you might be willing to dance naked.

36
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,442
And then...

37
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,323
So how'd you make out last night?

38
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,120
That is funny.
That is painfully funny.

39
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,746
No, wait, wait.

40
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,290
Yeah, that's just painful.

41
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,627
Wait a minute.
I thought last night was great.

42
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,712
Yeah, it was.
But I get home...

43
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:54,175
...and I see Julie's saline solution
on my night table...

44
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,760
...and I think,
"My God! What am I doing?"

45
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,846
Here I am with Julie,
this incredible, great woman...

46
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,808
...who I care about
and who cares about me...

47
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,435
...and I'm just
throwing all that away?

48
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,939
You got all that
from saline solution?

49
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,484
Wait. We're talking about Rachel.
You and Rachel.

50
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,654
I've been dreaming about
me and Rachel for 10 years.

51
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,614
But now I'm with Julie.

52
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,701
So it's like, me and Julie,
me and Rachel.

53
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,412
Me and Julie, me and Rach...

54
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,831
Rachel! Rachel.

55
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,250
- Hey, you.
- How are you?

56
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,876
Good. How are you?

57
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,337
Good.

58
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,715
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

59
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,342
Julie!

60
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:38,635
How are you?

61
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,262
Good.

62
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,848
So everybody's here.

63
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,226
Everybody's good.

64
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,105
Were you gonna play something?

65
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,942
- Well, actually...
- Play it!

66
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,111
All right.

67
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,615
- Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
- What?

68
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,910
Okay. Hi.

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,289
Hello. Hi. Okay.

70
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,459
This is a song about a love triangle...

71
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,254
...between three people I made up.

72
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:20,845
It's called
"Two of Them Kissed Last Night".

73
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,516
<i>There was a girl</i>
<i>We'll call her Betty</i>

74
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,521
<i>And a guy</i>
<i>Let's call him Neil</i>

75
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,566
<i>Now I can't stress</i>
<i>This point too strongly</i>

76
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,570
<i>This story isn't real</i>

77
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:44,910
<i>Now our Neil must decide</i>
<i>Who will be the girl that he casts aside</i>

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,371
<i>Will Betty be the one</i>
<i>Who he loves truly</i>

79
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:52,501
<i>Or will it be the one</i>
<i>Who we'll call Loolie</i>

80
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,881
<i>He must decide</i>
<i>He must decide</i>

81
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,010
<i>Even though I made him up</i>
<i>He must decide</i>

82
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,477
Nice, nice, nice.

83
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,479
<i>Muy impressivo.</i>

84
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,734
Mr. Rastatter, what does this
job entail? The ad wasn't clear.

85
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,904
Macholate.

86
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,446
- I'm sorry?
- Macholate.

87
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:25,451
It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,703
Go ahead, try a piece.

89
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,957
We think Macholate is
even better than chocolate.

90
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,751
All right.

91
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,803
I love how it crumbles.

92
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,807
- You see, chocolate doesn't do that.
- No, ma'am.

93
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:53,478
We should be getting
our FDA approval any day now.

94
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,065
Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

95
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,776
The way we see it,
chocolate dominates...

96
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:03,822
...your major food-preparation holidays.
Easter, Christmas, what have you.

97
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,116
But given the right marketing...

98
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,412
...we can make Thanksgiving
the Macholate holiday.

99
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,080
Wow.

100
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,625
Aren't you gonna swallow that?

101
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,294
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.

102
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,505
Isn't that great?

103
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,800
Well, anyhow...

104
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,512
...we're looking for chefs
who can create Thanksgiving recipes.

105
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,930
You interested?

106
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,224
Abso...

107
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,102
...- lutely!

108
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,980
I love creating recipes,
I love Thanksgiving, and now...

109
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,357
...I love Macholate.

110
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,650
Really?

111
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,528
Especially that aftertaste.
I tell you...

112
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:46,407
...that'll last you till Christmas.

113
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,161
How about Macholate mousse?

114
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,579
It's not...

115
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,622
...very Thanksgiving-y.

116
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,168
How about Pilgrim Macholate mousse?

117
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,711
What makes it Pilgrim?

118
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,299
We'll put buckles on it.

119
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,468
Did Ross call?

120
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,595
No, I'm sorry.

121
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,931
Why didn't he call?

122
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,766
He's gonna stay with Julie.

123
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,143
He's gonna stay with her
and she'll be:

124
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,646
"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me."

125
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:23,527
"We'll get married and have lots
of kids and dig up stuff together!"

126
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,864
No offense, but that
sounds nothing like her.

127
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:33,245
What am I gonna do?
This is like a complete nightmare!

128
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:38,709
I know. This must be so hard.
"Oh, no! Two women love me!"

129
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,171
"They're both gorgeous,
my wallet's too small for my 50s...

130
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:46,091
...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"

131
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:51,096
- Here's a thought...
- Don't ever touch the computer.

132
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,140
Ross, listen.
I got two words for you:

133
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,102
Threesome.

134
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,232
Let's get logical about this.
We'll make a list.

135
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,444
"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."

136
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,825
We'll put their names
in different fonts...

137
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,703
...and I can use different
colors for each column.

138
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,204
Can't we use a pen?

139
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,833
No, Amish boy.

140
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,920
Let's start with the cons
because they're more fun.

141
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,756
Rachel first.

142
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,466
I don't know.

143
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,884
I mean...

144
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:33,847
All right, I guess you can say
she's a little spoiled sometimes.

145
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,350
You could say that.

146
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:41,772
I guess, sometimes
she's a little ditzy, you know?

147
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,359
And I've seen her be a little
too into her looks.

148
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,694
And Julie and I have
a lot in common...

149
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,823
...because we're both
paleontologists, right?

150
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,866
But Rachel's just a waitress.

151
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,826
Waitress.

152
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,622
Got it.
You guys want to play Doom?

153
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,419
Or we could keep doing this.

154
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,212
What else?

155
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,298
I don't know.

156
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,886
Oh! Her ankles are a little chubby.

157
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,554
Okay, let's do Julie.

158
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,558
What's wrong with her?

159
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,230
She's not Rachel.

160
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,777
This is pumpkin pie
with a Macholate crust.

161
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,739
This is Macholate cranberry cake,
and these are Macholate-chip cookies.

162
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,577
Just like the Indians served.

163
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,621
Oh, my God!

164
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:40,790
"Oh, my God" good?

165
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,502
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you let me put this in my mouth.

166
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:50,882
Sweet Lord!
This is what evil must taste like!

167
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,223
I tell you, it won't print.

168
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,101
I pressed that button, like, 100 times.

169
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,855
For a hotline, you're not so hot.

170
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,483
What is that in the background?

171
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,694
Are you watching "Star Trek"?

172
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,370
So did you break Julie's heart?

173
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:26,376
It was horrible. She cried, I cried.
She threw things, they hit me.

174
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:28,963
I did the right thing.

175
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:33,342
So Spock actually hugs his father?

176
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,054
Hey, do you guys have...

177
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,682
Where you going?

178
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:44,270
I just got back...

179
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,314
...from Julie's.

180
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,524
No, no.

181
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,568
It's not what you think.

182
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,988
It's the other thing.

183
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:05,082
Well, what's the other thing?
What do I think?

184
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,042
Well...

185
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,003
He broke up with Julie!

186
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:14,424
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!

187
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,593
Really?

188
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,636
Really.

189
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,763
It's always been you, Rach.

190
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,225
Oh, God.

191
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,903
Oh, this is good.

192
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,238
- This is really good.
- I know. I know.

193
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,534
It's almost...

194
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,708
What do you say we take a walk?
Just us. Not them.

195
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,171
- Let me get my coat.
- Okay. No, hey!

196
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,382
I'll get your coat.

197
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,599
He's going to get my coat.
He's going to get my coat, Joey!

198
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,979
Joey, I can't believe this!
This is unbelievable!

199
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:13,191
- What's that?
- What? Nothing!

200
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:17,154
- I saw my name. What is it?
- No, no, see? See?

201
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,406
It's printing!

202
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,075
It's printing!

203
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,744
Let me see!

204
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,621
Hey, someone order a coat?

205
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,166
Chandler wrote something about me
and won't let me see.

206
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,794
He won't? He won't!

207
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,839
Because isn't that...

208
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,966
...the short story you were writing?

209
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:40,428
Yes, it is a short story...

210
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,928
...that I was writing.

211
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,056
And I'm in it?
Let me read it.

212
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,809
No!

213
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:52,898
- Come on!
- Hey, why don't you read it to her?

214
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,243
All right.

215
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,462
"It was summer."

216
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,632
"And it was hot."

217
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,052
"Rachel was there."

218
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:27,558
"A lonely gray couch."

219
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:31,228
"'Oh, look!' cried Ned."

220
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,440
"And the kingdom was his forever.
The end!"

221
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:41,864
That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the world!

222
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,741
This isn't funny anymore.

223
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:47,995
There's something about me
on that paper, and I want to see it.

224
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,873
No, you don't.

225
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:55,711
All right, fine. If you guys want
to be children, that's fine.

226
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,131
I do not need to see it!

227
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,262
What is this?

228
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,348
That is...

229
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,266
What is this?

230
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,686
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

231
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,024
Okay. Just remember how crazy
I am about you, okay?

232
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,068
"Kind of ditzy"?

233
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,822
"Too into her looks"?

234
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,072
"Spoiled"?

235
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:29,370
A little spoiled. He was supposed
to type "little", the idiot!

236
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,247
"Just a waitress"?

237
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,416
Now that was...

238
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,044
I mean, as opposed to...

239
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,173
Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

240
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,760
I do not have chubby ankles!

241
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,136
No! I...

242
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:50,181
Okay, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.

243
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,101
"She's not Rachem"?

244
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:54,770
What the hell's a Rachem?

245
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,064
Is that a stupid paleontology word...

246
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,983
...I wouldn't know,
because I'm just a waitress?

247
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,279
Rach, come on!

248
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,781
It's "She's not Rachel"!

249
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:09,409
She's not...

250
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,167
My diary! Brilliant!

251
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,212
If I'd said it was my diary,
she wouldn't have made me read it.

252
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:27,260
That's true. You'd be a great person
to have around after an emergency.

253
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,888
I cannot believe Ross
even made this list.

254
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,516
- I know.
- What a dinkus!

255
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:37,062
Hey, cut him some slack.
It was Chandler's idea.

256
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,563
What?

257
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:42,276
Oh, good. I was hoping
that would come up.

258
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:43,861
This was your idea?

259
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:48,532
Let's get some perspective here.
These things happen for a reason.

260
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,618
Yeah. You!

261
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:56,582
Pheebs, back me up. You believe
in that karma crap, don't you?

262
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:01,712
By the way, good luck
in your next life as a dung beetle.

263
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,564
Rach!

264
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,359
Hey! Open up! Please?

265
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,531
When somebody does not buzz you in,
Ross, that means, "Go away".

266
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,991
It doesn't mean,
"Climb up the fire escape."

267
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,994
I just want to read you
your "Pro List".

268
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,038
Not interested.

269
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,876
"Number one:
The way you cry at game shows."

270
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,671
"Number two:
How much you love your friends."

271
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,926
"Number three: The way you play
with your hair when you're nervous."

272
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:53,013
"Number four: How brave you are
for starting your life over."

273
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,349
"Number five:
How great you are with Ben."

274
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,771
"Number six: The way you smell."

275
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:02,857
What are you doing?

276
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,691
You want to open the window?

277
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,361
Oh, yeah.

278
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,905
- What are you doing out there?
- I'm...

279
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,574
You must be freezing.
You know what you need?

280
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:17,454
How about a nice, steaming
cup of hot Macholate?

281
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,376
Come on, open up.

282
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,712
Rach, come on.
You gotta give me another chance.

283
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,631
No.

284
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,925
- No?
- That's what I said.

285
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,218
Maybe we should go.

286
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,553
You don't have to go.
We're done.

287
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,306
I know how you must...

288
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,641
No! You don't, Ross.

289
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,728
Imagine the worst things
you think about yourself.

290
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:46,192
How would you feel if the person
you trusted most in the world...

291
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,068
...not only thinks them too...

292
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:52,280
...but actually uses them
as reasons not to be with you.

293
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:57,578
No, but see, I want to be with you
in spite of all those things.

294
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,456
Well, that's mighty big of you.

295
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:03,125
I said, don't go!

296
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,587
You know what?

297
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:11,633
If it were the other way around, there
is nothing you could put on a list...

298
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:15,054
...that would make me
not want to be with you.

299
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:18,516
Well, then I guess that's
the difference between us.

300
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,727
See, I'd never make a list.

301
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:42,957
I never know how long to wait
in this situation before you can talk.

302
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:46,502
Maybe a little longer.

303
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,633
In these recipes,
the quantities may seem unusual.

304
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,804
Like these coconut Macholate
holiday nut bars?

305
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:00,140
I've indicated four cups of coconut
and four cups of nuts...

306
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,561
...and only one tablespoon
of Macholate.

307
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,063
Doesn't matter.

308
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,817
Our FDA approval didn't come through.

309
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:13,862
Something about laboratory rats.

310
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,113
Gosh, I'm sorry.

311
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,657
Yeah.

312
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,827
Anyhow, here's your check.

313
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,663
Thank you for all the trouble
you went through.

314
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:26,917
Listen, you didn't eat a lot of it
while you were cooking, did you?

315
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,627
Well, I ate some.

316
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,714
Oh, some is fine.
Some is not a lot.

317
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:37,470
So it doesn't burn
when you pee, does it?

318
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,196
Is that him again?

319
00:19:55,445 --> 00:20:00,659
Tell him I'd come to the phone,
but my ankles are weighing me down.

320
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,912
I don't think this is the best time.

321
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:07,040
Look, can you do something for me?

322
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,169
Sure. What?

323
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,173
All right.

324
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,760
Music?

325
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,472
Sure.

326
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,105
<i>The next one's dedicated</i>
<i>to Rachel from Ross.</i>

327
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,191
<i>Rachel, he wants you to know</i>
<i>he's sorry for what he did...</i>

328
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:36,362
<i>... and he hopes you can forgive him.</i>

329
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:40,950
<i>See the stones set in your eyes</i>

330
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,496
<i>See the thorn twist in your side</i>

331
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:50,960
<i>I'll wait for you</i>

332
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:58,259
<i>Sleight of hand and twist of fate</i>

333
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:03,222
<i>On a bed of nails she makes me wait</i>

334
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:07,810
<i>And I'll wait without you</i>

335
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,940
<i>We've just gotten a call from Rachel</i>
<i>and she told us what Ross did.</i>

336
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,151
<i>It's pretty appalling.</i>
<i>And, Ross, if you're listening...</i>

337
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:20,614
<i>... I don't want to play</i>
<i>your song anymore.</i>

338
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,663
<i>Why don't we devote our time</i>
<i>to a couple that stands a chance?</i>

339
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,290
<i>Avery, Michelle's sorry</i>
<i>she hit you with her car...</i>

340
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,377
<i>... and she hopes you two</i>
<i>will work it out.</i>

341
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,171
<i>There's a room where</i>

342
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,799
<i>I can go</i>

343
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:45,556
<i>And tell my secrets to</i>

344
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:49,852
<i>In my room</i>

345
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:56,442
<i>In my room</i>

346
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,371
Thanks for coming in again.

347
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,624
Not at all. I have no morals,
and I need the cash.

348
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,711
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

349
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:19,882
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

350
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,760
They taste exactly
like pistachios...

351
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,263
...but they're made
of reconstituted fish bits.

352
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,890
Here, try one.

353
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:31,935
- All right.
- You're not allergic to anything?

354
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:32,978
Cat hair.

355
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,189
Oh, sorry.
