how about you?

what you're saying.

owner, and it is "to Sah-bray." Us!

Scissor me.

Dunder Mifflin was
recently bought

8
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,550
by an electronics
company named Sah-bray.

hour and they saved our asses.

that we were the one branch

that was actually
working right,

12
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,069
so we probably could've
saved our own asses.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,165
We didn't need them
touching our asses.

inattention to detail...

Hey, hey.

32
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,187
I have opened a box which
should not have been opened...

33
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,126
Terrible mistake.
...and distributed things

34
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,494
which should not
have been distributed.

35
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,623
Un-distributable.

36
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,031
Well, maybe we can
put the box back together.

Impossible.
He opened it like an ape.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah. Fax cable, then

they put their minds together,

they can do
something great.

all be proud of yourselves.

Okay, did everyone get one?

151
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,544
With these bottles, we eliminate
the need for plastic water bottles,

00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,644
which are the scourge
of the environment.

We will still get to use the
little cups, though, right?

154
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,018
Little cups?
Like paper or plastic?

I don't know what
they're made of.

Okay. Well,
I bet you could fit

158
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,368
20 little cups of water
in your aluminum bottle.

159
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,198
You know what
can't fit in a bottle

160
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,204
are the 20 little trips
I take to the cooler,

161
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,172
and the 20 little scans
I do of everybody

162
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,708
to make sure everything's
running smoothly,

163
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,802
and the 20 little conversations
that I have with Stanley.

164
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,937
That's okay.

165
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,243
There is a small part
of me that is actually

166
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,876
very excited about
this new company.

167
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,882
But 70% of me is water, and
the other part, the real part,

168
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,290
the part that has
feelings and emotions

169
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,828
and thoughts and
makes decisions,

170
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,560
and, if I can be crass,
makes babies,

171
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:24,695
that part thinks that
all of these changes suck...

172
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,537
Really?

173
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,676
You don't have enough water
in there? Your stomach?

Looks like we kicked it.

<i>MICHAEL: I miss the old

178
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:51,219
Too much change is not a
good thing. Ask the climate.

179
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,191
I don't want to
appear ungrateful

180
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,895
for everything
Sabre is doing for us.

181
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,437
I don't get that sense
at all from you, so...

182
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,767
Well, you should
have a little,

183
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,569
but it's great
that you don't,

184
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:06,942
because I am trying to
embrace all of these changes.

185
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,675
But I'm... I'll be honest,
I'm having trouble

186
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,239
wrapping my head
around a couple of them.

187
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,614
Which ones?

189
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,851
Well, I wish that
I could do something,

190
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,118
but it's kind of policy,
you know?

191
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,351
Above my pay grade.

So, maybe we should call.
We should call someone.

194
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,333
I could help. I'm good with
bosses. Call one of the higher ups?

195
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,959
You know what?
Let me see what I can do.

(BOTH GASPING)

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,301
Okay, this is officially the
cutest thing I've ever seen.

198
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,906
Cubbies! I totally
forgot about cubbies.

199
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,542
There's a finger-painting
station and a curly slide.

200

Am I too old to go here?

Oh!

202
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,989
Adorable, right?

203
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,264
I walked in on someone
in the bathroom. What?

204
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,830
I just walked in on
someone in the bathroom.

I don't know.

I am telling you, there
are no strawberries in here.

Well, I saw them in there.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

213
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,456
I think when Andy
finally asks me out,

214
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,359
he's gonna try to top what
he did with the drum line.

215
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,363
I can't wait to see
what he comes up with.

216

The ball is totally
in Erin's court,

everything that you wanted me to say

wanted me to say it, so...

love the sound of your voice,</i>

<i>but I really need
some new information now.</i>

222
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,681
Okay. I told the story
of your uncle,

223

and I have a feeling
that you would've really,

224
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,213
really been proud
of the way... Okay.

225

<i>Wait a minute, who is
it? Who's there? What?</i>

226

in the room with you?</i>

on it since I was a little girl.</i>

<i>To what do I owe the pleasure
of this video chat?</i>

237
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:37,226
Well, I am a little concerned about
all these changes, to be quite frank.

238
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,393
I think we have done things a
certain way here at Dunder Mifflin

for quite some time.

240

<i>Pardon.
Pardon me, Mr. Scott,</i>

241
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,838
<i>but the last time
I saw a company</i>

if I'd prefer</i>

245
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,638
<i>that you all adapt to
the way we do things.</i>

246
00:11:56,315 --> 00:12:00,945
Okay. I feel very strongly
that you can't just come in here

247
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,982
and change everything that
people have been doing forever.

248
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,630
Is Christian Slater back
there? Because he knows...

249
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,262
He'd know what to do.

250
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,395

why don't you tell Gabe</i>

251
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,805
<i>if by the end of the day
you can't handle the changes?</i>

252

I've already told him, but I will tell
him again, if you think that'll help.

This is great.

264
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,682
Gotta confess,
we came a little early,

265
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,382
so we got a quick
look around, but...

266
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,549
So you saw it already.

267
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,320
No. Yes, we saw this, yes.

No, it wasn't like
a look around,

we really just had a peek. Quick peek.

We should just go.
He's really uncomfortable.

276
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,335
He's uncomfortable
because you're acting weird,

277
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,500
so you have to
stop acting weird.

278
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,771
What if we just bring it up?
We'll just put it out in the open?

That's the weirdest possible
solution to the problem.

Sorry about that.
Right this way.

All right.

exactly what to do.

He is not a big fan of me
dropping by unannounced,

00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,734
but then again, who is?

You look great, too.

and never go back?

so well over there?

Oh, man!
How much time do you have?

301
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,137
I have a doctor's appointment
next Thursday.

302
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,533
Yeah?

303
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,174
Hey, honey, how's your day
going? Did you do anything cool?

304
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,512
No, sweetie,
I just hung out.

305

'Cause I saw
you had shoes on,

00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,414
so I didn't know
if you did anything.

307
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,582
No, just hanging out, hon.
You remember Michael?

and thought
I'd come by and say...

310
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,730
No problem at all.
This is great.

311
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,663
So, what are
you guys up to?

312
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,503
I don't know. Maybe...

313
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,802
Actually, you know, I think
maybe we'll go outside.

314
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:14,242
Maybe... We'll go outside? Go outside.

315
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,885
There was one thing
we were curious about.

316
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,979
Your flexibility on things
like Easter or Memorial Day,

317
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,354
because we might want to change
our days around a little bit.

318
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,450
That seems a bit premature,
don't you think?

319
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,154
I don't even know if I
have a space for you yet,

320
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,595
and you're already lining up
your holiday plans.

321
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:38,069
No, sorry, we're kind of planners,
but we're also flexible, too,

322
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,126
so you know what?

323
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,603
Maybe we can just discuss it
when the time comes.

324
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,574
Yeah. If the time comes,
we can discuss it.

325
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,135
Is this because Jim walked in
on you going to the bathroom?

326
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,305
What?

327
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,319
Seriously? You told her?

328
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,321
Did it...
It might have come up

329
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,981
while we were
waiting for you.

330
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,923
And you thought that
might have something

331
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,551
to do with how
the meeting is going?

332
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,255
No, I didn't... Maybe,
because it doesn't seem

333
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,264
to be going super well.

334
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,695
You didn't consider the fact that
it might not be going super well

335
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,759
just because it might
not be going super well?

336
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,730
No, 'cause we're
really nice people,

337
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,798
but you don't
seem to like us.

338
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,404
I'm being
perfectly pleasant.

339
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,176
Did you ever consider
that you might not be

340
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,407
as charming as
you think you are?

341
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,213
This coming from the guy who
still uses a children's toilet.

342
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,649
Why didn't you just
lock the door, man?

343
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,626
It doesn't lock for
the children's safety.

344
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,889
Anybody could have walked in.

345
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,192
It was story time.

346
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:48,833
Sabre is changing everything. Site
blockers, they don't let us use cups.

347
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,935
So I started thinking,
who could handle this?

348
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,773
Who would know what to do?

349
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,904
David Wallace
would know what to do.

350
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,846
What should I do,
David Wallace?

351
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,543
I don't know.
What can you do?

352
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,485
Mmm! Exactly.
What are you thinking?

353
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,845
It's a tough one.

354
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,151
It is a tough one.

355
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,522
I don't have
any ideas for you.

356
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,255
Yeah,
but one would be good.

357
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,923
Hey, okay, wait.

358
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,022
Okay.

359
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,226
I want to tell you about
a business idea I have.

360
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,325
Okay.
Okay.

361
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,497
You know how kids leave
their toys everywhere? Right?

362
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,871
So this is a vacuum. It's
like a Shop-Vac type of thing.

363
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,034
(EXCLAIMS)

364
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,646
Teaches kids how to pick up
their own toys. Right?

365
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,339
Baseball gloves,
Hacky Sacks,

366
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,818
drumsticks...
(EXCLAIMS) Picks it up.

367
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,316
So the kid's making
the noise to pick it up?

368
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,912
Yeah. No.

369
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,958
No, no,
that's the vacuum noise.

370
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,083
Okay.

371
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,821
You don't like it.

372
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,919
No, I think it's...

373
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,258
No, it's okay.

374
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,298
Another guy from Dunder
Mifflin, Arnie from Research,

375
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,802
he's gonna draw up
the prototype, and...

376
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,734
It's like a Shop-Vac.
Did I say that?

377
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,933
Yep.

378
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,567
It'll be okay.

379
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,114
Hey, any fun
weekend plans?

380
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,673
No. You?

381
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,219
No, actually.

382
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:12,848
So, nothing?

383
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,485
No movies or parties

384
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,552
or anything you might
want to invite someone to?

385
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,398
Nothing. It's wide open.

386
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,392
Okay.

387
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,298
That's as hard
as I can hint.

388
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,399
Hey, you know, if you want, I'm
sure I could get Arnie onboard,

389
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,966
if you want to join us
for Suck lt.

390
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,071
Work together again.

391
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,238
The what?

392
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,278
"Suck lt."
That's what it's called.

393
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,577
Oh! Okay.

394
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,844
Huh? Catchy.

395
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,476
Kid's will love it.
I like it.

396
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,850
There are very few things
that would make me

397
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,082
not want to team up
with David Wallace,

398
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,250
and Suck It
is one of them.

399
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,588
See you later.
Oh, Michael.

400
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,686
I know.

401
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:52,787
Thank you for coming.

402
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,423
Thanks for having me.

403
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,765
Well, that's not the David
Wallace that I remember.

404
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:03,239
That was some sort
of weird creature

405
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,701
that lives in
David Wallace's house.

406
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:12,550
Oh, my God. All right!
Just get me out of here.

407
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,750
Hello! Is anybody home?

408
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,085
Thank you, Erin.

409
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:28,028
Now, if everyone would
please ready their canteens

410
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,727
so I can fill them

411
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,861
with the sweet, sweet
nectar of Gabe's homeland

412
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,873
and then propose a toast.
Here we go.

413
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,872
You know when people
say getting fired

414
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,535
was the best thing that
ever happened to them?

415
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,135
I feel sorry
for those people.

416
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,579
That?
The best thing? Really?

417
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,809
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)

418
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,742
Well, I'm not really one
for making speeches.

419
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,479
Yes, you are.
Since when?

420
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,614
You make a lot.

421
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,816
MICHAEL: But I feel
pretty good right now.

422
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:56,452
I really do. A lot better than
I did earlier, let me tell you.

423
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,688
That's your toast?

424
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,321
No, this is my toast.

425
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,463
I think this whole thing
with Sabre is gonna work out.

426
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,901
I have a very good
feeling about it.

427
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,405
Michael, this isn't a toast,
you're just thinking out loud.

428
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,065
Here's my toast.

429
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,575
Orange juice is in here,

430
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:19,079
and like Sabre, it is from
Florida, and it is good.

431
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,343
Just 'cause you have liquid,
that doesn't make it a toast.

432
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,447
Here's the toast.
I'm gonna do it now.

433
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:31,760
Raise your container
to us and to Sabre.

434
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,230
PHYLLIS: To us and to Sabre. Hear, hear.

435
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,562
Mmm.

436
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:41,072
Wow, that is metallicy.
That's like drinking a battery.

437

doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
