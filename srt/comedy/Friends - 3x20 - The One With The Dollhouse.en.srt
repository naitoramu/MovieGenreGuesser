1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,020
You're telling me
this actress person. . .

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,170
. . .is the only woman you ever wanted
who didn't want you back?

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,170
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,660
Is this what it's like to be you?

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,140
-You're crazy about her, huh?
-You have no idea.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,170
When we're on stage, I get to
kiss her and touch her.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,930
She goes home with the director. . .

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,970
. . .and it's like somebody's
ripping out my heart.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,690
Oh, it's so great to see you
feeling like this.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,020
Dad called this morning.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,290
Aunt Sylvia passed away.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,290
We were all
pretty shaken up about it.

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,810
Am I missing something?

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,780
I thought death was supposed
to be sad, in a way.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,810
Well, Aunt Sylvia was. . .

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,410
. . .not a nice person.

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,290
She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,570
And I'm sorry she died.

19
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,330
Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,620
-You get the dollhouse.
-I get the dollhouse!

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,090
A house for dolls!
That is so cool.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,530
When I was a kid, I had a barrel.

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,690
You had a barrel for a dollhouse?

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,090
No, just a barrel.

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,290
You know what? You can play
with my dollhouse.

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,340
Really?

27
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,810
Any time you want.

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,890
When I was young I wanted
to play with this dollhouse.

29
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,290
But no! It was to be looked at,
never played with.

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,850
My grandmother said
the same thing to me.

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,370
The One With the Doll House

32
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,650
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

33
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,580
Thanks for lunch.
You didn't have to walk me here.

34
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,500
That's okay. No problem.

35
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,540
You realize we don't keep
the women's lingerie here.

36
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,890
Yes, I realize that.

37
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,890
-Summer catalog.
-That's the stuff.

38
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,700
Rachel, I need the versace invoice.

39
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,290
You don't work for me.

40
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,420
Joanna, this is my friend
Chandler Bing. Joanna.

41
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,140
Bing? That's a great name.

42
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,940
It's Gaelic for,
"Thy turkey's done. "

43
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,530
-I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you.
-You too.

44
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,100
So what's wrong with him?

45
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,690
Nothing. He's just goofy like that.
I actually hardly notice it anymore.

46
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,050
I mean, is he married
or involved with anyone?

47
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,170
He's not married or involved
with anyone.

48
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,100
Actually, you know what?
Forget it.

49
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,610
-I'll ask him for you, if you want.
-Would you?

50
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,410
Or is it too sad and desperate,
like something Sophie would do?

51
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,850
-I am here.
-I know that.

52
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,260
Look at it!

53
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,130
Wallpaper's a little faded.
That's okay.

54
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,700
Carpet's a little loose.

55
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,300
Hardwood floors?!

56
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,890
-It's so beautiful!
-I know!

57
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,130
So I'm here, ready to play!

58
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,810
I brought a bunch of stuff
for the house, so check it out.

59
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,330
What's this?

60
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,810
That's a dog.
Every house should have a dog.

61
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,130
Not one that can pee on the roof.

62
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,050
Maybe it's so big because the house
was built on radioactive waste.

63
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,290
And is this in case the house sneezes?

64
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,530
No, that's the ghost for the attic.

65
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,090
-I don't want a ghost.
-Well, nobody wants a ghost.

66
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,940
But you've got one. . .

67
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,090
. . .because the house is sitting on
an ancient lndian burial ground.

68
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,980
Wait a minute. The house
was built on radioactive waste. . .

69
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,370
. . .and an ancient
lndian burial ground?

70
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,890
That would never happen.

71
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,700
Obviously you don't know much
about the U.S. government.

72
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,570
-I need to talk to you.
-Sure. What's up?

73
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,100
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.

74
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,940
I know.

75
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,490
Well, if something comes up. . . .

76
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,740
I'm glad you guys are past
that little awkward phase.

77
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,370
My boss. Joanna. When you left. . .

78
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,090
. . .she started asking questions
about you. . . .

79
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,860
Liked what she saw?

80
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,090
Dug my action, did she?

81
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,210
Checking out the Chan Chan Man!

82
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,290
That was. . .

83
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,380
. . .surreal.

84
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,610
What do you think?
Are you interested?

85
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,090
She seemed cool. Attractive.
I'll do it.

86
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,690
Thank you, Chandler.
This is great. She's gonna love me.

87
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,490
Dinosaur attack!
Quick, everybody into the house!

88
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,700
All right, Phoebe, you know what?
That's it. That's it.

89
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,980
No dinosaurs, no ghosts,
no giant dogs, okay?

90
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,890
They're not the right size, they're
not victorian and they don't go.

91
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,850
Fine.

92
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,900
Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome
in the house of no imagination.

93
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,490
While we're on the subject,
I have to say that dinosaurs. . .

94
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,500
. . .they don't go, "ruff! "

95
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,620
The little ones do.

96
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,300
-Hey, Kate.
-Morning.

97
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,810
I went to that restaurant
you talked about--

98
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,290
Hey, lovely.

99
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,620
Come, talk to me for a minute.

100
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,450
I ate the food. It was good.
I had the fish.

101
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,890
I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.

102
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,930
Joey Tribbiani.

103
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,300
I know.

104
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,210
I'm a big fan of yours.

105
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,410
What?

106
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,690
I used to schedule my classes
so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray. . .

107
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,460
. . .on Days of our Lives.

108
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,330
-Get out of here. Really?
-Absolutely.

109
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,540
But then they dropped you
down that elevator shaft.

110
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,370
They gave me the shaft, all right.

111
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,050
You're so funny.

112
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,100
What are you doing after rehearsal?

113
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,170
You want to get a drink?

114
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,500
Sure. A drink sounds great.

115
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,650
-Cool. I'll see you then.
-All right.

116
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,250
All right. It's time to act,
my talking props.

117
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,650
Look everybody!
Look at my new dollhouse!

118
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,610
Look, look!

119
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,290
Hey, what's this?

120
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,250
It's a slide instead of stairs.
Look.

121
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,970
very interesting, Phoebe.

122
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,820
What's this?

123
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,500
The licorice room.
You can eat all the furniture.

124
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,650
And when guests come over, they can
stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.

125
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,410
This is the coolest house ever!

126
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,410
Does anyone want to join me
in the Aroma Room?

127
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,250
-All right.
-I would.

128
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,410
Hey, guys? Guys!

129
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,810
Did you see my new china cabinet?

130
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,690
Watch. Watch.

131
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,540
And? And?

132
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,290
Hey, my father's house does that.

133
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,140
How did it go?
Tell me everything!

134
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,570
The movie was great. . .

135
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,290
. . .dinner was great, and there's nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening.

136
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,100
Of course, I didn't enjoy any of that
because Joanna's such a dull dud!

137
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,170
Chandler is fantastic!

138
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,290
-What?
-You know how people just click?

139
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,570
He came by to pick me up, I opened
the door and it was just like, "click! "

140
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,170
Did he tell you?

141
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,980
Doesn't he have a good heart?

142
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,890
And he's so sweet. He said he'd
call, so put him straight through.

143
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,060
-Isn't this great?
-Don't spoil it.

144
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,370
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?

145
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,890
What do you say?

146
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,410
It's you.
Just one sec.

147
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,780
I'm going to take this call.

148
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,020
When I continue,
I hope there will appear on-stage. . .

149
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,570
. . .this magical thing
that in the theater we call. . .

150
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,620
. . .committing to the moment!

151
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,890
The guy's like a cartoon.

152
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,500
What do you see in him, anyway?

153
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,130
He happens to be brilliant.

154
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,300
Which is more than I can say
for that sweater you're dating.

155
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,090
I'm not interested in her sweater.

156
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,410
It's what's underneath her sweater
that counts.

157
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,330
And besides. . .

158
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,250
. . .since when do you care
who I'm with?

159
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,260
I don't care.
Why, do you want me to care?

160
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,700
Do you want me to want you to care?

161
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,490
Do you?

162
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,970
What?

163
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,090
Okay. I'm afraid to say this,
but let's pick up where we left off.

164
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,370
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?

165
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,890
I've got no reason to stay.

166
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,610
Stop!

167
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,300
Stop it! You must stop!

168
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,620
You are bad actors!

169
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,290
This is a terrible play!

170
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,690
I'll see you in the morning.

171
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,290
I can't believe we go on
in a week.

172
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,890
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

173
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,490
Since we're getting off early,
do you want to go paint mugs?

174
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,490
What?

175
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,370
At the place I told you about
last night?

176
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,490
Yeah, with the mug-painting.

177
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,890
I was so listening to that.

178
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,850
But you know what?
I need to work on my stuff tonight.

179
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,490
I'll see you tomorrow.

180
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,900
Are you okay?

181
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,500
I guess.

182
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,490
What are we gonna do about the scene?

183
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,850
I don't know.

184
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,090
Maybe if it had more heat.

185
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,290
Well, how do you mean?

186
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,300
Adrianne's looking for a reason
to stay, right?

187
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,370
victor can't just kiss her.
He's gotta. . .

188
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,810
. . .he's gotta give her a reason.

189
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,700
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

190
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,020
Or maybe. . .

191
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,010
. . .maybe he could grab her
and lift her up.

192
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,660
Then Adrianne could wrap her legs
around his waist.

193
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,900
Then she could rip off his shirt and
kiss his chest and stomach.

194
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,100
Then he could use his teeth
to undo her dress and. . .

195
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,180
. . .and bite her!

196
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,370
Then right when the scene ends,
he could take her. . .

197
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,290
. . .with this raw, animal. . . .

198
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,610
Something like that?

199
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,370
That's pretty much
what I had in mind.

200
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,700
It's a little early to be drinking.

201
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,570
Things finally happened with Kate.

202
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,570
You're kidding? That's great.

203
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,090
It was so amazing.

204
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,490
After the lovemaking. . .

205
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,620
Oh, my.

206
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,500
. . .I just watched her sleep for hours.

207
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,100
Just breathing in. . .

208
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,090
. . .and breathing out.

209
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,300
I knew she was dreaming because. . .

210
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,730
. . .her eyes kept going like this.

211
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,780
I'm telling you,
she's got it all wrong.

212
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,380
All I said was, "This was fun.
Let's do it again sometime.

213
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,770
I'll give you a call. "

214
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,340
I wonder why she thinks you're going
to call her?

215
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,900
It's what you say at the end
of a date.

216
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,770
You can't just say,
"Nice to meet you. Good night?"

217
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,530
To her face?

218
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,090
I'm standing there. . .

219
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,530
. . .she's waiting for me to say
I'll call her. . .

220
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,930
. . .and it comes out.
I can't help it.

221
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,170
It's a compulsion.

222
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,370
When a guy says he'll call,
it doesn't mean he's going to call.

223
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,620
This never happened to you?

224
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,690
Well, they always called.

225
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,090
Bite me.

226
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,420
-Did he call?
-No, sorry.

227
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,730
Why? He said he'd call.
Why hasn't he called?

228
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,860
Maybe he's intimidated by smart,
strong, successful women.

229
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,890
Sophie, will you please
climb out of my butt.

230
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,970
Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?

231
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,300
Maybe he feels awkward because
you're my boss.

232
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,380
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?

233
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,050
You didn't tell him
not to call me, did you?

234
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,130
If you're uncomfortable with
your friend dating me. . .

235
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,770
. . .there are always ways to fix that.

236
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,020
Call her. Call her now!

237
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,890
Multiple so many paper cuts.

238
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,900
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why, why? I don't understand! "

239
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,330
I'm telling you, she's flipped out!
She's gone crazy!

240
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,290
Well, give me the phone then.

241
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,420
She thinks it's my fault
you haven't called her.

242
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,890
You have to call her.

243
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,130
You can't call somebody
after this long to say:

244
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,500
"In case you didn't notice,
I don't like you. "

245
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,610
Then you'll have to
take her out again.

246
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,500
She's really dull,
and she gets this. . .

247
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,700
. . .gross mascara-goop thing
in the corner of her eye!

248
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,090
I don't care!

249
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,170
You'll take her out again
and end it. . .

250
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,690
. . .in a way she knows it's ended.

251
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,570
I don't care how hard it is.
Don't tell her you'll call her again!

252
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,780
All right, fine!

253
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,090
But just lunch.
From now on, I get my own dates.

254
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,380
I don't want you setting me up again!

255
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,530
That's fine!

256
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,500
-That's just a lot of big talk.
-I know.

257
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,100
I'm in the shower!

258
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,010
Fire! There's a fire! Fire!

259
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,690
I talked to Lauren.
I told her how things were with us.

260
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,530
Did you talk to Marshall?

261
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,650
About what?

262
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,170
About what happened with us.

263
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,090
No, there's really no reason
why he should find out.

264
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,900
So let's not make a big deal
out of it, okay?

265
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,500
What are you talking about?

266
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,890
It was a big deal.

267
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,090
You can't tell me last night
didn't mean something to you.

268
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,500
I was there.
You're not that good an actress.

269
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,610
I was just caught up in the moment.

270
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,500
That's all it was.

271
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,290
Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad, but. . .

272
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,290
. . .haven't you slept with a woman
and it meant more to her than to you?

273
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,370
Hi, pig!

274
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,940
Sorry I scared you in there.

275
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,690
It's okay.

276
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,570
By the way. . .

277
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,810
. . .I was just checking
the shower massager.

278
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,900
I tried to reach you at work.

279
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,410
There's been a fire.

280
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,090
What?
Oh, my God!

281
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,410
What happened?

282
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,300
We believe it originated here. . .

283
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,330
. . .in the Aroma Room.

284
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,290
Did everyone get out okay?

285
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,620
The giraffe's okay,
and so is the pirate.

286
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,290
-What's this?
-No, don't look!

287
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,490
You don't want to see
what's under there!

288
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,260
The foster puppets!

289
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,970
It's not a big deal. It's right
here, and it's all the time.

290
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,930
Thanks again for lunch.

291
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,140
-This was pleasant.
-It was, wasn't it?

292
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,220
-The food there was great.
-Wasn't it?

293
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,490
So take care.

294
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,130
You too.

295
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,930
I'll give you a call.
We should do it again!

296
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,490
Great. I'm looking forward to it.

297
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,210
-Any messages?
-Sophie's desk.

298
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,890
Are you gonna call her?

299
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,330
I'm sorry, okay? I'm weak
and pathetic and sorry.

300
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,930
You are gonna tell her.
You'll tell her now.

301
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,850
I'm not gonna call you.

302
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,180
What?

303
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,370
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,170
I'm sorry I said I was going to
when I'm not.

305
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,090
This has nothing to do with you.

306
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,570
And this isn't Rachel's fault.
It's me.

307
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,730
I have serious problems
when it comes to women.

308
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,940
I have issues with commitment,
intimacy. . .

309
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,930
: : :mascara goop:

310
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,330
I'm really sorry. It's just that. . .

311
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,170
. . .this isn't going to work out.

312
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,330
This isn't how I was hoping
this would end. . .

313
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,730
. . .but I guess I have to appreciate
your honesty.

314
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,370
I'll give you a call.
We should do it again sometime!

315
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,010
Anyway, Beth,
what I'm saying is. . .

316
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,940
. . .I should have considered your
feelings before I went home with you.

317
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,620
I've recently learned what it's like
to be on your side. . .

318
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,500
. . .and I'm sorry.

319
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,130
Do you think you can forgive me?

320
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,010
Great. Thanks.

321
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,500
Hello, Jennifer?

322
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,300
Hi, Mrs. Laurio.
Is Jennifer there?

323
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,770
She's not home, huh?

324
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,020
Actually I kind of need
to talk to you too.
