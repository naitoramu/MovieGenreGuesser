1
00:00:01,588 --> 00:00:03,853
Today is the first day
of Sabre's new project:

2
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:05,765
Develop a chain of retail stores.

3
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:08,260
I am meeting my new boss,
Nellie Bertram.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,548
Head of Special Projects.

5
00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:12,466
Work starts at 9:00.

6
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:15,886
Sabre HQ is 30 minutes away,
driving the speed limit.

7
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,888
Giving everyone 20 minutes to shower,

8
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:20,258
plus 50 for Jim to style his hair,

9
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:21,842
20 for breakfast,

10
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:24,895
40 for Erin to get lost
between her room and the lobby,

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,349
90 for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy.

12
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:31,519
We're already 20 minutes late.

13
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:40,161
Wake up!
[Screams]

14
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:45,032
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Wake up!

15
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,534
Ah!

16
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:47,868
Why are you sleeping that way?

17
00:00:47,886 --> 00:00:49,253
Oh.

18
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:51,639
I was reading the mattress tag,
and I fell asleep.

19
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:53,040
Stanley!

20
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,843
Wake up! You've got to wake up,
the hotel's on fire!

21
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:58,929
Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day!

22
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:01,148
[Sighs]

23
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:05,936
Mmm!

24
00:01:05,988 --> 00:01:07,571
[Grunting]

25
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:08,656
Good morning.

26
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,258
Hey, wake up.
Let's have some fun.

27
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:12,793
We're in Florida now.

28
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:15,129
Hey, you.
I'm so glad this is happening.

29
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:17,531
I actually came to your door
twice last night.

30
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:20,034
Come on in, the water's fine.

31
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:24,305
I am on the two kid sleep schedule,

32
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:26,540
so I'm up and at 'em
at 4:15,

33
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:27,842
but no kids,

34
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:30,845
so I honestly didn't know
what to do with myself,

35
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,580
and then I thought of something.

36
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:33,631
Uh--

37
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:36,684
He-e-ere's Dwi--
What the--?

38
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:42,523
- Oh, man.
- What do you think happened?

39
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:45,309
[Gasps] Looks like Jim got
mixed up with some bad apples.

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,527
[Gasps]

41
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,295
Oh, no, no, no, no.

42
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,364
It wasn't me.

43
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,100
I gotta find Luwanda
at the Alcohol Club.

44
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:54,785
Oh.

45
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,338
[Both scream]
[Gasps]

46
00:01:57,372 --> 00:02:00,341
[Cheerful music]

47
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,375

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

48
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:20,140
- Puppet.
- Cool, for your kids?

49
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:22,129
Yeah. It's weird
being away from them.

50
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:23,230
Never done this before.
[Laughs]

51
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:25,733
Attention, Dunder Mifflin Group.

52
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,435
Proceed outside.

53
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:30,438
The vehicle is waiting.
Seats have been assigned.

54
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,039
Shotgun goes to Ryan.

55
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:34,408
Congratulations, Ryan.

56
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:39,046
I need to make Nellie
see me as a leader today.

57
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:41,532
First impressions
get locked in forever.

58
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,200
When I first met Pam,
she said something

59
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,202
that slightly rubbed me the wrong way.

60
00:02:45,253 --> 00:02:47,021
Since then I've loved
working with Pam,

61
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:48,989
and she's frankly wonderful,

62
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:51,592
but I hate her.

63
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,427
I'll have a bottle of the antacid.

64
00:02:53,462 --> 00:02:55,362
Also, I want to get a souvenir
for my son,

65
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:57,131
but his mother doesn't
acknowledge my paternity.

66
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,399
Do you have anything for that?

67
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,101
Also, I want it to have
a Florida feel.

68
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:03,838
- What does he like?
- Power.

69
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:06,223
Okay, and this one is,

70
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:08,559
"Huh, don't see too many museums
around here."

71
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,445
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough.
Get in the car.

72
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,646
Hey, are you okay?

73
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,199
I'm fine, okay?
It's just stress.

74
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:17,401
You know, 'cause I care
about this project.

75
00:03:17,452 --> 00:03:18,786
And frankly, the fact that none of you

76
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,455
are vomiting or diarrheal
right now I find very alarming.

77
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,791
Who says none of us are diarrheal?

78
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:28,395
Are you sure it's stress?
Because I did poison you.

79
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,964
[Laughs] Very funny, Jim.

80
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:31,198
Oh, no, I'm serious.
I was thinking,

81
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,800
"For this trip
I have to do something epic,

82
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,868
so what should that be?"
And then I thought of it.

83
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:35,870
I'll poison you.

84
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:36,870
What are you gonna do?

85
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:38,072
You gonna steal my newspaper,

86
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:39,473
or put a cricket in my cereal,
or something?

87
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:41,392
I'm gonna set your face on fire.

88
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:45,112
That's a good one.

89
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:46,514
Whoa, Stanley.

90
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:48,715
Did you just come back from
burning down a rival nightclub?

91
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:49,984
Laugh it up, Halpert.

92
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,019
I'm in Florida for a month
without my family.

93
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:54,088
I'm gonna enjoy this.

94
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:56,390
Want to get in?
You can work the iPod.

95
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:58,492
Yes.

96
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:00,444
Ah.
You're a nice guy, Jim,

97
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:02,563
but have no idea how to vacation.

98
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:03,864
Find some Kenny Loggins.

99
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:04,949
Loggins and Messina.

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,434
Did I say "Messina?"
[Tires screech]

101
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:11,639
Ahh!

102
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:13,424
[Laughs] Sorry, I couldn't resist.

103
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,458
It's so quiet.

104
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,076
I like it.
It's so peaceful,

105
00:04:16,094 --> 00:04:18,579
I've already written, like,
12 plays today.

106
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:22,933
It's so quiet, one might say,
you could hear a pin...

107
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:27,638
I thought that would be cooler.

108
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:29,089
I loved it.

109
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:30,424
Hey, can you pick up the pin?

110
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,758
Some of us like to work
in our bare feet.

111
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:34,361
Of course, I will pick up the pin.

112
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:37,031
It is right here.

113
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:39,617
Got it.

114
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:40,968
Can we see that?
Did you really find it?

115
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:42,769
Yes, right here.
Got it.

116
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:45,122
Dink, ow.
[Chuckles]

117
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:46,457
[Clicks tongue] In the trash.

118
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:48,375
Hey, why is it so quiet?

119
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,612
Shouldn't the phone be ringing?

120
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:54,381
Uh-oh. Erin set the phone
to voicemail.

121
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,666
Oh, great.
[Overlapping chatter]

122
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:56,667
We're screwed.

123
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:58,335
There.

124
00:04:58,386 --> 00:04:59,336
[Phone ringing]

125
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:00,988
Oh! There we go.
Pam?

126
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,339
Yeah?

127
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,124
Can you get the phone?

128
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:05,292
Well, I'm not the receptionist.

129
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:07,127
Mm, well, you used to be.

130
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:09,730
I know, but I can't cover reception.

131
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:11,565
- [Grumbles]
- I have a lot of work to do.

132
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,467
Phone's ringing.

133
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:14,568
[Phone ringing]

134
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:15,903
Will one of you get the phone?

135
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:18,305
I am freaking out.
I know it's for me.

136
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:23,360
[Phone ringing]

137
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,578
Are you guys kidding me?

138
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:26,413
Stop flirting
and someone get the phone!

139
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:27,865
[General agreement]
Answer the phone.

140
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,817
- Andy, pick up the phone!
- Get the damn phone!

141
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:31,818
You're the closest one to it.

142
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:33,037
[Whining] Fine.

143
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:35,155
Hello, Dunder Mifflin.
[Phone continues ringing]

144
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:36,823
Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin.

145
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:37,841
How may I be of service?

146
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:39,510
[Boardroom chatter]
Man.

147
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:41,262
- How was the drive?
- Fantastic.

148
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:42,630
Stanley drives so fast.

149
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:45,382
Life is short. "Drive fast
and leave a sexy corpse."

150
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,668
That's one of my mottos.

151
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:50,137
I would love to hear the other mottos.

152
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,474
- Quick query, Halpert.
- No way.

153
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:56,510
- Still queer?
- Packer.

154
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:58,545
You can't put me down.

155
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,354
Too strong.

156
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:03,817
Yeah, Dwight and Jim
tried to get me fired,

157
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:06,453
but I landed on my feet
down here in Florida.

158
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:08,889
You see, this cat's got nine lives,

159
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,157
and a nine-inch--

160
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:11,408
Psst.

161
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,962
Say, "So who's leading
this thing, anyway?"

162
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:19,066
So who's leading this thing, anyway?

163
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,053
Psst. Say, "I can't wait
to meet him."

164
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:24,871
I can't wait to meet him.

165
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,258
Him, you say?

166
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,210
Don't think a woman can be a leader?

167
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:31,211
[Laughs]

168
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,212
- [Chuckles]
- I--

169
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,898
You poor, simple boy.

170
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,483
Expected a man, did you?

171
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:40,604
Strong, powerful,
huge, whopping penis?

172
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:42,556
Well, sorry to disappoint,

173
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,893
but my huge, whopping penis
is right here,

174
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,911
and I'm not afraid to use it.

175
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:53,667
So stop looking at my breasts,
and start looking at my penis.

176
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:56,069
[Slow clapping]

177
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:59,974
I'm Nellie Bertram,
president of Special Projects.

178
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:01,842
In the next few weeks
we're going to throw

179
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:04,645
everything you know about
business out of the window,

180
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,180
and do it our own way.

181
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:08,248
Are your minds blown?

182
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:11,769
So, how did this special
project come about anyway?

183
00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:18,392
Well, I interviewed to be
the manager of your branch,

184
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:22,112
after you decided I wasn't
"a good fit."

185
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:24,448
- It was--
- Ah. Mm-mmm.

186
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:25,482
It was.

187
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,234
I went on a shopping spree.

188
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:29,653
Very destructive, I bought 13 pianos.

189
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:32,940
Then I realized,
what if Sabre had a store?

190
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,158
Hmm?

191
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,277
So I called Jo, old friend,
founder of Sabre,

192
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:39,580
and I told her, and
she grabbed me by the shoulders,

193
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:41,048
and she said, "Yes!"

194
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:43,550
So let's talk about
this Sabre store then.

195
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:46,520
Probably gonna look stupid, right?

196
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:49,156
Like a big turd
with a door on the front, right?

197
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,808
What do you think it should look like?

198
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,125
Um, it might be fun

199
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:53,961
if each store had a different theme,

200
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:56,313
like a beach one, a winter one,
a jungle one.

201
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:58,399
No, not a big fan
of the winter aesthetic.

202
00:07:58,433 --> 00:07:59,967
Well, that was just one idea.
It doesn't have to be winter.

203
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,635
Oh, no, it does.

204
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,804
It does, it has to be winter,

205
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:04,905
and I reject it.

206
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:08,609
So I drew up a design concept.

207
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:10,110
Probably gonna be rubbish, right?

208
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:11,195
[Laughs]

209
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,479
Would you like to look at it?

210
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:14,698
- Just so you could laugh at it.
- Yeah.

211
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:16,050
Let me just get the projector working.

212
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:17,418
[Sighs]

213
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:18,852
You got to stop with the antacids.

214
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,354
It's not the antidote.

215
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:22,172
You didn't poison me,
it's just stress.

216
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:23,924
Okay.

217
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:24,992
What is the antidote?

218
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,126
True love's kiss.

219
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,062
Jim, help me lower this screen.

220
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:29,663
You're a big, tall man.

221
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:32,132
You'd be hilarious trying to do it,

222
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,350
like a little boy.

223
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:35,185
Just let go of his balloon.

224
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,604
I'll do it.
[Grunts]

225
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,673
I always say,
"You want something done right?

226
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:41,075
Ask Dwight."

227
00:08:41,109 --> 00:08:42,443
Right? Dwight.

228
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:44,611
Right? Dwight.
Right Dwight, right Dwight.

229
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:47,231
Sorry, now you'll never be able
to get that out of your head.

230
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:49,349
[Whimpers]

231
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,350
[Whimpering] Ah.

232
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:52,152
- I can do it.
- Mmm!

233
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:53,821
[Screams]

234
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:56,757
[Groans]

235
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,793
There we go.

236
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:06,733
Yes, a complete inability
to pass gas, pervert.

237
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,201
Ugh, yeah, it's tender.

238
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:11,371
It can't be appendicitis,
I eat more than enough bacon.

239
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:14,708
Okay, what poison mimics
the symptoms of appendicitis?

240
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:16,426
Oh, you don't know.
Hold on.

241
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:22,816
[Grunting and groaning]

242
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,185
What kind of poison did you use?

243
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:28,355
Dwight, I didn't poison you.
I was kidding.

244
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,110
Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance.

245
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,912
[Grunts]

246
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:39,232
Hold on, I have the address
in my phone. Hold on.

247
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,101
Hold on one second.

248
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:42,903
Uh, quick question.

249
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:45,422
Vice president, uh, who is that?

250
00:09:45,456 --> 00:09:47,374
- There's no name listed.
- Is there not?

251
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:50,744
Maybe I'm just waiting
for someone to wow me.

252
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:56,950
[On phone] Sir? Sir, where
should we send the ambulance?

253
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:59,219
Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.

254
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,561
I tell you what.
Since I moved down to Florida,

255
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:06,181
I've really gotten back
into hunting big time.

256
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:08,934
Hunting's so primal.
Almost sexual.

257
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:10,218
Totally.

258
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:12,053
I mean, I'd never bang an animal,

259
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:13,104
you can hardly tell the difference

260
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,439
between a boy or a girl, you know,

261
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:15,840
but hunting's intense.

262
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,225
You talking about hunting?

263
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:19,644
I love hunting.
I'm a master hunter.

264
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:20,779
Did you say,
"masturbator?"

265
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:21,947
I'm a decent baiter.

266
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,782
My cousin, Mose,
that's a master baiter.

267
00:10:23,816 --> 00:10:25,917
Why are you sitting down like that?

268
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:27,886
Why is everyone else standing up?

269
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,821
Okay, team, let's get back to work!

270
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:31,856
Break's over!

271
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:35,243
Wow. Are that bored?

272
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,263
It's just rum.
I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.

273
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:39,530
Is that another motto?

274
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,866
It's whatever you want.

275
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:43,034
Mmm.

276
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:44,936
Or do you only drink with your kids?

277
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:46,087
Ah, let's do it.
[Laughs]

278
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:47,372
Oh, that's healthy.

279
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,841
I've spent so much of my life
telling myself,

280
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:53,511
"Please, don't end up like Stanley,"

281
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:58,083
and now I'm wondering
if I even have what it takes.

282
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:01,886
We have the Sabre pyramid, right?

283
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:05,223
Hmm? We've got
a bunch of humans, you guys,

284
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:07,442
humans... pyramid.

285
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:09,778
Human pyramid.
Do you follow?

286
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:12,731
It's a team-building
exercise.

287
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:14,783
You'll love it.
Who's in? Hmm?

288
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:15,784
- Yup.
- Yeah.

289
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:17,168
Tallahassee, let's go.

290
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:18,253
Jim, are you in?

291
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:19,287
Oh, I don't know.

292
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:21,406
Sounds like a hoot.
I'm in.

293
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:24,309
All right, what the heck?
Let's do it.

294
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:26,628
This is great.
This is gonna be great.

295
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,047
I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt.

296
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:30,548
I'll be on top.

297
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:31,582
It's the most important position.

298
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,101
Dude, I think you have appendicitis.

299
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:34,419
Ahh!

300
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:35,586
- Dwight?
- Dwight, why don't we just

301
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:37,755
hold off with
the human pyramids for a while?

302
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:39,958
Everyone stop moving!
Everyone stop wiggling!

303
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,359
Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!

304
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:42,661
Dude, don't you yak on me.

305
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:43,812
This shirt is Van Heusen.

306
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:44,946
[Groans] Stop moving!

307
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:46,097
No one's moving.

308
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:47,699
[Struggles] Ohh!

309
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:48,733
[Laughs]

310
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:51,269
Oh, oh!
[General commotion]

311
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:53,288
Arrest Jim.
He poisoned me.

312
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:56,107
Wha--no.
No, it was not a poisoning.

313
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,209
The one thing Pam made sure I knew,

314
00:11:58,244 --> 00:12:00,645
Florida's pretty loose
with the death penalty.

315
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,447
You need an operation.
You have appendicitis.

316
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:03,781
Oh! Who called it?

317
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,166
Nothing but net.

318
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:06,468
How long will he be gone?

319
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:08,003
Two or three days.

320
00:12:08,054 --> 00:12:10,088
Don't remember me like this.

321
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,474
Remember me as the man
who pulled down the screen.

322
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:15,510
Drama queen, am I right?

323
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:19,314
Philip, if you're hearing this memo,

324
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:22,350
that can only mean one thing,
I'm dead.

325
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:24,686
You are the rightful heir
to Shrute Farms.

326
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:27,272
Please, you must do one thing.

327
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:31,876
Kill Mose before he kills you.

328
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:33,495
[Grunts]

329
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,697
Mose, hey, it's Dwight.

330
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:37,332
Listen, yeah, I just
want to give you a heads-up.

331
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:39,150
That was an interesting diversion.

332
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,586
Shall we get back to the meeting?

333
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,254
Whoa, are those mini pizzas?

334
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,173
Yeah, I figured
we'd keep things savory

335
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:47,559
while Oscar's mouth
is in canker country.

336
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:50,045
I also have some
bacon-wrapped dates on deck.

337
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:52,630
Look at these little mini pizzas.

338
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:54,299
Does this make me look huge?

339
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,350
[Giggles]

340
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:58,503
Hey, guys, look at me, I'm huge.

341
00:12:58,521 --> 00:12:59,838
[Laughs]
Hey, Darryl,

342
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:01,523
good news, your fax went through.

343
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:04,476
Oh, [bleep] yeah.

344
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,560
- Up high.
- Yes, sir. Thanks.

345
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:06,878
[Phone ringing]

346
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,380
Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy.

347
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:09,397
[Whispering]
I put out some new magazines.

348
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:10,482
Check it out.

349
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:13,568
A <i>dwell.</i>

350
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:17,405
I'm acting like I like reception,

351
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:18,856
and I'm a really good actor,

352
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:22,327
so people are actually buying
that I actually like reception,

353
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:24,662
but I mean, seriously,
reception sucks.

354
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:27,499
[Phone ringing] Oh, there's the phone.

355
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:31,970
What's going on?
Fill me in.

356
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:33,405
Well, we broke into groups,

357
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,090
and the groups
are giving presentations later.

358
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,975
Who's doing the presentations?

359
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:39,394
- Packer's giving one.
- [Growls]

360
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:40,445
Jim will probably give ours, I guess.

361
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,597
Damn it!
[Groans]

362
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:44,682
Let's see, what else have you missed?

363
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:46,885
Ryan switched his name tag
to his pants,

364
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,853
so now it's like,
if you wear yours on your shirt,

365
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:52,273
you're a total dick, but
if you switch, you're a copycat.

366
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:55,026
But I think I figured out a solution.

367
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,661
What else?

368
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:58,763
My shoes are gonna--
[Sighs]

369
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,198
Features a tech support area.

370
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:02,283
Bring in your product,
a bunch of nerdy virgins

371
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,535
fix it on the spot.

372
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,286
Huge for building loyalty.

373
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:07,088
Yes, that is a very good point.

374
00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:09,090
[Panting] Yeah, Todd, decent idea.

375
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,543
Obvious, but interesting.

376
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:13,428
Dwight, are you all right?

377
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:15,930
I'm great.
How are you?

378
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:19,434
Mmm.

379
00:14:19,468 --> 00:14:22,470
Uh.

380
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:23,921
[Whispering]
What's our presentation about?

381
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:25,557
Dwight, will you go back
to the hospital?

382
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:26,941
You were there for like three hours.

383
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:28,660
I got the surgery,
what else is there to do?

384
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:30,094
Do 100 jumping Jacks.

385
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:31,863
No, I don't feel like it.
You do 100 jumping Jacks.

386
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:33,231
I don't feel like it, either.

387
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:35,967
97, 98, 99--

388
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,535
I want that vice presidency.

389
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,769
You haven't done any of the research.

390
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:40,405
"You're too slow, you're too small,

391
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:41,706
Seabiscuit
is a stupid name."

392
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,541
You guys sound just like
the enemies of Seabiscuit.

393
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:47,612
- I'm going to do it.
- Aw, let him do it.

394
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:49,297
Stanley, are you listening to music?

395
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:51,082
Yup.

396
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:54,302
All right, who's ready
for the next presentation?

397
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:56,971
Ah, what is your topic?

398
00:14:57,006 --> 00:15:00,091
What is our topic?
Oh, what a topic it is.

399
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,676
Retail consumer habits.

400
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:03,795
Really? Okay.

401
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:07,098
Retail consumer habits is...

402
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:09,067
[Sighs]

403
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:11,069
The only thing you need to know
about retail consumer habits

404
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,022
is that consumers
are mindless lemmings.

405
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:18,409
They just want to be told what to do.

406
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:20,078
Fast-forward to today,

407
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:23,248
and the retail consumer
is independent,

408
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:26,784
well-informed,
super-smart.

409
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:29,220
Super-smart.
Okay.

410
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,254
Shopping habits

411
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:35,489
are both seasonal and cyclical.

412
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:37,111
What does this mean?

413
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,238
- I can field this one.
- No, sit down.

414
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,441
"Seasonal." Well,
the Christmas shopping season

415
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:46,028
is certainly a busy one,
back-to-school is, as well,

416
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:47,946
and in early summer,
it seems to slow down a bit,

417
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,549
but shopping is also cyclical.

418
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,736
The menstrual cycle determines
every choice a woman makes.

419
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,922
You see, during ovulation,

420
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,259
a woman's only goal
is to get pregnant,

421
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,795
and during menses,
she is sad that she has failed,

422
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,431
and how does the woman
console herself?

423
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,234
Shopping.
Shopping.

424
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,602
Just--

425
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,056
Jim, could you fetch me
some ice chips?

426
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,008
Thank you.
Just gonna...

427
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,977
Take a... brief pause
at this point.

428
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,847
Thank you.

429
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,549
Oh, God.

430
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:29,821

Are those the lyrics?

"Anderson's
Three Pillars of Retail."

441
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,414
Crucial.
So important.

442
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,633
Next.

443
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,518
Are there any questions?

444
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,554
What are the three pillars of retail?

445
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,124
[Whispering] Convenience.

446
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,292
Ingredients.

Burgers.

449
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,495
Building loyalty.

450
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,331
Killing royalty.

451
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,816
The truth be told,
we should really disregard

452
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,101
Anderson's three pillars.

453
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,670
He was later diagnosed with dementia.

454
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,607
You know what is important?

455
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:25,127
Is Dwight's pillars,
and there is only one:

456
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,461
desire.

457
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:29,965
Do we have a desire
to dominate the retail space?

458
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:32,284
Not just succeed in it,
but to dominate,

459
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,653
and looking around this room,
I'm not so sure that we do,

460
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,639
but we can get there,
and I can lead us there,

461
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:39,925
and that is all that matters.

462
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,193
Very true.

463
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,594
Where there's a will, there's a way.

464
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:47,349
I once spent a passionate night
with Hugh Grant's brother,

465
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,835
John grant.
He's older than Hugh,

466
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,570
just a little bit uglier.

467
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,138
How did I pull that off?

468
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,740
Sheer force of will.

469
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,842
That is very good, Dwight.

470
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,661
Thank you very much.
Any other questions?

471
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,146
Jim.

472
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,333
You are bleeding through your shirt.

473
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,668
Oops.

474
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:08,587
That's embarrassing.

475
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,823
Egg on my face.

476
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,992
Ah.

477
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,995
Hey, having fun?

478
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,097
Yes, I am, as a matter of fact.

479
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,833
Well, I know how it is.
I know it's a lot of fun.

480
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,235
I don't know how it is.

481
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,471
Andy, this is a lame job.
What are you doing here?

482
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,939
I found my calling.

483
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,008
Andy, when I was 12 years old,

484
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,912
we did a field trip,
a lock-in at the zoo.

485
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,949
I met this girl,
I thought she was so perfect.

486
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,318
I was in love with her,

487
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,487
but when the sun came up,
I knew it wasn't real,

488
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:46,425
'cause she was ugly,
and I had grown tired of her.

489
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,060
I know you want reception today,

490
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,761
but tomorrow you won't want to do her.

491
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,997
She's a dog.

492
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,367
Guys, I don't like this analogy.

493
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,918
[Groaning] Ohh!

494
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,771
Fine.

495
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,277
Did you see this?

496
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,562
- It's nice.
- I mean...

497
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,898
[Giggles]

498
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:12,818
- How are you feeling?
- Amazing.

499
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,552
Just lost four ounces of appendix,

500
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,488
already replaced it with muscle.

501
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,291
Can I see the wound?

502
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,077
[Grunts]

503
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,614
- Oh, God.
- Oh! That's disgusting!

504
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,499
That's barely healed.

505
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,669
You're not paying me to heal,
you're paying me to kick ass.

506
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:35,340
A few hours ago, your body
was open like a cabinet.

507
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,709
- That's right.
- That is amazing.

508
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:40,545
- Todd, look at that.
- Oh, yikes.

509
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,764
- Incom--
- Ah! Not so fast.

510
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,549
Would you come in early tomorrow,

511
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,685
so we can talk about the store
over breakfast?

512
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,754
I feel you have a lot to offer.

513
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,223
It would be an honor, ma'am.

514
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,092
I'll go ahead and cancel
my post-op check-up right now.

515
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,961
I had two goals today.

516
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,129
The first was to make myself

517
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,197
the clear candidate
for vice president.

518
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:02,067
I achieved that,
no thanks to my appendix.

519
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,936
The second was to find
a memorable souvenir for Philip.

520
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:09,374
For that, I do have to
thank my appendix.

521
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,545
[Phone ringing]

522
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,353
Dunder Mifflin, how can I
help you save money on paper?

523
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,421
This is Andrew.

524
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,756
Hi, Andrew.
What happened to Erin?

525
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,791
Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida

526
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,727
- for a couple of weeks.
- Oh, good for her.

527
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,028
She's such a sweetheart.

528
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,997
You tell her Donna Muraski misses her.

529
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:35,033
Yeah, we all kind of miss her.

530
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:39,473
Everyone, we have a very special guest.

531
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:44,167
He turned an idea into a store,
into hundreds of stores.

532
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:48,024
I give you Wally Amos,
founder of famous Amos Cookies.

533
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:48,682
Yeah!
[Cheers and applause]

534
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:50,217
Ah.

535
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:53,016
Aloha, aloha, aloha.

536
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:54,387
So I hear you're all

537
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,223
looking to bake up some dough
in the sales game?

538
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,022
[Laughter] Well, back when I was

539
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:01,457
- a regular Amos...
- What's under the cloth?

540
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:02,853
We'll get to that.

541
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,770
***

542
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,794
It's cookies.

543
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,989
Let me... Let me finish my speech first.

544
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:13,154
***, isn't it?

545
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:15,496
*** make with the cookies.

546
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:17,970
Okay, yes.

547
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:23,686
Amos. Hi. I'm sure you get ideas
for your cookies all the time.

548
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:27,248
- But...
- Is it oatmeal with no rasins?

549
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:29,976
I'm sorry, I was wasting your time.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
