1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,467
I'm having dinner with my dad
tomorrow. Wanna come?

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,803
Sure. He's kind of sexy.

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,763
I'll be there too.

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:19,186
So we'll come up with a signal.
If it's going well, you can take off.

5
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,565
I need your support.
I haven't told him I'm pregnant.

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,025
Oh. Why not?

7
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,404
He's gonna flip out.
I hate it when he's angry.

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,365
This is all so "Papa Don't Preach."

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,077
He's scary.
Once, he caught me smoking.

10
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,914
He said if I did it again,
he'd make me eat the pack.

11
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,625
Wow. Well, I will be there.

12
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:46,005
I won't let that man
make you eat your baby!

13
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:51,010
Hey, who is that guy?
I think I know him.

14
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:53,095
No, you don't.

15
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:58,391
Oh, my God! Monica, he's the stripper
from your bachelorette party!

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,896
Her what?

17
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,276
Your secret bachelorette party.

18
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:12,322
- Bachelorette party?
- She untied his G-string with her teeth.

19
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,575
Somebody stop me!

20
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:21,415
We weren't gonna have parties.
We agreed that it's a silly tradition.

21
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,376
It's a grand tradition!

22
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,129
They surprised me.
There was nothing I could do.

23
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,299
You could've untied it
with your hands.

24
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,055
This is so unfair. I wanted
to throw a bachelor party...

25
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,349
...but I wasn't allowed.
All we got was dinner.

26
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,644
You went home with the waitress.

27
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,064
Yeah, that was a good night.

28
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,358
Why didn't you tell me?

29
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:52,696
The two pillars of marriage
are openness and honesty.

30
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:57,909
I knew giving you that book would
come back and bite me in the ass.

31
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,412

34
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:43,580
- I'll order everyone the chicken.
- Oh, I don't eat meat.

35
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,374
It's chicken!

36
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,629
- I don't eat that either.
- I never understand you lesbians.

37
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,677
- So, what's new with you?
- Well, actually...

38
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,888
Your '74 Lafite, sir.

39
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,517
I ordered the '75. That's a
magnificent wine. '74 is sewage!

40
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,812
Why would you bring me sewage?

41
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:12,025
Are you an idiot?
Is that why you're a waiter?

42
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,862
This is why I didn't want
to wait on you.

43
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,031
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a baby.

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,413
In case you didn't notice,
that is a scary man.

45
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,250
He's right, though.
The '74 is absolute piss.

46
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,630
This was a huge mistake.
I can't tell him. I can't.

47
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,882
Rachel...

48
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,637
I'm gonna wait a couple of years,
and then the baby will tell him.

49
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,227
- Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
- That's the baby's problem.

50
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:54,235
- Everything okay with the waiter?
- I don't know. I went to the bathroom.

51
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:01,116
So, sweetie, you were starting
to tell me what's new with you.

52
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,539
I got TiVo.

53
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:12,461
- What's TiVo?
- It's slang for "pregnant."

54
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,051
Are you pregnant?

55
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,471
Well, yes and no.

56
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,848
Except, not no.

57
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,351
So to sum it up, yeah.

58
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,772
Who is the father?
Please don't tell me it's her!

59
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,819
No, it's Ross. You like Ross.

60
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,698
I hope you're okay with this.

61
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,453
This is a good thing.
This is your first grandchild!

62
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,038
You're gonna be a poppy!

63
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,459
That's true. I'm a poppy!

64
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,253
I'm gonna be a poppy!

65
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,884
- So when is the wedding?
- The who?

66
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,430
The wedding.
There's going to be a wedding.

67
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,228
Young lady, don't you tell me my first
grandchild is gonna be a bastard!

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,275
- Tell me there's gonna be a wedding!
- February 2nd!

69
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,741
It was cool seeing you lecture today.

70
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,580
Thanks. Although it seemed like
you were falling asleep.

71
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,252
No, I had my eyes closed so I could
concentrate and take it all in.

72
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,630
A lot of my students do that.

73
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,718
- I've got to get going.
- I'll see you tonight?

74
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:50,350
Thanks for showing me your semiprecious
stone collection. It was amazing.

75
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,105
My God, you must be good in bed.

76
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,652
So you and Mona. It's been a while.
How is it?

77
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,945
It's going good.

78
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:05,574
I mean, we get along great.
She's so...

79
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,036
- Hot?
- I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!

80
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,081
She's okay with the baby?

81
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,502
I haven't actually told her yet.
I don't wanna scare her off.

82
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,048
You have to be honest, or you may
think you're on the same path...

83
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,426
...but you're on different ones.

84
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:28,013
I'm gonna take that book
and beat you to death with it.

85
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,766
You are gonna love me so much.

86
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,686
I felt bad about
the bachelorette party...

87
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,190
...so tonight you're gonna have
a bachelor party.

88
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:43,236
I got this number from a guy at work
and I hired a stripper for you.

89
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,365
I'm going in the wife hall of fame!

90
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:52,037
- Honey, I don't want a stripper.
- Will you let the lady talk?

91
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,458
Come on, it'll be fun.
It'll make me feel better.

92
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:02,381
I appreciate it, but it's a little
creepy. I'm not a bachelor anymore.

93
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:07,219
Just think of it as
a two-month anniversary present.

94
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:11,640
Sure. One year is paper,
but two months is lap dance.

95
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:17,062
Please, I feel so bad.
Just watch the hot woman get naked!

96
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,191
- Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.
- Yeah!

97
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,486
And Joey.

98
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:30,158
- Who else do you wanna invite?
- Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.

99
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,787
I can't make it.
I'm seeing Mona tonight.

100
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,707
Why cancel a real date
to go to a fake bachelor party?

101
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,295
I'm sorry.
I gotta cancel tonight, baby.

102
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:51,013
I'm sorry I won't make it to your
imaginary wedding. I'm busy that day.

103
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,769
I already have a unicorn baptism
and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.

104
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,231
I know. I panicked.

105
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,320
I didn't want him yelling at me
like I was some '74 Latour.

106
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,322
It's Lafite.

107
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,201
The '74 Latour is actually
drinking quite nicely.

108
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,456
I'm gonna tell him.
I'm gonna be strong.

109
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,875
I just called a friend.

110
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:24,797
I think I may be able
to book the Plaza on short notice.

111
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,507
Really?

112
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,385
The Plaza?

113
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,845
Oh, Daddy!

114
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,934
- Daddy, I need to talk to you.
- What is it, sweetie?

115
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,522
Ross and I aren't getting married.

116
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,149
- I'm sorry.
- I don't believe this!

117
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:48,153
- Stay calm, please.
- How do you expect me to stay calm?

118
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:52,074
This is unacceptable, Rachel.
And I wanna know why!

119
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,243
Is it because that punk
won't marry you?

120
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:59,540
- Is that it?
- Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.

121
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,634
You nervous about getting married?

122
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,055
What are you doing?

123
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,810
Pretend it's a real bachelor party.
It'll be more fun.

124
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,314
All right. I can't believe
tomorrow's the big day.

125
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:29,111
You're never gonna be
with another woman.

126
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,908
You have to wake up
to the same face every day...

127
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,036
...until you finally have
the sweet release of death.

128
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,625
You're right. This is more fun.

129
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,086
That's her! Okay, come on!

130
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,806
Which one of you is Chandler?

131
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,892
That's me!

132
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,311
That's me.

133
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,857
Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.

134
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:11,069
- Is that a bedroom?
- Yeah, right over there.

135
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,238
Whenever you're ready.

136
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,950
That was weird.

137
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:21,372
- Why would she go in the bedroom?
- I'm waiting.

138
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,927
- So she's a...
- Yeah, that's one naked hooker.

139
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,349
I love your place.
Where is this guy from?

140
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,894
That's an 18th-century artifact
from Calcutta.

141
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,437
Oh. Wow.

142
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:50,108
So you're more than just dinosaurs.

143
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,653
So much more.

144
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,411
Oh, my God! I am so sorry!

145
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,872
Forget it. It's from Pier 1.

146
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,711
Sorry.

147
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,094
Think you can knock up my daughter
and not marry her?

148
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,763
I ought to kill you!

149
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,810
This is actually not
a great time for me.

150
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:34,194
So come on.
Explain yourself, Geller.

151
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,364
- You got Rachel pregnant!
- You got her pregnant?

152
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,407
- Who did?
- You did!

153
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:44,997
Yes, but it was a one-night thing.
It meant nothing.

154
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,084
Oh? Really? My daughter means nothing?

155
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:53,171
No, sir. She means a lot to me.
I love Rachel.

156
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,966
- What?
- But not that way.

157
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,178
I'm not in love.
I love her like a friend.

158
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,889
So you get her in trouble
and refuse to marry her?

159
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:07,477
I offered to marry her.
But I didn't want to.

160
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,065
Why not? You wanted to be
with this tramp?

161
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,567
Tramp?

162
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona.
Mona, Dr. Green.

163
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,618
I can't believe there is
a naked hooker in there!

164
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,537
Maybe she's a hooker
and a stripper...

165
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,707
...but she got confused
about what to do.

166
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,920
Maybe. Technically, she stripped.
We just missed it.

167
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,383
Ma'am?

168
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,720
Are you also a stripper?

169
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,098
No, but I can pretend to strip.
Costs extra.

170
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:48,352
Here's the extras:
Handcuffs, spanking...

171
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,648
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.

172
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:57,569
Getting her husband a hooker.
That's pretty funny.

173
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:02,408
That is funny. Maybe for my birthday
she'll murder someone.

174
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:07,496
I'll bet Ross was in on it.
He was conveniently busy.

175
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:11,709
- You mind if I smoke in here?
- Actually, I'd rather...

176
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:16,088
Go ahead. We're gonna have to
burn that room, anyway.

177
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,802
- How could you hide this?
- I wanted to tell you, but...

178
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,722
You'd get what you wanted,
then dump her, like Rachel.

179
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:30,311
Hey, I did not dump Rachel.
Nor are we still together.

180
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,315
Can l...?

181
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,695
We'll just let the machine get that.

182
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,699
"Ross", "it's Joey."
<i>There's a hooker here.</i>

183
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,993
<i>We thought you'd</i>
<i>know something about it.</i>

184
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,079
No! No! No!

185
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,497
No!

186
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,042
I need to lie down.

187
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,465
Tonight's the bachelor party?

188
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:04,511
- Thanks for that number.
- No problem. Who's the party for?

189
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,098
- My husband.
- You hired your husband a hooker?

190
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,934
- She's a stripper.
- No, a hooker.

191
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,480
- Is that a name for strippers?
- Lf they're hookers.

192
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,901
Stu, I can't believe you did this.

193
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,069
You're sure she's a hooker?

194
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,158
Either that, or she's the best,
most expensive date I ever had.

195
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:34,541
- Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
- Why would she do that?

196
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,752
Maybe she wants you
to learn something.

197
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,925
Is there anything
you're really bad at, sexually?

198
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:48,013
This is the worst
bachelor party ever.

199
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:52,101
- What's taking you boys so long?
- In a minute!

200
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:55,062
What's gonna happen in a minute?

201
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,940
You should ask her to leave.

202
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,192
- Why me?
- It's your party.

203
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:05,156
- Which is why you should do it.
- No, you do it.

204
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:09,535
Rock, paper, scissors
for who tells the whore to leave.

205
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,874
- What?
- I miss this.

206
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,461
I don't think we've
done this before.

207
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,172
No, I miss hanging out with you.

208
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,550
- We still hang out.
- Not like we used to.

209
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,804
Remember? We used to be inseparable.

210
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:33,767
You know, now it's like
things are different.

211
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:38,188
Well, you know, things are different.
I'm married now.

212
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,691
Don't get me wrong,
I'm happy for you guys.

213
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:47,114
I just miss hanging out.
Just us, you know?

214
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,117
Yeah, I miss that too.

215
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,620
From now on,
we'll make time to hang out.

216
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,707
You got it. Come here.

217
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,045
Oh, God.

218
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:05,132
Listen, I am this close
to robbing you guys.

219
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,093
She's a hooker!
She's a...

220
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:13,890
Hi. We spoke on the phone.

221
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,482
So your dad dropped by.

222
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,901
He's a pleasant man.

223
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,487
- Oh, no.
- I better go.

224
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,997
Just over here.
I can't miss the fight.

225
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,040
Ross, I am so sorry.

226
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,795
I'll straighten this out
tomorrow in person.

227
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,630
Or via e-mail.

228
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:50,510
I don't care about your dad.
Mona is totally freaked out!

229
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:54,223
I'll fix that too.
What's her e-mail?

230
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:58,310
I'll fix this.
I swear I'll talk to her.

231
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,270
Okay. Thank you.

232
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:04,691
That's it?
You call that a fight?

233
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,738
"We were on a break!" "No we weren't!"
What happened to you two?

234
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,039
Thank you so much
for coming back over.

235
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,001
Oh, good. You're here.

236
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,880
And I was worried that
it would be uncomfortable.

237
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,048
Mona, just hear me out.

238
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,219
I'm sorry about my father
yelling at you.

239
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,972
But you held your own.
You have to tell me how.

240
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,475
- Focus.
- Okay.

241
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,853
Yes, Ross and I used to date.

242
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,399
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.

243
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:49,611
But we are definitely not
getting back together.

244
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:53,491
- How can I be sure?
- We drove each other crazy.

245
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:59,746
He was possessive, jealous.
He couldn't let the little things go.

246
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,082
Trying to date this woman.

247
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,837
None of that compared
to how kind and gentle...

248
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,256
...and thoughtful he is.

249
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,426
You probably shouldn't touch me.

250
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:16,430
I don't want something so complicated.

251
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:20,016
But what relationship
is not complicated?

252
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,103
We all have our baggage.
You must too.

253
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,481
Why else would you still be single?

254
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,193
I'm so gonna leave right now.

255
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,323
Should I leave this open?

256
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,911
I'm not sure.
Why didn't you just tell me?

257
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,331
It has nothing to do
with how I feel.

258
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:47,086
- You still should have told me.
- I was going to...

259
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:52,090
...but I thought you should hear it
from Rachel's father.

260
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,760
I made a mistake...

261
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,515
...but it's only because
I really like you. Really.

262
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:05,229
Okay. I guess you can
close the door now.

263
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:20,786
Forgot my purse.
Oh, you guys made up.

264
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,624
Good kisser, isn't he?
I'm going!

265
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,841
I swear I didn't know
she was a hooker.

266
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,553
You let her smoke?

267
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:43,767
Her ass-print is still on our quilt.
Really want to talk about smoking?

268
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,563
I'm gonna make this up to you.

269
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,481
I promised a stripper...

270
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,237
...and you're gonna get a stripper.

271
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,365
- Monica, wait.
- What?

272
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,285
Carry on.

273
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,388
These tennis shoes are so tight.

274
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:26,476
- I think I'll take them off.
- Could you not narrate?

275
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,771
Gotcha, sailor.

276
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,657
<i>Just because</i>
<i>you're not in love...</i>

277
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,913
- You told your dad the truth.
- An hour ago.

278
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,542
- Wanna go see a movie?
- Yes.

279
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,172
Bye, Dad.

280
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,514
<i>It's unacceptable! What does love</i>
<i>have to do with it?</i>

281
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:07,268
<i>There are more important things</i>
<i>than love.</i>

282
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:15,567
<i>You have to think about</i>
<i>the consequences of your decisions!</i>

283
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:22,199
I do think about
the consequences of my decisions!

284
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,577
What gives you the right to...?

285
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,080
Go to hell!

286
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,380
Stupid guy on my phone.

287
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,261
