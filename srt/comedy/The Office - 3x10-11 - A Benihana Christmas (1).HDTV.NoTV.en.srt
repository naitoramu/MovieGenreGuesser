1
00:00:04,555 --> 00:00:06,325
Merry Christmas.

2
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:07,626
Merry Christ... No!

3
00:00:07,673 --> 00:00:09,728
Why are you...
why did you bring that here?

4
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:11,868
Don't worry, she's dead. Oh, wait...

5
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:13,904
He's dead.

6
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:15,158
Dwight, what...

7
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:19,249
I accidentally ran over it.
It's a Christmas miracle.

8
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:20,446
Get it out of here!

9
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:21,549
Relax, okay?

10
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,369
And because this is Christmas,

11
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:25,923
I am going
to roast this goose and prepare it

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,487
with a wild rice dressing.

13
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:31,105
Do we have any
cayenne pepper in the kitchen?

14
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,999
Merry Christmas, Dwight.

15
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:35,394
What have we got here?

16
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:36,552
What does it look like?

17
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:38,222
Dead goose.

18
00:00:38,307 --> 00:00:39,613
And circle gets the square.

19
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:40,645
All right.

20
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:43,935
So can you watch this? I'm gonna
get my carving knife out of the trunk.

21
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:45,264
Dwight, we talked about this.

22
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:46,923
No, Toby, this is different.

23
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:48,479
He is already dead.

24
00:00:48,997 --> 00:00:51,538
Once, I brought in a duck
to prepare for lunch.

25
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:53,908
And people got upset.

26
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:58,832
Apparently, they go attached to the duck
and didn't want to see it killed.

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,999
He was already dead.

28
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:02,555
And we Schrutes
use every part of the goose.

29
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:05,631
The meat has a delicious,
smoky, rich flavor.

30
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:08,988
Plus, you can use the molten goose
grease and save it in the refrigerator.

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,311
Thus saving you a trip to the store
for a can of expensive goose grease.

32
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:13,489
Oh, win-win.

33
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,195
- Exactly.
- Thank you, Jim.

34
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:16,873
I like goose and it's already dead.

35
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,277
Is it so crazy if we eat it?

36
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:20,002
That's crazy. It's crazy.

37
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:22,500
Dwight, you cannot keep that here.

38
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:23,886
Okay, that is ridiculous.

39
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,307
and totally against
the spirit of Christmas.

40
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,288
Come on, Dwight.

41
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:31,342
We went over this,
like, for a half an hour.

42
00:01:36,273 --> 00:01:37,631
- you can't...
- Toby...

43
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:38,706
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,053
Please?

45
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:42,844
Please?

46
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:48,031
Clean it in your car.

47
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,934
I would like it off my desk.

48
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:53,681
Oh, Pam... Take a chill pill.

85
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,910
Ah, beep!

86
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:38,060
Hey!

87
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:40,181
I would like

88
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:41,897
a nice slice

89
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:43,603
of Christmas Pam.

90
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:45,055
Side of candy Pams.

91
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:46,855
And perhaps...

92
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,222
some Pam chops.

93
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,249
- Can I help you, Michael?
- With mint.

94
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:53,755
I'm looking for the toy drive box.

95
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:55,838
- It's behind you.
- Okay.

96
00:02:55,895 --> 00:02:58,902
Well, I need to put this bike in there.

97
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:02,097
I hope it'll fit
with all these little knickknacks.

98
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:04,775
What kind of bike is that?

99
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:06,321
Um, I don't know.

100
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:07,612
Average kind.

101
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,385
The tires look pretty worn.

102
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:11,883
Well, that is probably
from the test drive.

103
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:13,335
But the paint's chipping.

104
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,102
Is that your old bike, Michael?

105
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,050
Yo, Michael. Sweet ride, Mike.

106
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:19,097
Oh, thanks.

107
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,279
- Michael...
- Yes?

108
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,135
Oh, Pam.

109
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:27,587
That is so sweet.

110
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:28,879
You didn't have to do that.

111
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:30,481
I didn't. It's from corporate.

112
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:31,960
Okay.

113
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:33,638
- Did everybody get one of these?
- Yep.

114
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:35,429
Terrific. Good!

115
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,936
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

116
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:40,906
My girlfriend Carol
is coming to our party tonight.

117
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,187
And I have a little surprise for her.

118
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:45,255
I've got

119
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:48,564
two tickets to paradise

120
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:51,797
Pack your bags,
we're leaving day after tomorrow

121
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:54,889
Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica.

122
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:55,817
All-inclusive.

123
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:57,651
All-inclusive.

124
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:59,517
You know what that means.

125
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,007
Right?

126
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:02,319
Yeah.

127
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:12,441
I think you're supposed
to put a toy in the box, Creed.

128
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,167
And a happy holiday to you.

129
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:23,394
- Carol.
- Hi, is Michael around here?

130
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:24,667
There she is!

131
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:26,505
A Christmas Carol.

132
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,542
Hello.

133
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:31,126
You're about
five hours early to the party.

134
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:33,148
Oh, you're such a blonde.

135
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:35,891
Hey, everybody!

136
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:38,969
I don't know who you haven't met yet,

137
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:40,826
but I think this is one of them.

138
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:42,758
This is my girlfriend, Carol.

139
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:44,653
This is just the front of her.

140
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,652
Show 'em... show 'em the other side.

141
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,886
- What?
- Turn around. Turn around.

142
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:49,945
Come on.

143
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:52,577
- Get out of here.
- Oh, you get out of here.

144
00:04:53,112 --> 00:04:54,326
- Yes?
- If I may say,

145
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,996
she's even prettier
than you described her.

146
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,574
Oh, ouch!

147
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:02,317
Michael, I don't think there's anything
wrong with the way you described her.

148
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,660
- Thank you.
- I really need a moment alone with you.

149
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:07,765
Not as much as I need
a moment alone with you.

150
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:13,104
What is this?

151
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,661
That is my Christmas card.

152
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,846
It's a picture of you and me and
your kids on a ski trip, having a blast.

153
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:21,223
"Ski-son's Greetings."

154
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,509
No, see...

155
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:24,243
We never went on a ski trip.

156
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:25,205
I know, I know.

157
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,920
- I went on a ski trip...
- Right.

158
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,431
... two years ago,
with my kids and my ex-husband.

159
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,174
Yes, but what you didn't realize
at the time was

160
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:35,614
that I was with you, in a sense.
I was in your heart

161
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:38,112
- Michael...
- and next to your kids. What?

162
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,413
This is so weird.

163
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,128
I don't understand.

164
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:46,201
It's a bold move to Photoshop yourself
into a picture with your girlfriend

165
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:49,104
and her kids on a ski trip
with their real father.

166
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,942
But then again, Michael's a bold guy.

167
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:54,120
Is bold the right word?

168
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,986
I think you're a really sweet guy.

169
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,815
- Okay.
- But, um...

170
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:00,190
I don't know how to deal with...

171
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:02,028
with, like this... thing.

172
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,056
And... and the proposal.

173
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:06,903
And I don't think things
are gonna work out with us.

174
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:08,324
No, no. Okay, okay.

175
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,568
You know what?
You're not thinking straight.

176
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:11,850
You know what you need?

177
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,226
You need...

178
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:15,319
to think this through in...

179
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:19,956
Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.

180
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:22,176
What are you talking about?

181
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:23,896
I got us tickets...

182
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:27,601
to Sandals, Jamaica.
We leave day after tomorrow.

183
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:30,617
You had better find the skimpiest bikini

184
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:33,125
- there is.
- Michael...

185
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:34,455
And it's all-inclusive.

186
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:36,804
Yes?

187
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:38,422
I'm sorry.

188
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,428
No, Carol.
You walk out that door, and it is over.

189
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:44,691
I know.

190
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,549
Jim?

191
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:03,186
- Um, hey.
- Hey.

192
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:05,712
I need to give you
your Christmas gift now.

193
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,069
Because, um...

194
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:09,245
Well, I'll just tell you.

195
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,338
What?

196
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,214
For the past few months,

197
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:15,768
I've been sending Dwight
letters from the CIA.

198
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:20,273
Are you serious?

199
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,026
They're considering him
for a top-secret mission.

200
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:24,816
There's his application.

201
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:26,437
And this is where I made him list

202
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:29,341
every secret he promised
he'd never, ever tell.

203
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:32,857
"Last year, my boss, Michael Scott,

204
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,336
"took a day off,
'cause he said he had pneumonia,

205
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:38,268
"but really, he was leaving early
to go to magic camp."

206
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:41,124
So here's the gift.

207
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:44,348
You get to decide
what his top secret mission is.

208
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:46,768
Sorry I didn't wrap it.

209
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:51,616
You know what?

210
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:56,235
I really don't think I should be doing
this stuff anymore, though.

211
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:57,305
Oh.

212
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,403
- Just 'cause of the promotion.
- Oh, yeah.

213
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:01,116
Just feels a little bit like, uh...

214
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,249
No, I get it.

215
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:03,673
Of course.

216
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,539
Okay.

217
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:06,567
Oh.

218
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:18,663
I feel like there's a chance
for me to start over.

219
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:22,905
And... if I fall back into the same kind
of things I used to do, then...

220
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:25,450
What am I doing?

221
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:32,463
I'd like everybody's attention.

222
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:34,952
Christmas is canceled.

223
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,715
You can't cancel a holiday.

224
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:38,883
Keep it up, Stanley,
and you will lose New Year's.

225
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,939
What does that mean?

226
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,918
Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley!

227
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,719
Michael, what's going on?

228
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,009
Carol and I...

229
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:51,593
split up.

230
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:54,487
Amicably.

231
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:56,599
And I just don't think
it would be appropriate

232
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,305
to celebrate under the circumst...

233
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:00,247
Will they still air Rudolph?

234
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:01,416
That's not fair.

235
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,837
Are we going to cancel Hanukkah as well?

236
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:06,705
Fine!

237
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:08,562
Have your party!

238
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:10,202
Just no guests.

239
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,946
But we invited guests.

240
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,976
Well, you know what, Phyllis?

241
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:16,717
All of your guests

242
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:20,148
would have probably canceled
at the last minute anyway.

243
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,901
Leaving your life a stupid, rotten mess.

244
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:26,040
Okay.

245
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,336
It hurts.

246
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:36,816
I know.

247
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,238
It hurts my heart.

248
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,094
It hurts my stomach.

249
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,936
Hurts my arms.

250
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:48,320
Okay, well,
why are you laying like that?

251
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:49,584
Thanks.

252
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:52,742
How did you push away the bad thoughts?

253
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:53,844
Like what?

254
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,261
Like maybe

255
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:57,263
the real reason they left

256
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,144
was because...

257
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:00,935
there were things

258
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,301
they wanted you to do

259
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:04,744
in bed

260
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:05,998
that were...

261
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:07,393
Wha... um...

262
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:08,703
foreign and scary.

263
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,174
I--I don't believe--

264
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:12,087
And not that you didn't wanna try them.

265
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:14,171
Some wine might have helped.

266
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,238
Do you know what I'm referring to?

267
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,405
I don't need to know.

268
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:18,940
- Michael?
- Yep?

269
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:20,052
Sorry to interrupt.

270
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,286
It appears we're one bathrobe be short.

271
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,464
Take it from Toby.

272
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:25,576
Copy.

273
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:29,636
Pam, would you like to go
to Sandals, Jamaica with me?

274
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:31,701
- No, thank you.
- It's all... Okay.

275
00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:35,370
Hey, Dwight.

276
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,101
Some pretty nice robes there.

277
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:39,614
Why?

278
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:43,851
Phyllis, I need you to pick up
green streamers at lunch.

279
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:46,267
I thought you said green was whorish.

280
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:49,057
No, orange is whorish.

281
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:53,550
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas

282
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:56,246
to make the Stamford people
feel more at home.

283
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,234
Each year, we have a Christmas raffle.

284
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:01,195
- Okay.
- It would never work here.

285
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:03,165
Okay...

286
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:05,785
Um, another idea was

287
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,170
- karaoke.
- No.

288
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:09,423
A Christmas drinking game.

289
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,290
- Yes.
- God help you.

290
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:13,920
What?

291
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:15,946
These are all terrible ideas.

292
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:19,513
And none of them are on the theme
of a Nutcracker Christmas.

293
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:21,766
I think you should leave.

294
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:24,242
You're kidding.

295
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:25,483
You tried this out

296
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,322
and it's clearly not for you.

297
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:28,727
It's time to go.

298
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,969
Come on!

299
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:35,005
Please? Thank you.

300
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:38,408
Okay.

301
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:39,709
Thank you very much.

302
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:53,153
- What are you doing?
- We are getting rid of everything

303
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:55,123
that reminds you of Carol.

304
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:56,593
Hey, what's a-haps?

305
00:11:58,554 --> 00:11:59,554
Carol?

306
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:00,751
No.

307
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:02,493
Oh, look at this.

308
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:06,152
Your old condo closing papers.

309
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:08,185
Ew, it's riddled with Carol's name.

310
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,359
I wish I could throw this in the box.

311
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:20,481
Why don't you just buy the whole song?

312
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,431
I don't have to buy it.

313
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,844
I just wanna taste it.

314
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:28,054
That's all.

315
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:30,199
I just want a little taste of it.

316
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:34,903
Oh, look at this. She saved you $2,000

317
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,533
'cause they failed
to report a mold problem.

318
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:40,794
But wouldn't that affect the final...

319
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:41,991
How did she...

320
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:44,631
Oh...oh, I see what she did.

321
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:45,743
That is good.

322
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:49,728
That Carol is one smart cookie.

323
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:08,355
This is an old adage,

324
00:13:09,212 --> 00:13:12,069
but they say
that when you find true love,

325
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:15,632
you know within the first 24 hours.

326
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,036
With Carol?

327
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:22,852
I knew within the first 24 minutes
of the second day I met her.

328
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:36,676
I feel like
I've been kind of cold to Karen.

329
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:38,448
And there's no real reason for it.

330
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:41,371
I mean, it's not like
she's ever done anything to me.

331
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,632
So... I think I probably
shouldn't be cold to her.

332
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,573
Hey... Karen...

333
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:49,967
Sorry about that meeting today.
That was really crazy.

334
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:52,276
Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that.

335
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,812
Because I don't know
how those meetings usually go.

336
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,094
Um, usually like that.

337
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:58,856
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela?

338
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:00,539
I think one of her cats did once.

339
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:02,889
She came in
with scratches all over her face.

340
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:04,046
Right.

341
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:07,939
Um...I really liked your karaoke idea.

342
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:10,069
- Oh, cool, yeah.
- That could really be fun.

343
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:11,455
You guys do a raffle?

344
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:12,680
Yeah, we do a raffle.

345
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:18,984
- Hey, Kev.
- Hey.

346
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,152
This should have been up yesterday.

347
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:35,340
It'll be all right.

348
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:39,767
What is that?

349
00:14:40,153 --> 00:14:44,093
"The Committee to Plan Parties invites
you to a Margarita-Karaoke Christmas."

350
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:46,379
There's no such thing
as the Committee to Plan Parties.

351
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:47,930
There is now. We just started it.

352
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:49,892
Well, you can't just start a committee.

353
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,192
You have to have funding.

354
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:52,228
What's your funding?

355
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,388
$200.

356
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:55,801
- What's ours again?
- Um, $201.

357
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,112
- Right.
- Hey!

358
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,477
A Margarita-Karaoke Christmas party.
That sounds like fun.

359
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:01,985
No, that is not a party.

360
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:05,237
There's only one party, and it's hosted
by the party planning committee,

361
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:06,444
and it starts at 3:00.

362
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:08,263
Then why are there two flyers?

363
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:11,855
I understand that this is confusing
for everyone. Let me explain.

364
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,381
- There's a party that starts at 3:00.
- Right.

365
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,614
And then there's a way more fun
party that starts at 2:45.

366
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:20,767
Right, and if you're interested
in the way more fun party,

367
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:24,189
all the info can be found here
on our more brightly-colored flyer.

368
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,203
I didn't see where it was.

369
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:37,426
Yep, looks like the Scranton people
and the Stamford people are

370
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:38,840
finally coming together.

371
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:41,508
And that's what you want, right?

372
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:44,911
I think that's a really good...

373
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:45,958
Pam and Karen!

374
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:50,020
I am ordering you to cease and desist
all party planning immediately.

375
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:53,077
- You can't do that.
- As ranking N°3 in this office...

376
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,376
- I'm N°3.
- You're N°4.

377
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,007
- Yeah, but I'm N°3.
- Uh, no.

378
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:59,340
You must turn over to me
all Christmas decorations

379
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:01,875
and party paraphernalia
immediately that'll be returned to you

380
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:02,743
on January 4th.

381
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,713
- Okay, I think I can help here.
- Okay, good.

382
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,946
As ranking number two,
I am starting a committee

383
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:09,266
to determine
the validity of the two committees.

384
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:10,580
And I am the sole member.

385
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:12,023
Committee will act on this now.

386
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,544
- This's stupid.
- Can you keep it down? I'm in session.

387
00:16:17,803 --> 00:16:19,452
I've determined this committee is valid.

388
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,611
What? No, no! Wait, wait.

389
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,949
Permission to join
the validity committee.

390
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:27,868
Permission denied.

391
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:28,980
Damn it!

392
00:16:31,997 --> 00:16:33,006
Hey.

393
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,266
I can't concentrate
when I know you're in pain, man.

394
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:37,700
Let me take you to lunch.

395
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:41,357
Come on, my treat.

396
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:45,524
All right. Nothing here
to distract myself with anyway.

397
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,815
That's my boy.

398
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:49,290
I know the perfect place too.

399
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:50,346
Hooters?

400
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:52,184
No, Benihana.

401
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:53,391
Much classier.

402
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:55,229
But don't worry.

403
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,265
The babes are totally hot too.

404
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:01,869
Well, I need my entourage.

405
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:03,528
Jim, Dwight, Ryan.

406
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:05,141
Come on, we're going to Asian Hooters.

407
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:06,187
Oh, man, I can't.

408
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:08,299
- Why not?
- I'm not feeling so well.

409
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,240
I got a ton of work to do here
and MSG allergy, peanut allergy.

410
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,068
I just ate there last night.

411
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:15,858
- Okay. Feel better.
- Thanks.

412
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:17,168
Come on, Jim. Let's go.

413
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:18,082
Okay.

414
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,712
Wow... thanks for taking
all the excuses, dude.

415
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,947
Doctor appointment, car trouble,
plantar warts, granddad fought in WWII.

416
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,766
Use your head, man. I keep mine in here.

417
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:27,888
Look alive, Halpert.

418
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:29,000
Welcome back.

419
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:31,082
Bros before hoes!

420
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:34,317
Why? Because your bros
are always there for you.

421
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:35,928
They have got your back

422
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,209
after your ho rips your heart out

423
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,369
for no good reason.

424
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:42,018
And you were nothing
but great to your ho,

425
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:44,988
and you told her
that she was the only ho for you,

426
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:48,325
and that she was better
than all the other hoes in the world.

427
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:49,965
And then...

428
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:56,375
then suddenly, she's not your ho no mo'.

429
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:03,907
So... she looks really hot.

430
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,471
So I said,

431
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,771
"You look hotter than usual today."

432
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:08,833
Thank you.

433
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:10,590
Michael.

434
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,154
Head of the table.

435
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,414
Just get in right there.

436
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:16,518
Good.

437
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:18,810
Actually, um...

438
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,113
Excuse me, sir,

439
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,326
- I'm gonna need to take this chair.
- Dwight, just leav... leave them alone.

440
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:26,132
Please. They're on a date,
they look very happy.

441
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:29,519
So she looks at me, right?

442
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:32,451
And she goes,
"I'm sorry, do I even know you?"

443
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,619
After a year!

444
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:37,884
A year of buying lattes from her.
Do you believe that?

445
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:38,955
Yes.

446
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,287
I can't...
I can't hear what you're saying!

447
00:18:41,325 --> 00:18:43,691
- Carol used to drink lattes.
- Who are you talking about?

448
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,529
She would get
this little foam moustache.

449
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:49,856
- And I used to say, "Hey, got latte?"
- Carol had a moustache?

450
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:51,855
And she'd say, "That's not funny."

451
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:52,977
What're you talking about?

452
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:55,409
She totally got me. She understood...

453
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:59,283
- that we didn't have to laugh
- Michael!

454
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:00,404
to enjoy each other.

455
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,355
Repeat what you said, louder.

456
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:04,778
It is my job to be there for Michael.

457
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,962
How can I be here for Michael
if I'm here for Michael?

458
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:15,763
I'm already starting
to forget what color eyes she had.

459
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:18,200
I can't... okay. I'm gonna call her.

460
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,255
- I am going to call and find out...
- No!

461
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:21,623
Who are you calling?

462
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,672
I'm gonna call her.

463
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:25,849
Put that away. SOS! We... hi.

464
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:26,970
Mayday.

465
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,789
Man down over here, we need your help.

466
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,303
What can I get for ya?

467
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,743
I think we'll start
with a round of Nog-a-sakes.

468
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:37,216
One part eggnog.

469
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:39,196
Three parts sake!

470
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,816
Some places won't make it for you,
though, because eggnog

471
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:44,220
is seasonal.

472
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,846
You should put out salt for the rims.

473
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,760
That's a great idea.

474
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:52,707
Phyllis?

475
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,474
I was just getting a snack.

476
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,746
You can have your snack in here.

477
00:19:56,793 --> 00:19:58,490
Pam, don't tell her what to do.

478
00:19:58,603 --> 00:19:59,650
Phyllis...

479
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,205
Oh... okay.

480
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:10,885
I think I'll go to Angela's party
because that's the party I know.

481
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,287
I miss the days when there was only
one party I didn't want to go to.

482
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,680
So I only use three?

483
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:21,165
If you use more
than three pieces of tape

484
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:22,928
to wrap a present,
you're doing it wrong.

485
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:25,326
Okay, and where'd
you get all those cool bows?

486
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,031
Oh, I just get those
at any party supply place.

487
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:29,945
Okay.

488
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,458
Are you sure I can't use,
like, the cartoons from the newspaper?

489
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:36,513
Oh, yeah, your mom would love that.

490
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:39,263
- Hey.
- Hey.

491
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:42,044
All right, I'll see you guys later.

492
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:43,185
Bye.

493
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:46,833
He's cute. You should date him.

494
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,463
Yeah, maybe.

495
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,018
Looks like you got a little nakiri knife
action going there.

496
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,131
No, it's usuba.

497
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:02,685
Yeah, I bet
you wish you had a nakiri, though.

498
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:06,607
Actually, the usuba's the better knife
when you're working with this quantity.

499
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:08,040
Eh, I don't know.

500
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:09,764
Still think nakiri's better.

501
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,650
I think he'd know.

502
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:17,700
Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.

503
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:19,512
Wait for the onion.

504
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,142
Trust me.

505
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,130
Hey, Cindy!

506
00:21:25,714 --> 00:21:28,561
He just had his heart broken.
You wouldn't do that to him, would you?

507
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:31,181
- I don't know.
- Oh, sure you would. Look at you.

508
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:33,484
I bet you break up
with a guy every hour.

509
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:36,942
You made her laugh!

510
00:21:37,324 --> 00:21:38,323
Yes!

511
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:39,973
She totally digs us.

512
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:41,792
Watch, watch.

513
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:45,865
Huh? Huh?

514
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:47,590
What did I tell you?

515
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:49,569
You're right. That's good.

516
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:55,998
Hello, everyone.

517
00:21:56,394 --> 00:21:59,062
We would just like to announce
that our party is starting now

518
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:00,985
in the break room, so...

519
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,615
I have a very
important announcement to make.

520
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:05,274
About...

521
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,197
your paychecks.

522
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:12,117
Your paychecks
will be arriving as scheduled on Friday.

523
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,524
And they will be in the correct amount

524
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:17,315
that they normally are in.

525
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,726
Please stand by
for a very important announcement

526
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:25,384
further regarding your paycheck!

527
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,117
I need to know if I can start the party.

528
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:33,030
Michael!

529
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:34,575
Hey!

530
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:36,244
Over here, Michael!

531
00:22:39,732 --> 00:22:41,457
I don't know. No one can hear me.

532
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,389
You know what? Start the party.

533
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:46,557
Did Michael give you
permission to do this?

534
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:50,045
Start the party.

535
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,003
Also, I would like to inform you that,

536
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:58,491
as a special treat,
my party will be starting early.

537
00:22:58,604 --> 00:23:00,272
In fact, it will be starting...

538
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:01,705
Right now.

539
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:04,109
- Our party is also starting now!
- Yep.

540
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:31,710
- All right, Stanley!
- Good choice.

541
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:36,838
Welcome, Hannah.

542
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:38,658
You will not be disappointed.

543
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:40,543
Why would I bedisappointed?

544
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,626
I said you wouldn't be disappointed.

545
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:47,832
Meredith, if you don't come to my party,

546
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,198
you will be very, very sorry.

547
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:52,036
Is that a threat?

548
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,722
No, it's an invitation.

549
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:56,579
- We have vodka!
- Lots of it.

550
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:05,482
I hear Angela's party
will have double fudge brownies.

551
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:08,188
But it will also have Angela.

552
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:10,695
So, double fudge.

553
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:12,520
Angela.

554
00:24:13,598 --> 00:24:14,880
Double fudge...

555
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:17,953
Angela.

556
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:25,955
Brownies.

557
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:28,605
- Cupcakes.
- Don't push it.

558
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,414
Are we taking this too far?

559
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:44,307
You know what? I don't think
we're taking this far enough.

560
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:46,523
What?

561
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:48,314
I got goose bumps.

562
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:52,018
I don't back down.

563
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,554
My sister and I used to be best friends,

564
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,779
and we haven't talked
in 16 years over some disagreement

565
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:59,193
I don't even remember.

566
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
So...

567
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,360
Yeah.

568
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,623
I'm pretty good.

569
00:25:06,776 --> 00:25:08,511
Damn, this chicken is good.

570
00:25:09,143 --> 00:25:10,717
My compliments to the chef.

571
00:25:11,282 --> 00:25:12,498
Which is you!

572
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:14,393
Right?

573
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,270
Awesome!

574
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,607
I need some meat.

575
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,502
I want some steak.

576
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:23,435
That guy's got steak.

577
00:25:23,874 --> 00:25:25,203
I see steak.

578
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:26,909
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me!

579
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:28,106
En garde!

580
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:31,302
It's family style.

581
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:32,414
No, it's not.

582
00:25:32,452 --> 00:25:33,621
Oh, God.

583
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:35,194
Cindy! Cindy!

584
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:36,363
I love steak.

585
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:37,520
I love it!

586
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:41,209
I want you to close your eyes

587
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:43,707
and imagine your dream house.

588
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:48,033
Come on! Do it for Michael.

589
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,517
He's had a really long day.

590
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:51,700
What are you doing?

591
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:52,892
This is great.

592
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:54,397
- Jim!
- Okay.

593
00:25:54,547 --> 00:25:55,566
Jim!

594
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:57,649
What...

595
00:25:58,403 --> 00:25:59,873
What's happening?

596
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:03,324
She's asleep.

597
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,850
Narcolepsy.

598
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:06,963
Probably.

599
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:09,923
Okay, now open your eyes

600
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:11,685
and describe it to me.

601
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,522
I don't know.

602
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,298
It has four bedrooms and a loft.

603
00:26:16,332 --> 00:26:18,463
- Oh, my God! Now she's up.
- Yeah?

604
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:21,715
And she's trying to describe
how to correctly butcher a goose,

605
00:26:21,743 --> 00:26:23,572
but she's having trouble
coming up with it.

606
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:24,684
Okay. Cindy!

607
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,296
Yo, Cindy, Cindy.

608
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:30,431
Hold its neck back,
insert the knife beneath the jaw,

609
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,827
bring it all the way around.

610
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:33,806
There's gonna be a good amount of blood.

611
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:37,342
Don't let that bother you.
Have a bucket there for the blood and

612
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:39,274
the innards and the feathers.

613
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:42,102
Oh, no, this is different.

614
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:44,539
The CIA thing,
that was a prank on Dwight.

615
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,975
This is more like a, um...

616
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:50,614
Okay, it's pretty much the same thing.

617
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,636
What do you think?

618
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:08,386
Fruity and delicious.

619
00:27:08,424 --> 00:27:10,074
See, I told you. You want one, Meredith?

620
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:11,111
No thanks.

621
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:12,364
They're too sweet.

622
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,513
Hey, so what's the status?

623
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:17,238
Looks like they forgot the power cord.

624
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:18,699
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

625
00:27:18,775 --> 00:27:20,396
- No.
- Oh, God.

626
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:22,008
You guys, guys.

627
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,368
I'm sorry, but there's a problem
with the karaoke machine.

628
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:27,355
That blows.

629
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:28,517
Hang on, little ladies.

630
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:31,267
You don't need this thing.
I'll go grab my synthesizer.

631
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:36,283
Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!

632
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:43,708
- Hi.
- Hey.

633
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,630
Hey, look when you get done with your...

634
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:48,930
meeting, you should come
to the break room.

635
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:50,106
We're having a party.

636
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:51,495
- Oh, okay.
- All right?

637
00:27:51,674 --> 00:27:52,956
See you later.

638
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,875
These nuts are really hard to crack.

639
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:01,563
Try harder then.

640
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:09,953
No one has seconds
until everyone's had some.

641
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,121
You've got to be kidding.

642
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:13,968
You've got to be kidding.

643
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:22,827
Cold, huh?

644
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:24,639
Yeah.

645
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,078
That'll help.

646
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,938
Is it cold in there?

647
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:34,880
They have been
checking us out all night.

648
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:36,172
I am not kidding!

649
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:37,925
- You know what we should do?
- What?

650
00:28:37,953 --> 00:28:39,981
We should invite them
to the Christmas party.

651
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,432
Now you are thinking.

652
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:43,073
Yes!

653
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:44,223
And you know what?

654
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,683
Because you have had such a rough day,

655
00:28:46,947 --> 00:28:48,050
you get Cindy.

656
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:51,217
Oh, you are such a mensch, my friend.

657
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,965
Okay, where is everybody?

658
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:02,217
I would like them
to meet my new girlfriend.

659
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,813
I'm sure they'll want to meet her too.

660
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:09,804
The least I could do

661
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:13,075
was give some poor sick kid a bike.

662
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:14,471
That rocks.

663
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:15,875
Yeah, you rock.

664
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,534
Tell you what.
If you want it, it's yours.

665
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,409
Thanks!

666
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:24,124
I want to give you something.

667
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,188
That's what she said?

668
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:32,078
Hello!

669
00:29:32,224 --> 00:29:35,005
I would like everybody
to meet my new girlfriend.

670
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,701
And my new girlfriend.

671
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,210
Where's Dwight?

672
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:40,284
Is he the hot one or the giant baby?

673
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:41,529
The giant baby.

674
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:43,923
Wow, I am so sorry.

675
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:46,195
I had no idea this party'd be so lame.

676
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,042
There's another party in the break room.

677
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,993
Oh, party in the break room!
Let's go, let's go. Thank God.

678
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,170
- Let's go to the break room.
- Excuse me!

679
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,716
Waitress lady, hey!

680
00:29:54,717 --> 00:29:56,483
Where do you think
you're going with that?

681
00:29:56,511 --> 00:29:57,713
I thought I could have it.

682
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,845
You can't have it.

683
00:29:58,873 --> 00:30:01,531
I don't walk into your house
and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.

684
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,162
Ssshut it!

685
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:04,605
Come on, party.

686
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:06,650
Hey, it's Angela!

687
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,467
I just think that there are two...

688
00:30:25,763 --> 00:30:28,657
two specific
kinds of people in the world.

689
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,991
People who own houses

690
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:33,434
and people who own condos.

691
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,838
All right?

692
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:37,380
And...

693
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,398
my question to you

694
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:41,273
is do you agree?

695
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:43,687
Do I agree about what?

696
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:45,610
Do you agree about what?

697
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:51,874
You're lucky you're so damn cute.

698
00:30:52,874 --> 00:30:55,522
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

699
00:31:17,164 --> 00:31:18,616
Way to go, Kev.

700
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:19,908
Good work.

701
00:31:30,395 --> 00:31:32,019
Did you have fun at Benihana's?

702
00:31:32,112 --> 00:31:33,120
No.

703
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:35,783
It was awful. I couldn't hear anything.

704
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:41,303
I've had the worst day here.

705
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:49,833
Dwight...

706
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,133
You won the raffle.

707
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:53,274
No...

708
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,452
way!

709
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:56,790
- Yeah!
- Open it, open it!

710
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,367
- Do you like it?
- Walkie-talkies!

711
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:05,308
- Can I talk to you a sec?
- Yes!

712
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:08,670
Well, the Committee to Plan Parties
has served its purpose.

713
00:32:09,022 --> 00:32:10,228
We're gonna disband

714
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:11,859
in the name of Christmas.

715
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,769
In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.

716
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:20,435
Angela?

717
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:24,526
We've been hearing really great things
about your brownies and

718
00:32:24,705 --> 00:32:27,693
we were hoping
you'd consider merging the two parties.

719
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:29,531
I'm not sure.

720
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:35,460
Does your karaoke machine
have Christmas songs?

721
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:38,279
Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.

722
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:41,981
I may have seen it somewhere.

723
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:49,143
Is it this one?

724
00:32:50,107 --> 00:32:51,116
Yeah.

725
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:52,162
Thanks.

726
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:55,553
We'll go tell everyone.

727
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:56,708
Okay.

728
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,834
When you know, you just know.

729
00:33:57,645 --> 00:33:58,645
Right?

730
00:33:59,012 --> 00:34:00,454
- Right.
- Check her out.

731
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:03,410
My little gal over there?
Babe-a-lectable.

732
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,581
Which one is she?

733
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:09,999
It's one of those two.

734
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:12,372
You don't know?

735
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:14,041
Dude, you should know.

736
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,398
Yeah, well...

737
00:34:15,794 --> 00:34:18,800
It's been hard,
they're wearing the exact same uniform.

738
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,477
And I've been drinking.

739
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,184
And

740
00:34:22,382 --> 00:34:23,692
you know how all...

741
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:25,606
waitresses look alike.

742
00:34:28,781 --> 00:34:31,090
I honestly don't see
what the big deal is.

743
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,844
Stevie Wonder is married.

744
00:34:32,957 --> 00:34:34,408
Are you going to tell me...

745
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,679
that Steve Wonder doesn't love his wife

746
00:34:37,981 --> 00:34:40,357
just because
he's not sure what she looks like?

747
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:41,610
Hey!

748
00:34:42,308 --> 00:34:44,033
Where's my girl?

749
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,775
Is she in the fridge?

750
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,047
Where is she hiding?

751
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,771
I don't know where she is.

752
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,967
Oh, 'cause I'm drunk.

753
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:57,334
I can't ever find her.

754
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:00,765
You know where I am.

755
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:01,867
I do!

756
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,376
Hi!

757
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:05,581
I just haven't hugged you in a while.

758
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:09,767
Good. That felt good.

759
00:35:09,795 --> 00:35:11,907
Let's go party.

760
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:39,998
Monkey, this is Possum.

761
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:41,144
Do you copy?

762
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,298
Copy, Possum.

763
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:43,392
What's your 20?

764
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:45,843
No way!

765
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:48,605
What a horrible,
horrible movie that was.

766
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,519
And now I get to remember it forever.

767
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:52,106
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

768
00:35:58,106 --> 00:35:59,105
- Hey.
- Hey.

769
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:00,528
Hey you!

770
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:01,895
How are you?

771
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:05,119
This party blows, so we're gonna leave.

772
00:36:05,514 --> 00:36:06,485
No, no.

773
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:09,559
Hey, you should stay
because we're having fun.

774
00:36:09,624 --> 00:36:10,624
And...

775
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,566
Where do you wanna go?

776
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:14,725
I... we're just gonna take off.

777
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,213
You know what? I...

778
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,250
Okay, listen.

779
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,833
I like you.

780
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:21,624
I really like you.

781
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,770
So much, in fact,
that I would like you to accompany me

782
00:36:26,118 --> 00:36:28,352
on a trip to Sandals Jamaica.

783
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,169
No, I have school.

784
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:42,459
You want help?

785
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,609
Okay.

786
00:36:43,778 --> 00:36:44,834
Merry Christmas!

787
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:46,276
Merry Christmas.

788
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:13,735
That waitress... was the one.

789
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:14,830
No.

790
00:37:15,184 --> 00:37:16,221
She wasn't.

791
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:17,800
How can you be sure?

792
00:37:18,024 --> 00:37:19,238
Well, for starters,

793
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:22,113
I've known you as a couple
since the beginning of the relationship,

794
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:23,421
which was approximately

795
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:24,587
three hours ago.

796
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:26,897
Don't make fun of me.
You're making fun of me.

797
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:29,560
Sorry.

798
00:37:34,616 --> 00:37:37,160
I guess I didn't know her very well.

799
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,508
I marked her arm.

800
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,074
You... You what?

801
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:48,599
I... I put a mark on her arm.

802
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:54,786
So I could tell 'em apart.

803
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:56,238
I don't...

804
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,120
I know, I know.

805
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,245
I can't believe I gave her my bike.

806
00:38:02,622 --> 00:38:03,942
Yeah.

807
00:38:05,803 --> 00:38:07,477
Why do I feel like crap?

808
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:11,579
You just had a rebound.

809
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:15,348
Had a rebound.

810
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:17,009
Yeah.

811
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,204
Which, don't get me wrong,
can be a really fun distraction.

812
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:23,765
But when it's over,

813
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,453
you're left thinking
about the girl you really like.

814
00:38:28,113 --> 00:38:29,716
The one that broke your heart.

815
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:36,027
I totally rebounded.

816
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:40,045
Someone else shoots,
and I take the ball and I score.

817
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:41,918
Well, I guess I didn't really score.

818
00:38:41,977 --> 00:38:45,595
And I'm not sure
who is actually shooting, but...

819
00:38:46,113 --> 00:38:47,174
Whatever.

820
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,789
Doesn't matter. It's all good.

821
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:52,229
Or as my ex might say,

822
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:55,151
"Domo arigato, Mister...

823
00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:57,177
"Scott-o."

824
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:29,283
Yes, I just wanted to see, if

825
00:39:29,863 --> 00:39:32,892
you would like
to come to Jamaica with me.

826
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:36,179
There's this resort called Sandals.

827
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:40,557
Really?

828
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:43,480
Okay.

829
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:47,050
All right.
I promise you won't be disappointed.

830
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:48,841
It's all-inclusive.

831
00:39:55,757 --> 00:39:56,794
Too soon.

832
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:20,368
Night, Pam.

833
00:40:20,427 --> 00:40:21,440
Night.

834
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,775
Oh, you know what?

835
00:40:25,494 --> 00:40:26,919
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

836
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:29,241
I intercepted a transmission earlier,

837
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,833
and it seems
that the CIA is gonna need Dwight

838
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:34,543
down at their headquarters
at Langley for training

839
00:40:34,602 --> 00:40:37,100
and an ice cream social
with the other agents.

840
00:40:39,634 --> 00:40:41,354
We should get him a bus ticket.

841
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:45,266
- To make his trip easier.
- Oh, no, that would be very patriotic.

842
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:47,953
It costs $75.

843
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:53,123
Well, maybe the CIA
could send a helicopter.

844
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:02,808
What the...

845
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:08,239
"You have been compromised.

846
00:41:08,313 --> 00:41:10,452
"Abort mission. Destroy phone."

847
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,932
Destroy phone.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
