1
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,967
-He's gonna miss his train, Frank.
-Tommy, don't worry, he'll be here.

2
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,928
I'm sorry you couldn't come over for dinner.

3
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:56,472
-What dinner?
-Last night.

4
00:02:56,515 --> 00:02:59,684
Rose talked to Angie.
She said you guys were busy.

5
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:02,270
She never mentioned that to me.
We were home, watching TV.

6
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:04,689
You missed a good dinner, Frank.

7
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:09,527
I don't know what's wrong
with Angela lately. I'll talk to her.

8
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:19,912
Right on time.

9
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:30,798
I love you.

10
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:59,136
-How do these people do it every day?
-It's like fucking sardines.

11
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:20,950
I tell you what, Angela.
It all boils down to good follicles.

12
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:24,662
You've been blessed. One head in a million.

13
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,164
I ran into her at Foodtown.

14
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,750
-I invited her over for dinner.
-Yeah?

15
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:31,836
But Angela says they're busy.

16
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:35,297
Then, this morning,
Tommy was talking to Frankie.

17
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,842
-Turns out they were home last night.
-Stop.

18
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:42,513
Frankie didn't know about it.
She never told her own husband.

19
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:44,140
Who does she think she is?

20
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:00,948
Mrs. D, you don't like it?

21
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,951
No, it's not the cut.

22
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:06,203
Thanks, Ray.

23
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:21,051
-Connie.
-Hey, doll. How are you?

24
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:25,389
Look at you. A redhead. You look gorgeous.

25
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,103
-Angela. How are you doing, kiddo?
-Okay. How you doing?

26
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,898
You know me. Always looking for action.

27
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,234
-You look terrific.
-Thanks.

28
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:40,404
-Frank better keep an eye on you.
-Yeah, right.

29
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:45,367
You coming to the card game tonight?
We haven't seen you in an age.

30
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,496
I gotta help Joey with his homework.
He's having trouble in school.

31
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,624
Of course he is.
He hangs out with Tony Junior.

32
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:55,461
These boys will never be Einstein.
Come over tonight.

33
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:59,924
I really can't. I gotta go. I'm sorry.

34
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:02,927
Have a great time.
It was great to see you guys.

35
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:05,179
Bye. Take care.

36
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,184
That bitch. She thinks her shit don't stink.

37
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:41,131
I have three cards.
One red, you can take all my bread,

38
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:43,551
and two blacks, that'll set you back.

39
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:46,804
Watch it, chase it, see where I place it.

40
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:49,056
-It's right here.
-It's right here. That's it.

41
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:51,058
Give me five and you win ten.

42
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:58,482
-Gee, I could've sworn, girls.
-Tough luck. Try again.

43
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:01,610
Hey. What's going on here?

44
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:04,613
-Hi, Mrs. de Marco.
-Hi, Tara.

45
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:07,658
Nothing, Ma. We're just playing.

46
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:13,664
-You playing for money?
-No, we were just playing for fun. Right?

47
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,215
I want all of you to go home.
Joseph Francis, I'll talk to you inside.

48
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:25,759
I'll be right in, Ma.

49
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:38,480
-Hi, hon.
-Hey, babe.

50
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:41,025
-Going out tonight?
-Yeah, Tony called a meeting.

51
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:45,696
-You playing cards at Connie's tonight?
-No. What are you lookin' for?

52
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:47,531
Why not?

53
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:49,825
I don't feel like it.

54
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:55,247
When the boss's wife
asks you to play cards, you go.

55
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:59,460
I don't have to jump every time
Connie or Tony snaps their fingers.

56
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:04,548
What's wrong with you lately?
All the other guys' wives get along.

57
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:08,093
Tommy and Rose invite us to dinner.
You lie to them, you don't tell me about it.

58
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:11,347
They were your friends.
Now you can't stand them?

59
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:14,141
How am I supposed to get ahead
in the family?

60
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:18,270
The same way you always have.
Lie, cheat, steal, kill.

61
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:21,440
It's very funny. You're a comedian now?

62
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:23,984
I should get you on fucking Star Search.

63
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:26,153
I have to go to the bathroom.

64
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:28,238
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

65
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:31,075
I do not want you taking money
from those kids anymore.

66
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,743
It was Tony Junior's idea.

67
00:09:32,786 --> 00:09:35,537
Does that make it okay?
You can't think for yourself?

68
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,832
-You playing three-card monte again?
-Yeah.

69
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:41,835
-How much did you take from them?
-Twelve bucks.

70
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:44,755
-Not bad.
-Thanks, Dad.

71
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:48,258
Thanks, Frankie.
I'm trying to teach him something.

72
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,260
He's only a kid.

73
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:53,889
-What are you looking for?
-Where is my revolver?

74
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:57,768
Jesus!

75
00:09:57,852 --> 00:09:59,645
-Here, Dad.
-Give me that.

76
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,402
-Go to your room.
-Come on, Lucky.

77
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:09,863
Thank you, Joey.

78
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:16,120
That's great, Frank. That's really great.

79
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:18,914
It's not loaded.

80
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,794
-I can't believe it.
-I'll keep it locked up from now on.

81
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:29,466
It's not just the gun. It's everything.

82
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:31,969
It's this whole life.

83
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:36,849
Your life is so bad?

84
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:42,646
You have a beautiful house, plenty of
money, a great kid, a loving husband.

85
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:45,691
-What more do you want?
-I want a normal life.

86
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:48,819
I'm sick of the gambling, the guns,

87
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:53,031
bailing you outta jail, never knowing
when or if you're gonna come home.

88
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:58,620
Look at this place. Everything we wear
and everything we own fell off a truck.

89
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:02,374
Take it easy, baby.
I don't think you're making much sense.

90
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:08,756
When I look at this house,
I see beautiful furnishings.

91
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:12,176
In Joey's room
I see all the things we give him.

92
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,887
Things you and I never had
when we was growing up.

93
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:19,683
Don't you get it?
Everything has blood on it.

94
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:23,771
I don't have to listen to this garbage.

95
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:27,107
-Neither do I.
-Oh no?

96
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:30,527
-What are you gonna do about it?
-I want a divorce.

97
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:40,245
Listen to Dr. de Marco
for just a second, darling.

98
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:43,040
You go upstairs, you take a Valium.

99
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:47,044
You lie down, relax. You'll feel a lot better.

100
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:49,379
I love you.

101
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,104
What have we here?

102
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,485
It's Nick "The Snake" and
his two nephews, Al "The Worm" and...

103
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,946
Don't tell me. Vinnie "The Slug."

104
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,367
Your common, garden-variety hoodlums.

105
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:23,747
And speak of the devil,
"Cucumber" Frank de Marco.

106
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,250
Bang.

107
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,920
The gang's all here, Mike.

108
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:33,131
Everyone except Tony "The Tiger" Russo.

109
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:12,963
Here's Tony

110
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:15,424
"The Tiger"

111
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:19,052
And I don't mind telling you folks

112
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,430
From this mike here

113
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:26,101
It's Tony, hey, Tony, no phony baloney

114
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,312
"The Tiger"

115
00:13:28,771 --> 00:13:31,690
He's the paisan the sun always shines on

116
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:34,985
He's Tony "The Tiger"

117
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:39,907
-Excuse me, Mr. Russo.
-Sure.

118
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,451
-John.
-Tony.

119
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:46,288
-The Château Lichine is coming in.
-It's pre-Chernobyl, I hope.

120
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,749
-Hey, fellas!
-Tony!

121
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:54,504
Butch. Nick.

122
00:13:57,675 --> 00:14:01,219
Tom? Some glasses and an order for you.

123
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,642
-Tony.
-Frank.

124
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:18,528
-How's Angela and the kid?
-They're both very good. Thank you.

125
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,868
-I've got something for you here.
-Thanks very much, Tony.

126
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:29,331
That was a great job you did on the train.

127
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,668
It was a beautiful ride, Tony.

128
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:38,674
Take care of the guys upstairs.
I'll be right up.

129
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:01,071
Table for two, gentlemen?
This way, please.

130
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:04,533
-My God. It's beautiful.
-You're beautiful.

131
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:07,995
I'll have to do something
very special for you tonight.

132
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,414
You twisted my arm. The Fantasia.

133
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:13,291
-Our old room. 17.
-Room 17.

134
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:15,419
-Twelve past ten.
-Ten past.

135
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:17,379
Yeah, ten past twelve.

136
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:40,986
2:00 am. Quitting time.

137
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:44,531
But you did miss a good dinner.

138
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:50,954
-You know Rosie's Chicken Francese?
-With the ricotta?

139
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,669
Shells with sauce. Cannoli afterwards.

140
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:10,307
-Are you staying?
-I'm gonna take a bath before I go.

141
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,146
Is something wrong?

142
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:19,316
Yeah.

143
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:27,324
You shouldn't smoke in bed.
You're gonna start a fire.

144
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,244
It's a water bed.

145
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:35,415
I gotta go. Gimme a kiss.

146
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:48,512
-Thanks.
-Forget about it.

147
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:59,022
You go straight home now, lollipop.

148
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,329
Frank?

149
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,792
You're early.

150
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,884
Put this over there.

151
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,648
Karen?

152
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:49,656
Karen?

153
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:58,748
Karen.

154
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,756
Save me some soap,

155
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:11,511
because I'm feeling extra dirty tonight.

156
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,947
I had no idea
you was putting the stones to Karen.

157
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:34,409
It's checkout time, Frankie.

158
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:37,621
Tony, this blows my mind.

159
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:50,467
-I loved you like a father.
-You disappointed the shit out of me.

160
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,489
Go away.

161
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:18,828
Downey.

162
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:21,915
I'm there.

163
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:15,635
-Special Agent Downey, FBI.
-Let him by.

164
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:27,772
Yesterday "The Fat Man" buys a one-way
ticket on the Long Island train.

165
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:31,735
19 hours later,
"Cucumber" Frank de Marco takes a bath.

166
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:35,113
I'm no mathematician
but it looks like payback time.

167
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:37,907
Excuse me, gentlemen. The place is clean.

168
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:40,410
I don't know, sir. Doesn't add up.

169
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:41,619
Here you go.

170
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:43,830
You got a better make on it?

171
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,459
The late Karen Lutnick
was Tony Russo's girlfriend.

172
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:48,793
No shit.

173
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:53,548
Maybe Frank was indiscreet. They don't
call him "The Cucumber" for nothing.

174
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:55,467
Karen was a real dish.

175
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:58,803
Tony finds out Frank's eating off his plate.

176
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:02,640
Tony's got a temper.
A man gets angry, he gets sloppy.

177
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:05,226
Maybe "The Tiger" did it himself.

178
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,063
-That's murder one.
-Two counts. We could hang him.

179
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:10,607
Put me back on 24-hour surveillance.

180
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:13,902
I'll nail Tony for the murders
of Frank and Karen.

181
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:18,656
Let us pray for our brother
to our Lord Jesus Christ, who said,

182
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:21,951
"I am the resurrection and the life.

183
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:25,997
"The man who believes in me
will live even if he dies."

184
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,626
Frank. My baby.

185
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:32,504
Such a good boy.

186
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:36,466
We commend our brother to the Lord.

187
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:39,803
May the Lord receive him into his peace

188
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:43,890
and raise up his body
on the last day. Amen.

189
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:53,316
Frank. I'm coming with you.

190
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:57,112
Mamma, no. Mamma!

191
00:21:59,156 --> 00:22:01,991
They found them in the tub, naked.

192
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:05,328
-What goes around comes around.
-Here she comes.

193
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:10,500
-You don't have to clean up.
-Angela, just be quiet.

194
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:14,754
-Thanks, you guys. I appreciate this.
-What are friends for?

195
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:19,050
And we are your friends,
whether you like it or not.

196
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:23,596
I'm gonna go check on my mother-in-law.

197
00:22:24,682 --> 00:22:26,975
Poor kid. She's been through a lot.

198
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:29,894
-You liar.
-No, it's true.

199
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:33,648
-Liar!
-No, it's true!

200
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:36,443
Give him a shot.

201
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:38,862
The two of you knock it off.

202
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,449
Stop this fight. What is this?

203
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:45,076
Tony, get off. Get up.

204
00:22:47,037 --> 00:22:49,080
Get in the house. Hurry up.

205
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:53,168
-You all right?
-My nose is bleeding.

206
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:55,628
Let me see that.

207
00:22:57,298 --> 00:22:58,715
That's nothing.

208
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,219
Are you okay?

209
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:07,640
You two stay away from each other today.

210
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:15,398
Thank you so much, Tony.
Thank you so much.

211
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:19,986
So, how are you holding up?

212
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:22,238
I don't know.

213
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:24,199
I'm okay. I'm okay. Yeah.

214
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:28,244
Now, look. I wanna reassure you, Angela.

215
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:33,416
You're not gonna be alone.
I'm gonna take care of you.

216
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:38,046
-I really appreciate that. I really do. But...
-Angela...

217
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:42,050
I wanna help you.

218
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:45,762
You're so sweet.

219
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,430
Thanks.

220
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,432
Oh, Angela.

221
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,026
Holy shit, the grieving widow.

222
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,750
Keep your hands off me.

223
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:28,555
Bingo.

224
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:34,435
Ma, what are we gonna do now?

225
00:24:38,482 --> 00:24:40,108
I don't know, hon.

226
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:42,777
I just don't know.

227
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:05,425
-Hi, Rose.
-Hi, Angela.

228
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:12,348
-Angela!
-Connie.

229
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,310
Weight Watchers?

230
00:25:17,104 --> 00:25:19,355
You worried about your figure?

231
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:22,400
-Some of us are.
-Cute.

232
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,402
Joan Rivers Junior.

233
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:30,283
You know, Angela,
sometimes when a girl gets single,

234
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:34,287
she thinks of going out
with other girls' guys.

235
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:36,497
I am not interested in Tony.

236
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:40,460
Everybody is interested in Tony.

237
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:46,257
You better call it off, because
if I ever catch you two together...

238
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:02,857
Just forget about it.

239
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,861
Then keep Tony on a leash.
You'll find one in aisle 5.

240
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:09,989
While I'm there, I'll pick you up a flea collar.

241
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:12,325
Watch your ass.

242
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:15,495
-Spiced or regular?
-Spiced.

243
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:17,205
Coming right up.

244
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:24,128
Die! Die, earthling.

245
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:30,760
-Where did you get that?
-Uncle Tony gave it to me.

246
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:35,264
-Uncle Tony?
-He gave me this, too. A $100 bill.

247
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:41,104
-He bought some stuff for you, too.
-Oh, yeah?

248
00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:57,787
Joey, stop it.

249
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:01,749
What's the matter?

250
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:12,135
Tony is not your uncle. He's not a relative.

251
00:27:12,803 --> 00:27:15,972
I don't want you
taking presents from him anymore.

252
00:27:16,306 --> 00:27:18,307
Can I keep the Laser Tag stuff?

253
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:21,728
No. Sorry.

254
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:25,481
-Run upstairs and do your homework.
-Okay.

255
00:27:58,557 --> 00:28:00,183
"Because I care."

256
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:15,323
-Your generosity is overwhelming.
-Sure, sure.

257
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:19,744
Here. The pink slip to the car, and
the address where to pick it up tonight.

258
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:22,371
God bless you.

259
00:28:22,664 --> 00:28:24,207
Forget about it.

260
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:28,336
After tonight, lose that address.

261
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:46,729
-Ready, big guy?
-Let's go, Mom.

262
00:28:46,814 --> 00:28:49,148
Okay. Here we go.

263
00:29:01,995 --> 00:29:04,080
-Who's the bimbo?
-Angela de Marco.

264
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:07,792
The former Miss Angela Maria Gianelli.

265
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:11,337
Daughter of Dominick and Catherine,
both deceased.

266
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:13,923
Mother of Joseph Francis, age seven.

267
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,594
Subject graduated
Bayside High School, Queens, 1 978.

268
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:22,598
Attended one semester
at Robert René Beauty Academy.

269
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:25,560
College education, none.

270
00:29:25,602 --> 00:29:28,271
-Favorite vegetable?
-Cucumber.

271
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:30,273
-Favorite animal?
-Tiger.

272
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:34,944
What? "Cucumber" Frank de Marco's
widow is screwing Tony Russo?

273
00:29:34,987 --> 00:29:38,614
-That's what Tony's wife thinks.
-How does Connie fit in?

274
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:45,121
From my observation, Connie is
the one person who Tony actively fears.

275
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,292
Who knows why,
but it borders on the pathological.

276
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:54,714
Subject married
Francis Aloysius de Marco, May 15, 1 979.

277
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:56,924
The key is Angela de Marco.

278
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:00,970
I say we tap her phone, her house,
her bedroom. Stake her out.

279
00:30:01,054 --> 00:30:03,723
Scope her, tail her, coming and going,

280
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:07,143
and we catch Tony "The Tiger"
with his pants down.

281
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:09,520
Not bad, Downey. Get the bitch.

282
00:30:24,328 --> 00:30:26,954
-Why is she stopping here, Ed?
-I don't know.

283
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:37,173
Go on in.

284
00:30:39,343 --> 00:30:40,593
Come on.

285
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:54,023
We can't live here.

286
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,653
I told you this is all we can afford
right now.

287
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:02,281
Things are gonna be tough for a while.

288
00:31:03,283 --> 00:31:07,370
I'll get a good job. We'll save
some money and find a nicer place.

289
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:11,540
We'll lead a life we can be proud of.
That's what matters.

290
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,710
Okay, but this place really sucks.

291
00:31:16,213 --> 00:31:19,423
I know. Let's go down and unload the car.

292
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:23,803
What's that thing
in the middle of that room?

293
00:31:25,222 --> 00:31:26,555
A bathtub.

294
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:29,976
-Why is it in the kitchen?
-I'll tell you later.

295
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:45,199
-Blow them out.
-Make a wish.

296
00:31:47,911 --> 00:31:49,412
I got a wish.

297
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:03,759
Carlo, the door.

298
00:32:04,261 --> 00:32:06,846
Honey, cut the cake. I'll be right back.

299
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:17,314
Where did she go?

300
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,816
Tony, you wouldn't believe it.

301
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,279
She moved into some shithole on
the Lower East Side. Here's the address.

302
00:32:23,363 --> 00:32:26,157
-What the hell's she doing there?
-Beats me.

303
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:29,910
It's in a hell of a place.
I wouldn't have a dog live there.

304
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:32,621
-It's falling apart.
-It's that bad.

305
00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:34,790
It's a dangerous neighborhood.

306
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:38,919
Did you remember
that orange notebook on the couch?

307
00:32:40,547 --> 00:32:44,717
-Ma, I wanna go in that way.
-I don't think... Okay.

308
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:47,386
Mom, don't worry about me.

309
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:51,807
I'm gonna pick you up right here at 3:00.

310
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,809
Good luck.

311
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:59,857
-Be good.
-Be good.

312
00:33:19,002 --> 00:33:22,296
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

313
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:28,677
This is my stop.

314
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:08,425
-Can I help you?
-I'm not sure you're the person to talk to,

315
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,347
but I'm here about your advertisement
about the cosmetics position.

316
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:16,725
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
They already hired somebody.

317
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:18,727
You've got to get here really early.

318
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:19,496
-Hello, sweetie. How are you today?
-I can't find a job.

319
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:23,959
Go to Chicken Lickin' next door.
They got a sign in the window.

320
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:26,003
-Right here.
-Yeah?

321
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,673
-Thank you.
-All right.

322
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,967
-You have a good day.
-You, too.

323
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:47,983
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

324
00:35:53,073 --> 00:35:57,868
I've never worked in a restaurant.
But I'm a hard worker and I learn fast.

325
00:35:58,078 --> 00:36:03,082
Good. Let's try this uniform on,
and then we'll see how things look.

326
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:04,667
Okay.

327
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,128
You can change in here.

328
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,466
For privacy.

329
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:15,803
Furthermore, I'll lock the door.

330
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,847
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

331
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:50,421
You are a real lowlife, mister.
You know that?

332
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:53,382
Young lady, one moment. Ma'am. Please.

333
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:56,468
Give me back my uniform.

334
00:36:57,304 --> 00:36:58,304
What?

335
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:00,389
Give me back my uniform.

336
00:37:03,226 --> 00:37:04,727
Drop dead, dirt bag.

337
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,647
You tell him, honey.

338
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,318
Get that man another milk shake.

339
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:10,376
"Tiptoes" Mazzilli and Johnny King
got knocked off last night.

340
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:21,470
This is a shithole.

341
00:38:25,934 --> 00:38:30,646
-Watch where you're...
-Sorry. Pick up his bag for him, Tommy.

342
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:35,025
I ought to be more careful.
I'm dangerous on the road.

343
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:38,654
A regular menace to society.

344
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:41,281
See you later, pal.

345
00:38:44,828 --> 00:38:46,328
What a jerk.

346
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:49,832
Fucking dickhead.

347
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,876
It's all right. Tom. 41.

348
00:38:57,841 --> 00:38:59,633
No, up.

349
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:18,193
-Are you coming out?
-No, I'm going up.

350
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:24,283
Sorry.

351
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,371
Could you press 5, please?

352
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:34,585
I've really got you trapped in here.
Are you sure you're okay?

353
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,254
I'm fine, thanks.

354
00:39:37,797 --> 00:39:39,923
I found it on the street. I couldn't resist.

355
00:39:40,842 --> 00:39:44,553
You probably want to strip it
before you put a finish on it.

356
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:52,019
You live here?

357
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:56,064
-Yes.
-Really? Me too.

358
00:39:57,066 --> 00:39:58,400
I'm Angela de Marco.

359
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:02,738
I'm Mike Smith.

360
00:40:03,406 --> 00:40:06,408
Nice to meet you.
I'm 41. What number are you?

361
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:08,535
Fifty nine.

362
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,206
-It's 4. It's you.
-Thanks.

363
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,918
-Well, I'm sorry. Nice meeting you, Mike.
-It's okay.

364
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,503
Yeah, there you go.

365
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:18,587
Sorry.

366
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:20,923
Guess I'll see you around.

367
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:22,132
Thanks for the tip.

368
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:25,093
Excuse me.

369
00:40:34,437 --> 00:40:36,104
Glad we caught you.

370
00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:52,329
How'd you guys know where I live?

371
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:07,469
The new place
needs a little bit of work, Angela.

372
00:41:11,766 --> 00:41:13,976
But you fix it up right, it'll be great.

373
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:15,852
Yeah, I think so.

374
00:41:15,937 --> 00:41:19,815
We got you some olive oil,
some beautiful tomatoes.

375
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:23,360
That smoked mozzarella you like,
half-a-dozen bagels.

376
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:26,697
-Even a few household items.
-You shouldn't have.

377
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,784
You know, Angela, we miss Frank a lot.

378
00:41:31,828 --> 00:41:34,538
-And we miss you, too.
-That's right.

379
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:38,667
We're still your family. We always will be.

380
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:44,298
I gotta get going.

381
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,425
We'll walk you down.

382
00:41:46,884 --> 00:41:50,679
Rosie wants you to come to dinner
next week. Thursday? Friday?

383
00:41:50,722 --> 00:41:52,764
Any night that's good for you.

384
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:58,020
I'm so busy with the move
and getting set up and everything.

385
00:41:58,688 --> 00:42:03,817
I don't even know if we'll stay here.
Why don't I call you when I'm settled?

386
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,487
-Sure, I understand.
-Say hi to Rose for me.

387
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:12,659
Everybody misses you so much.

388
00:42:14,537 --> 00:42:16,663
We'll see you real soon, okay?

389
00:43:40,498 --> 00:43:42,958
-Hello, gorgeous.
-I'm Angela.

390
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,919
-I'm Rita. How are you doing?
-I'm fine.

391
00:43:46,504 --> 00:43:49,798
I'm looking for a job.
I saw your sign in the window.

392
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:55,303
-What can you do?
-I went to Robert René Beauty Academy.

393
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:57,139
I didn't graduate.

394
00:43:57,724 --> 00:44:02,144
But I can clean,
I can answer phones, I do windows.

395
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,855
And I live right across the street.

396
00:44:06,524 --> 00:44:08,859
And I'm willing to try anything.

397
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:13,739
Please give me a chance.

398
00:44:15,825 --> 00:44:17,325
Almost there.

399
00:44:27,003 --> 00:44:30,797
-You like it?
-I think so.

400
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:34,342
It's short.

401
00:44:34,427 --> 00:44:37,304
-It's a haircut.
-I like it.

402
00:44:38,347 --> 00:44:40,849
-I think it's short.
-It looks great.

403
00:44:40,892 --> 00:44:43,769
-Thank you.
-See you tomorrow.

404
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:46,396
Thank you for the haircut, the job
and everything.

405
00:44:46,481 --> 00:44:47,773
You won't be disappointed.

406
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:51,401
-I hope not. See you tomorrow.
-Thanks, Rita.

407
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:55,197
Next victim.

408
00:44:59,243 --> 00:45:01,077
Note to myself.

409
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:05,123
Run a make on the black chick.

410
00:45:16,135 --> 00:45:19,471
You scared me.

411
00:45:23,226 --> 00:45:26,561
-I thought you lived upstairs.
-I do. I'm a plumber.

412
00:45:26,813 --> 00:45:29,189
I got off on the wrong floor.
They all look the same.

413
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:31,566
Are you okay?

414
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,986
No. Not really.

415
00:45:35,655 --> 00:45:37,531
I've got this flu.

416
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:44,496
-I ought to get to bed.
-I have some great 12-hour cold tablets.

417
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:48,250
Why don't I get them for you?

418
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:49,626
No!

419
00:45:56,425 --> 00:46:01,972
This is a 24-hour bug. It's very kind of you.

420
00:46:09,522 --> 00:46:11,690
You didn't notice my hair.

421
00:46:12,191 --> 00:46:13,483
No, I did.

422
00:46:14,443 --> 00:46:15,986
What do you think?

423
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:19,114
It's a brand-new you.

424
00:46:19,448 --> 00:46:21,908
Thanks. I think.

425
00:46:25,288 --> 00:46:28,456
Take care of yourself. Drink plenty of fluids.

426
00:46:28,499 --> 00:46:30,375
Thanks for the advice.

427
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,302
Ma, can I stay over
at David's house Friday night?

428
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:44,306
-I don't know, hon.
-Please. His mother will be there.

429
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:46,600
Friday night will be okay.

430
00:46:46,642 --> 00:46:49,895
A promotion in this for the both of us.

431
00:46:50,813 --> 00:46:52,397
I ran into her twice today.

432
00:46:54,066 --> 00:46:56,943
She seems so nice, Ed.

433
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,449
I just can't figure it out.
The move, this place.

434
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:06,328
The job hunt.

435
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:22,177
Hi, Mike.

436
00:47:22,845 --> 00:47:27,515
Here are those 12-hour cold tablets,
just in case.

437
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:34,189
I feel better. Must have
just been a six-hour bug. But thanks.

438
00:47:35,149 --> 00:47:37,484
Would you like
to go out on a date with me?

439
00:47:39,195 --> 00:47:40,862
If you want to.

440
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:44,366
Just dinner or...

441
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:48,495
Yeah. Sure.

442
00:47:50,706 --> 00:47:52,040
Great.

443
00:47:54,961 --> 00:47:56,544
How about Friday night?

444
00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:00,882
Friday night sounds great.

445
00:48:01,926 --> 00:48:03,343
-Great...
-Hey, Ma!

446
00:48:03,386 --> 00:48:06,638
-How'd you know where I was?
-I followed your voice.

447
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:08,765
Some detective.

448
00:48:09,225 --> 00:48:11,101
Mike, this is my son Joey.

449
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:13,186
-Hi, Joey.
-Hi.

450
00:48:13,562 --> 00:48:15,730
Did the cavemen kill the dinosaurs?

451
00:48:17,566 --> 00:48:20,652
I don't know. It's a little before my time.

452
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,905
Actually, Joey,

453
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,867
the dinosaurs were dead millions
of years before humans showed up.

454
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:32,872
In fact, if the world were 24 hours old,

455
00:48:32,915 --> 00:48:35,709
the dinosaurs would
have lived in the last hour,

456
00:48:36,335 --> 00:48:41,756
and the humans would have lived
less than two seconds of that 24th hour.

457
00:48:42,008 --> 00:48:43,758
You blow my mind.

458
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:48,513
-Big guy, have you started your homework?
-No.

459
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:50,265
No, I didn't think so.

460
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:54,394
You run down and start your homework.
I'll be down in a few minutes.

461
00:48:57,398 --> 00:49:01,317
You're good with kids. Do you have any?
You're not married, are you?

462
00:49:01,777 --> 00:49:06,406
Angela, If I were married,
would I accept a date with you?

463
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:11,745
I guess not. Neither am I.
I was, but he's dead.

464
00:49:13,956 --> 00:49:15,832
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

465
00:49:18,836 --> 00:49:20,837
I'll get outta your hair.

466
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:25,216
-So, I'll see you Friday night.
-See you there.

467
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:29,429
-About 8:00?
-8:00.

468
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:35,351
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

469
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:42,942
Bingo.

470
00:50:16,685 --> 00:50:20,188
-Pretty wild.
-It's very nice.

471
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:23,441
This is some kind of punch.
I can't pronounce the name.

472
00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:25,610
What shall we toast?

473
00:50:25,694 --> 00:50:27,529
I know.

474
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:31,783
Here's to elevators.
You meet the nicest people in them.

475
00:51:03,065 --> 00:51:04,566
So where to?

476
00:51:05,276 --> 00:51:09,404
-I could use a little snack.
-The usual?

477
00:51:09,446 --> 00:51:12,949
You read my mind. Tell the boys behind us.

478
00:51:18,873 --> 00:51:21,749
-Are you hungry, boys?
-I thought you'd never ask.

479
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:23,918
Good. We're going to Burger World.

480
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:29,340
-Alka-Seltzer World.
-You don't like Burger World?

481
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:32,552
Drive up to the clown

482
00:51:33,053 --> 00:51:35,430
It's a Burger World town

483
00:51:38,225 --> 00:51:41,561
The fries are crispy, the shakes are creamy

484
00:51:41,604 --> 00:51:45,690
The Double Continental
with cheese is dreamy

485
00:51:45,774 --> 00:51:49,527
Charred, rotting flesh
ain't my idea of a good meal.

486
00:51:49,612 --> 00:51:51,112
Come on, Vinnie.

487
00:52:04,919 --> 00:52:06,461
Shit. Butch.

488
00:52:19,808 --> 00:52:22,185
It's a Burger World town

489
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,732
Howdy. May I take your order?

490
00:53:09,858 --> 00:53:13,486
Two Double Continental cheeseburgers,

491
00:53:13,529 --> 00:53:17,031
two fries and two chocolate shakes.

492
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:23,329
-Rings.
-Oh, yeah. Rings.

493
00:53:28,377 --> 00:53:32,714
Could you add on
two orders of onion rings?

494
00:53:32,756 --> 00:53:34,299
You bet.

495
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:52,358
That'll be $8.20, gentlemen.

496
00:53:54,445 --> 00:53:57,947
Take out for the car behind us.
Keep $5 for yourself.

497
00:53:58,032 --> 00:53:59,032
Thanks very much.

498
00:53:59,116 --> 00:54:01,326
-And extra ketchup.
-You got it.

499
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,580
That's a new clown.

500
00:54:08,042 --> 00:54:10,376
-Let's get the fuck outta here.
-Don't.

501
00:54:32,232 --> 00:54:33,816
The clown.

502
00:55:25,911 --> 00:55:28,496
I don't care if
you have to send fucking telegrams.

503
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,998
A clown just tried to kill me.

504
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,836
I want a sit-down in Miami in 36 hours.
I want mediation.

505
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,172
We're gonna settle this bullshit
once and for all.

506
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,376
So, what are you drinking?

507
00:56:17,463 --> 00:56:19,797
-What've you got?
-Not a lot.

508
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:26,679
You have a choice of Caffé Lolita,
or tequila, or crème de menthe.

509
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:32,393
Do you have a club soda?

510
00:56:34,396 --> 00:56:38,149
It's in the fridge. You wanna get it?

511
00:56:39,526 --> 00:56:40,943
I'll be right back.

512
00:56:43,906 --> 00:56:45,531
Good night, Lucky.

513
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:12,266
-I see you found everything.
-No problem.

514
00:57:12,476 --> 00:57:15,311
Why not take your coat off
and stay a while?

515
00:57:15,395 --> 00:57:17,563
Sounds like a fantastic idea.

516
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:35,122
I really liked that band.
Their music is kind of strange. I like it.

517
00:57:43,757 --> 00:57:46,133
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

518
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:02,358
This is really good club soda.

519
00:58:07,155 --> 00:58:09,615
Would you rub my feet? They're killing me.

520
00:58:13,996 --> 00:58:17,248
I think I'm actually pretty good at this.

521
00:58:20,043 --> 00:58:22,878
I just gotta get ahold of
one of these nerves in here...

522
00:58:50,991 --> 00:58:53,701
Don't stop. That feels great.

523
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:57,955
I can't remember the last time
a man touched me below the waist.

524
00:59:00,709 --> 00:59:01,751
I can't believe I said that.

525
00:59:02,753 --> 00:59:04,629
Mike, I'm sorry.

526
00:59:11,762 --> 00:59:14,764
-I'll just use the bathroom.
-It's right there.

527
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:20,061
-You must think I'm so crude.
-Are you kidding? It's just club soda.

528
00:59:30,113 --> 00:59:31,238
Joey?

529
00:59:36,703 --> 00:59:38,913
Guess who's here, Tone.

530
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:43,584
Guess who's here, babycakes. Come on.
This is your life.

531
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:46,921
-Tony.
-Tony is not here.

532
00:59:57,265 --> 00:59:59,266
What a fucking dump.

533
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:03,104
-What do you want?
-Where is he. I know he's here.

534
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:07,608
-No one's here.
-What do you call these?

535
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,862
-Glasses?
-I'll remember you said that.

536
01:00:11,947 --> 01:00:13,197
Your hair looks like shit.

537
01:00:16,368 --> 01:00:19,453
-Please.
-I'm here, Tony.

538
01:00:19,788 --> 01:00:21,914
You're making a big mistake.

539
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:29,255
See?

540
01:00:31,508 --> 01:00:35,803
This is my neighbor Mike.
This is my friend Connie.

541
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:38,556
Whose husband are you, dorkface?

542
01:00:44,229 --> 01:00:47,606
I don't know.
Whose husband are you looking for?

543
01:00:52,237 --> 01:00:53,529
Mine.

544
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,201
-I guess I got you on the wrong night.
-Get out. And stay out of my life.

545
01:00:59,286 --> 01:01:02,955
I fight for what's mine. I make no apologies.

546
01:01:02,998 --> 01:01:06,500
You can call me a ball-buster,
but it's just the way I am.

547
01:01:07,794 --> 01:01:09,545
Keep away from Tony.

548
01:01:13,133 --> 01:01:14,550
What a grouch.

549
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:36,197
You all right?

550
01:01:39,367 --> 01:01:40,910
It doesn't matter.

551
01:01:42,412 --> 01:01:45,331
What the hell was I thinking?
I'm such a jerk.

552
01:01:48,585 --> 01:01:52,880
I thought I could start a new life.
I gave away everything we had.

553
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:59,845
I cut all our ties to the past.
Dragged Joey away from his friends.

554
01:02:01,681 --> 01:02:04,517
"Be good," look where it got us.
All for nothing.

555
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,394
We'll never get away from them.

556
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:15,110
The funniest part is, I wasn't even thinking
of guys, and then I meet you...

557
01:02:22,244 --> 01:02:26,413
If you knew what I thought about us...

558
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:31,085
That's pretty pathetic.

559
01:02:32,796 --> 01:02:36,465
Let's face it.
They're never gonna leave me alone.

560
01:02:40,595 --> 01:02:42,263
The ball-buster

561
01:02:44,266 --> 01:02:46,100
is Mrs. Tony Russo.

562
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,729
You've heard of the Russo crime family?

563
01:02:51,106 --> 01:02:54,358
My husband worked for Tony.

564
01:03:01,283 --> 01:03:02,950
And he was iced.

565
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:08,163
Tony's been trying to screw me ever since.

566
01:03:11,293 --> 01:03:12,960
God, I hate them.

567
01:03:21,052 --> 01:03:24,722
I really misjudged you.

568
01:03:27,225 --> 01:03:28,309
I'm sorry.

569
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:34,857
It was nice knowing you.

570
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:21,236
-I've got some things I have to say to you.
-You do?

571
01:04:24,366 --> 01:04:26,367
Goddamn it.

572
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:31,413
It's not easy to turn your life around.

573
01:04:32,207 --> 01:04:35,042
Especially when your past
keeps coming back to haunt you.

574
01:04:36,544 --> 01:04:38,462
What makes you so smart?

575
01:04:43,385 --> 01:04:46,553
I guess I know you
better than you think I do.

576
01:04:57,732 --> 01:04:59,733
We all make mistakes.

577
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:07,324
The important thing is to realize it
and to do something about it.

578
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,746
And to let yourself off the hook,

579
01:05:12,831 --> 01:05:15,916
because everybody
deserves a second chance.

580
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:18,127
They do?

581
01:05:20,463 --> 01:05:22,589
Especially someone like you.

582
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:29,471
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

583
01:06:36,331 --> 01:06:37,873
Open up, Romeo.

584
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:40,751
-Who's that?
-My friend.

585
01:06:40,835 --> 01:06:43,629
I gotta get to work. I'll call you later.

586
01:06:43,713 --> 01:06:46,799
-Mike, is everything okay?
-Everything's fine.

587
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:49,843
Wakey, wakey. Eggs and bacie.
Let's get going.

588
01:06:52,222 --> 01:06:56,141
-How long we been on the Russo case?
-Fourteen months. Next question?

589
01:06:56,184 --> 01:06:59,561
-When did you last play hide the salami?
-Classified. Next?

590
01:06:59,646 --> 01:07:03,190
-Utilize a fun bag?
-Back off. Classified. Next question?

591
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:06,443
Fourteen months ruined
because your sausage gets lonely.

592
01:07:06,528 --> 01:07:09,947
Negative. We treed the wrong possum.
Angela's innocent.

593
01:07:12,784 --> 01:07:15,202
I don't know about you anymore.

594
01:07:15,703 --> 01:07:18,413
You're brain's on hold.
You're thinking with your dick.

595
01:07:19,124 --> 01:07:22,709
Maybe you're burned out. Fried.
In over your head.

596
01:07:23,753 --> 01:07:25,796
Maybe you need a vacation.

597
01:07:27,132 --> 01:07:28,507
Maybe not.

598
01:07:29,634 --> 01:07:31,385
I don't know, Downey.

599
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:35,055
I just don't know.

600
01:07:37,642 --> 01:07:41,562
Three words, gentlemen. Get Tony Russo.

601
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:50,070
4:30. Tuesday. Rita.

602
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,990
You got it.

603
01:07:58,163 --> 01:08:00,455
-Angela de Marco?
-Yeah?

604
01:08:00,915 --> 01:08:03,250
FBI. You wanna come downtown with us?

605
01:08:03,835 --> 01:08:06,587
-What is going on?
-Rita Harcourt?

606
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,464
Immigration and Naturalization.
You gotta come downtown with me.

607
01:08:12,093 --> 01:08:15,179
Who do you think you are,
telling us to come downtown?

608
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:30,110
What are you doing here?

609
01:08:30,195 --> 01:08:32,696
You'd better sit down.

610
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:49,379
I'm Regional Director Franklin.
This is Special Agent Benitez.

611
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:52,007
You already know Special Agent Downey.

612
01:08:55,887 --> 01:08:57,095
You're FBI?

613
01:09:00,642 --> 01:09:03,101
We've had you
under surveillance for some time.

614
01:09:03,478 --> 01:09:07,522
Surveillance? Is that what you call it?
Surveillance for what?

615
01:09:07,607 --> 01:09:12,319
-For starters, trafficking in stolen goods.
-What are you talking about?

616
01:09:13,321 --> 01:09:16,823
You donated a lot of furniture
to charity. Very generous.

617
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:21,912
-Unfortunately, most of it was hot.
-Give me a break.

618
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:23,789
That's three to five years.

619
01:09:24,749 --> 01:09:26,750
I also have a report from the IRS.

620
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:30,003
About undeclared income
and defrauding the government.

621
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,048
That's an additional 10 to 15
in a federal pen.

622
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:38,011
-Frankie always took care of the taxes.
-You signed the returns.

623
01:09:39,472 --> 01:09:42,683
Then there's your husband's death.
We know who killed him.

624
01:09:46,187 --> 01:09:48,146
And we know who helped.

625
01:09:49,023 --> 01:09:50,482
Where did you get this?

626
01:09:51,276 --> 01:09:52,609
You're in deep shit.

627
01:09:53,653 --> 01:09:56,697
So is your friend. She's being deported.

628
01:09:57,532 --> 01:10:01,034
She'll be under a palm tree
opening coconuts by the end of the week.

629
01:10:03,454 --> 01:10:05,539
You sleazy sons of bitches.

630
01:10:06,374 --> 01:10:09,626
-Unless you play ball.
-You people work like the Mob.

631
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:13,046
-There's no difference.
-There's a big difference.

632
01:10:13,464 --> 01:10:17,050
The Mob is run by murdering,
lying, cheating psychopaths.

633
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:20,512
We work for the President
of the United States of America.

634
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:24,891
-Go to hell.
-Let's stop playing games, Angela.

635
01:10:26,394 --> 01:10:28,812
We can have you arrested and put in jail.

636
01:10:29,063 --> 01:10:33,066
You'll be declared an unfit mother,
and Joey will end up in a foster home.

637
01:10:33,401 --> 01:10:35,902
-Hold it, Franklin.
-Shut up, Downey.

638
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:41,241
-You can't do that.
-Just you watch us.

639
01:10:42,744 --> 01:10:46,496
The meeting is all set.
Everyone is gonna be there.

640
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:49,750
I'm having a travel agent
bring over the tickets.

641
01:10:50,251 --> 01:10:54,588
I'm handling the security myself.
I don't see any problems.

642
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:57,424
That's real good, Uncle Joe.

643
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:02,763
By the way, there's a Mrs. de Marco
waiting to see you.

644
01:11:04,182 --> 01:11:05,182
She's here now?

645
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:13,190
-Have her come in, Uncle Joe.
-Right.

646
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:22,115
Fellas, evaporate for five minutes.

647
01:11:37,298 --> 01:11:39,925
Look what the cat dragged in.

648
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:43,970
Sit down.

649
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:54,648
It's terrible about Tommy.

650
01:11:58,611 --> 01:12:01,363
First it was Frankie, and now Tommy.

651
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,784
How's Rosie taking it?

652
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:12,165
Rosie took a month's supply of Valium
this morning. She's at Mercy Hospital.

653
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:19,965
-I'm a little surprised you're here.
-Yeah. I know.

654
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:27,848
When I saw the newspaper this morning,

655
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:32,018
all these feelings came over me.

656
01:12:33,312 --> 01:12:36,565
I just feel really lost.

657
01:12:36,649 --> 01:12:41,111
And I just wanted to see you.

658
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:44,197
Get outta here.

659
01:12:44,449 --> 01:12:46,908
You really scared me the day of the funeral.

660
01:12:46,993 --> 01:12:49,995
You don't realize the effect
you have on a woman.

661
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:52,539
You're a very powerful guy, Tony.

662
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,917
Don't bullshit me.

663
01:12:58,421 --> 01:13:01,840
You don't get it, do you?
Well, I didn't expect you to.

664
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,642
I'll see you around.

665
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:15,020
-Hold it right there.
-What?

666
01:13:22,028 --> 01:13:24,237
Are you being straight with me?

667
01:13:25,531 --> 01:13:28,241
No, I came all the way out here
just to pull your chain.

668
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:31,828
You know something? I almost believe you.

669
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,087
Here's your itinerary, Anthony.

670
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:45,926
You're going out on Eastern. 8:00 a.m.

671
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:49,262
Thank you, Uncle Joe.

672
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,435
Where are you going?

673
01:13:59,065 --> 01:14:00,357
Miami.

674
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:04,110
-Bye, Mom.
-Love you.

675
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:17,958
Tony! Tony! Tone!

676
01:14:20,962 --> 01:14:24,798
Boarding flight 17,
non-stop service to Miami. Bay 32.

677
01:14:27,802 --> 01:14:31,346
That's it. We got a minute.
Let's park it here.

678
01:14:32,223 --> 01:14:34,307
I'll double-check the tickets.

679
01:14:34,392 --> 01:14:38,144
-I'm gonna go freshen up.
-Okay. You got time.

680
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:52,659
-Have a safe trip, miss.
-Thank you.

681
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:57,706
Leave me alone.

682
01:15:21,272 --> 01:15:23,064
Holy shit. Nick!

683
01:15:23,149 --> 01:15:26,359
-I'm way ahead of you, boss.
-I don't believe this.

684
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:29,362
Thank God I got here in time. Oh, baby.

685
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:35,368
-What's wrong? What's wrong?
-You forgot to say goodbye to me.

686
01:15:35,745 --> 01:15:40,874
-You were asleep. I kissed you goodbye.
-You should have woken me up.

687
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:45,003
I know I've been hard on you lately,
but I had this awful dream.

688
01:15:45,046 --> 01:15:48,798
And I realized I've been awfully selfish.

689
01:15:49,884 --> 01:15:51,301
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

690
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:56,723
Eastern Airlines flight 17,
non-stop to Miami, is now boarding.

691
01:16:01,312 --> 01:16:04,105
-Please forgive me, baby.
-Don't be silly.

692
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:07,400
I've got a confession to make.

693
01:16:09,236 --> 01:16:13,448
The other night when you didn't
come home on time, I got suspicious.

694
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:18,078
-I'm so ashamed. I went to Angela's.
-You went over to Angela's?

695
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,748
I couldn't help it.
I had to see if you were with her.

696
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:27,420
Just thinking about you with that slut,
I just I went crazy. I couldn't stand it.

697
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:34,719
Tony, if I'd found you banging that broad,
I would've hunted you down like an animal.

698
01:16:34,762 --> 01:16:38,264
It would have been slow and painful.

699
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:40,934
You would have begged me
for mercy, baby.

700
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:42,268
I was so far gone.

701
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:45,563
Connie, you're talking crazy.
I gotta get on the plane.

702
01:16:45,606 --> 01:16:50,944
I'm so ashamed for not trusting you,
is what I'm trying to say.

703
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:55,073
Especially when I saw
the schmuck Angela was with.

704
01:16:55,116 --> 01:16:57,784
-What schmuck?
-Just some schmuck.

705
01:16:57,868 --> 01:16:59,452
Get on your plane.

706
01:17:00,705 --> 01:17:03,248
She didn't waste any time, did she?

707
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:06,167
-Get on the plane, you maniac.
-Okay.

708
01:17:06,252 --> 01:17:08,962
Tone, I'm gonna be the best wife to you.

709
01:17:09,672 --> 01:17:11,297
Okay, honey. See you.

710
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:35,238
I hope that didn't shake you up
too much back there.

711
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:37,449
-No. I'm okay.
-Good.

712
01:17:38,701 --> 01:17:41,161
-Champagne, sir?
-Thank you.

713
01:17:43,998 --> 01:17:49,919
Here's to the mystery of life.

714
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:53,673
We have a lot to learn about each other.

715
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:08,897
Front desk. How are you, honey?

716
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:12,734
Beautiful. You have a reservation
for Mr. Anthony Russo?

717
01:18:12,818 --> 01:18:16,529
This is Mrs. Russo.
I'm gonna join my husband.

718
01:18:16,572 --> 01:18:19,783
I want you to move us
into the honeymoon suite.

719
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:22,994
I want champagne. I want caviar.

720
01:18:23,037 --> 01:18:26,790
I want flowers.
I want the room to swim in flowers...

721
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,958
Excuse me, honey?

722
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:32,962
He already has the honeymoon suite?

723
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:39,010
-We have a flight in 45 minutes.
-Give me the fucking ticket, dickhead.

724
01:19:16,841 --> 01:19:18,800
-Nick, check us in.
-Right.

725
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:24,514
Look. A piano bar.

726
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:37,944
-Is something wrong?
-No. Nothing's wrong.

727
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,364
Are you sure?

728
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:11,185
A regular menace to society.

729
01:20:14,523 --> 01:20:17,817
Especially when I saw
the schmuck Angela was with.

730
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:25,742
-Hi, boss.
-Yo, boss.

731
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:30,163
Stevarino, Al. I wanna talk to you.
Angela, I'll be right with you.

732
01:20:47,014 --> 01:20:50,516
-Can I get you a drink, sir?
-Club soda. Thanks.

733
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:09,285
Hello, Mama. Homeboy. Target sky bound.

734
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:13,081
Remember, look, but don't touch.
You're the eyes, we're the brains.

735
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:16,542
Don't make a move without my say-so.
You got it, Downey?

736
01:21:22,758 --> 01:21:24,008
Downey?

737
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,221
Roger, Mama. Loud and clear.

738
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:34,727
-Pal, what are you drinking?
-Thanks, but I gotta...

739
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:37,563
You gotta what? You gotta relax.

740
01:21:37,648 --> 01:21:41,067
I can see you're on your own
and you're bored. So are we.

741
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:45,071
-What's your name?
-Mike. Mike Smith.

742
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:50,743
-I'm Nick Jones. This is my nephew Al.
-Hey, how's it going, pal?

743
01:21:51,495 --> 01:21:53,997
If I could buy my Uncle Nick
for what he's worth

744
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:57,625
and then sell him for what he thinks
he's worth, I'd be a billionaire.

745
01:21:57,710 --> 01:22:00,211
I'll give him a beating.

746
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:13,808
Meeting's in one hour, boss.

747
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,938
Get New York on the phone
for me, Stevarino.

748
01:22:35,164 --> 01:22:38,291
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Miami.

749
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:42,879
Please remain in your seats
until we reach the terminal.

750
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:44,630
Madam, please.

751
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:48,468
Honey, forget about it.

752
01:22:59,313 --> 01:23:01,481
Got something for you.

753
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:03,357
Open it up.

754
01:23:05,235 --> 01:23:07,320
It's beautiful.

755
01:23:10,282 --> 01:23:14,410
I thought you deserved
something real special.

756
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:17,997
So do you, Tone.

757
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:21,584
What's that? For me? You little devil.

758
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:25,338
Your hands are trembling.

759
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:27,298
I'm scared shitless.

760
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:34,764
I didn't expect this of you, Angela.

761
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:41,854
-It's magnificent.
-You like it?

762
01:23:41,897 --> 01:23:45,525
Like? Are you kidding? Here, put it on.

763
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:50,530
Look at that. Look how it picks up the light.

764
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:55,243
That's not all it picks up, Tony.

765
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:57,203
Grand jury time, Tony.

766
01:23:57,371 --> 01:23:59,038
Don't you go away now.

767
01:24:03,794 --> 01:24:07,380
Director Franklin, Jimmy "Fisheggs"
just arrived. The gondola.

768
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:09,423
Clear, Renée.

769
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:13,719
Mr. James Roe.
The party's shaping up nicely.

770
01:24:14,263 --> 01:24:17,181
Come on, Tony. Get your ass over here.

771
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:21,561
-Stevarino, I'll get it.
-Okay, boss.

772
01:24:25,149 --> 01:24:26,732
Come in, fellas.

773
01:24:29,403 --> 01:24:32,363
-Who's your friend?
-Meet Mike Smith.

774
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:35,700
A lonely guy from Dubuque. A great guy.

775
01:24:35,742 --> 01:24:38,411
A one-man party
in search of the right crowd.

776
01:24:38,453 --> 01:24:42,248
-I knew you guys had to meet.
-You did the right thing, Nick.

777
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:46,419
It's fabulous to meet you, Mr. Smith.

778
01:24:46,503 --> 01:24:49,046
Great to hook up
with another party animal.

779
01:24:49,089 --> 01:24:52,592
I think it's Nick and Al here
who are the real animals.

780
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:55,428
What is he up to now?

781
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:58,973
-I admire your mustache.
-Thank you very much.

782
01:25:00,684 --> 01:25:02,894
-Angela?
-Yeah.

783
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,939
Come and meet Mike Smith from Dubuque.

784
01:25:09,943 --> 01:25:13,446
Hi. I'm Mike Smith from Dubuque.

785
01:25:16,783 --> 01:25:20,786
-Hello, Mr. Smith.
-It's fabulous to meet you, Angela.

786
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:23,497
-Thank you.
-It's fabulous to meet all of you.

787
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:26,667
Let's take a seat, Mike.

788
01:25:26,752 --> 01:25:29,045
-Come on.
-Thanks.

789
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:31,631
-Sit down, Mr. Smith.
-Okay.

790
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:40,473
It's a wild spread you got here.
I realize you're busy. I'll...

791
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:43,184
Fellas.

792
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:48,898
Frisk him, Stevarino.

793
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:51,150
-Watch him, Nick.
-You got it, Steve.

794
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:54,195
Hold it.

795
01:25:54,655 --> 01:25:57,031
Make another move
and I'll blow your brains out.

796
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:05,748
Looky here, boss. Only a lighter.

797
01:26:11,838 --> 01:26:13,381
Very interesting.

798
01:26:17,552 --> 01:26:19,053
You know, hon.

799
01:26:19,263 --> 01:26:23,933
This is none of my business.
I don't even know what's going on here.

800
01:26:24,601 --> 01:26:26,894
But I think it's getting out of hand.

801
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:28,938
Stay out of this, miss.

802
01:26:29,856 --> 01:26:31,732
Check out this here.

803
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:47,915
-Who the fuck are you?
-Federal Bureau of Investigation.

804
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:51,836
You're all under arrest. If you got
about 14 hours, I'll read you the charges.

805
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:55,965
I can see the headlines
in the newspaper in the morning.

806
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:58,509
"FBI hothead shoots love-nest girlfriend."

807
01:26:58,552 --> 01:27:01,220
-Hey, what you doing? What the...
-Freeze.

808
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:06,100
If anyone moves, I'll blow his head off.

809
01:27:09,563 --> 01:27:10,730
Go ahead.

810
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:16,527
-I'm not kidding, Tony.
-It's all over, Tony.

811
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:20,114
The place is crawling with cops.
FBI, DEA, Treasury.

812
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:23,409
Angela.

813
01:27:23,994 --> 01:27:25,870
-What?
-Be careful.

814
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:28,372
Very, very careful.

815
01:27:28,707 --> 01:27:31,375
-Don't.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

816
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:41,177
Angela, you're a very exciting woman.

817
01:27:43,138 --> 01:27:46,349
For some crazy reason, I think
I'd rather kill myself than hurt you.

818
01:27:47,267 --> 01:27:49,393
But suicide's out of the question.

819
01:27:49,603 --> 01:27:55,274
Just like you hurt my husband, Tony? Just
like you killed Frankie, you lying bastard?

820
01:27:56,318 --> 01:27:59,111
Boss, is that bitch telling
the truth or is she lying?

821
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:01,781
-Chill out.
-That's right, buddies.

822
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,659
Tell 'em, Tony. Say it loud and clear
so we can get it on tape.

823
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:09,038
The whole place is bugged.
The chairs, the lamps, the paintings.

824
01:28:09,456 --> 01:28:12,458
Any second, 50 agents
are gonna pound at that door.

825
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:14,460
Bullshit.

826
01:28:17,839 --> 01:28:20,966
That's it, Tony.
You have the right to remain silent.

827
01:28:21,009 --> 01:28:23,803
Anything you say
can and will be used against you.

828
01:28:24,221 --> 01:28:26,639
Shut the fuck up, fuzzball.

829
01:28:27,974 --> 01:28:30,935
-I'll get it.
-You have the right to an attorney.

830
01:28:31,186 --> 01:28:34,188
Angela, stay...
Get your dicks out of your hands, guys.

831
01:28:34,272 --> 01:28:36,774
If you cannot afford an attorney
one will be appointed to you.

832
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:39,610
Wait a minute,
Mike, it's your old buddy Al. Remember?

833
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:43,322
-Connie!
-Connie!

834
01:28:45,325 --> 01:28:47,618
Oh, my God! Tony, it's Connie.

835
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:55,292
Why are you here, dorkface?

836
01:28:55,335 --> 01:28:58,504
I came to tell your husband
to keep his hands off of my woman.

837
01:28:59,297 --> 01:29:03,926
Connie, don't listen to him. He's a cop.
And Angela is working with him.

838
01:29:08,223 --> 01:29:10,015
Honeymoon suite.

839
01:29:12,102 --> 01:29:14,061
Connie, she gave me a ring, see?

840
01:29:14,354 --> 01:29:18,149
She gave me a ring,
but it's got a bug in it, Connie. A bug!

841
01:29:18,525 --> 01:29:20,860
Can you believe that? How about that shit?

842
01:29:21,486 --> 01:29:23,696
I got nothing to live for anymore, Tony.

843
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:29,452
Connie, of course you do.
That's ridiculous. Think of Tony Junior.

844
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:34,373
All your credit cards, honey. You got a...

845
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:39,378
All right, let's think.
You got your game shows, honey.

846
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:41,964
You got Wheel of Fame.

847
01:29:44,843 --> 01:29:47,219
Connie, that was close.

848
01:29:50,056 --> 01:29:51,515
Watch your back, Uncle Nick.

849
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,560
Take him out.

850
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:32,056
Gee, Mike. You didn't have to do that.

851
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:38,187
Now, Connie.
Connie, honey, I'm gonna change.

852
01:30:38,939 --> 01:30:40,356
You certainly will.

853
01:30:43,944 --> 01:30:45,236
FBI. Drop it, Connie.

854
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:14,974
-Hold it, Tony.
-Screw you.

855
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:18,561
Tony Russo,

856
01:31:19,062 --> 01:31:22,731
you're under arrest for the murders
of Frank de Marco and Karen Lutnick.

857
01:31:23,984 --> 01:31:27,236
-You'll never make it stick.
-Sure, Tony.

858
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:38,455
-Hey, Tony, what did you tell them in there?
-I'm sorry. I can't talk about it.

859
01:31:38,498 --> 01:31:42,835
-How are the Feds treating you, Tony?
-Not bad. I get to watch all my soaps.

860
01:31:44,796 --> 01:31:47,840
The food must be good.
You put on some weight.

861
01:31:48,174 --> 01:31:49,925
It's probably the bulletproof vest.

862
01:31:51,136 --> 01:31:53,846
Bullet proof vest, are you afraid
someone will knock you off, Tony?

863
01:31:53,888 --> 01:31:57,308
Afraid? With these gorillas around me?

864
01:31:57,350 --> 01:32:00,686
Come on, I feel safer than a virgin
at a eunuch convention.

865
01:32:01,438 --> 01:32:06,275
Say, Robert. Would you mind
if I stepped in and took a leak?

866
01:32:07,652 --> 01:32:09,695
-Go ahead.
-You're a gentleman.

867
01:32:16,911 --> 01:32:20,414
The fries are crispy, the shakes are creamy

868
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:25,044
The Double Continental
with cheese is dreamy

869
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:27,880
It's a Burger World town

870
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:54,073
Hiya, Tone.

871
01:32:55,784 --> 01:32:57,076
Connie?

872
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:06,377
Kiss it goodbye.

873
01:33:11,758 --> 01:33:12,758
No!

874
01:33:18,932 --> 01:33:21,392
Holy Mary, mother of God.

875
01:33:22,102 --> 01:33:23,686
Oh, shit!

876
01:33:25,021 --> 01:33:29,316
-Another bad dream?
-Yeah. I guess you could say that.

877
01:33:40,954 --> 01:33:42,621
Time to get up anyway.

878
01:33:43,581 --> 01:33:46,917
Today's your big day.
Can't keep the grand jury waiting.

879
01:33:55,343 --> 01:33:57,720
Angela, you are an artist.

880
01:34:00,306 --> 01:34:02,641
-Great. You like it?
-I love it.

881
01:34:05,145 --> 01:34:07,730
Here. You keep the change.

882
01:34:11,943 --> 01:34:13,485
Next victim.

883
01:34:17,323 --> 01:34:19,992
-Hello, Gorgeous.
-Hello, gorgeous.

884
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,458
-It's you.
-Please don't hang up again.

885
01:34:28,418 --> 01:34:32,004
Angela, look out the window.
Look across the street.

886
01:34:38,428 --> 01:34:40,262
Give me a break. What do you want?

887
01:34:42,098 --> 01:34:43,140
A haircut?

888
01:34:44,768 --> 01:34:49,188
-Boy, you don't give up too easy, Mike.
-Not when it come to you, Angela.

889
01:34:51,858 --> 01:34:55,110
Sure. I suppose I could squeeze you in.

890
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,868
I see your arm is healed. Lay back.

891
01:35:06,915 --> 01:35:09,833
You know, Angela, I've been thinking.

892
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:13,754
There you go, working without tools again.

893
01:35:14,255 --> 01:35:15,964
I've been thinking, too.

894
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:21,720
You know, I fell for you like a ton of bricks.

895
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:29,895
I bared my soul to you.
I trusted you. You lied to me.

896
01:35:30,188 --> 01:35:33,315
Then, you almost had me killed.

897
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:37,361
But...

898
01:35:40,073 --> 01:35:41,949
I can't stop thinking about

899
01:35:45,286 --> 01:35:48,247
what you said to me
that night at my apartment.

900
01:35:49,624 --> 01:35:53,168
Maybe everyone does
deserve a second chance.

901
01:35:55,296 --> 01:35:56,588
Even you.

902
01:36:02,262 --> 01:36:03,887
You want one?

903
01:36:08,059 --> 01:36:09,852
Yeah. I want one.

904
01:36:11,604 --> 01:36:13,522
I'll think about it.
