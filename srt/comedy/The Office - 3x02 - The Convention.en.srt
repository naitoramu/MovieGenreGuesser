1
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:04,153
- Pam?
- Yeah?

2
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:06,064
Did you see Oprah yesterday?

3
00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:09,661
- No, I didn't.
- I, uh...

4
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:12,858
I am going to be a father.

5
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,281
What was Oprah about?

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,071
Angelina Jolie was on.

7
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:20,963
And she adopted a baby from Asia, 
and she said that it changed her life.

8
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,490
And that really inspired me.

9
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:30,830
So, I want you to look into seeing 
how much a little Chinese baby would cost.

10
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:33,996
- That's a really big decision.
- I know.

11
00:00:34,157 --> 00:00:38,223
Maybe you should wait before
you adopt. Or not adopt.

12
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:40,194
Just do it, okay?

13
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:44,659
Roy's sister looked into it, and the 
application alone costs a thousand dollars.

14
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:53,876
Um... find out if there's a cheaper, 
less expensive baby out there, okay?

15
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:56,768
You know, she also said the waiting
list is like eight months.

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,828
- Eight months?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:57,863 --> 00:00:59,809
I don't even know if I'll want
a baby in eight months.

18
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:01,303
You probably won't.

19
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:07,810
You know what, Pam?
If in ten years...

20
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:10,910
I haven't had a baby,
and you haven't had a baby...

21
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:12,443
No, Michael.

22
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:15,675
- Twenty years.
- No, Michael.

23
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:18,455
Thirty.

24
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:20,752
Sure.

25
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:22,824
It's a deal.

26
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,388
All right. Three pairs of pants.

27
00:01:57,444 --> 00:01:59,077
Three pairs of socks.

28
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:02,066
- Three packs of condoms.
- Yesh.

29
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,989
Uh, fun jeans.

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,827
- Sign.
- Per diem.

31
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,642
Guess where I am going!

32
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:13,945
I will give you a hint.

33
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:17,372
It is a booze-fueled sex romp,
where anything goes.

34
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:19,048
You are correct, sir!

35
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:20,385
I am headed to Philadelphia

36
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:24,382
for the Annual Northeastern
Mid-Market Office Supply Convention.

37
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:28,018
And Jim Halpert is going to be
coming, which will be fun.

38
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:32,973
Poor little guy. He's been
stuck working under Josh,

39
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:35,215
the poor man's Michael Scott,

40
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:37,342
as he is known around my condo.

41
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:41,238
Don't be mad, it is a business trip.

42
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:44,353
But I don't understand.
It's for managers.

43
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:47,150
Monkey, I am an A. R. M.,
Assistant Regional Manager. 

44
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:48,592
I know!

45
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:53,878
It... I was just really hoping
we could spend some time together.

46
00:02:57,205 --> 00:02:59,429
- Are you still there?
- Yes, Monkey.

47
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:03,381
Don't "Monkey" me! You can't wait
to get out of here, A. R. M.

48
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,825
In the Martin family, we like to say,

49
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,144
"Looks like someone took
the slow train from Philly."

50
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:13,188
That's code for "check out the slut."

51
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,382
What is...

52
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:18,322
why are there flies in here?

53
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:20,758
Oh my God! Are you so
excited for tonight?

54
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:23,073
I am so excited. You guys are
going to click, I can feel it.

55
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:24,950
So what are you wearing?

56
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:26,861
This.

57
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,022
You look so pretty.

58
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:34,497
Thank you.

59
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,072
Yes, I have a date.

60
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:40,047
He's a cartoonist for the local paper,

61
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,474
which is really neat,
because I like to draw too.

62
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:46,727
I'm kind of nervous.

63
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:51,162
I haven't been on a first
date in nine years... 

64
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:55,267
probably shouldn't broadcast that.

65
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:57,738
Well, remember, no matter
how much you may want to,

66
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:00,435
do not sleep with him on the first
date. It gives him all the power.

67
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,124
Sleep with who?

68
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,914
Whom, whom... whom?

69
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,472
My neighbor Alan. They're
going on a date tonight.

70
00:04:06,524 --> 00:04:08,296
Oh, wow! Oh my God,

71
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:10,125
I have a great idea.
You know what you should do

72
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:12,401
to be hilarious?
Wear your wedding dress.

73
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:15,550
It would be a great icebreaker.

74
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:18,278
- And your veil.
- Yeah, do it!

75
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:21,319
- I'll probably just wear this.
- Really? Okay.

76
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:23,759
Well, word of advice:
unbutton that top button.

77
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:25,309
Let those things breathe.

78
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:28,253
Any message you want me
to relate to Jim?

79
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:31,155
- Um...
- Um. Okay, um.

80
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:32,632
- Um. - You got that?
- I got it.

81
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,109
- Write it down.
- Um. Um....

82
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:44,250
There's my girl.

83
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,121
I noticed you handing out some shekels.

84
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:49,002
How would one get on that train?

85
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:50,774
That was for per diem for Philadelphia.

86
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,072
Ugh, that town smells
like cheese steaks.

87
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:55,000
That town is full of history.

88
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:01,607
Andrea's the office bitch.

89
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,491
You'll get used to her.

90
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:08,183
Creed.

91
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:14,776
Can I have my neck pillow back?

92
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,309
Michael!

93
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:19,284
Can I have my neck pillow back?

94
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:24,757
- Hey, Michael.
- Hey, Josh, how you doing?

95
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,058
- Pretty good. How you doing?
- Good to see you. There he is.

96
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,265
There's the traitor.
Traitor! Traitor!

97
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,041
Come here, you. Come here!

98
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:36,015
The product...the progital...

99
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,208
my son returns.

100
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:41,370
I was shocked when he told me
he was transferring to Stamford.

101
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:44,519
It's like the firemen.
You don't leave your brothers behind.

102
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,656
Even if you find out that there is
a better fire in Connecticut.

103
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:53,184
Really good to see you, man.

104
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:57,427
Yeah. Wow.
I didn't expect that.

105
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:59,690
It's good to see you too.

106
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:02,978
Oh, hey. How's it going up there?

107
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,993
Have you made any sales yet?

108
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,422
Yeah, sold about 40,000.

109
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,177
Shut up. That's impossible.

110
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,109
No, it's not. And I did.
Yeah.

111
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:12,264
Well, I did it too.

112
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,986
You know, when I saw Dwight,
I realized

113
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:20,139
how stupid and petty
all those pranks I pulled on him were.

114
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:22,993
And then he spoke.

115
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:27,010
I wonder how hard it would be
to get a copy of his room key.

116
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:28,634
- So did you hear?
- What?

117
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:32,248
- Pam's back on the market again.
- Really? She's dating?

118
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:37,555
Oh, if I weren't engaged,
I would so hit that.

119
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,355
So what kind of commissions
you get up there?

120
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:45,316
Oh, Dwight, I missed you so much.

121
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,979
You're so immature.

122
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,784
Listen, Michael, I heard you
were a great salesman.

123
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,707
And I just want to let you know that
if our branch absorbs your branch,

124
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:57,018
I'm going to look for
a place for you at Stamford.

125
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:58,916
- Oh, hey!
- Hey, Jan.

126
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,536
- We all checked in?
- Yes.

127
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,489
Great. Let's dump our stuff and meet
back down here in a half an hour.

128
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:04,692
- Okay.
- Okay.

129
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:08,897
Jan? Look, I think
we need to set some ground rules.

130
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:12,588
- What are you talking about?
- The 800-pound gorilla in the room.

131
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:14,676
Carol. I'm still dating her.

132
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:18,378
So nothing can happen
between us at the convention.

133
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,634
- Step away from me, Michael.
- Thank you

134
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:24,867
for being so brave with all of this.
Thank you.

135
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,675
Alan's cartoon is so funny, right?

136
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:39,565
And they're, like, so smart. I don't
even know what they mean half the time.

137
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:57,972
- This party is gonna be awesome.
- I know.

138
00:07:58,007 --> 00:08:03,463
That is specifically why I chose a room
close to the elevator. More foot traffic.

139
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,360
Check it out.

140
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,835
That is crooked on that side.

141
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:11,467
Hey hey!

142
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:13,816
- That is a lot of liquor.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:16,579
- And a dart board.
- Well, that's how we do it in Scranton.

144
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:17,935
Or did you forget?

145
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:22,273
Ain't no party like a Scranton party,
'cause a Scranton party don't stop.

146
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,920
We should probably head on down,
you know, hook up with Jan.

147
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:30,760
Well, we have time.
One for the road, gentlemen?

148
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:34,061
A shot of Midori, perhaps.

149
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:42,371
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There
was this bartender at Stamford who...

150
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,353
You know what?
You'd just have to be there.

151
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,498
Wish I was.
I love inside jokes.

152
00:08:48,572 --> 00:08:51,699
I'd love to be a part of one someday.

153
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:58,453
- We should...
- Yeah, all right.

154
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:00,677
- All right, see you guys down there.
- See you guys.

155
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:02,258
Change your mind, come back up.

156
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:04,903
- I'll do a shot with you, Michael.
- Ugh, that would be gross.

157
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:07,183
It's not even lunch yet.

158
00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:15,128
SWAG!
Stuff We All Get.

159
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:19,840
I basically decorated my condo for free
with all of my SWAG!

160
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:24,435
Check it out.
Hi, I'm Michael Scott. Dunder Mifflin.

161
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:26,941
Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional
Manager, Dunder Mifflin.

162
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,401
I am a huge fan.

163
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,163
- Thanks. I appreciate it, guys.
- You know what?

164
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:33,117
I am having a big blowout tonight,
room 308. Hope you can come.

165
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:35,689
- I...maybe. If I can.
- Well, cool!

166
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:38,677
Okay, so can I tell people
you're gonna be there?

167
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:40,249
No, you cannot.

168
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:41,952
So maybe. See ya.

169
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:43,867
Why do they call him The Bus?

170
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:45,469
Because he's afraid to fly.

171
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:46,772
Smile.

172
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,927
Do you remember me from last year?

173
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:52,719
There's a party in my room, 308.
Can't miss it. Right off the elevator.

174
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,599
Tonight. Be there.

175
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,522
All right, Jan just emailed me.
She wants us to meet her up front.

176
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:59,451
Yep. Yeah, she's up front.

177
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,366
You don't have email on your phone.

178
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:04,150
I don't have to, I just know.

179
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:07,226
Yes, hello?

180
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:09,332
- No one just called you.
- All right, nice meeting
you, Ted. Take care.

181
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:13,068
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah, stop by later.
- See you in a bit. Bye-bye.

182
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,848
May I have a moment
of your time, please?

183
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,626
- I need you to do something for me.
- Yes, anything.

184
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,381
I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh.

185
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:23,265
Find out if there are
any skeletons in his attic.

186
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,715
I'll talk to my buddy down
at the station, stat.

187
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,173
Hey, Pam.

188
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,519
- Hey, what's up?
- It's, uh...

189
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:33,803
- I was...might ask if you wanted...
- Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

190
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:38,255
He's not in the office.
Can I take a message?

191
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:40,956
I will.

192
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,085
You too.

193
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:46,794
- Sorry. What's up?
- Um, if, uh...

194
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:55,524
I just completely forgot
what I was going to say.

195
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:57,377
It's so weird.

196
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:01,635
Okay. Well, if you think
of it, I'll be here.

197
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:04,206
Okay.

198
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:12,867
So I called my buddy down
at the station today.

199
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,742
Had them run a background check
on Josh Porter.

200
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:18,365
See if there's any known
aliases, et cetera.

201
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,721
And?

202
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:22,622
He wasn't volunteering today.

203
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:27,742
Yeah.

204
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,252
Things have been pretty
crazy around the office.

205
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:32,320
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

206
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,787
We moved Ryan over to your desk.

207
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,737
Oh. Tell him I say hi.

208
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,799
I will call him later with that message.

209
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,923
Hey, how's... Toby?

210
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:47,796
Toby Flenderson is everything
that is wrong with the paper industry.

211
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,375
- Is he why you left?
- Oh, no. It was just...

212
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,738
you know, a good opportunity for me,
a promotion. I got a chance to... 

213
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:55,140
Opportunity, promotion. Blah blah.

214
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,576
You know, Jim, those are just words.

215
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,447
Have you taken into account
other factors?

216
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,202
Vis-a-vis bosses?

217
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:03,926
Is Josh funnier than I am?

218
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:05,403
Does he even have a girlfriend?

219
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:07,089
Because I have two, basically.

220
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:09,799
Michael, it's really not a competition.

221
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:14,551
Jim got us a great lead with a new rep
from National Envelope.

222
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,375
We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.

223
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:17,400
Hey, Jan. Jan?

224
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,701
Don't worry. I have got the tip.

225
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:21,317
Whoa, Michael.

226
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,654
- Wow. Oh, my God, thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Was that your per diem?

227
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,368
No, that was a different
hundred dollar bill.

228
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:28,949
What have you generated, Michael?

229
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:33,231
I have generated a lot of interest
in my party this evening.

230
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:36,276
- What party?
- Party I'm having tonight in 308.

231
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:38,170
Obviously, you are invited.

232
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:44,029
Michael, um...
Jim and Josh are in meetings

233
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:47,477
all day and I am
in and out of meetings.

234
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:52,451
I can't stay on top of you 24/7.

235
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,791
You should order
the most expensive thing on the menu.

236
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,776
So he knows you're worth it.

237
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:05,585
If you do that, you're gonna
have to put out.

238
00:13:07,517 --> 00:13:10,089
Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.

239
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:13,603
Is there a key for Jane Doe?

240
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:16,234
Thank you.

241
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:20,943
Any messages for 308?

242
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:24,092
All right.

243
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:25,951
Hey hey, fellers.

244
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,550
- Michael. Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Michael.

245
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:30,754
Uh, well, Jim and I have a meeting
with Uni-ball in about 45 minutes,

246
00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:32,635
- so we should probably go.
- Hey, check this out.

247
00:13:32,636 --> 00:13:35,189
How about that?
A little friendly competition.

248
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,017
Stamford versus Scranton.

249
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:40,336
- I don't think so.
- Oh. Jim?

250
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:44,215
Looks like you picked a bad time
to defect, my friend.

251
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,904
Fine. All right.

252
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:48,149
Okay. Excellent.

253
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:50,742
Oh, just shut it.

254
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:54,878
Hey, Pam, what's up?

255
00:13:55,455 --> 00:13:59,764
Yeah--uh, no. Tell him I will give him
general specifics tomorrow, okay?

256
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:02,257
Yes. Say hi to Pam!

257
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:04,359
Hi, Pam.

258
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:06,548
Yes, that is Josh and Dwight and Jim.

259
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,527
Pam says hi.
Have fun on your date.

260
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:12,694
Very good. Talk to you later.
Bye.

261
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,343
You first.

262
00:14:21,758 --> 00:14:25,250
- Oh, nice try, Josh!
- Not. It hit the rim.

263
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:27,613
Okay, and...

264
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,096
Okay, double or nothing.

265
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:33,620
What? We didn't bet anything, Michael.

266
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,761
- Well, let's...
- You know, we should go.

267
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:39,253
- Come on, come on. Come on!
- We'll do it later.

268
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:42,138
Say, while I have you here,

269
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:45,068
can I talk to you about some new and
exciting advances to our product line?

270
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:45,911
Fine.

271
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:47,703
Jim and I have different
definitions of friendship.

272
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:49,946
I think it's talking and being friends

273
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,508
and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut
and being best friends with Josh.

274
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:57,299
Well...
phooey on that.

275
00:14:57,377 --> 00:15:02,242
I, uh... I'm done. I am not going
to be speaking with him anymore.

276
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:05,352
Whatevs.
Long distance relationships never work.

277
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:07,480
That is so true.

278
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:09,708
Ready?

279
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,687
Okay, let me tell you
what we're looking for.

280
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:17,947
Sorry, my meeting ran late.

281
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:21,092
- Really?
- Yes, Jan. Really.

282
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,863
With a rep from Hammermill.
They're exclusive with Staples.

283
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:25,274
Used to be.

284
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:27,359
Evan'll call you in the morning
to work out the details.

285
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,396
We can now sell Hammermill products.

286
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:31,068
Yes!

287
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:34,057
Well, Michael...

288
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:36,146
I underestimated you.

289
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:40,055
Yeah, well, maybe next time
you will estimate me.

290
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:44,528
Dwight's room key.

291
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,517
And Dwight's room.

292
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,887
What can I say? Old habits die hard.

293
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:52,190
D?

294
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:57,198
Oh, my God. Dwight got a hooker.

295
00:15:57,268 --> 00:15:59,440
Oh, my God, I gotta call...

296
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:02,324
I gotta call somebody.
I don't even know who to call.

297
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,125
Dwight got a hooker!

298
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:09,633
So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with
your cartoons. She reads them every day.

299
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,566
Oh, great.

300
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:15,479
I don't want ketchup.
You love ketchup. He loves ketchup.

301
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:18,142
So how do you come up
with your cartoons?

302
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:24,019
I just...I kinda think
about stuff that I see.

303
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,034
Or dream them.

304
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:30,139
You dream in cartoons? How fun.

305
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:33,973
Hey! First guest!

306
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,614
You are going to have
some tequila, my friend.

307
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:39,120
I thought there was a party in here.

308
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,215
This is the party.

309
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,821
- This is room 308?
- Party central.

310
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:46,314
So what can I do you for?
All right.

311
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:50,544
See this one is great.

312
00:16:50,648 --> 00:16:54,036
Because it could work
on a couple of different levels.

313
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,270
Freedom fries for the table.

314
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:01,137
Freedom fries. Yeah.

315
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,851
Yeah, I mean,

316
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:07,209
people always say, like,
don't be edgy. But,

317
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,842
I don't know any other way.

318
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:12,578
Yeah, you get it.

319
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:29,786
Well, it was really nice
meeting you, Alan.

320
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,164
Yeah, next time bring some of your
illustrations. I'll let you pick my brain.

321
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,948
- More freedom fries.
- Yeah.

322
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,529
- That's great.
- Okay.

323
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:41,221
I went on a date.
It wasn't a love connection.

324
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,451
I think when I like someone again,
I'll just kinda know.

325
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,659
Michael.

326
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:14,769
Am I the first to arrive?

327
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:18,088
People have been filtering in and out.

328
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:21,862
- Can I get a drink?
- What?

329
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:25,671
- Can I get a drink?
- Sure.

330
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,211
- You like cosmos?
- Yeah, sure. Sounds good.

331
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:37,954
So why are you here?
Is Josh busy?

332
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:40,082
- Michael...
- I get it, you know?

333
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:43,505
- Did I do something?
- No, I totally get it.
He made a better paper airplane.

334
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:46,723
Stamford is better in sales.

335
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:49,458
I get it. We had some fun.
We had some laughs.

336
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,568
Wait wait wait,
I didn't transfer because of you.

337
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:57,034
You're a good boss.
You're a great boss.

338
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,327
Not better than Josh.

339
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,812
Michael, it's not about...

340
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,357
I transferred because of Pam.

341
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,205
Oh, my God.

342
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:15,979
You don't even know. She's single now.

343
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:19,093
No, I heard something about that.

344
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:22,433
It's just, I kind of
put it all on the line.

345
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:29,374
Twice, actually.
And she said no. Twice.

346
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:35,841
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,025
Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.

348
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:40,666
- No, that's okay.
- Yeah.

349
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:42,230
- That's all right.
- I will.

350
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,019
I'll talk to her.

351
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,786
You should at least talk to...Roy.

352
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:49,935
I mean, he knows exactly
how you're feeling.

353
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:52,506
Yeah.

354
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:54,422
Okay, maybe.

355
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:57,657
- Are we early?
- Hey, no.

356
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,951
You know, people have been
filtering in and out.

357
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:02,474
- Hey. Evan, this is Jim. 
- How are ya?

358
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:06,739
- Hey, Arnie Risman. Michael, Jim.
- Hey, Arnie, how you doing?

359
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:09,884
- You guys work together?
- No, we used to.

360
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:11,987
- Yeah.
- Now, we're friends.

361
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:13,846
Best friends.

362
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:18,020
Some people need dozens of friends

363
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:21,016
to say, hey, look at me, I'm popular.

364
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:24,391
But not me. I'm very picky.
I need three. Maybe two?

365
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:27,922
When you meet that someone special,
you'll just know.

366
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:33,212
Because a real relationship...
can't be forced.

367
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:36,917
It should just come
about effortledlessly.

368
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:42,950
Would you do the pleasure of
hitting the lights, sir?

369
00:20:48,635 --> 00:20:50,512
Whoa. What are all those stains?

370
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,960
- Blood, urine, or semen.
- Oh, God, I hope it's urine.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
