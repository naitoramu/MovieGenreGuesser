1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,298
What am I sitting on?

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,091
Top of the world?

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,886
Dock of the bay?

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,764
I'm out.

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,850
Oh, undies!

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,313
Whose are they?

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,690
- Whose are they?
- Not mine.

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:27,111
Joey's!
Got to be Joey's.

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,449
They're mine.

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,076
See, Joey's.
They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.

11
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,037
Why are they here?

12
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,415
I don't know.

13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,418
I'm Joey.

14
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,712
I'm disgusting.

15
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:49,258
I take my underwear off
in other people's homes.

16
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:54,262
Get them out of here.
What's wrong with you?

17
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,642
- Take them!
- I got them.

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,063
You can touch them.
They're yours.

19
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,945
Chandler? A word?

20
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:22,666
I'm tired of covering for you two.
This has got to stop.

21
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,629
Tighty-whiteys?
What are you, eight?

22
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,672
Thank you, Joey, so much.

23
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,674
You're not welcome, okay?

24
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,511
Look, I hate this.
You guys keep embarrassing me.

25
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,223
Yesterday, Rachel found
your razor in our bathroom.

26
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:44,145
I said it was mine, and that
I was playing a woman in a play.

27
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,192
Then one thing led
to another and...

28
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:55,115
And around the ankles,
that is a tough spot.

29
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,033
It was.
All right, listen...

30
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,703
All this lying has been
hard on us too.

31
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:04,040
Yeah, I bet all the sex
makes it easier.

32
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,044
Yeah, actually.

33
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,670
We'll be more careful.

34
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:13,300
We don't want them to know
because it's going really well.

35
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,636
And maybe it's going well
because it's a secret.

36
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,557
It sounds weird,
but we're so bad at relationships.

37
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,227
- We are. Help us!
- Help!

38
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:29,817
All right.
But you do it with me once.

39
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,239
Didn't think so.

40
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,577
The One with Ross' Sandwich

41
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,836
What are you reading?

42
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,045
<i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

43
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:36,300
I have to finish it by tomorrow
for my literature class.

44
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,886
You're taking a class?
That's so cool.

45
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,139
I really liked
that Lamaze class I took.

46
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,101
I thought this time I'd go
for something more intellectual...

47
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,813
...with a less painful final exam.

48
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,648
That sounds like fun.

49
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,068
Oh, you should come with me!

50
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,030
Then I'll have someone to sit with.

51
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,574
Do you have time to read it?

52
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:01,783
I read it in school.

53
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:07,540
This is going to be so much fun!
I have to finish.

54
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,712
What's wrong, buddy?

55
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,883
Someone at work ate my sandwich.

56
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,136
What did the police say?

57
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,347
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.

58
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,433
I can't believe someone ate it.

59
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,934
It's just a sandwich.

60
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,770
Just a sandwich?

61
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,939
I am 30 years old, okay?

62
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,483
I'll be divorced twice and
I got evicted.

63
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,945
That sandwich was
the only good thing in my life!

64
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:43,534
Someone ate the only good thing
going on in my life!

65
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,286
I have enough
for one more sandwich.

66
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:50,291
I was going to eat it myself, but...

67
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:54,462
Mon, that would be incredible.
Thank you so much.

68
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:59,007
I still can't believe
someone ate it!

69
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,845
Look, I left a note and everything.

70
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,513
"Knock-knock."
"Who's there?"

71
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,224
"Ross Geller's lunch."

72
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,601
"Ross Geller's lunch, who?"

73
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:15,149
"Ross Geller's lunch.
Please don't take me. Okay?"

74
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:19,111
I'm surprised
you didn't wear it home.

75
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,030
Want to keep your food?
Scare people off.

76
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,991
I learned that on the street.

77
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,534
Really?

78
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,577
What would you say, Pheebs?

79
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:33,459
Stuff like:
"Keep your mitts off my grub".

80
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:39,548
Do you picture Phoebe on the street
with the entire cast of "Annie"?

81
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:45,053
This'll keep them away
from your stuff.

82
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,521
Phoebe, you are a badass!

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,815
Someday I'll tell you
how I stabbed the cop.

84
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,360
He stabbed me first!

85
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,827
They lived in a patriarchal society.

86
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,497
Sorry I'm late,
but I left late.

87
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,585
So what is the book about?

88
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,545
Didn't you read it
in high school?

89
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,798
I started it, but then
there was this pep rally.

90
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,134
And I was on top of the pyramid.

91
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,802
But anyway...

92
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,097
...what's the book about?

93
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:32,059
It's a tragic love story
between Cathy and Heathcliff.

94
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,187
It takes place on these
creepy moors in England.

95
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:39,524
Which I think represent the wildness
of Heathcliff's character.

96
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,987
I totally get symbolism.

97
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,073
How would you characterize
the theme of this book?

98
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,743
Let's see...
Rachel Greene?

99
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,960
I would have to say
that it's a tragic love story.

100
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,504
That's sort of a given...

101
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,799
...but, yes.
Anyone else?

102
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,593
Symbolism!

103
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,472
And the wildness of the moors...

104
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,183
...which I think, is mirrored...

105
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:18,104
...in the wildness
of Heathcliff's character.

106
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:23,151
Excellent! What Rachel
has shrewdly observed here...

107
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,279
You completely stole my answer!

108
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,281
Honey, that was pretty obvious.

109
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,326
How would you know?
You didn't read it!

110
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:36,748
What do you think?
You in the blue shirt?

111
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:43,630
I think that yours is a question
with many possible answers.

112
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,133
Would you care to venture one?

113
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,220
Would you care to venture one?

114
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,055
Are you just repeating me?

115
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:56,352
Are you just repeating me?

116
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,355
All right. Let's move on.

117
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,149
Okay, then.

118
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,153
Why didn't you say
you hadn't read the book?

119
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,865
I didn't want him
to think I was stupid.

120
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:14,745
That was really embarrassing,
what happened to you.

121
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,416
Your note?

122
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,876
Amazing!

123
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,462
Not only did no one
touch my sandwich...

124
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,798
...but people at work are
actually afraid of me.

125
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,759
A guy called me "Mental".

126
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,761
"Mental Geller."

127
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,890
I've always wanted
a cool nickname like that.

128
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,685
The best you got in high school
was "Wet Pants Geller".

129
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,231
It was the water fountain, okay?!

130
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,442
Anyway...

131
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,569
...people are writing
reports for me...

132
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,363
...pushing back deadlines
to fit my schedule.

133
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,783
I tell you,
you get tough with people...

134
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,786
...and you can get
anything you want.

135
00:08:56,036 --> 00:09:00,582
Hey, Tribbiani!
Give me that coffee! Now!

136
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,718
This was really fun.

137
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,888
I've been wondering
if you'd ask me out.

138
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,140
So you still wondering?

139
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:21,103
No. We just went out.

140
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,730
You're smart.

141
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,359
I like that.

142
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,118
Oh, candles!

143
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,245
What is that, a blanket?

144
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,249
A video camera?
Oh, my God!

145
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:49,172
I can't believe you thought you'd
tape us having sex on the first date!

146
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,766
Joey, is what she just said...

147
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,267
Oh, my God!

148
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,520
You're actually going...

149
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,943
What is going on here?

150
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,865
And with Chandler in the next room.
What are you, sick?

151
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,622
I'm Joey.

152
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,502
I mean, I'm disgusting.

153
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:32,382
I make low-budget adult films.

154
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,477
You promised to be more careful!

155
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:48,357
The good Joey name's been
dragged through the mud!

156
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,067
We're so sorry.

157
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,735
I'm telling everyone.

158
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:56,907
It's the only explanation that
doesn't make me look like a pig!

159
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,825
No, there's a better explanation.

160
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,538
Tell them you had to make
an adult film for your...

161
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:06,083
...adult film class.

162
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,960
I like that.
But no!

163
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,048
How does that explain
my underwear at your place?

164
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,800
I don't know.

165
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,595
Get ready to come out
of the non-gay closet.

166
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:23,434
I promise to come up with something.
Just give us time.

167
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,186
All right.

168
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,147
But it better make me
look really good.

169
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,941
And another thing:

170
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,567
The video camera?

171
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,612
Nice!

172
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:44,955
May I have a word?

173
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,124
Of course, Donald.

174
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:51,712
We've been getting reports
of very angry behavior on your part.

175
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,338
Threatening letters...

176
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,092
...refusal to meet deadlines.

177
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:00,846
Apparently people now
call you Mental.

178
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,769
We want you to speak
to a psychiatrist.

179
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,024
You don't understand.
This is so silly.

180
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,736
This is all just
because of a sandwich.

181
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,571
A sandwich?

182
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:22,242
You see, my sister makes
these amazing turkey sandwiches.

183
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:27,455
Her secret is, she puts an extra slice
of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.

184
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,292
I call it "The Moistmaker".

185
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,296
Anyway, I put my sandwich
in the fridge...

186
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,797
Oh, you know what?

187
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,466
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,969
I believe I ate that.

189
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,682
You ate my sandwich?

190
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,144
A simple mistake.
It can happen to anyone.

191
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,979
Oh, really?

192
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:58,570
Did you confuse it with your own
turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?

193
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,822
Do you, perhaps, remember...

194
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,618
...seeing a note on top of it?

195
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:08,955
There may have been a joke
or limerick of some kind.

196
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,999
That said it was...

197
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,669
...my sandwich!

198
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,587
Now calm down.

199
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:20,301
Look in my office.
Some may be in the trash.

200
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:28,141
It was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.

201
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,229
You threw my sandwich away?

202
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,899
<i>My sandwich?!</i>

203
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,781
What's this book about?

204
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,365
You didn't read it, either?

205
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,702
I was going to, but I accidentally
read something else.

206
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,706
<i>Vogue.</i>

207
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,958
So tell me about Jane Eyre.

208
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,710
No, read it yourself.

209
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,505
Come on,
don't be such a goody-goody.

210
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,549
Fine.

211
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,343
All right.
So, Jane Eyre?

212
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,222
First you'd think she's a woman,
but she's not.

213
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,391
She's a cyborg.

214
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,604
A cyborg?
Isn't that like a robot?

215
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:18,359
This book was light years
ahead of its time.

216
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,363
Sorry I'm late.
Let's get started.

217
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,656
What did you think of "Jane Eyre"?

218
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:30,913
Rachel and I were discussing it,
and she had very interesting insights.

219
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,832
Go ahead, Rachel.

220
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,793
Thank you, Phoebe.

221
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,422
What struck me most
when reading "Jane Eyre"...

222
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,842
...was how the book was
so ahead of its time.

223
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:49,389
If you're talking about feminism,
I think you're right.

224
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,937
Well, feminism, yes.
But also the robots.

225
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,905
Since that video camera thing
didn't work out...

226
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:10,661
...I thought that I would give you
just a little preview.

227
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,287
You're naked!

228
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,124
I know!

229
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,600
Are you okay?

230
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,227
I'm fine.

231
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,480
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.

232
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,606
Why?

233
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,651
On account of my rage.

234
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:47,197
Which, if I may say,
right now is out of control.

235
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,284
He gave me a pill for it.

236
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,745
A pill?

237
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,332
When the psychiatrist told me
to take a leave of absence...

238
00:15:56,582 --> 00:16:00,920
...because I yelled at my boss,
I started to get worked up again.

239
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,798
So he offered me a tranquilizer.

240
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,299
And I thought it was a good idea.

241
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,636
So I took it.

242
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,848
They're making you take
time off work?

243
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,558
And you're okay with that?

244
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,601
I don't know.

245
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:20,314
It's going to be weird
not having a job for a while.

246
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:25,277
But I definitely don't care
about my sandwich.

247
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:30,699
It's so embarrassing! I can't believe
you let me go on like that!

248
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,910
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:40,042
It was so funny when you compared
"Jane Eyre" to "Robocop".

250
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,669
That was not funny!

251
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,507
I snapped, okay?
You weren't taking the class seriously.

252
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,676
Come on!
What is the big deal?

253
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,679
I thought it'd be something
we could do together.

254
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:53,305
I thought it would be fun.

255
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,890
Fun is good.

256
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,100
But I also wanted to learn.

257
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:03,399
People talk about what they learned
in high school. I never went.

258
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:08,570
So you really wanted to learn.

259
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,907
You know, Pheebs,
I just wanted to have fun.

260
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,493
You know who should go?

261
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:18,372
I know! I know! I know!

262
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,877
Monica, you asked the question.

263
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:43,939
Oh, my god, that's Monica!

264
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,945
You get away from me,
you sick, sick, sicko!

265
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,613
What's going on?

266
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:55,576
Joey has got a secret peephole!

267
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,330
He has a naked picture of Monica!

268
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,668
He takes naked pictures of us, then
he eats chicken and looks at them!

269
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,047
Oh! Dude, that's my sister!

270
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,591
Give me that!

271
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,177
Wait! Everybody calm down, okay?

272
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:19,266
Let's give our friend a chance
to explain why he's such a big pervert!

273
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,476
I am not a pervert, okay?

274
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,062
It's just...

275
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,898
I just kind of...

276
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,192
I think I can explain this.

277
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,736
Thank you.

278
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:34,072
Joey's a sex addict.

279
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,991
What?! No, I'm not!

280
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,995
It's okay! It's good!

281
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,623
It's a disease.

282
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,625
I am not a sex addict!

283
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,960
Yes, you are!

284
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,672
That's the only way
to explain all this stuff!

285
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,632
No, it isn't. It's not.

286
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:55,427
Because you could also explain it
with the truth!

287
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,720
What is the truth?

288
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,307
- What's up?
- What's going on?

289
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:08,190
I slept with Monica.

290
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:17,908
Well, let's see what everybody
thinks of that.

291
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:25,124
You slept with my sister?

292
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,834
Yes, but it was...

293
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,420
We just did it once, in London.

294
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,757
This is not good for my rage.

295
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,262
Is this true?

296
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,472
Of course, it's true.

297
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:46,436
How else would you explain all the
weird stuff that's been going on?

298
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,064
Yes, it's true.

299
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:55,111
If it happened once, how come we
found your underwear in our apartment?

300
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,950
That was the underwear
I was wearing that night in London.

301
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,036
Right, Monica?

302
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,875
I guess I wanted to keep it...

303
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,836
...as a souvenir.

304
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,964
My God, Monica!

305
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:19,094
Are you sure you're not
just a sex addict?

306
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:25,100
If anyone's a sex addict here,
it's Monica.

307
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,813
She has been trying to get me back
in the sack ever since London!

308
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,899
That's why she gave you
a naked picture of herself.

309
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,819
That makes sense.

310
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,155
And the video camera?

311
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:47,623
I guess I set up the video camera
to try and entice Joey.

312
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:52,378
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.

313
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,587
Unbelievable!

314
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,506
You really kept Joey's underwear?

315
00:20:56,757 --> 00:21:00,761
Why? Why would you do that?

316
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,390
I'm Monica.

317
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:08,602
I'm disgusting.

318
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:13,232
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.

319
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:22,324
I think we've all learned
who's disgusting and who's not.

320
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:27,954
Now, I'm going to get back
to my bucket.

321
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm only eating the skin,
so the chicken's up for grabs.

322
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,133
You were making a good point.

323
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,803
I mean, till you got cut off.

324
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,013
What's up with that girl Monica?

325
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:48,642
I don't know.
I didn't come with her.

326
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,645
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, guess what!

327
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,147
I just convinced Carl
to give us a test.

328
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,482
Test?

329
00:21:55,732 --> 00:22:00,070
Come on!
Tests make us all better learners!

330
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:04,950
Oh, yeah!
We should have essay questions!
