1
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,154
Oh, well, none of us can live forever.

2
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:25,280
Remarkable man, the colonel.

3
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:30,986
A girl's earring.

4
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:33,458
Remarkable.

5
00:01:40,428 --> 00:01:43,002
What a lovely sunrise.

6
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:46,382
Too bad he just missed it.

7
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:14,794
Hello.

8
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:18,879
Yes, this is Mr. Tony Ryder.

9
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:22,802
He did?

10
00:02:23,805 --> 00:02:25,963
When?

11
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:30,476
I see.

12
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:36,063
I see, yeah.
Thanks forcalling.

13
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:40,388
Bad news, sweetie?
- Yeah. My uncle, honey.

14
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:42,933
Look, you... You better leave,
sweetheart.

15
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,073
Get going.
- But don't...

16
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:47,753
But, Tony...
- That's all right.

17
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:49,606
You call me later.
- But, Tony...

18
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:51,706
Goodbye.

19
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:02,208
But, Tony, I live here.

20
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:40,949
Take a look, Mr. O'Hara.
- I'm looking.

21
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:45,120
The Ryder Building.
Fifty stories of glass and steel.

22
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,581
With a statue ofthe colonel on the top.

23
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,374
In solid bronze.

24
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:51,209
Holding one ofhis magazines.

25
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:53,044
Your magazines now.

26
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:56,047
He left everything to you, me boy.
- Even you.

27
00:03:56,147 --> 00:04:00,051
I'll do me very best to serve you with
the same devotion I did the colonel.

28
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:03,555
Tell me something.
How do you follow a man like that?

29
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:06,027
It won't be easy, lad.

30
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:08,101
You know, I've got to prove to them...

31
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:10,604
...that I'm as good a man forthis job
as my uncle was.

32
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:12,355
Yes, sir.
- That won't be easy.

33
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:14,455
No, sir.
- No, sir.

34
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:17,068
Well, you know, in five minutes

35
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:20,488
I'm going to head up
my first board meeting.

36
00:04:20,588 --> 00:04:24,409
You think I'll get away with it?
- Sure you will, Mr. Ryder.

37
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:26,995
That's one ofthe advantages
ofbeing at the top.

38
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:30,999
Anybody who tells you you're making
a mistake is making a bigger mistake.

39
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:33,970
Sure, and I feel betternow.

40
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:57,525
I still can't believe he's not going
to walk through that door...

41
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,362
...and tell us what's wrong
with the latest issues.

42
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:04,372
He'stelling it to that big publisher up there.

43
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:10,538
What about young Ryder? Do you
think he'sthe right man to take over?

44
00:05:10,638 --> 00:05:13,094
We don't have much choice.

45
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
He'sthe only relative.

46
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:20,215
Gentlemen.

47
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:22,008
Good morning.
- Good morning.

48
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:23,551
Greetings, my boy.

49
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:24,970
Welcome, welcome.

50
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,555
Mr. Albright, Mr. Baker,
Mr. Carter, Mr. Weaver.

51
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,224
How do you do?

52
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:32,561
Oh, no, no, no. Excuse me.
The chairman ofthe board sits here.

53
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:35,636
The colonel's chairfor you, my boy.

54
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:38,665
Thank you.

55
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:44,864
Well, now, then, I'd like to make
my position absolutely clear.

56
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:47,769
My late uncle and I, we hardly...

57
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:50,343
Oh, sorry.

58
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:57,586
Hardly knew each other.
In fact, we were practically strangers.

59
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:59,588
Some of you may think the only reason

60
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:03,133
I'm the new chairman ofthe board
is because I'm his only relative.

61
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,528
Oh, not at all, not at all.

62
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:11,224
Nevertheless, it's true. Anyway, I'll
do the best I can, and that's about it.

63
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:15,395
You'll do fine, Tony. Believe me,
your past reputation is behind you.

64
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:18,899
From a useless life to a life of use,
that'sthe way I look at it.

65
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,735
Nothing like responsibility
to give a man backbone.

66
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:23,903
And initiative.
- And drive.

67
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:27,828
You may not be much,
but you're all we've got.

68
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,925
Thank you, gentlemen,
for your vote of confidence.

69
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:41,004
Now, what's our problem fortoday?

70
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:43,757
The colonel.
He picked a critical time to die.

71
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:46,009
What about our overseas
expansion program?

72
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:49,763
We've been trying to float a bank loan
for $5 million. Now what?

73
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:53,099
We'll open our European branches
next month, right on schedule.

74
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,601
What do we use for money?

75
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:57,270
Oh, I took care ofthe bank loan
overthe weekend.

76
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,690
I called on an old skin-diving buddy
of mine, Pudge Hamilton.

77
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,692
Hamilton? OfHamilton Trust?

78
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:07,781
His son. Anyway, the bank is willing
to back us on the colonel's reputation.

79
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,454
That's wonderful news, Tony.

80
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,621
Of course, they'll have to ratify it
at theirfinance meeting Wednesday.

81
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:21,008
In the meantime, I jotted down some
figures on the expansion program.

82
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:24,434
Afew more here.

83
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:28,109
Didn't win a bet that day.

84
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:31,028
Oh, shot a 76.
That was all right.

85
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,821
Mr. Ryder.

86
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:40,847
Amortization. Profit potential.
See what you think ofit, fellas.

87
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:45,235
He's a very commonplace man.

88
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:47,320
He said it was important.

89
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,650
But I don't know any house detectives.

90
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:55,161
Did he happen to mention
any particular city?

91
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:58,164
Like London? Paris? Omaha?
- No, sir.

92
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:00,625
Just that there was a young lady involved.

93
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:04,129
Oh, well, it's probably just a case
of mistaken identity.

94
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,544
I'd better see him,
straighten this out.

95
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:12,897
I didn't know he could even spell
'amortization.'

96
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,405
Mr. Ryderwill see you now,
Mr. Lasker.

97
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:24,288
Gloria?

98
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:26,526
Jeanie?

99
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:28,626
Jackie?

100
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:32,991
Mr. Ryder, I think there's
something you ought to know.

101
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:35,499
Now I remember. Quebec.

102
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,495
Chateau Sans Souci.

103
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:40,665
Yeah, I can explain about that girl
in my room that night.

104
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:44,085
She said she was a ski instructor.
I didn't find out till later...

105
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:46,185
It wasn't Quebec.

106
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:49,230
Palm Beach. Mirador Hotel.

107
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,813
Mira...? Mirador?

108
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:56,056
Well, that's where my uncle always stays.

109
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:58,281
Or stayed.
- Oh, yes, sir.

110
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,102
With him being youruncle,
his reputation and all,

111
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:05,792
I figured you didn't want
this kind ofthing to get out.

112
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,333
Has she contacted you yet?

113
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:14,872
Who contacted me?

114
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:17,285
Your uncle's girlfriend.

115
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:20,622
His girl...?
Look, you'd betterfill me in.

116
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:23,124
I don't know what you're...
Sit down, won't you.

117
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:25,431
Sure. Sure.

118
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:29,475
You see, I was on duty
early Saturday morning.

119
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:33,218
I got this complaint that there was
a disturbance on the ninth floor.

120
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:36,596
I went up to investigate. When
I got halfway down the corridor,

121
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:40,642
I spotted this girl running out
of your uncle's bedroom.

122
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:46,352
Oh, well, I could think of a million
innocent explanations forthat.

123
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:49,219
She could have been a manicurist.

124
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:52,502
At 3 a. M?
- Three a. m.

125
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:54,752
Wearing a Turkish towel?

126
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:58,571
A masseuse.
You know, Turkish towel? No?

127
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,830
What did you do? Did you catch her?
- I tried.

128
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,332
But she beat me to the elevator
and got away.

129
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:07,335
When I got back, your uncle's room,
the place was all a shambles.

130
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:11,770
The furniture was knocked down,
the lamp was broken.

131
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,770
He was in bed.

132
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:17,026
Dead.

133
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:20,765
He was smiling.

134
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:22,865
Smiling?

135
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:26,187
Have you told anybody else about this?

136
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:28,940
No, no, sir. No, no.
Only the manager.

137
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,945
He thought it would be betterfor
everybody if we just kept this quiet.

138
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:37,785
Did you ever see this girl before?
- No, sir.

139
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:41,536
Did you get a good look at her?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:44,456
That is, I'd recognize her ifl saw her again.

141
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:48,933
Say, maybe this'll help.

142
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,970
It's an earring I found
on the floor nearthe bed.

143
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,070
I checked.

144
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:05,367
That inscription means 'good' in Chinese.

145
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,729
Chinese.

146
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:09,869
Look, I'll keep this.

147
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:12,984
Do you think you could stay around
fora few days?

148
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,153
The boss said to do anything you asked.

149
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:17,238
Youruncle was a very good customer.

150
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:20,742
Good. Well, my secretary'll
get you a hotel room.

151
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:22,953
I have a hunch this girl's gonna show up,

152
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:24,663
and I want you to identify her.

153
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:26,164
Oh, it'd be a pleasure.

154
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:28,833
In the meantime,
consider yourself on the payroll.

155
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:30,502
We'll just charge it offto...

156
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:32,974
Research?
- Research.

157
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:53,065
These are very interesting figures,
Tony. We'd like to talk to you...

158
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:58,947
He was a remarkable man.

159
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:01,658
He was a more remarkable man
than you think.

160
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:04,536
Sam, you were the colonel's oldest friend.

161
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:05,996
Thirty years' worth.

162
00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:09,874
Did he have any love affairs, I mean,
after my aunt died? Did he ever...?

163
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:13,545
Never. The colonel had
only one love, his work.

164
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:16,548
He built his whole empire
on fidelity and chastity.

165
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:19,551
Well, now, Sam, there was
that lady dentist in Seattle.

166
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:23,555
Purely platonic.
Anyway, we paid her off years ago.

167
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:25,849
Well, what about that female archeologist?

168
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,767
That tall woman with the pith helmet?

169
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:30,228
Threatened to expose him
to the National Geographic?

170
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:33,481
You notice she stopped that kind
ofirresponsible talk in a hurry.

171
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,859
Yeah.
The minute we paid her off.

172
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,236
Boys, I've got a flash for you.

173
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:42,699
The colonel died with
an undressed girl in his bedroom.

174
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,743
I'm not certain about her occupation,

175
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:48,538
but I have a hunch that payoffnumber
three is right around the corner.

176
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:52,209
And the house dick at the Mirador
said he saw a girl running...

177
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:56,602
...from Uncle Charlie's
bedroom wearing this.

178
00:12:56,813 --> 00:13:00,043
Just an earring?
- And a Turkish towel.

179
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,885
This means 'good' in Chinese.

180
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:04,471
And 10-to-1 that the mate
to this says 'luck.'

181
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:07,223
It ought to. That young woman
has us over a barrel.

182
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:09,392
Blackmail.
I can see the headlines:

183
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:14,932
'Founder ofFamily Magazine Dies
in Love Nest with a Naked Nymph.'

184
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,121
And a smile on his face.

185
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,568
The bank loan.

186
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:21,279
Lfthey hear about this,
we won't be able to borrow a quarter.

187
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:24,324
What are we going to do?
- Buy her offlike the others.

188
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:25,909
Where do we find her?

189
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:29,746
I have a funny feeling she'll find us.
I can draw you a picture ofher.

190
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:34,584
She's young, beautiful, sentimental,
especially about money.

191
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:36,253
I can even spot her entrance.

192
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,353
Where?
- At the funeral.

193
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:40,006
Where's a better place to show the world...

194
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:41,758
...how much she's gonna miss the colonel?

195
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:43,510
So we will know Thursday.

196
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,303
No, that'll be too late.

197
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:47,222
The bank committee meets Wednesday.

198
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:49,975
We'll have the funeral Tuesday.
- That'stomorrow.

199
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:51,393
What about all the preparations?

200
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:53,353
We were going to give him
a military ceremony.

201
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:56,273
Some four-star generals were
coming up from Washington.

202
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:59,178
We wanted him to go out in style.

203
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:04,039
Sam, he went out in style.

204
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:46,087
Katie. Hi.

205
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:47,991
Hello, Marge.

206
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:50,744
Welcome back
to the decompression chamber.

207
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:54,247
Well, how was Palm Beach?
- It was all right, I guess.

208
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:58,084
All right? Is that all you've gotta say?
What'd you do there?

209
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:00,904
I got a tan and lost an earring.

210
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:05,467
Palm Beach, moonlight, millionaires,
and all you lost was an earring?

211
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:08,637
Didn't you get to meet any
ofthose millionaires?

212
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:12,515
What made you ask that?
- Just my feminine sense of greed.

213
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:16,945
Well, did you?
- Yes. I met a millionaire.

214
00:15:17,162 --> 00:15:19,735
What's that? Who sitsthere?

215
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:22,245
The new researcher. Aman.

216
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,009
Imagine.
I haven't met him yet.

217
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:28,323
Research, Robbins.

218
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:30,462
Hi. Guess who this is.

219
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,455
Well, I'll give you a hint.
I'm tall, witty, good-looking...

220
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:38,208
...and you're simply mad about me.
- Warren.

221
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:40,251
Oh, how sweet of you to call.

222
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:43,505
What'sthe matterwith yourvoice?
You ought to see a doctor.

223
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:45,882
But, honey, I am a doctor.
It's nothing serious.

224
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:48,593
Just something I picked up
from one of my patients.

225
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:50,887
How was Florida?
- Oh, it was all right.

226
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:54,023
But I'm glad I'm back.
- So am I.

227
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,184
And so will Mom and Dad be.

228
00:15:56,284 --> 00:16:00,272
Oh, yourfolks are in town?
- Just got in this morning.

229
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:02,993
They can't wait to meet you.

230
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,529
Well, I hope they like me.
- They'll love you.

231
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,823
Oh, well, that makes me feel better.

232
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:15,278
How about the four of us getting
together, say, Wednesday night?

233
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:19,005
Oh, that's fine. Fine.
I'd love to.

234
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:22,114
I'll see you then.
- Goodbye, dear.

235
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:26,729
Bye.

236
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:35,890
Now, then, old man, let's just
make sure this isn't psychosomatic.

237
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,276
Say, 'Woof, woof.'

238
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:42,272
You know, you're sure lucky to be
marrying a professional man...

239
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:45,650
...who owns his own business. I don't
know why you even went to Florida.

240
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,130
Oh, I went to think it over.

241
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:51,323
Warren's a wonderful man, Marge,

242
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:55,123
but I don't know ifl, well...

243
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:58,594
Love him?
- No. Deserve him.

244
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:02,792
Every girl deserves a man,
whethershe deserves him or not.

245
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:05,545
Katie, come on, come on.
We're keeping them waiting.

246
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:08,136
Who?
- The brass, the brass.

247
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:10,217
You're on the bargaining committee.

248
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:12,677
Oh, no, Harry.
I'm on Health and Welfare.

249
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:14,512
You've been kicked upstairs, kiddo.

250
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:16,765
Union-wise, you're in the big time.

251
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:20,018
But I've been working on pink paper
towels forthe ladies' lounge.

252
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,853
Chicken feed, chicken feed.

253
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:24,105
Now we're gonna hit them
with some real stiff demands.

254
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,524
We'll probably be knocking heads
right through lunch hour.

255
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:29,194
Oh, but, no, I have to do some
shopping during my lunch hour.

256
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:33,799
You see, I have to have a 'good'
to go with my 'luck.'

257
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:38,662
Now, don't be upset
if I do some table-pounding.

258
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:40,455
And wheneverthey make a demand,

259
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:42,832
you just shake your head and look worried.

260
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:44,932
But I am worried.

261
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:48,171
The union committee is here.

262
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:51,023
This way, please.
- Thank you.

263
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:56,232
Oh, this is Mr. Ryder.
Mr. Ryder, Mr. Lane, Mr. Kowalski.

264
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:57,556
How are you?

265
00:17:57,656 --> 00:18:00,266
This is Katie Robbins,
the new member of our committee.

266
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:04,032
Joe Kowalski.
Katie, this is Mr. Ryder.

267
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,074
How do you do?
- Hello.

268
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,541
Katie.

269
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:31,715
All right, now, let's get the ball rolling.

270
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:35,135
Here'sthe union proposal.
- Absolutely ridiculous.

271
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:38,305
This is no proposal.
It is a knife at ourthroat.

272
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:41,805
Don't you think we should read it first?

273
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:51,526
Strong medicine, eh, Mr. Ryder?

274
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:54,082
Seems pretty reasonable.

275
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:56,364
It seems reasonable on the surface.

276
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:58,992
But can management live with it?
- No.

277
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:01,161
That's not an answer,
it's an ultimatum.

278
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:03,914
Take it or leave it.
- It's a knife at ourthroat.

279
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:07,217
I said that.
- Gentlemen, please.

280
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,474
What do you think, Miss?

281
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:12,505
Robbins. Katie Robbins.
I'm in Research.

282
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:16,760
Research? Oh, that's one of our more
vital departments in the organization.

283
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,762
Where is it?
- Forty-fifth floor,

284
00:19:18,862 --> 00:19:21,667
behind the water cooler.
'Cooler.'

285
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:25,018
You could hardly call it that,
the way it's been working lately.

286
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:28,355
I was just saying the other day in
Health and Welfare, we really should...

287
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:30,273
Is that with two B's?

288
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:31,941
What, cooler?

289
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,041
No, Robbins.

290
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:36,285
Yes, two B's.
- B's, B's.

291
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:40,283
Miss Robbins, we've got
a very important agenda here.

292
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:42,118
I'm sorry.

293
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:44,955
Severance pay. Seniority rights.
Fringe benefits.

294
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:47,296
She said she was sorry.

295
00:19:47,515 --> 00:19:50,877
When it comesto fringe benefits,
I'd say the union's getting...

296
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:54,214
...all the benefits and management's
left holding the fringe.

297
00:19:54,314 --> 00:19:57,765
Well put.
- All we want's a fair deal.

298
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:01,894
Ashare ofthe profits.
- And a new water cooler.

299
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:05,642
Well, I mean, on a hot day,
really, our morale...

300
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:08,144
Will you forget the water cooler.

301
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:11,022
Look, if you don't wanna negotiate,
we're walking out.

302
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:13,733
All right, walk.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

303
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,069
This bickering is getting us no place.

304
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:19,656
Now, I suggest we adjourn
to a subcommittee oftwo,

305
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,756
to feel each other out.

306
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:24,953
Mr. Dunning, why don't you
meet Harry afterlunch.

307
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:27,163
Oh, just a minute.
I have a better idea.

308
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,999
Now, a subcommittee oftwo is
an excellent suggestion,

309
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:35,255
but any feeling-out process should
logically take place between members...

310
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:39,092
...ofthis group who haven't displayed
antagonism towards one another.

311
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:41,845
In otherwords,
between Miss Robbins and myself.

312
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:46,433
Now, you don't feel antagonistic
towards me, do you, Miss Robbins?

313
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,809
Well, no.

314
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:53,523
Good. Nor I towards you. So it seems
logical that you and I should meet.

315
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:55,746
You and I meet?

316
00:20:57,794 --> 00:21:01,329
Oh, now, orafter lunch?
- During lunch.

317
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:04,819
No use wasting valuable working hours.

318
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:07,427
Meeting adjourned.

319
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,926
Yeah, well, keep looking.

320
00:21:15,145 --> 00:21:17,145
Gotcha.

321
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:26,181
I'll be back, but if I get
any out-of-town calls...

322
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:29,392
Oh, I...
I will be so glad to take them.

323
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:31,061
Don't take them.

324
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:34,660
Oh, don't take them. Gotcha.

325
00:21:35,498 --> 00:21:37,623
Don't... Don't take them.

326
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,625
Gotcha.

327
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:42,792
Oh, pardon me.

328
00:21:49,554 --> 00:21:50,872
What'sthis, Marge?

329
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:54,967
I don't know. It came
for you a few minutes ago.

330
00:21:55,268 --> 00:21:57,921
It must be that bathing suit
I bought in Palm Beach.

331
00:21:58,021 --> 00:22:02,016
They were having a sale at this little place...

332
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:07,389
Marge, somebody made a mistake.

333
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:09,861
Oh, my dear, I wish I did.

334
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,810
This isn't my coat.

335
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,728
'Miss Katie Robbins.'

336
00:22:13,828 --> 00:22:15,647
Well, it's another Katie Robbins.

337
00:22:15,747 --> 00:22:17,649
'Ryder Building, New York,
New York.'

338
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:20,129
Well, it's another New York.

339
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:26,141
I guess it is my coat, isn't it.

340
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:30,426
Marge.

341
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:32,998
Yes?
- Can you keep a secret?

342
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:37,518
Oh, Katie, I'd just love to.
Just give me the chance.

343
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,089
I wanted to be by myself on my vacation,

344
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:43,675
you know, sort ofthink things over,
about Warren...

345
00:22:43,775 --> 00:22:45,427
...and getting married and all.

346
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:48,597
Well, it's too important a step
to just rush into like that.

347
00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:53,967
I know that, I know that, Katie,
but, now, what about the coat?

348
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:58,940
Health and Welfare found me
a nice motel nearthe beach.

349
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,403
It was 7 dollars a day,
including a continental breakfast.

350
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:07,999
Florida is a wonderful place,
if you're a grapefruit.

351
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:11,926
Or half of a twosome.

352
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:27,860
Not that I didn't get offers.

353
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:33,700
But I wasn't interested in
that kind oftraveler's aid.

354
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:38,314
So I tried to find things I could do alone.

355
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:41,775
That eliminated just about everything
that's any fun.

356
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,611
During the day, I went to the beach.

357
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:46,711
I read a lot.

358
00:23:46,713 --> 00:23:48,789
That is, I tried to.

359
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:54,955
But fiction sounded pretty dull...

360
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:59,633
...with all the juicy nonfiction
going on around me.

361
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:06,007
At night, though, Palm Beach was lovely,

362
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:09,970
with that big tropical moon
and those dark, velvety clouds...

363
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,045
...filled with romance and mystery.

364
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,267
There I was, trespassing in the garden...

365
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:21,575
...of an exclusive hotel,
pretending to be one ofthe elite.

366
00:24:34,135 --> 00:24:37,247
With all the romance around me,
there I was with my partner,

367
00:24:37,347 --> 00:24:39,982
a very romantic sort of fellow.

368
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:43,264
Full of air.

369
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:59,519
Help. Help.
- Suddenly I heard someone...

370
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:02,063
...calling for help.
There was a man in the pool.

371
00:25:02,163 --> 00:25:04,915
He seemed to be drowning.
- Help.

372
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,485
And I was wearing my
flowered chiffon that cost me...

373
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:09,362
...two whole months without dessert.

374
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:12,866
My partnerwas useless, and I
remembered my Girl Scout training.

375
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:15,941
Aperson goes down only three times.

376
00:25:16,302 --> 00:25:19,532
Help.
- And this one was on his fourth.

377
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:22,181
Help.

378
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:43,229
I realized at once that poor
Mr. Hackett had been drinking.

379
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:47,233
That was his name, Kirby Hackett,
ofHackett Industries.

380
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:50,820
I couldn't leave him there,
he was chilled to the bone.

381
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,320
So I decided to help him up to his room.

382
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:00,798
That was my first mistake.

383
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:12,926
My second mistake
was playing Good Samaritan.

384
00:26:13,026 --> 00:26:16,513
I bundled him up
so he wouldn't catch pneumonia.

385
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:22,138
And then I realized I was
the next likely candidate for it myself.

386
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:27,117
In my wet chiffon,
I felt like a clam at low tide.

387
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,900
As long as he was sound asleep,
I decided to get dried off.

388
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,308
That was my third mistake.

389
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:05,770
While I'd been playing Good Samaritan,

390
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,939
Mr. Hackett had been playing possum.

391
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,167
I said, 'Mr. Hackett.
Please, I'm not dressed.'

392
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:17,477
And he said, 'But, sweetie,
it's not as if we were strangers.

393
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:19,159
You saved my life.'

394
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:23,509
No, no, no, no, now, you stay right...
Mr. Hackett.

395
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:35,175
So I said, 'Goodbye, Mr. Hackett.'

396
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:37,010
I didn't know where I was going,

397
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,700
but anything was an improvement
overwhat I'd just left.

398
00:28:05,847 --> 00:28:07,665
I went through some curtains.

399
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:11,795
It was dark, but I could just tell
I was in another man's bedroom.

400
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:15,423
This just seemed to be my night
for it. There was a man in bed.

401
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:18,009
And you know who it was?
- Frank Sinatra.

402
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:20,398
Oh, Marge. Colonel Ryder.

403
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:22,818
Our Colonel Ryder?
- Yes.

404
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:24,599
Oh, you are sly.

405
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,351
That isn't even the half ofit.

406
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:29,020
Oh, I'm perfectly willing to listen
to the other half.

407
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,481
Then it wasthe colonel
who gave you the mink coat?

408
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:33,233
No, he couldn't.
Don't you see...?

409
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,527
Lfhe didn't, who did give you the coat?

410
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:38,280
Mr. Hackett.
Bright and early the next morning,

411
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,490
I got a phone call.
It was Mr. Hackett.

412
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,368
Anyway, on the phone he said he
was sending me a mink coat...

413
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:47,622
...for saving his life. And he did,
and this is it. And I'm returning it.

414
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:50,593
Why?
- Because I don't deserve it.

415
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:53,169
Listen, Katie, there's
no need to be so noble.

416
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:55,171
Even Dr. Schweitzer takes donations.

417
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:57,513
Oh, Marge. Back it goes.

418
00:28:57,732 --> 00:29:01,052
I refuse to be obligated to a man
who practically drowns himself...

419
00:29:01,152 --> 00:29:02,762
...just to get me up to his room.

420
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:05,056
Okay, okay, now, what about
Colonel Ryder?

421
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:06,891
You were in his room...
- Katie.

422
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:08,560
Oh, it's Harry.

423
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,061
More later.

424
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:13,064
That young Ryder's on his way down
the lobby to meet you.

425
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:16,067
Now, I got some last-minute
negotiating instructions for you, kiddo.

426
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:19,654
Now, you get to the pension plan
before you finish yourfruit salad.

427
00:29:19,754 --> 00:29:22,574
Important.
- Pension plan, fruit salad. Yes, Harry.

428
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:25,744
You might have to give him
a hard sell on seniority rights,

429
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:28,705
so order something that'll take
a long time, like roast duck.

430
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:30,999
Seniority rights, roast duck.
Yes, Harry.

431
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:33,084
Now, here's our proposal
in black and white.

432
00:29:33,184 --> 00:29:36,719
Yes.
- Now, don't forget, stand pat.

433
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:38,938
Stand pat.

434
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:42,525
Thank you.

435
00:29:47,615 --> 00:29:50,936
This pension plan looks very interesting.

436
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:53,021
You match us...
- Penny forpenny.

437
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:55,106
Employee and employer moving forward...

438
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:58,436
...shoulder and shoulder,
hand in hand.

439
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,195
That's a very good idea.

440
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:02,572
By the way, where do you live,
Miss Robbins?

441
00:30:02,672 --> 00:30:05,784
Pardon me?
- Well, you know, subcommittee work,

442
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:10,304
I may have to get ahold of you
in a hurry some night.

443
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,759
463 East 76th.

444
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:17,796
Thank you.

445
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:21,675
May I ask you a personal question?
- Certainly.

446
00:30:21,775 --> 00:30:23,843
If your uncle hadn't been Colonel Ryder,

447
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:26,137
what do you think you'd be doing now?

448
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:27,556
Playing golf, I guess.

449
00:30:27,656 --> 00:30:30,725
No, what I mean is, you don't seem
like management to me.

450
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:34,813
You mean, would I be in the
publishing business? Yes, I would.

451
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:37,482
Well, you're lucky to be able to start
at the top.

452
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:40,443
I started just one step below.
I worked as a messenger,

453
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:44,322
then a stock boy.
Printer's devil fortwo years.

454
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:48,076
Then I worked in the promotion
department, advertising, sales.

455
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:50,578
I moved into the editorial department.

456
00:30:50,678 --> 00:30:53,832
I had the experience, but I had
to keep proving to the Ryders.

457
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:57,502
If you're a relative,
you're supposed to be an idiot.

458
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:59,671
I started at the top the hard way.

459
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:03,967
Still, it must have been nice to have
Colonel Ryder behind you all the time.

460
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,439
I worked for a rival chain.

461
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:12,100
Well, that's enough about me.
Now, you ordered roast duck.

462
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,515
Oh, yes, roast duck.
Seniority rights...

463
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:19,747
Excuse me.

464
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:23,361
Seniority rights.
There are the figures.

465
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:25,461
Oh, right here?

466
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Yes.

467
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:30,827
Seniority rights are a basic issue,
you know, Mr. Ryder.

468
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:33,330
An old man is like an old car.

469
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,874
Just because his carburetor gets rusty...

470
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:37,792
...and his spark plugs get stuck,
you don't just...

471
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:39,892
Voilà.

472
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:42,672
Isthat a roast duck?
- Oui, from Normandy.

473
00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:44,632
Petite, but delicious beyond words.

474
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:46,384
But it's so small.

475
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:49,119
Madame, petite mais délicieuse.

476
00:31:49,738 --> 00:31:52,641
Well, I'lljust have to talk faster,
that's all.

477
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:56,738
Where was I?
- Your spark plugs were stuck.

478
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:00,496
Yes.

479
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:05,779
You don't just throw an old man
on the scrapheap forthat.

480
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:10,408
No, you refuel his fuel pump
and you tighten up his confidence.

481
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:12,410
And then you give him another chance.

482
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,510
Voilà, madame.

483
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,794
Seniority rights, fringe benefits
and pension plan.

484
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:23,463
It's all right here in black and white,
Mr. Ryder.

485
00:32:23,563 --> 00:32:26,633
Now, speaking forthe union...
- You are standing pat.

486
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:31,774
That's right, we're standing pat.
Thank you.

487
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:33,473
Hey, it's 2:30.

488
00:32:33,573 --> 00:32:35,850
What do you say we take
the rest ofthe afternoon off.

489
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,990
I think we've earned it.

490
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,292
I'm curious about something.

491
00:32:41,414 --> 00:32:44,025
Why did you pick on me
to do the negotiating?

492
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,070
I suppose because you were
the prettiest one there.

493
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,572
But you don't have to be pretty to negotiate.

494
00:32:49,672 --> 00:32:51,324
No, but you're brainy too.

495
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:56,329
And the nice part about that
is your brains don't show a bit.

496
00:32:56,429 --> 00:32:58,429
Thank you.

497
00:32:58,598 --> 00:33:01,501
But you see, I'm in Research,
Mr. Ryder,

498
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:05,130
and I've been doing quite a bit
of research on you.

499
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,465
And I'm afraid I'm not yourtype at all.

500
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:12,227
I know you like tall, svelte,
sophisticated blonds.

501
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:18,818
You're a good researcher, but don't
believe everything you read.

502
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:23,189
I said we earned an afternoon off,
so let's take it.

503
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:26,575
Now, what would you like to do?

504
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:31,210
Well, I would like to do some shopping.

505
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:36,089
Shopping. Okay.
Just what I had in mind.

506
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:38,427
Why don't you use my car.

507
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:42,125
My chauffeur, O'Hara, he'll drive you
anywhere you wanna go.

508
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:44,846
And I'll drop off at the club,

509
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:47,103
take a cold shower.

510
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:59,023
May I be of assistance?
- Yes, thank you.

511
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:01,452
You see, I thought that...

512
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:05,232
I thought that this was a bathing suit
that I had bought...

513
00:34:05,332 --> 00:34:09,958
...on sale in Palm Beach.
Just one moment.

514
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:15,325
But when I opened the box,
I discovered...

515
00:34:15,425 --> 00:34:18,411
...it wasn't the bathing suit
I bought on sale in Palm Beach.

516
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:21,122
It was Mr. Hackett's mink.
- Mr. Hackett's mink.

517
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:23,792
Yes. Now, I saved his life,
and Dr. Schweitzer...

518
00:34:23,892 --> 00:34:26,920
...or no Dr. Schweitzer,
I'm afraid I can't accept this coat.

519
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,131
Dr. Schweitzer. Excuse me,
this is a matterfor our manager.

520
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,232
Mr. Carruthers, please.
- Yes. Yes?

521
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:36,012
There seems to be a problem
with this lady's coat.

522
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:39,349
No, there's no problem.
It's just that I can't accept this.

523
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,142
Isthere something wrong with the coat?

524
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:43,478
Oh, no, not at all.
It's just beautiful.

525
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:47,858
But, you see, it's not mine.
It's Mr. Hackett's. He sent it to me.

526
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,527
Oh, Mr. Kirby Hackett?
- Yes, that's right.

527
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:53,200
And you're Miss Robbins?

528
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:57,158
Oh, yes. Well, there's been
no mistake. The coat's yours.

529
00:34:57,258 --> 00:35:00,161
Oh, but there is a mistake.
You see, I don't want it.

530
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:03,298
I see.
You want the money.

531
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:05,542
No, sir, I do not want the money.

532
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:08,253
But the coat is yours.
It's already paid for.

533
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:11,804
I haven't done anything to earn it.

534
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:16,845
Oh, I mean, all I did wastake him up
to his room and put him to...

535
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:18,430
He'd been drinking, you see,

536
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,270
and it seemed like the only place
we could...

537
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:26,360
I saved his life. Well, I did.
- Yes, yes.

538
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,940
Will you tell Mr. Hackett I returned the coat?

539
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,859
I'm afraid that might be a bit difficult.

540
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:33,361
He left for Europe this morning
on the Liberté.

541
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:36,197
I don't care ifhe went
to Devil's Island in a canoe.

542
00:35:36,297 --> 00:35:38,783
Please, may I have a receipt forthe coat?

543
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:43,048
I'm sure this is not what
Mr. Hackett had in mind.

544
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:46,531
I know what Mr. Hackett had in mind.

545
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:50,636
How much is the coat?
- Eleven thousand dollars.

546
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:56,231
Eleven thousand dollars?
- Oh, that includesthe tax.

547
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:01,404
Well.

548
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:05,476
There's $10.
I would like to pay $5 a week.

549
00:36:05,744 --> 00:36:08,313
Are you sure you wouldn't
like to think this over?

550
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:12,275
Why, at $5 a week,
it'll take you 45 yearsto pay for it.

551
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,277
I'm in no hurry if you're not.

552
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:20,213
You'll be through paying
for it in the year 2005.

553
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:23,426
Well...

554
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,885
There's another 5.
I'll have to try it on again.

555
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:50,689
And then I saw her buying a mink coat.

556
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:52,357
She paid cash for it.

557
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:55,602
Must have been thousand-dollar bills.

558
00:36:59,506 --> 00:37:02,742
How can she afford a mink on her salary?

559
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:04,327
Overtime.

560
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:06,427
Overtime?

561
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:09,847
Overtime.

562
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,637
Oh, no, not Miss Robbins.

563
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:19,857
No.

564
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:26,349
Bye, ladies.

565
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:28,435
Bye, Marie, see you at 6.
- Bye.

566
00:37:28,535 --> 00:37:30,535
Thank you.

567
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,441
Now, what did you do about the coat?
- Nothing. I have to pay it off, that's all.

568
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:37,006
But how?
- Ten dollars a week.

569
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:39,279
It's the principle ofthe thing, Marge.

570
00:37:39,379 --> 00:37:42,741
I wish somebody would test my principles.

571
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:45,035
Hey, I see you found a 'good'
to go with your 'luck.'

572
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:47,537
No, they didn't have a 'good.'
I had to buy another 'luck.'

573
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:48,913
'Luck-luck'?

574
00:37:49,013 --> 00:37:52,923
As long as you keep out
of Chinese restaurants.

575
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:54,961
Pardon me.

576
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:57,297
He was a wonderful man,
the colonel.

577
00:37:57,397 --> 00:38:00,008
Oh, wonderful.
He paid the lowest salaries in town.

578
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:02,636
Oh, Marge, that was
just his business sense.

579
00:38:02,736 --> 00:38:06,806
Underneath, he was a sensitive,
idealistic and very lonely human being.

580
00:38:06,906 --> 00:38:09,184
Are we talking about
the same Colonel Ryder?

581
00:38:09,284 --> 00:38:11,102
Rememberwhen we ran his biography?

582
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:14,356
When I was doing the research,
I came across some ofthe poems...

583
00:38:14,456 --> 00:38:16,149
...he had done in college.

584
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:18,374
Poems? The colonel?
- Yes.

585
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:22,322
Of course, he wouldn't let us use any
ofthem. But talk about raw emotion.

586
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:24,991
Keep moving.
Expressto the 30th floor.

587
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:29,919
Love is like a wild volcano
Seething with dark desire

588
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,166
Well, if you don't mind, I'd rather
remember him for his low salaries.

589
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,669
Hey, kiddo. I've been looking for you.
Come on.

590
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:37,504
I got a cab, we're gonna be late.

591
00:38:37,604 --> 00:38:40,256
Forwhat?
- The funeral. Union's got three seats.

592
00:38:40,356 --> 00:38:43,259
You're one ofthem.
- Oh, Harry, I couldn't possibly.

593
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,847
Why not?
- Because I'm very emotional, I'll cry.

594
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:48,932
Go ahead.
Afew tears won't hurt us a bit.

595
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:52,602
But, Harry, you don't understand.
It's not just tears. I mean, I cry.

596
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:55,897
At weddings, at funerals.
Once I even cried at a hockey match.

597
00:38:55,997 --> 00:38:59,234
I don't know what it is orwhy I do it,
but I'm very emotional.

598
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:01,236
Just like my wife, only she giggles.

599
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:02,737
At funerals?
- Yeah.

600
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:07,909
And I'll tell you one thing, kiddo:
She better stay away from my funeral.

601
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:11,378
And in World War I, what happened?

602
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,008
The great man that we have gathered
to honortoday...

603
00:39:17,227 --> 00:39:22,932
...volunteered once more for military duty.

604
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:28,606
And in six months ofhard,
grinding toil, he brought chaos...

605
00:39:28,863 --> 00:39:31,266
He brought orderto the chaos...

606
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:34,561
...that beset our overseas
parcel-post service.

607
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:38,361
And that Christmas,
I may now reveal,

608
00:39:38,915 --> 00:39:42,655
not a single dough boy in the front lines...

609
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:44,669
...not one...

610
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:49,208
...had to do without a slice
ofMom's fruit cake.

611
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:57,959
Easy on the waterworks, kiddo.

612
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:00,949
I'm sorry, Harry, I can't help it.

613
00:40:01,062 --> 00:40:04,063
Once I even cried at an auto show.

614
00:40:04,732 --> 00:40:09,525
And then, at long last,
came theArmistice.

615
00:40:12,907 --> 00:40:14,907
It's gotta be her.

616
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:20,595
And ifl were to summarize
Colonel Charles J. Ryder's career...

617
00:40:21,124 --> 00:40:24,623
...in one apt phrase, I would say:

618
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:30,423
'First in war, first in peace
and first in the publishing game.'

619
00:41:09,214 --> 00:41:13,674
You go on, Harry.
I wanna dry off a little bit.

620
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:35,473
That's our girl.

621
00:41:35,573 --> 00:41:38,143
You recognize her?
- Even with her clothes on.

622
00:41:38,243 --> 00:41:40,979
And the earring too.
It's a perfect match, see?

623
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:43,440
That about wraps it up.
She's our blackmailer.

624
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,984
No, not Miss Robbins.
She's not the type.

625
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:50,589
They never are. We'll be hearing
from that young lady.

626
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:53,658
I don't see why you're so upset.

627
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:56,119
If a person can't even sniffle at a funeral...

628
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:58,329
Marge, it wasn't a sniffle,
it was loud.

629
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:00,749
I practically did a duet with the bugler.

630
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,252
Well, it is perfectly natural.
Especially in your case.

631
00:42:04,352 --> 00:42:06,921
There's no use arguing.
I'm going straight upstairs...

632
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:09,571
...and apologize to Mr. Ryder.

633
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:11,981
Now, to conclude report.

634
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,012
Cased blackmailer's apartment.

635
00:42:14,112 --> 00:42:16,598
Lives alone, except for small bird.

636
00:42:16,698 --> 00:42:19,851
Think it was parakeet.
Might've been canary.

637
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:22,187
Couldn't make out through binoculars.

638
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:25,074
You mean you were spying on her?

639
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,585
Orders from the board, sir.

640
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:30,345
Our orders, Tony.
- That's right.

641
00:42:30,378 --> 00:42:33,114
Blackmailer came home about 7:12 p. m.

642
00:42:33,214 --> 00:42:35,033
Made dinner. Ate dinner.

643
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:38,119
Washed hair. Washed dishes.
Went to bed.

644
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:40,219
No visitors?

645
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:43,927
No visitors, no phone calls.

646
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:48,987
Well, that's about the size ofit.
Better get down to work.

647
00:42:50,064 --> 00:42:53,379
Will you please leave by the side door.

648
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:58,556
I still can't believe she did it.

649
00:42:58,656 --> 00:43:00,475
Oh, no.
- Mr. Ryder.

650
00:43:00,575 --> 00:43:03,937
The bank is postponing the meeting
about our loan until tomorrow.

651
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:06,773
Gentlemen, I'd say Miss Robbins
had us over a barrel.

652
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:08,775
We're lucky ifwe don't end up in one.

653
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:12,070
Now, let's be fair. Are we sure
this isthe girl we're looking for?

654
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,990
Of course we are.
- Lasker identified her, didn't he?

655
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,617
People have been hanged
on cases of mistaken identity.

656
00:43:17,717 --> 00:43:20,036
Mr. Ryder...
- And I say that a person is innocent...

657
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:22,664
...until proven guilty.
How do we know she's guilty?

658
00:43:22,764 --> 00:43:24,624
Those earrings.
- Could be a coincidence.

659
00:43:24,724 --> 00:43:27,460
They probably sell thousands
ofthese. Ten thousand.

660
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,131
And here's something else.
If she really wasthe blackmailer,

661
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:34,509
where would she be now?
In my office waiting to see me.

662
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:36,344
Mr. Ryder.
- Yes?

663
00:43:36,444 --> 00:43:39,472
Miss Robbins is in your office
waiting to see you.

664
00:43:39,572 --> 00:43:41,349
In my office, waiting to see me.

665
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:43,143
She said it was important.

666
00:43:43,243 --> 00:43:45,243
To see me...

667
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,652
Careful, Tony.
This is sticky business.

668
00:43:52,752 --> 00:43:56,536
And she's plenty tricky.
- Sticky, tricky.

669
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:14,939
Good morning, Mr...

670
00:44:27,871 --> 00:44:29,871
Good morning, Mr...

671
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:44,287
Good morning. I think I know
why you're here, Miss Robbins.

672
00:44:44,387 --> 00:44:46,539
Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

673
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:49,011
Sit down.
- Yes.

674
00:44:49,225 --> 00:44:55,513
I wanted to come up and get it
overwith before I lost my nerve.

675
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,888
Thank you. I know what you
must think of me, Mr. Ryder.

676
00:45:01,988 --> 00:45:04,474
But honestly, I couldn't help
what happened.

677
00:45:04,574 --> 00:45:08,478
It was all my uncle's fault.
- No, it wasn't anybody's fault.

678
00:45:08,578 --> 00:45:11,468
Oh, believe me, I didn't wanna go.

679
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:13,942
But afterall, he wasthe head
ofthe company.

680
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:17,245
And you were dazzled, huh?
- Dazzled?

681
00:45:17,754 --> 00:45:19,964
Orshall we say, impressed?

682
00:45:20,673 --> 00:45:23,577
Well, that is a betterword, I guess.

683
00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:29,300
But, you see, the real trouble,
Mr. Ryder, sir,

684
00:45:29,516 --> 00:45:31,516
isthat I'm...

685
00:45:31,643 --> 00:45:34,264
I'm too sentimental.

686
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:39,532
Sentimental. Oh, I'm sure you
could think of a betterword.

687
00:45:40,527 --> 00:45:43,430
Well, how about emotional?
That's what I am.

688
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,849
That's it, I'm over-emotional.

689
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:51,521
Especially when I think about all those
wonderful poems Colonel Ryderwrote.

690
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:54,341
Po...? He wrote poems?
- Oh, yes.

691
00:45:54,499 --> 00:45:57,736
Oh, they were so sensitive and passionate.

692
00:45:57,836 --> 00:46:00,327
Passionate poems?

693
00:46:00,547 --> 00:46:05,173
Love is a wild volcano
Seething with dark desire

694
00:46:05,385 --> 00:46:08,830
And you and I, the twain...
That means 'the two.'

695
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,582
I get the idea.

696
00:46:10,682 --> 00:46:12,751
Miss Robbins, how many poems are there?

697
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:14,851
Dozens.
- Dozens?

698
00:46:14,853 --> 00:46:19,633
Yes. You know, your uncle was a very
warm and tender man, Mr. Ryder.

699
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:21,426
Oh, you should read his letters.

700
00:46:21,526 --> 00:46:23,804
Letters too?
- Yes, would you like to see them?

701
00:46:23,904 --> 00:46:26,556
No, thanks, and I wouldn't want
anyone else to see them, either.

702
00:46:26,656 --> 00:46:29,642
Oh, well, you mustn't worry about that.
I have them in a safe place.

703
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:31,818
I'm sure you do.

704
00:46:32,537 --> 00:46:36,816
Mr. Ryder. Suppose we published
all ofthose letters and poems...

705
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:43,546
...so that the entire world could see what
kind of a man your uncle really was.

706
00:46:44,382 --> 00:46:47,017
Well, it was just a suggestion.

707
00:46:48,428 --> 00:46:51,122
Miss Robbins, I've had enough
ofthis cat-and-mouse game.

708
00:46:51,222 --> 00:46:52,582
Well, it was just a suggestion.

709
00:46:52,682 --> 00:46:55,001
We both know why
you came up here, right?

710
00:46:55,101 --> 00:46:56,711
Now that we know where we both stand...

711
00:46:56,811 --> 00:46:58,504
Yes.
Well, I'll get back to work.

712
00:46:58,604 --> 00:47:01,178
No, we'll talk.
- Talk?

713
00:47:02,484 --> 00:47:05,136
What'll we talk about,
fringe benefits?

714
00:47:05,236 --> 00:47:08,181
We'll talk about loyalty.
- All right.

715
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:12,811
My uncle's reputation and the Ryder
Enterprises are very closely linked.

716
00:47:12,911 --> 00:47:15,480
If anything should happen
to destroy this company,

717
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,565
hundreds ofpeople would be
thrown out of work.

718
00:47:17,665 --> 00:47:19,984
Now, you wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

719
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:21,820
Why, no.
- Good.

720
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,073
Then your loyalty will be suitably rewarded.

721
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:27,242
I didn't come here to ask for any...

722
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:29,536
In the form of a raise?
- I don't want...

723
00:47:29,636 --> 00:47:31,246
Shall we say $50 a week more?

724
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:33,248
Fifty dollars?
- A hundred dollars?

725
00:47:33,348 --> 00:47:35,875
I think you're a little unstrung
by the funeral. If you...

726
00:47:35,975 --> 00:47:37,919
Two hundred dollars a week.
Take it or leave it.

727
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:40,255
Oh, I'll take it, I'll take it.
- Good, good.

728
00:47:40,355 --> 00:47:44,180
Now, remember, don't talk
about thisto anyone.

729
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:47,482
Don't worry, I won't.

730
00:47:47,946 --> 00:47:50,900
But I think you should.
Talk.

731
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:53,699
To a doctor.

732
00:47:54,202 --> 00:47:57,188
Well, why don't you look it up yourself.

733
00:47:57,288 --> 00:48:00,442
How do you like that?
Some wise guy trying to tell me...

734
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:04,112
...we had a president
named Andrew Johnson.

735
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:08,700
I realize that you're new
in Research, Mr. Lasker,

736
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,913
but ifthere are any more phone calls,
especially about presidents...

737
00:48:14,013 --> 00:48:17,459
...I'll be glad to take them.
- Oh, gotcha.

738
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:19,559
Excuse me.

739
00:48:21,062 --> 00:48:22,881
Thank you.

740
00:48:22,981 --> 00:48:24,981
Oh, by the way...

741
00:48:25,817 --> 00:48:30,609
...do you and Mrs. Lasker bowl?

742
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:32,864
I do. She doesn't.

743
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:35,072
There is no Mrs. Lasker.

744
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:37,615
Oh, that is peachy.

745
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:40,367
That you bowl, I mean.

746
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:42,749
I love bowling.

747
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,750
It's so healthy.

748
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:47,280
And maybe some night
you could join Katie and me...

749
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:51,743
...and her boyfriend some night.
- Oh, sure. Any time.

750
00:48:51,843 --> 00:48:53,620
Tonight?

751
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,634
Marge. The strangest thing just happened.

752
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:00,919
Hello.
- Miss Robbins, this is Mr. Lasker.

753
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:03,713
Mr. Lasker, this is Miss Robbins.
- How do you do?

754
00:49:03,813 --> 00:49:06,883
And guess where we're
all going tonight. Bowling.

755
00:49:06,983 --> 00:49:10,482
Oh, Marge, I'm sorry, I can't tonight.

756
00:49:10,695 --> 00:49:13,103
I have a date with Warren.

757
00:49:14,157 --> 00:49:18,985
This fella, Warren,
does he work here?

758
00:49:19,204 --> 00:49:21,439
No.
Dr. Kingsley's a friend of mine.

759
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:24,442
He's herfiancé.
They're going to be married.

760
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:27,942
Oh, marriage is a wonderful institution.

761
00:49:29,172 --> 00:49:31,295
When'sthe happy event?

762
00:49:31,508 --> 00:49:34,653
Oh, we haven't even set the date yet.

763
00:49:36,054 --> 00:49:38,054
When'sthe happy event?

764
00:49:38,181 --> 00:49:40,292
Oh, we haven't even set the date yet.

765
00:49:40,392 --> 00:49:43,628
Dr. Kingsley's folks are in town.
Katie's afraid they won't like her.

766
00:49:43,728 --> 00:49:46,589
I'm not afraid, exactly.
But they're from a small town.

767
00:49:46,689 --> 00:49:48,925
You know, sort of strait-laced.

768
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:51,970
Small town, strait-laced.
Rememberthat.

769
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,014
I hope I make a good impression
when I meet them tonight, that's all.

770
00:49:55,114 --> 00:49:56,599
Why shouldn't you?

771
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:59,978
Because it'll probably be days
before I can pull myselftogether...

772
00:50:00,078 --> 00:50:03,315
...afterthat ten minutes Ijust spent
with that nut upstairs.

773
00:50:03,415 --> 00:50:08,207
Which nut upstairs?
- Tony Ryder, that's which nut.

774
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:13,283
Then somebody called Research
and Miss Robbins got too busy to talk.

775
00:50:13,383 --> 00:50:17,718
I wonderwhy she called Tony,
excuse me, Tony, a nut.

776
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:19,998
I don't care what she called me orwhy.

777
00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:23,793
We haven't learned a single thing
from that electronic house dick.

778
00:50:23,893 --> 00:50:27,172
We have a lead that could be
very good forus, Mr. Ryder.

779
00:50:27,272 --> 00:50:31,593
We found out that this babe is
engaged to a very respectable guy.

780
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:34,923
So?
- So get her married off and bingo,

781
00:50:34,946 --> 00:50:37,140
she's off your back and out
of your cash register.

782
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,018
Sure.'Miss Robbins, how would
you like your husband to know...

783
00:50:40,118 --> 00:50:44,856
...about that little episode at Palm
Beach?' I guessthat'll hush herup.

784
00:50:44,956 --> 00:50:48,193
Counter-blackmail is an ugly word,
gentlemen.

785
00:50:48,293 --> 00:50:51,613
Suppose we're on the wrong track.
Suppose this Dr. What's-his-name...

786
00:50:51,713 --> 00:50:53,656
Kingsley.
- Suppose he'sthe brains...

787
00:50:53,756 --> 00:50:56,868
...behind this blackmail scheme and
Miss Robbins is nothing but a pawn.

788
00:50:56,968 --> 00:50:59,037
That's hardly likely.
- Likely or not,

789
00:50:59,137 --> 00:51:01,665
I intend to do a little investigating
of my own.

790
00:51:01,765 --> 00:51:05,502
I wanna meet this guy, size him up and
see what we have to contend with.

791
00:51:05,602 --> 00:51:07,754
Yes, sir?
- Would you get me the address...

792
00:51:07,854 --> 00:51:10,173
...of a Dr. Warren Kingsley.
- Yes, sir.

793
00:51:10,273 --> 00:51:12,978
Thank you. Meeting adjourned.

794
00:51:16,696 --> 00:51:18,903
Amateurs.

795
00:51:32,128 --> 00:51:33,780
Well, there you are.

796
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,783
Have you any idea how you're
going to get in the place?

797
00:51:36,883 --> 00:51:39,869
Simple. He's a doctor,
I can have a stomachache.

798
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:43,206
Careful, or you'll end up
with your appendix missing.

799
00:51:43,306 --> 00:51:48,916
Very funny, Mr. O'Hara. Now, you
wait for me down the street there.

800
00:51:51,064 --> 00:51:53,064
Now, cheer up, Bobo.

801
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:56,976
The nice doctorsays it's all
in your mind. Yes.

802
00:51:56,987 --> 00:51:59,359
Come on, Bobo.

803
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:24,164
Hey, son, do you mind ifl borrow
your dog for a few minutes?

804
00:52:24,264 --> 00:52:26,458
I'll give you a quarter.
What do you say?

805
00:52:26,558 --> 00:52:29,503
Gee, thanks.
But, mister, it's not my dog.

806
00:52:29,603 --> 00:52:32,176
You mean it's not your horse.

807
00:53:00,592 --> 00:53:03,328
Emergency case. I'd like to see
the doctorright away.

808
00:53:03,428 --> 00:53:05,663
And what isthe nature ofthe emergency?

809
00:53:05,763 --> 00:53:08,171
Well, it's rather personal.

810
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:10,585
I'd preferto see the doctor.
Oh, doc.

811
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:12,921
Young man, you're finally out ofthe woods.

812
00:53:13,021 --> 00:53:15,173
You just stick to that vitamin therapy...

813
00:53:15,273 --> 00:53:16,883
...and you'll feel like a new dog.

814
00:53:16,983 --> 00:53:18,983
Thank you, doctor.

815
00:53:18,985 --> 00:53:22,222
Yes, do you have an appointment?
- Emergency case, very important.

816
00:53:22,322 --> 00:53:25,157
Come on, doc. Oh, doc.

817
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:31,606
Now, you take it easy, old boy.
Good old doc'll fix you up. Attaboy.

818
00:53:31,706 --> 00:53:33,942
Did you have an appointment,
Mr?

819
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:37,826
Heminschlogger.
Julius T. Heminschlogger.

820
00:53:38,046 --> 00:53:40,782
Yeah, and as I mentioned,
this is an emergency case.

821
00:53:40,882 --> 00:53:46,125
I see. What seemsto be his problem,
Mr. Heminschlogger?

822
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,430
Well...

823
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:52,517
...amnesia.

824
00:53:53,228 --> 00:53:56,297
Your dog has amnesia?
- It happened all of a sudden.

825
00:53:56,397 --> 00:53:58,174
I wastaking him fora walk,

826
00:53:58,274 --> 00:54:01,469
and he gave me that 'who are you?' look.

827
00:54:01,569 --> 00:54:05,014
The 'who are you?' look?
- Yeah, like this:

828
00:54:05,114 --> 00:54:08,059
Don't mind telling you it shook me up.

829
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:13,231
Canine amnesia. That's very rare.
I don't think they everwrote that up.

830
00:54:13,331 --> 00:54:15,150
Well, now's your chance, doc.

831
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,903
Not only to help me,
but advance the cause of medical...

832
00:54:19,003 --> 00:54:22,157
Will you hold still, Julius.
What are you...?

833
00:54:22,257 --> 00:54:25,577
Not in the pocket, Julius.
You see there, doc?

834
00:54:25,677 --> 00:54:27,203
He thinks he's a pickpocket.

835
00:54:27,303 --> 00:54:29,080
Julius? Isn't that your name?

836
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,709
Is it? Yeah, it is.
Well, this is Julius Jr.

837
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:37,554
I'm the sentimental type
and we're very close, you know.

838
00:54:40,024 --> 00:54:42,914
See, doc?
Now he thinks I'm Lassie.

839
00:54:45,822 --> 00:54:48,609
Kind of a memory block, huh?

840
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:51,945
May I?
- Yeah.

841
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:58,860
All right, now, Julius, just calm down.
You're among friends now.

842
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,795
Just relax. Just relax.

843
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:06,850
Tell me, Mr. Heminschlogger,
has he had a physical lately?

844
00:55:07,177 --> 00:55:11,790
Well, not in six months. You better
check him over. Take yourtime.

845
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,751
Lfthis doesn't work, we'll try analysis.
- Oh, anything.

846
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:18,336
Long as we get my buddy back on his feet.

847
00:55:20,064 --> 00:55:24,312
'Kansas Institute of Veterinary Science.'

848
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:27,597
That must be a wonderful old school.

849
00:55:27,697 --> 00:55:30,614
Sure is.
My father's the president.

850
00:55:30,867 --> 00:55:32,477
Oh, he is?

851
00:55:32,577 --> 00:55:35,480
Now, let'stake a look at
those tonsils. Now, now, Julius.

852
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,960
Biting won't solve anything.

853
00:55:39,042 --> 00:55:41,042
Just relax.

854
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:46,741
Oh, doc. This picture,
I've seen this girl before.

855
00:55:46,841 --> 00:55:49,619
Where?
- Well, isn't she a chorus girl...

856
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:51,842
...at the Copacabana?

857
00:55:52,055 --> 00:55:54,749
No, I'm afraid not.
That's my fiancée.

858
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:57,684
Oh, well, I could be mistaken.

859
00:55:57,894 --> 00:56:00,213
No, my family's very strait-laced.

860
00:56:00,313 --> 00:56:02,966
I'm afraid they would never allow me
to be engaged...

861
00:56:03,066 --> 00:56:04,801
...to a girl from the Copacabana.

862
00:56:04,901 --> 00:56:07,688
Rocky. Rocky.

863
00:56:07,904 --> 00:56:09,306
All right, where is he?.

864
00:56:09,406 --> 00:56:12,892
What do you want?
This is a respectable clinic.

865
00:56:12,992 --> 00:56:16,688
I'm looking fora dognapper,
that's what I'm looking for.

866
00:56:16,788 --> 00:56:19,065
What's in there?
- You can't go in there.

867
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:21,630
Police.
- Who snatched my dog?

868
00:56:21,835 --> 00:56:23,820
Get out ofthere.
- Police.

869
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,656
Rocky, baby.
- Keep your hands offmy patient.

870
00:56:26,756 --> 00:56:30,836
Police.
- You dognapper.

871
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:33,052
I want words with you.

872
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:35,498
I don't know what you did to my dog,

873
00:56:35,598 --> 00:56:39,423
but I want everything
put back the way it was.

874
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:41,046
Police.
- Thanks forthe advice...

875
00:56:41,146 --> 00:56:45,175
...about my parakeet, doc.
I'll keep him out of drafts.

876
00:56:45,275 --> 00:56:47,260
In there, officer. You'd better hurry.

877
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,485
Oh, doctor. Dr. Kingsley.

878
00:57:34,574 --> 00:57:36,784
Hello.
- Well, here we are.

879
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,715
Won't you come in. How do you do?

880
00:57:39,746 --> 00:57:41,147
How are you?

881
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:44,067
Happy to know you, Miss...
What wasthe lady's name?

882
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:45,819
Miss Robbins.
- Miss Robbins.

883
00:57:45,919 --> 00:57:47,737
Happy to know you.
Come right in.

884
00:57:47,837 --> 00:57:50,126
Well, thank you.

885
00:57:53,343 --> 00:57:55,798
I'm delighted to know you.

886
00:57:56,012 --> 00:57:57,580
Miss Robbins, this is Mother.

887
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,375
Oh, I'm delighted to know your mothertoo.

888
00:58:00,475 --> 00:58:01,751
Oh, I mean...

889
00:58:01,851 --> 00:58:03,170
She's my mother, Katie.

890
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,588
I know, Warren, I know.
I meant to say that...

891
00:58:05,688 --> 00:58:07,549
Did you hearthat, Mother?

892
00:58:07,649 --> 00:58:09,926
Girl here thought you were
Warren's grandma.

893
00:58:10,026 --> 00:58:13,555
No, I didn't. Honest, I didn't.
You're too old.

894
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:16,442
I mean, you're both too old.

895
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:18,101
Oh, what I mean is...

896
00:58:18,201 --> 00:58:20,312
I'll explain it later.
Could we sit down?

897
00:58:20,412 --> 00:58:23,064
Yes, of course, sit down.
Could I take yourwrap?

898
00:58:23,164 --> 00:58:24,607
No, thank you.

899
00:58:24,707 --> 00:58:27,708
Your hat?
- Yes, put it anywhere.

900
00:58:34,843 --> 00:58:38,413
Well, isn't she everything I said she was?

901
00:58:44,936 --> 00:58:47,547
I'm sorry I don't have any more room.

902
00:58:47,647 --> 00:58:50,648
No, no, it's very nice.

903
00:58:50,859 --> 00:58:53,895
In Kansas, we have 30 acres.

904
00:58:55,572 --> 00:58:59,984
Well, I could use some ofthose here.

905
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:02,324
That's very funny.

906
00:59:10,086 --> 00:59:13,364
Well, I would say that
refreshments are in order.

907
00:59:13,464 --> 00:59:15,116
What have you got in mind?

908
00:59:15,216 --> 00:59:18,620
Well, I made a nice big pitcher of cold mar...

909
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,205
Hot chocolate.

910
00:59:20,305 --> 00:59:24,433
Of cold hot chocolate. Yes.
That's right.

911
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:26,211
So you have your choice...

912
00:59:26,311 --> 00:59:30,221
...of cold hot chocolate or hot hot chocolate.

913
00:59:30,398 --> 00:59:32,474
Hot, please.

914
00:59:33,485 --> 00:59:35,720
Well, I'll have cold, I guess.

915
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,138
That'stwo chocolates.

916
00:59:37,238 --> 00:59:40,383
One hot and one cold,
coming right up.

917
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,660
Isn't she nice?

918
00:59:53,671 --> 00:59:55,671
I forgot.

919
00:59:55,715 --> 00:59:58,669
I'm all out of chocolate.

920
00:59:59,677 --> 01:00:03,927
Oh, would you like olives?
Would you like an olive?

921
01:00:04,098 --> 01:00:06,098
No, thanks.

922
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:09,754
No, thank you. They stick in my...
No, thank you.

923
01:00:09,854 --> 01:00:11,854
Yes.

924
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:26,438
Well, I guess we're off
to our little French restaurant.

925
01:00:26,538 --> 01:00:30,108
Oh, little French restaurants,
that's all we've had on thistrip.

926
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:33,862
It seems to me we ought to go
to some big noisy nightclub.

927
01:00:33,962 --> 01:00:36,448
Do you know any nightclubs,
Miss Robbins?

928
01:00:36,548 --> 01:00:38,548
There's the Martinique.

929
01:00:39,342 --> 01:00:41,661
But I've never been there.
Never.

930
01:00:41,761 --> 01:00:44,497
I've heard about it. Let's go there.

931
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:46,750
Dad, it's very popular.
I doubt if we'd get in.

932
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:48,793
You just tell them that your dad heads up...

933
01:00:48,893 --> 01:00:51,129
...the Kansas Institute
of Veterinary Science.

934
01:00:51,229 --> 01:00:55,049
That'll make them sit up and bark.
Yeah, sit up and b...

935
01:00:55,149 --> 01:00:58,804
Did you hearthat, Mother,
'sit up and bark'?

936
01:00:59,487 --> 01:01:02,140
She said she's never been there.
- No.

937
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:07,896
I'm a working girl. And working girls
just don't have time for nightclubs.

938
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:10,035
That's right.

939
01:01:10,248 --> 01:01:14,246
Yeah, well, should I get your coat,
Katie?

940
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,460
Thank you, Warren.

941
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:19,961
I don't need...

942
01:01:20,342 --> 01:01:23,128
Mink?
- May I?

943
01:01:23,344 --> 01:01:25,717
May I have a feel ofthat?

944
01:01:27,265 --> 01:01:31,678
Oh, my. Tourmaline mink.
They run into money.

945
01:01:32,187 --> 01:01:34,822
What is it you do for a living?

946
01:01:36,024 --> 01:01:38,024
Research.

947
01:01:38,109 --> 01:01:40,814
Obviously pays very well.

948
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:45,401
Katie, where did you get the coat?

949
01:01:45,617 --> 01:01:48,603
I bought it on time, Warren.
I wastrying to explain.

950
01:01:48,703 --> 01:01:51,940
Ten dollars a week.
I wanted to surprise you.

951
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,290
Yeah. You surprised me.

952
01:01:56,044 --> 01:01:58,044
Shall we go?

953
01:02:04,886 --> 01:02:06,579
Oh, do you know that I...?

954
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:08,679
Oh, I beg yourpardon.

955
01:03:11,077 --> 01:03:13,146
What's the matter, darling?
- Nothing.

956
01:03:13,246 --> 01:03:16,483
I just have a little business to take care of.

957
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:18,902
Could we have a table forfour,
please?

958
01:03:19,002 --> 01:03:21,988
I'd be very happy to accept
a small bribe tomorrow night.

959
01:03:22,088 --> 01:03:23,990
Next week would be even better.

960
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:26,826
Oh, but we...
- Tonight is quite impossible.

961
01:03:26,926 --> 01:03:28,328
Oh, it is?

962
01:03:28,428 --> 01:03:30,580
George, do me a favor, huh?

963
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,918
You see that girl there, with
the fur coat? That's Miss Robbins.

964
01:03:35,018 --> 01:03:37,639
Now, she's got to get married.

965
01:03:37,854 --> 01:03:42,869
Yeah, and they love each other.
Now, we've gotta play Cupid.

966
01:03:43,026 --> 01:03:48,181
See, we'll get her a good table,
some good music and real fine wine.

967
01:03:48,281 --> 01:03:50,517
Then let nature take its course,
you understand?

968
01:03:50,617 --> 01:03:52,823
Perfectly.

969
01:03:53,036 --> 01:03:56,189
Let's go to the Stork Club.
Motherand I have neverbeen there.

970
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:59,776
Well, I'm more than glad to be leaving.
This isn't my kind of place.

971
01:03:59,876 --> 01:04:04,891
You're so right, Mrs. Kingsley.
It's not my kind of, either.

972
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:08,102
Miss Robbins.
One moment, please.

973
01:04:08,134 --> 01:04:10,134
Me?
- Athousand pardons.

974
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:13,174
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

975
01:04:14,974 --> 01:04:16,974
Me?

976
01:04:17,477 --> 01:04:21,472
Captain, table 30
for Miss Robbins and herparty.

977
01:04:22,899 --> 01:04:24,899
Us?

978
01:04:27,904 --> 01:04:30,624
But I've never been here before.

979
01:04:31,908 --> 01:04:35,562
Katie probably looks like one
oftheir regular customers.

980
01:04:35,662 --> 01:04:38,565
Whose name just happens to be Robbins?

981
01:04:38,665 --> 01:04:40,665
Champagne.

982
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:48,074
Oh, we didn't order any champagne.

983
01:04:48,174 --> 01:04:52,084
For Miss Robbins.
Compliments ofthe Martinique.

984
01:04:52,929 --> 01:04:54,247
Oh, well, I know.

985
01:04:54,347 --> 01:04:58,001
I'm probably the one millionth person
to come in here tonight.

986
01:04:58,101 --> 01:05:00,920
Tonight?
- Well, I mean, since it opened,

987
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,883
or something. You know, how
they're always giving things away?

988
01:05:04,983 --> 01:05:07,604
No. No, I don't.

989
01:05:07,819 --> 01:05:10,199
Well, they do. All the time.

990
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:13,224
Just last week there wasthis girl,
and she was crossing this bridge...

991
01:05:13,324 --> 01:05:15,602
...in this car,
and they gave it to her.

992
01:05:15,702 --> 01:05:19,486
The bridge?
- No, the car.

993
01:05:19,706 --> 01:05:21,232
Anew one too, that is.

994
01:05:21,332 --> 01:05:24,903
She was probably the ten millionth
person to cross the bridge.

995
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:26,738
Orwas it a tunnel?

996
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:29,449
Yeah, well, Mom, ifKatie says
she's never been here before,

997
01:05:29,549 --> 01:05:32,577
she's never been here before.
- No, I haven't.

998
01:05:32,677 --> 01:05:36,295
And it was a tunnel.
And this girl...

999
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:45,477
To the Veterinary Institute in Kansas.

1000
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:47,849
I'll drink to that.

1001
01:05:54,699 --> 01:05:56,935
Everything satisfactory, Mr. Ryder?

1002
01:05:57,035 --> 01:05:58,812
Yeah, I think we've given Cupid
a good start.

1003
01:05:58,912 --> 01:06:00,855
Now, you keep those arrows coming.

1004
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:04,359
I heard them say they were going
to the Stork Club from here.

1005
01:06:04,459 --> 01:06:06,459
Good.

1006
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:08,530
Come on, honey,
let's go to the Stork Club.

1007
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,448
We can't keep ourfriends waiting.

1008
01:06:10,548 --> 01:06:12,826
We don't have any friends
at the Stork Club.

1009
01:06:12,926 --> 01:06:15,816
We'll make some.
- I liked it here.

1010
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:19,541
Oh, darling, I forgot my purse.

1011
01:06:19,641 --> 01:06:23,976
Oh, I'll get it for you.
I'll meet you out in front.

1012
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:28,091
Heminschlogger.
It's Heminschlogger.

1013
01:06:28,191 --> 01:06:29,509
I'll drink to that.

1014
01:06:29,609 --> 01:06:31,970
No, Dad, it'sthat crackpot I told you about.

1015
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:34,442
Where?
- Sneaking out.

1016
01:06:38,326 --> 01:06:40,326
He waved at me.

1017
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:43,531
I believe he was waving at me.

1018
01:06:43,915 --> 01:06:46,860
Don't be silly, honey. How would
you know Heminschlogger?

1019
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,112
Heminschlogger?
That's not Heminschlogger.

1020
01:06:49,212 --> 01:06:52,908
That's my boss, Tony Ryder.
- Oh, no. No, you're mistaken.

1021
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:55,660
How could I be mistaken about
a man that just this morning...

1022
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,163
...gave me a $200-a-week raise?

1023
01:06:58,263 --> 01:07:00,718
Two hundred?
- Aweek?

1024
01:07:01,307 --> 01:07:03,307
I'll drink to that.

1025
01:07:03,435 --> 01:07:05,211
But I didn't take it.

1026
01:07:05,311 --> 01:07:07,422
And I've never been to this place before,

1027
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:09,591
and I'm so sorry we came here again.

1028
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:12,886
Warren, couldn't we go someplace
else for dinner and have supper?

1029
01:07:12,986 --> 01:07:15,013
It's just making me very, very nervous.

1030
01:07:15,113 --> 01:07:17,473
Yeah, I'm a little nervous myself.

1031
01:07:17,573 --> 01:07:20,243
Waiter. Check.

1032
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:24,505
Never a check for Miss Robbins.

1033
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:27,901
I'll drink to that.

1034
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:30,752
Me too.
One forthe road.

1035
01:07:34,507 --> 01:07:40,012
Hail to thee, O Kansas Institute

1036
01:07:40,221 --> 01:07:42,593
Of Veterinary Science.

1037
01:07:42,807 --> 01:07:50,388
With your students scattered wide...

1038
01:07:50,857 --> 01:07:53,593
I wonder if we could get in here.
- Really, Warren.

1039
01:07:53,693 --> 01:07:54,928
She only had two drinks, Mom.

1040
01:07:55,028 --> 01:07:56,972
It's just that she never had
champagne before.

1041
01:07:57,072 --> 01:07:59,072
I wonder.

1042
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:04,364
They're always ready

1043
01:08:04,704 --> 01:08:12,082
With needle and insecticide

1044
01:08:12,337 --> 01:08:14,625
We'll go quietly, officer.

1045
01:08:24,641 --> 01:08:28,754
Perhaps some othernight, sir.
Or better yet, some afternoon.

1046
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,588
But thank you, sir.
- Oh, no.

1047
01:08:30,688 --> 01:08:32,882
We're not tourists, old man,
you know.

1048
01:08:32,982 --> 01:08:34,259
I should say not.

1049
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:38,555
I happen to be the president ofthe
Kansas Institute of Veterinary Science.

1050
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:42,140
That's right.
- He is. He's the president.

1051
01:08:42,492 --> 01:08:44,817
No luck, huh? All right.

1052
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:47,397
Are they always this snooty?

1053
01:08:47,497 --> 01:08:49,816
I don't know, I've never been here before.

1054
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:51,109
Either.

1055
01:08:51,209 --> 01:08:53,236
That's the party I told you about.

1056
01:08:53,336 --> 01:08:54,654
Oh, yes, sir.

1057
01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:56,990
Come on, honey,
let's get out ofhere.

1058
01:08:57,090 --> 01:09:00,285
It's getting awfully stuffy.
Let's go back to La Martinique.

1059
01:09:00,385 --> 01:09:03,246
Miss Robbins.
Please forgive the captain.

1060
01:09:03,346 --> 01:09:08,106
He's a new man. It's nice
to see you again, Miss Robbins.

1061
01:09:09,352 --> 01:09:13,646
It's nice to see you...
It's nice to see you again.

1062
01:09:13,856 --> 01:09:17,851
How're the wife and kids?
- Just fine. This way.

1063
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:22,234
She's never been here, either.

1064
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,460
Thank you very much.

1065
01:09:37,213 --> 01:09:40,325
She's a great girl.
- Congratulations are in orderfor me.

1066
01:09:40,425 --> 01:09:44,162
I'm the ten millionth lady
to cross this bridge.

1067
01:09:44,262 --> 01:09:49,304
Hail to thee, O Kansas Institute...

1068
01:09:49,726 --> 01:09:51,726
Ryder, Tony Ryder.

1069
01:09:51,895 --> 01:09:53,963
Yeah, I'm sure he'll talk to me.

1070
01:09:54,063 --> 01:09:55,673
They're trying to reach Pudge.

1071
01:09:55,773 --> 01:09:58,468
Good. Try and find out
what's holding up that loan.

1072
01:09:58,568 --> 01:10:01,721
Now, about getting ourblackmailer
married off, I think that...

1073
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:05,475
Not a chance, Mr. Dunning.
Not for a long time, anyway.

1074
01:10:05,575 --> 01:10:06,852
How do you know?

1075
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:09,396
Talked to the waiter at the Stork Club.

1076
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:12,482
He told me Mrs. Kingsley and her son
were very unhappy...

1077
01:10:12,582 --> 01:10:16,527
...about Miss Robbins
doing the cha-cha in the kitchen...

1078
01:10:16,627 --> 01:10:17,987
...with the cook.

1079
01:10:18,087 --> 01:10:21,574
Oh, it'll be a cornless day in Kansas
before that girl gets married.

1080
01:10:21,674 --> 01:10:25,120
Let's face it, gentlemen.
Cupid-wise, we are in trouble.

1081
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,831
Our counter-blackmail scheme
doesn't have a prayer.

1082
01:10:27,931 --> 01:10:30,375
We've got to get that young lady
out ofthe way.

1083
01:10:30,475 --> 01:10:32,475
I know a gangster.

1084
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:37,741
Well, he's not really a gangster.
He's my wife's brother...

1085
01:10:37,857 --> 01:10:41,107
Hello. Hello.
Oh, hi, Pudge.

1086
01:10:41,778 --> 01:10:44,498
What'sthe good word on our loan?

1087
01:10:47,033 --> 01:10:49,073
Oh, I see.

1088
01:10:51,037 --> 01:10:55,082
Well, could you tell me
what kind of a hitch?

1089
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,925
I understand, Pudge. Thanks.

1090
01:11:02,548 --> 01:11:07,507
Well, they've decided to hold off
on the loan.

1091
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:16,743
Gentlemen, I guess I'm not
the best man forthis job after all.

1092
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:20,258
Now, this is no time to give up, Tony.

1093
01:11:20,358 --> 01:11:22,761
Didn't yourfriend Pudge give you
any reasons?

1094
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:25,138
Well, he said they were
checking on a rumor.

1095
01:11:25,238 --> 01:11:27,140
Didn't know what it was.
- Arumor?

1096
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:31,269
We have got to keep her
from talking, orwe're sunk.

1097
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:34,273
What ifwe tried this little thing again?

1098
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,274
Let the little lady incriminate herself.

1099
01:11:36,374 --> 01:11:38,192
We've already tried that.
She wouldn't talk.

1100
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:40,778
With me we tried,
and with me she wouldn't talk.

1101
01:11:40,878 --> 01:11:43,657
But what if we got somebody else
wired for sound?

1102
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:49,047
Somebody suave, clever,
good-looking, huh?

1103
01:11:49,262 --> 01:11:51,164
Somebody she could really go for.

1104
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:53,291
I've got a cute little spot in the Village.

1105
01:11:53,391 --> 01:11:55,633
Ridiculous.

1106
01:11:57,437 --> 01:12:00,521
Looks like you're drafted, Tony.

1107
01:12:00,732 --> 01:12:02,217
I'd like to help you...

1108
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:06,813
Mr. Ryder.
- For personal reasons, I'd rather not.

1109
01:12:10,491 --> 01:12:12,491
Listen to this.

1110
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:16,481
'Dear Mr. Ryder, I've been thinking
about the $200-a-week raise...

1111
01:12:16,581 --> 01:12:20,568
...you offered me.
Of course, I can't possibly accept it.

1112
01:12:20,668 --> 01:12:23,071
Naturally, I realize you
must have been joking.'

1113
01:12:23,171 --> 01:12:25,459
Joking?
- Go on, go on.

1114
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,660
Oh, here's where she slips in the knife.

1115
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,080
'I suppose next you'll be offering me
the Ryder Building,

1116
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:36,012
lock, stock and magazines. Ha. Ha.'

1117
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,268
'Ha. Ha.'?

1118
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:40,270
See for yourself.

1119
01:12:40,355 --> 01:12:41,839
It's 'ha-ha,' all right.

1120
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:45,510
Well, this girl is going to 'ha-ha' us
right into the poorhouse.

1121
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,428
Not if we move fast.

1122
01:12:47,528 --> 01:12:50,066
'Yourstruly, Katie Robbins.'

1123
01:12:51,366 --> 01:12:53,524
Well, Tony?

1124
01:12:58,206 --> 01:13:00,416
How do you wearthis thing?

1125
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:02,527
Good boy. Good boy.

1126
01:13:02,627 --> 01:13:05,530
Now the question is:
Where should he go into action?

1127
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:07,866
I think Mr. Ryder ought
to take her someplace...

1128
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:11,620
...where she thinks they'll be alone.
Just the two ofthem.

1129
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,015
Then she'll really open up.

1130
01:13:14,222 --> 01:13:16,833
I think I know just the spot
where I can catch Miss Robbins...

1131
01:13:16,933 --> 01:13:21,097
...with her 'ha-ha' down.
My apartment, tonight.

1132
01:13:21,312 --> 01:13:25,967
And a little champagne to loosen
hertongue, eh, Mr. Ryder, huh?

1133
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:29,721
Yeah, and ifthat don't work,
I can alwaystry torture.

1134
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:32,442
That's very funny. Torture.

1135
01:13:32,657 --> 01:13:34,559
I'm not in a funny mood, Mr. Lasker.

1136
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:37,312
As far as Katie is...
Miss Robbins is concerned,

1137
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:39,815
I may be involved
in this underhanded scheme,

1138
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:42,317
but I certainly don't have to enjoy it.

1139
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:45,737
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir,
I see what you mean.

1140
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:47,837
Good luck.

1141
01:13:53,845 --> 01:13:55,921
I'll get it, Kim.

1142
01:13:56,764 --> 01:13:59,626
Now, look, after you've served
dinnerto the young lady and myself,

1143
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:01,419
you get lost.

1144
01:14:01,519 --> 01:14:03,421
Same like always. Get lost.

1145
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:05,646
No, no, this is business.

1146
01:14:05,857 --> 01:14:09,107
Same like always.
Monkey business.

1147
01:14:14,824 --> 01:14:17,102
I hope I'm not late.
- Oh, no, not at all.

1148
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:19,202
Come on in.

1149
01:14:27,003 --> 01:14:29,003
Thank you.

1150
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,952
I realize I shouldn't have worn mink
to a business meeting,

1151
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:36,507
but it's my very first one.

1152
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:40,635
I'm sure it won't be your last.
'Ha. Ha.'

1153
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,509
Pardon me?
- 'Ha. Ha.'

1154
01:14:43,728 --> 01:14:47,643
Oh, yes.'Ha. Ha.'

1155
01:14:47,857 --> 01:14:50,183
Oh, my.

1156
01:14:51,694 --> 01:14:54,861
This is a lovely room.

1157
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:07,437
Oh, are there just the two ofus again?

1158
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,544
Surprised?

1159
01:15:10,046 --> 01:15:12,532
Oh, well, no.
No, it's just that you...

1160
01:15:12,632 --> 01:15:15,368
When you called me
about the urgent company business,

1161
01:15:15,468 --> 01:15:19,378
well, I had this bowling date,
and I thought...

1162
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:22,959
Well, I don't know what I thought.
Health and Welfare, maybe.

1163
01:15:23,059 --> 01:15:25,545
Your health and yourwelfare,
Miss Robbins?

1164
01:15:25,645 --> 01:15:27,463
No, everybody's health and welfare.

1165
01:15:27,563 --> 01:15:29,215
'Ha. Ha.'

1166
01:15:29,315 --> 01:15:31,315
'Ha. Ha.'?

1167
01:15:32,235 --> 01:15:34,235
'Ha. Ha.'

1168
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:43,450
Oh, this is beautiful.

1169
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,148
It's a Remington.

1170
01:15:45,248 --> 01:15:48,138
Yes, he painted this around 1.900.

1171
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:52,030
Oh, I forgot. You're in Research.

1172
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,658
No, my father used to collect
Remington sketches.

1173
01:15:55,758 --> 01:16:00,008
Of course, he could never afford
the original oils.

1174
01:16:01,264 --> 01:16:03,934
Isn't this beautiful?

1175
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:11,675
Shall we? Nothing like a little
champagne to loosen yourton...

1176
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,814
Whet your appetite.

1177
01:16:14,277 --> 01:16:16,400
Champagne?

1178
01:16:18,948 --> 01:16:21,017
Well, I'm not very thirsty, Mr. Ryder.

1179
01:16:21,117 --> 01:16:22,852
Matter of fact,
I'm not very hungry, either.

1180
01:16:22,952 --> 01:16:26,356
So why don't we just get our business
overwith, and I'll run along.

1181
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:27,941
Oh, what'sthe rush?

1182
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:30,568
Well, I'm not in a rush,
but I thought maybe you were.

1183
01:16:30,668 --> 01:16:34,493
Oh, no, I'm not in a rush,
Miss Robbins. Here.

1184
01:16:36,382 --> 01:16:38,382
Drink up.

1185
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:55,301
Oh, your uncle certainly was
a strong man, wasn't he?

1186
01:16:55,401 --> 01:17:00,277
Yeah. Strong like a bull
and weak like a man.

1187
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:05,270
You remind me ofhim.
You have the same strength.

1188
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,410
You see? The jaw.

1189
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,957
I mean, it's similar.

1190
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,145
Oh, your power's going.

1191
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:52,942
Oh, I really can't stay.
I have this bowling date,

1192
01:17:53,042 --> 01:17:55,737
and I'm sort ofthe anchorman... Girl.

1193
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,781
Relax, Miss Robbins.
On a beautiful evening like this,

1194
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:02,077
it's no crime to enjoy the view
and sip champagne...

1195
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:07,800
...before we settle down
to more important matters.'Ha. Ha.'

1196
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,016
All right.

1197
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:13,303
Here'sto crime.
How'sthat fora 'ha-ha'?

1198
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:15,521
'Ha. Ha.'
- 'Ha. Ha.'

1199
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:19,177
But, Warren, I was in the office when
he called, and he said it was business.

1200
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:22,347
When a man like Tony Ryder asks
a girl like Katie up to his apartment,

1201
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:24,265
you know what kind ofbusiness.

1202
01:18:24,365 --> 01:18:26,017
Step on it, driver.

1203
01:18:26,117 --> 01:18:28,853
But I asked Mr. Lasker to go bowling.

1204
01:18:28,953 --> 01:18:32,441
Why can't we bowl without Katie,
and mind our own business?

1205
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,858
Because Katie is my business.

1206
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:36,152
But just an hour ago, you said
you were through with her.

1207
01:18:36,252 --> 01:18:38,577
Well, that was an hour ago.

1208
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:40,865
Suppose we get there
and there's nothing going on.

1209
01:18:40,965 --> 01:18:43,457
There better be.

1210
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:52,841
Oh, what a beautiful view this is.

1211
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:56,762
There'sthe Triborough Bridge...

1212
01:18:56,981 --> 01:19:01,511
...and the Brooklyn Bridge
and the Queensborough Bridge.

1213
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:04,315
And the Brooklyn Bridge again.

1214
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:06,739
Again?

1215
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,780
Oh, that's their problem.

1216
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,314
Here we are.

1217
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:16,901
I really shouldn't. Like I said before,
I'm the anchorman.

1218
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:19,001
But...

1219
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:40,356
Now, then,

1220
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:43,063
let'stalk business.

1221
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:47,953
Oh, good. I could listen
to you talk business all night.

1222
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:52,565
I'll lay my cards on the table,
Miss Robbins.

1223
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,106
Katie.

1224
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:59,081
I'm Katie, and you're Mr. Ryder.

1225
01:19:59,877 --> 01:20:01,195
Cards? What cards?

1226
01:20:01,295 --> 01:20:03,531
I thought you wanted to talk business.

1227
01:20:03,631 --> 01:20:06,785
Let's face facts, huh?
No beating around the bush.

1228
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,885
Bush? What bush?

1229
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,539
You haven't answered me yet
about the cards.

1230
01:20:11,639 --> 01:20:14,709
And I could listen
to you play cards all night.

1231
01:20:14,809 --> 01:20:16,878
Let's get to the point, Miss Robbins.

1232
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:18,978
Katie.

1233
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,591
All right, I know when I'm licked.

1234
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,468
Now, it's your move.

1235
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:26,721
You name the figure,
and I'll make out the check.

1236
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:29,891
I could listen to you make out
checks all night.

1237
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:33,526
Please, Miss Robbins.
- Please. Katie.

1238
01:20:34,245 --> 01:20:36,950
All right. Katie.

1239
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:39,288
What do you want?

1240
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,707
I want...

1241
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:47,006
I wanna dance.

1242
01:20:54,683 --> 01:21:00,436
And even though I'm the anchorman,
I think that you had better lead.

1243
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,688
Of course.

1244
01:21:06,527 --> 01:21:07,721
Oh, me.

1245
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,442
A jug of wine, a loaf of bread

1246
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:14,061
And thou beside me
Singing in the wilderness

1247
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:18,273
You know, that's one ofthe prettiest
poems your uncle everwrote.

1248
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,109
Orwas it youruncle?
No, that was Khayyam.

1249
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,777
Omar Khayyam.

1250
01:21:22,877 --> 01:21:26,791
Born 1.157, died 1.906.

1251
01:21:27,006 --> 01:21:30,831
Oh, orwas that the Chicago Fire?
I don't know.

1252
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:33,680
As long as I'm not on duty.

1253
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:36,917
You know, ifit weren't for my uncle,

1254
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:40,295
we could have met under more
pleasant circumstances.

1255
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:45,495
Oh, I think this is very pleasant.
Circumstantially, that is.

1256
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:50,985
Love is a wild volcano Seething with...

1257
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:53,141
You may kiss me, Mr. Ryder,
if you'd like to.

1258
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:55,399
It's perfectly all right.

1259
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:59,072
Oh, Heminschlogger, you're slipping.

1260
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:01,289
Katie.

1261
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:09,459
Oh, Mr. Ryder. Mr. Ryder.

1262
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:18,625
First time I ever kissed an anchorman.

1263
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,765
Oh, excuse me.

1264
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:23,442
I'm sorry, it'sthe champagne.

1265
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:27,884
Oh, I really shouldn't have done that.

1266
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:30,449
You see, I'm sort of engaged.

1267
01:22:30,653 --> 01:22:32,805
At least, I was until last night.

1268
01:22:32,905 --> 01:22:34,390
I think I'd better go.

1269
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:37,644
You know, I don't think you've seen
the rest of my Remingtons.

1270
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:40,397
Oh, but I saw the one
in the living room. I saw that one.

1271
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:44,152
I have a few more that I'd like you to see.

1272
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:56,798
Here's one ofhis most famous
paintings, Pursuing the Indians.

1273
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:59,207
Well, I can sympathize with them.

1274
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,059
Oh, there are more this way.

1275
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:21,619
Here's my favorite one.

1276
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,322
His famous card game.

1277
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:29,279
Yes, I have seen this reproduced
so many times, it's like an old friend.

1278
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:32,199
Did you know he did a few bronze statues?

1279
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:35,785
Yes, he's just as famous for
his bronze as he is for his paintings.

1280
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:38,945
And there's anotherbeauty overthere.

1281
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:49,299
But I can barely see it.

1282
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:51,399
I know.

1283
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:56,097
Most men have etchings,
and you have Remingtons.

1284
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:58,308
Yeah, but most men aren't as lucky as I am.

1285
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,408
Especially right now.

1286
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:03,521
Mr. Ryder, you know what you should do?

1287
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:06,232
You should turn this into a theater.

1288
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:08,621
Atheater in the round.

1289
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:11,613
Your lighting effects are most effective.

1290
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,713
Most.

1291
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:15,784
You have this system in all yourrooms?

1292
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:20,380
Every room except the kitchen and in there.

1293
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:26,544
You wouldn't really need it
in the kitchen and in there.

1294
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:27,921
No, you wouldn't.

1295
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:30,757
I really must be going, Mr. Ryder.

1296
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,926
We came here to have a meeting.

1297
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:34,427
We're having one, Katie.

1298
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:36,596
Yes, but I feel very embarrassed.

1299
01:24:36,696 --> 01:24:38,056
I only came here to talk.

1300
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:39,933
Of course you did.

1301
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:43,562
Katie, let's forget the past.
What's done is done.

1302
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,897
The important thing is I love you.

1303
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:50,502
I didn't wanna fall in love with you,
but there it is.

1304
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:53,002
Mr. Ryder.

1305
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:56,667
Tony. I forgive you.

1306
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:00,793
You're so sweet.

1307
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,930
Forgive me forwhat?

1308
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,737
For everything, darling. Florida.

1309
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:10,144
Florida?
- And the hotel.

1310
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:13,839
The hotel?
- The rendezvous with my uncle.

1311
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:17,136
The rendezvous with your uncle?

1312
01:25:17,236 --> 01:25:20,551
I forgive you forthe whole ugly scheme.

1313
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:26,274
You think I had a rendezvous
with your uncle?

1314
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,658
Forget that.
You met my uncle.

1315
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:34,668
He was old and lonely.
You felt sorry forhim.

1316
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:37,963
You're a very emotional girl, right?

1317
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:41,870
Right. There's only one small detail
you've missed.

1318
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,748
I didn't happen to meet your uncle,
I planned it that way.

1319
01:25:45,848 --> 01:25:48,126
You planned it?
- Beautifully.

1320
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,669
You mean you heard he was lonely...

1321
01:25:49,769 --> 01:25:52,881
I heard he was loaded.
And after Cosmo...

1322
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,133
Cosmo?
- That beatnik bongo player

1323
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,551
I used to be engaged to.

1324
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,388
He was great on the bongos, but very
low on the dough, like all the others.

1325
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:03,183
There were a lot of others?
- You wanna count baseball players?

1326
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:05,059
If you do, then there
were quite a few others.

1327
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:07,187
I was crazy about baseball players.

1328
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:11,108
I used to like jockeystoo,
only I kept growing and they didn't.

1329
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:12,900
That's in the past.
I don't wanna hear it.

1330
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,569
Now, prizefighters are the worst...

1331
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:17,197
...because you have to catch them
when they're not in training.

1332
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:20,033
Well, I forgive you. We're all
a little weak. And I'm a little weak.

1333
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:22,343
Well, I'm not. I'm strong.

1334
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:25,747
Now, back to that rendezvous.
Why did I do it?

1335
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,970
Blackmail?
- Blackmail?.

1336
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,710
Yeah, but I forgive you.
That's all in the past.

1337
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:33,301
Well, thanks a lot.

1338
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:36,641
And one more thing, Mr. Ryder,

1339
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:40,274
once a blackmailer,
always a blackmailer.

1340
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:42,889
Katie.
- I want money. Real money.

1341
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:45,892
By the time I get through with you,
you'll be selling your magazines...

1342
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:48,145
Let go. On a street corner.

1343
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:50,795
Katie, you can't leave me now.

1344
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:54,275
No.

1345
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:58,503
Katie.
- Let go or I'll punch you in the nose.

1346
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:02,575
Good evening.

1347
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:04,244
Good evening, Mr. Ryder,
Miss Robbins.

1348
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:05,995
I hope we're not interrupting anything.

1349
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:07,914
Well.
- And they say bowling...

1350
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:09,916
...isthe most popular indoorsport.

1351
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:12,085
I was helping herwith her coat.

1352
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,837
Well, was she crawling into it?

1353
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:16,923
Warren, don't just stand there.
The man insulted me.

1354
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:19,759
Hit him. Sock him. Knock him down.

1355
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:21,719
Well, he is down.
- Well, then, kick him.

1356
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:23,180
Oh, well...
Let me help you.

1357
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,890
He's up now, Warren,
give him the old one-two.

1358
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:30,437
Oh, well, I would, but I have
to operate in the morning, my hands.

1359
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:34,399
Mr. Ryder, you'll have to excuse Katie
because she's not used to champagne.

1360
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:38,278
And you know who plied me with it?
Your precious Mr. Heminschlogger.

1361
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:41,364
And you know what else?
He called me a blackmailer.

1362
01:27:41,464 --> 01:27:43,464
Ablackmailer?
- Yes.

1363
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:47,134
Look, he's even stolen my other shoe.

1364
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:50,582
Yeah, well, I think an explanation
is in order, old man.

1365
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,209
Oh, I agree with you, young man.

1366
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:54,002
Do you think I'm a blackmailer,
Warren?

1367
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,796
I never heard of anything
so ridiculous in my life.

1368
01:27:56,896 --> 01:27:59,601
Oh, I can always depend on you.

1369
01:27:59,815 --> 01:28:02,620
Take me out ofhere.
- Oh, Katie...

1370
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:05,430
As for you, my fine-feathered
Heminschlogger,

1371
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:08,892
you're very lucky my fiancé didn't
beat you within an inch of yourlife.

1372
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,311
I know, I'm not lucky, but...

1373
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:13,063
Come, darling, let's go.

1374
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:15,654
Katie. Katie.

1375
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,283
Research. I mean, hello.

1376
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:20,153
Marge, you bettertake it.

1377
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:22,463
Katie, please.
- Mr. Ryder.

1378
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:25,075
Are you in for Mr. Dunning?
- Take the message.

1379
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:27,410
Katie.
- Mr. Ryder, he says it's urgent.

1380
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,883
He hasto talk with you.

1381
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:33,792
Hello. Look, I'm very busy.

1382
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:35,668
We've got the loan.

1383
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:38,604
Yeah.
You know what held it up?

1384
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:43,551
The bank thought we hired Lasker
to watch you.

1385
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,595
I was beginning to think so myself.

1386
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:47,263
Katie, please.

1387
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:50,100
Katie, you've got to listen to me.

1388
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,200
Pardon me.
- Katie.

1389
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,439
Please, you've got to listen to me.

1390
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:59,359
Nothing you can say interests me.
I'm going to marry the man I love.

1391
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:01,582
Not him, him.

1392
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:05,198
I can't let you make that terrible mistake.

1393
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:06,949
See this?
- It's a gun.

1394
01:29:07,049 --> 01:29:10,619
No, not a gun, madam.
It's a tape recorder.

1395
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:13,498
Before you think ofmarrying
this young lady,

1396
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,458
I'd like you to hear something, doc.

1397
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:18,643
You didn't.
- I didn't, huh?

1398
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:24,551
You may kiss me if you want to,
Mr. Ryder. It's perfectly all right.

1399
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:27,137
First time I ever kissed an anchorman.

1400
01:29:27,237 --> 01:29:29,312
Oh, Mr. Ryder.

1401
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:32,114
Alittle further.

1402
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:35,020
And one more thing, Mr. Ryder.

1403
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,856
Once a blackmailer,
always a blackmailer.

1404
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:39,733
Blackmailer?

1405
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:42,902
Oh, come in, ladies, you're just
in time to hearthe next chapter.

1406
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:46,531
I can explain everything, Warren.
Really, I can. I can explain it all.

1407
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,756
I want money, real money.

1408
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:51,203
When I'm through with you,
you'll be selling your magazines...

1409
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:53,705
Let me go.
- Very interesting, huh, doc?

1410
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,094
On a street corner.

1411
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:58,919
Well, that's about the size ofit.

1412
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:01,019
Sorry.

1413
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:06,275
This could never have happened in Boston.

1414
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,320
Katie.

1415
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:13,766
I think I'll... I better get on home.

1416
01:30:13,866 --> 01:30:16,501
It's a little late for bowling,

1417
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:20,232
and I've got a basset hound
tonsillectomy in the morning.

1418
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:25,539
Warren. You don't believe
all that silly nonsense, do you?

1419
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:29,372
Oh, no. No, of course not.

1420
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,300
Well...

1421
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:36,456
Well, what about tomorrow evening?

1422
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,679
Oh, well...

1423
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:42,170
Oh, I've got a meeting
at the dog medical center.

1424
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:46,766
But I'll... I'll keep in touch with you.
Okay?

1425
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:52,104
It was bound to happen.

1426
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:56,147
I knew it as soon as I met his mother.

1427
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:15,120
There, there, Katie.

1428
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:18,873
I'm sorry, but I had to
show him up forwhat he was.

1429
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:21,710
We'll just have to find you somebody else.

1430
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:24,265
I don't want somebody else.

1431
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:30,259
And you, embarrassing me like that
in front ofthose sweet old ladies.

1432
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:33,763
They thought I was some kind of a criminal.

1433
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:35,849
I'll admit I shouldn't have done it.

1434
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:38,726
But even an idiot deserves
a second chance.

1435
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:41,546
I know you're not a blackmailer.

1436
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:43,231
I never believed you were.

1437
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,817
I couldn't fall in love with a blackmailer.

1438
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:47,568
That's the important thing.

1439
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:51,156
Oh, no, the important thing...
Where are you taking me?

1440
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:53,408
Up.
- But I don't wanna go up.

1441
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:58,121
I neverwanna see him again, and
I neverwanna see you again, either.

1442
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:02,751
But first I'm gonna tell you what
really happened that night in Florida.

1443
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:05,754
I was running away from
some drunken lunatic I had rescued...

1444
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:09,841
...from the swimming pool
and had helped up to his room.

1445
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:13,766
I came through some curtains,
and it was dark.

1446
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,431
And I knocked over some furniture.

1447
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:19,267
There I was,
in another man's bedroom.

1448
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,905
And there was a man in bed.

1449
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:25,738
Your uncle, Colonel Ryder.

1450
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:28,080
I thought he was asleep.

1451
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:33,137
Well, I was in and out ofthere
in about five seconds flat.

1452
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:37,259
And that must have been
where I lost my earring.

1453
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:41,873
I started down the hall,
looking for a stairway...

1454
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,459
...ora freight elevatoror something,

1455
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:48,212
when, suddenly, the house detective
yelled at me.

1456
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:51,202
Hey.
- Oh, I kept right on running.

1457
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:55,303
I hadn't done anything, but racing
around a hotel with practically...

1458
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:59,993
...nothing on can give a girl
a terrible guilt complex.

1459
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:20,370
Like I told you, that's all in the past.
I never believed it for a minute.

1460
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,470
Stop that.

1461
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:24,879
I told you, we're through.

1462
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:28,336
Of course, we're through.
- Well? So goodbye.

1463
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:29,963
Goodbye.

1464
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:32,358
I neverwanna see you again.

1465
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:38,239
But you'll have to, darling.
We'll be on our honeymoon.

1466
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:41,531
You mean you're...

1467
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:44,534
...asking me...

1468
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:47,242
Oh, Mr. Ryder.

1469
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:54,460
Oh, Mr. Ryder.
