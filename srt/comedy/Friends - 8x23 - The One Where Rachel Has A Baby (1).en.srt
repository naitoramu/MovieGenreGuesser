1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,379
All right!

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,300
Yes! From home to the hospital
in seven minutes!

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,804
Yes. The hard part is truly over.

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,265
We're off to a great start, aren't we?

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:19,144
I knew I'd get here fast,
but this has to be a record!

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,522
- Oh, you made it!
- Hi.

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,694
- How the hell did you beat us here?
- We took a cab. Did you walk?

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,615
No, we took a cab too.
But I did test runs...

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,408
Hey, you made it!

10
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:38,497
Okay, is there some kind of magic
tunnel to this hospital?

11
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,835
Ross, you stay here and talk.
I'm gonna go have a baby.

12
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:48,048
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene. I'm
Ross Geller. We called from the car.

13
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,301
We have a semi-private
labor room waiting...

14
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:56,932
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?
We asked for a private room.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,394
Yes, I see that here.
We can't guarantee a private room.

16
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:07,193
- Currently, they're all unavailable.
- Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.

17
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,030
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms
are all we have.

18
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,908
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?

19
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:21,874
- Give her some money.
- I really think they're out of rooms.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,878
They're saving them for important
people! What if I was the president?

21
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:32,050
We'd be in a lot of trouble.
You don't know where any countries are.

22
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,177
Okay.

23
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,432
Say, would you mind checking again?

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,978
See if any private rooms
may have opened up?

25
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,023
This is a hospital.

26
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,651
You know what?
I don't really care for your tone.

27
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:55,741
This is not the only hospital in the
city. We have no problem... Oh, gosh!

28
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,743
- What, what?
- Contraction!

29
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,370
Oh!

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,877
- Like to see a semi-private room?
- Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.

31
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,213

34
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,001
You're 2 centimeters dilated.
We need to get to 10.

35
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,378
- It will be a while.
- Oh, okay.

36
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:54,675
- I'll be back in an hour to check on you.
- Thank you.

37
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,679
- I guess we have some time to kill.
- Yeah, guess so.

38
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,725
Oh, check these out.

39
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,152
Never done this before.

40
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:17,155
Yeah, well, it looks great.

41
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:21,451
Thank you very much.
I think we're ready to...

42
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,880
Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin
this magical day for you.

43
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,425
Not at all. Marc Horger.
This is my wife, Julie.

44
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,762
- Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
- Oh, hi, Rachel.

45
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,139
- Is this your first?
- It is.

46
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,059
Well, little Jamie here is our third.

47
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,687
So if you have any questions,
just holler.

48
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,857
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:58,697
- Let me give you guys some privacy.
- Nonsense. We're all in this together.

50
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,284
We are gonna share every
moment of this with you.

51
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:06,288
- I think we're gonna have some fun.
- Yeah.

52
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,791
- Oh, okay, I guess.
- Hey, smile!

53
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,001
- No.
- I really don't want any...

54
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,336
Oh, thank you.

55
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,841
Oh, Ross!
Here comes another contraction.

56
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,176
Okay, just breathe...

57
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,929
- Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
- Oh, my God!

58
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:31,104
- Hey, look at this. Here you go!
- Oh, no!

59
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,488
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.

60
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,242
The miracle of birth
sure is a snooze-fest.

61
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:50,082
- Hey, you wanna see something?
- Sure. What?

62
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,460
This will be fun.
Watch me freak out Chandler.

63
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,754
- Honey?
- Yeah?

64
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,049
Listen, I've been doing
some thinking...

65
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:03,304
...and I don't know whether
it's because we're here...

66
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,223
...or Rachel's giving birth...

67
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,352
...but I think we should
try to have a baby.

68
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,900
Okay.

69
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,528
What's that now?

70
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,949
Okay. I've been thinking about it too.
I think we're ready.

71
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,955
Are you kidding? You think
we're ready to have a baby?

72
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,581
Oh, this is fun.

73
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,588
You're ready to have a baby?
My boy's all grown up!

74
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,422
You said you were ready.

75
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,844
I was screwing with you to get
your voice high and weird...

76
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,387
...like mine is now!

77
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,766
Yes, but haven't you
wanted a kid forever?

78
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,602
Okay, just back off, mister!

79
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,690
Because I am ready to have a baby.

80
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,443
I just want Joey to be the father.

81
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:04,990
- What? Are you crazy?
- Right there! That's all I wanted!

82
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:10,829
I'm sorry. The doctor insisted
on closing the curtain for the exam.

83
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,291
Oh, that's very...
Really, very, very okay.

84
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:20,171
Julie's cervix is dilated seven
centimeters. That's about four fingers!

85
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,260
- Doctor let me feel it.
- Have you felt Rachel's?

86
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,721
- No, I don't...
- We won't be doing that.

87
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:32,351
Well, you could feel Rachel's,
then feel mine to compare.

88
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:37,314
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes! Thank you! Later.

89
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:40,151
- You can't leave me with them.
- Sorry.

90
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:45,322
No, Ross, Ross? Ross?
My child has no father!

91
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:51,120
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna
be a while. I wish you'd called first.

92
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,914
I'm coming back later with your father.

93
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:58,252
- I need to talk to you before the birth.
- Okay. What's up?

94
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,379
I brought something
that I want to give you.

95
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,842
Assuming, of course, that you want it.

96
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,679
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?

97
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:14,184
Your grandma's engagement ring,
I want you to give it to Rachel.

98
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,897
- Mom, no. Come on. Thank you...
- Just hear me out...

99
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:22,651
No! Okay? We're not getting
married because she's pregnant.

100
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:29,491
Honestly, this isn't just some girl
you picked up in a bar and humped.

101
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,995
A child should have a family.

102
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,873
I can't deal with this now. I'm sorry.

103
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,044
Think about it. If you don't,
I'll talk more about humping.

104
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,088
Give me that.

105
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,092
- Hi, dear.
- Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

106
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,179
Ross, get in here!

107
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:59,104
She dragged me out of the labor room
to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.

108
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:04,484
- Why aren't you with Rachel?
- Are you kidding?

109
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,613
We're not gonna be together
because we're having a baby!

110
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,074
It seems you belong together.

111
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,245
I can't deal with this right now.
I have to go have a baby.

112
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,040
Right. And with who again?

113
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,586
He's crazy. Why doesn't
he wanna be with Rachel?

114
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,837
I know.

115
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:28,425
She's like the perfect woman.
I know she turned me down...

116
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:33,931
...but if she wanted to be with me,
I would take her in my arms and...

117
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:41,146
I haven't bummed you guys out
like this in a while.

118
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,318
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,113
- Who's that?
- New people.

120
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,742
What happened to the Disgustingtons?

121
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:59,289
They're having their baby.
It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!

122
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,125
After you left, they wheeled her off.

123
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:08,465
Not before she gave me a nice, juicy
shot of little Jamie, crowning away.

124
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,259
Wow. Sorry.

125
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,094
So how are the new people?

126
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:17,015
Well, they have some unusual
pet names for each other.

127
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:23,522
Including "Evil Bitch"
and "Sick Bastard."

128
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,568
- Oh, gosh, a contraction.
- Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.

129
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,779
- Are you looking at her?
- No!

130
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:36,202
- Don't look at her, you sick bastard!
- I swear I wasn't looking at her!

131
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,665
She's in labor. You like that,
you sick son of a bitch?

132
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,669
I'm just gonna...

133
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:49,673
See? It's because you were looking,
you fat pervert.

134
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,429
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
Just want some privacy.

135
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,267
You miss your girlfriend?

136
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,854
Just ignore them.

137
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,523
- You okay?
- Yeah.

138
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,321
- Ross!
- What?

139
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:16,116
- He's looking at me.
- Hey!

140
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,244
Wanna live to see your baby?

141
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:22,748
Don't you talk to my husband like that,
you stupid bastard!

142
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:31,089
Oh, good God! If you want
a baby so bad, just go steal it!

143
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,595
Since when are you
so crazy about babies?

144
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:41,141
I'm not crazy about babies.
I'm crazy about us.

145
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:43,936
What?

146
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,940
We talk about having
babies someday, not now...

147
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:53,320
...but I'm starting to think that we
can handle it. We're good.

148
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,198
We're really good.

149
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,659
We are pretty good.

150
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,995
But nothing has to happen
until you're ready.

151
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,749
Well, maybe I'm ready now.

152
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,962
I mean, it's a little scary,
but maybe it's right.

153
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,173
It's not right!
We're not ready for a kid!

154
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:17,595
- What?
- I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.

155
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:23,225
So we're gonna try?
I mean, we're trying?

156
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,144
We're trying to get pregnant.

157
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:33,944
I'm not comfortable doing
this in front of the babies.

158
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:39,532
- So when do you want to start trying?
- All right, hold on a sec.

159
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,578
- Period math?
- Yeah.

160
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,499
Well, we could start trying now.

161
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,337
- Right here?
- No, not here.

162
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,881
Maybe here.

163
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,261
We got time to kill. We're in
a building that's full of beds!

164
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,680
And it's so clean!

165
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,898
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!

166
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,943
- It ate your money?
- No.

167
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:22,034
- I'll see you downstairs then.
- All right.

168
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,496
Hey, I got one! I got one!

169
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,416
- Hi.
- Hi.

170
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:33,212
- Oh, up or down?
- Oh. Down, please.

171
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,719
I hate to be a ball-buster,
but can I just do it?

172
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,973
- Could you press up too?
- Sure.

173
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:50,813
- I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.
- How did yours happen?

174
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,440
It's a long, embarrassing story.

175
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:58,821
Let's just say, there was a
typographical error with a sex manual.

176
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,532
- How about you?
- Car accident.

177
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,536
- Idiot on a cell not paying attention?
- Yeah. Me.

178
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,625
Oh, hey, that's me.

179
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:15,504
Hey, I take it you're
just visiting someone.

180
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:20,092
Well, if you have some time,
and you wanna visit someone else...

181
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,052
Yeah. I would like that.

182
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:28,016
- Great. I'm in room...
- Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!

183
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,895
You gotta press the button.

184
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,651
They're bringing in another woman.

185
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,029
Oh. Is she pregnant yet?

186
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:44,825
She doesn't need to be.
She'll still have the baby before I do.

187
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:49,622
- Oh, Ross! Another contraction.
- Oh, okay. Here, here.

188
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,541
That's it.

189
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:57,213
- Oh, that sounded like a bad one.
- Yeah, it was.

190
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:02,176
Mine haven't been so bad.
Oh, here comes one now.

191
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,433
Oh, that was a big one.

192
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:19,568
Could you help me? The patient
I'm looking for has a broken leg.

193
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:24,114
He's in a wheelchair. He's early
to mid-30s, very attractive.

194
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:28,911
- I know who you're talking about.
- Great! What room is he in?

195
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,913
Sorry. That information is restricted.

196
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,752
- She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
- Dr. Drake who?

197
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:43,592
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
We need that information. I'm a doctor.

198
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:47,888
- At this hospital?
- Damn it! We're losing precious time.

199
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:52,268
You want this man's blood
on your head... Hands!

200
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:57,356
It is essential that you tell me
what room he is staying in.

201
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,734
He's a patient of mine.

202
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,486
- He's in room 816.
- 816. Thank you.

203
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,447
- And what is his name?
- No.

204
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,919
- I think we found a place.
- Okay.

205
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:24,967
- Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
- Okay.

206
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,677
- We'll dim the lights.
- Okay.

207
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,848
Or turn them out altogether.

208
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:36,061
No scented candles.
Okay, here. There we go.

209
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:39,982
Okay, okay.
Making me sterile, but okay.

210
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:48,991
Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait.
Do we have a condom?

211
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,410
Oh, right!

212
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:03,380
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.

213
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,176
This is it!

214
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,930
- That's him!
- Great. Go get him!

215
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,601
Wait a second.
Or maybe you could go in first.

216
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,311
He's not really my type.

217
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:22,774
Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him
questions and see what he's like.

218
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,570
- People tell doctors everything.
- You said he's great.

219
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:31,199
Guys I meet seem nice at first,
then turn out to be big jerks.

220
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,661
- You do attract some stinkers.
- I know.

221
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:39,166
Dr. Long, I've been at this
for 17 hours.

222
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,919
Three women have had their babies.

223
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:46,840
Give me good news. How many
centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?

224
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,176
- Three.
- Just 3?

225
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,761
I'm dilated 3!

226
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:58,226
We are moving along slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.

227
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:01,813
- I'll be back soon.
- Thank you.

228
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:06,777
I'm not waiting.
I'm gonna push this baby out.

229
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:11,866
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?

230
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:18,121
- Actually, it's more like this.
- Oh, stupid metric system.

231
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,458
Oh! Oh! Oh!

232
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,837
We'll take you straight
to the delivery room.

233
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,757
Oh, for the love of God!

234
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:35,639
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few
routine questions I need to ask you.

235
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:38,100
I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.

236
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,394
I know. I'm a neurologist.
To be safe...

237
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:46,650
...Dr. Wells wanted a more
comprehensive overview. So he sent me.

238
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,486
Dr. Wells is a woman!

239
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,698
That was a test. Good response.

240
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,537
- All right. Full name?
- Clifford Burnett.

241
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,040
- Date of birth?
- November 16, 1968.

242
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,500
Age?

243
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:10,507
- Can't you figure that out?
- I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.

244
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,386
- I'm 33.
- Okay.

245
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,722
- And are you married?
- No.

246
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:24,604
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would
you say you have commitment issues?

247
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:28,943
Are all the questions this personal?

248
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,652
Yes.

249
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:35,074
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.

250
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:39,328
- Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

251
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,748
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

252
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,002
- No.
- Excellent. Excellent.

253
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:52,841
And finally, are you into any weird
stuff, you know, sexually?

254
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,429
- No!
- Wrong answer.

255
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,517
- What else? What else?
- He's 33.

256
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,394
- A widower.
- Oh!

257
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:10,109
He seemed like a standup guy. And
he's not into anything weird sexually.

258
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,779
Enter Pheebs!

259
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,827
- This room's available.
- Okay! Wait, listen to me!

260
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,454
Since I've been waiting,
four women...

261
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:26,292
...one higher than the centimeters
I'm dilated...

262
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:31,797
...have come and gone with their babies.
I'm next. My turn. It's only fair.

263
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:37,261
If you bring in one more woman who has
her baby before me, I will sue you.

264
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:41,765
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.
My husband is a lawyer.

265
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,769
- Rach?
- You get back on that case, honey!

266
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:49,023
I don't think the next
patient is far along.

267
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:52,818
Okay. Well, then bring her in.

268
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:06,415
Oh, my God!

269
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:24,057
I can't believe this!

270
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:30,147
And yet, somehow, it's true.

271
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:35,319
I mean, this is so great.
We're gonna be baby buddies!

272
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:41,033
Squeeze your legs together,
cover the baby's ears.

273
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,661
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hi, sweetheart.

274
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:48,665
This is my husband, Sid.
I don't think you've met him.

275
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:54,547
I nabbed him at the dermatologist's.
Thank God for adult acne!

276
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:58,675
I can't believe it.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

277
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,677
Really?

278
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,762
What did he say?

279
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:06,808
You have to speak loudly,
he's almost completely deaf.

280
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:10,437
- Oh, there you go.
- Of course he is.

281
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:14,608
Congratulations!
I didn't even know you got married.

282
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,028
- Oh, no. We didn't.
- What?

283
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:23,701
We're just having this baby together,
but that's all. You know?

284
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,660
Why?

285
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:34,169
We're just not in that place, you know?
But we're very excited about this.

286
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:37,214
Oh. Well, then shut me up.

287
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,592
Just tell me how.

288
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,346
Oh, I feel another one coming.

289
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:53,856
[ENGLISH]

290
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,696
"Previously on" Friends:

291
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:02,990
I've been at this for 17 hours.

292
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,367
- How many centimeters am I dilated?
- Three.

293
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:09,037
Just three? I'm dilated three!

294
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:13,459
- We talk about having babies someday.
- We're gonna try?

295
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:17,004
- Right here?
- No, not here.

296
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,382
Maybe here.

297
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,260
Your grandma's engagement ring,
I want you to give it to Rachel.

298
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:25,638
- Mom, no.
- This isn't some girl...

299
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:30,059
...you picked up in a bar
and humped.

300
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,646
I take it you're just visiting someone?

301
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:36,065
- Wanna visit someone else?
- I would like that.

302
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,234
- That's him.
- Great. Go get him!

303
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,194
Maybe you could go in first.

304
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:45,199
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray.
I have a few routine questions.

305
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:48,953
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

306
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:54,541
Oh, my God!

307
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:08,555
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty
room right next to hers?

308
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:12,893
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

309
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,149
Well, let me think about that.
While I remove my pants!

310
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:23,570
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!

311
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,542
Does that sound like Janice?

312
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,628
If it's not, then there's two of them.

313
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:43,548
And that would mean
it's the end of the world!

314
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,343
The One Where Rachel has a Baby - Part II

315
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:24,715
Hey.

316
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:25,924
- Hey.
- Hi.

317
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:29,303
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How are you?

318
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:35,600
Not bad. You know that feeling, trying
to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?

319
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,814
Weirdest thing. Did I hear...?

320
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:43,484
Mother of God, it's true!

321
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:47,988
Chandler Bing!

322
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,156
Janice.

323
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:55,078
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.

324
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:58,832
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.

325
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,502
You remember, Chandler.

326
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,090
I didn't know you were pregnant.

327
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:11,052
Who's the unwitting human
whose essence you've stolen?

328
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:14,556
It's you.

329
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,017
This is yours.

330
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:18,853
What?

331
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:24,108
Look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!

332
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:30,197
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?

333
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,744
Okay, I have one.
If you had to, which would you eat?

334
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:40,332
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

335
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:46,088
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

336
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:51,051
'Cause at least I could explain to him
that you're making me eat him.

337
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:55,180
- Oh. Somebody went to college.
- Yeah.

338
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:57,558
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

339
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,769
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.

340
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:03,689
Oh. I'll get it.

341
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:09,778
I usually get to know a girl better
before I let her spoon me.

342
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:13,240
Relax. It's not like we're forking.

343
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:25,293
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies...

344
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,921
...and I have had no babies.

345
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,924
Why doesn't she want to come out?

346
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:34,094
I think you made such a nice
home for her...

347
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:38,557
...the last nine months,
that she just doesn't want to leave.

348
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:44,688
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.

349
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:49,025
- Oh, God.
- Okay. Okay.

350
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,778
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

351
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,323
Do something! Get me drugs...

352
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:58,535
...or you light a fire up in there
and just smoke it out!

353
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:03,457
I think you're ready to go
to the delivery room.

354
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:04,666
What?

355
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:09,254
Ten centimeters.
You're about to become a mom.

356
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,925
Oh, my God. Okay.

357
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:17,512
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.

358
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,566
Oh, my God! That's the doctor
who was in my room before.

359
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:33,946
Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.

360
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:38,742
I'm telling you, the guy
from that show was here...

361
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,954
...asking me all these weird questions.

362
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:46,291
Do you really believe that a character
from a TV show was here?

363
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,961
Rachel's having her baby!

364
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,465
That's him! You know him?

365
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:57,761
Okay. Okay. L... Okay.

366
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:01,974
I sent my friend, Joey,
in here to find out stuff about you.

367
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,061
If it, you know, if it helps,
you came off great.

368
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,940
A lot better than I'm coming off
right now.

369
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:14,277
I don't believe this. You had him
pretend he was a fake doctor?

370
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:18,073
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

371
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:25,038
- You tried making me think I was crazy?
- That was wrong. I'm so sorry.

372
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:29,501
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?

373
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:30,836
I don't think so.

374
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:36,050
If I may? You told me a lot
of personal stuff about you, right?

375
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:41,263
Now, maybe it would help if you knew
some personal stuff about her.

376
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,850
She was married to a gay ice dancer.

377
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:49,437
She gave birth to her
brother's triplets.

378
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:56,653
Her twin sister used to do porn.

379
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,949
- We're trying to dial down the crazy.
- Right.

380
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:07,664
We don't know each other,
so it'd be easy to forget this...

381
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:12,002
...but there's something between us.
I don't know about you...

382
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,839
...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

383
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:20,761
- It doesn't happen to me, either.
- Me, neither!

384
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:27,434
Push. Push. We're gonna push
for five more seconds.

385
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,353
Five, four...

386
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,855
Three, two, one! Oh!

387
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:35,901
The next contraction will be
in 20 seconds.

388
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:38,988
- I can't push anymore!
- You're doing great.

389
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:42,366
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!

390
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,910
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

391
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,911
- Come on.
- Push. Wait.

392
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:50,749
- I see something.
- What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!

393
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:54,085
- Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!
- What is that?

394
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,797
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.

395
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:01,218
- I thought she had two heads.
- Oh, God!

396
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:02,595
Will she be okay?

397
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,263
- She'll be fine.
- Yeah.

398
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,641
She's in a difficult position,
so push hard.

399
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,144
- Okay.
- Go. Come on. Go! Go!

400
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,271
You'll have to push harder.

401
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:17,025
- I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!
- Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

402
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:21,571
I can't do it.
Please, you do it for me!

403
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:28,287
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

404
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:30,748
Good.

405
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:33,584
Keep pushing!

406
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:37,295
Are you okay?

407
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:42,050
You have no idea how much this hurts.

408
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:47,389
Keep going! Keep going!

409
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:48,932
Here we go!

410
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:52,102
She's upside down, but she's coming!

411
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:54,938
- Oh, God!
- Oh! Oh, my God!

412
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:58,067
Oh, my God, she's here.

413
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,155
Oh, she's perfect.

414
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:08,368
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.

415
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,668
- Where'd she go?
- They're just wrapping her up.

416
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,132
Okay. Well, be careful with her,
she's really tiny.

417
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:26,011
Here she is.

418
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:39,400
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

419
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:44,488
I know. Oh.

420
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:54,289
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.

421
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:58,001
- Do we have a name yet?
- No, not yet.

422
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,797
Fine. For now we'll just
call her Baby Girl Greene.

423
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,592
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.

424
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:25,571
Hello, Baby Girl.

425
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:33,537
- Can we come in?
- Oh, come on in.

426
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:37,458
- Oh, there she is.
- Oh, she's so beautiful.

427
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,167
Here.

428
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:44,464
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

429
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:49,594
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk
and had sex.

430
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:54,391
It's incredible. I mean,
one minute she's inside you...

431
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:57,728
...and then 47 hours later,
here she is.

432
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:06,111
She looks so real.

433
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,447
You know what I mean.

434
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:12,075
- Okay, my turn. My turn.
- Aunt Phoebe.

435
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:16,330
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!

436
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:20,542
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

437
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:24,212
I won't.

438
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:29,342
- Honey, what's the matter?
- Nothing. I just can't stop crying.

439
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:33,388
The doctor said it's normal,
plus you're sleep-deprived.

440
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,724
You guys are all sleep-deprived.

441
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:41,021
I don't see you weeping because you
put your slippers on the wrong feet.

442
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,106
Oh, God.

443
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:47,861
- What's the matter now?
- I was reliving it.

444
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,865
Do you know what you're gonna
call her yet?

445
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:57,371
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?
I thought that was so original.

446
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:01,000
Actually, we've narrowed it
down to two.

447
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:07,173
And you know what? I love them both.
So just pick one, and that'll be it.

448
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:13,095
Wow, okay. Everyone?

449
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:17,308
This is Isabella.

450
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:21,395
- Hi, Isabella!
- Hi.

451
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:25,190
What?

452
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,193
That's not her name.

453
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:31,906
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel
like an Isabella.

454
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,491
- What was the other one?
- Delilah.

455
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:39,537
Oh, great! At least she
sounds like a biblical whore.

456
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:46,128
So, I guess we're back to Baby Girl.

457
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,006
What will we do?

458
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:51,967
- You'll find a name.
- Easy for you to say.

459
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,970
You know what your
kids' names will be.

460
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:59,516
- You do?
- I had them picked out since I was 14.

461
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:04,729
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after
some snack or baked good, isn't it?

462
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:13,072
- Well, tell us, what are they?
- Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

463
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,617
- And if it's a girl?
- I don't want to say.

464
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:20,913
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.

465
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,540
Okay. It's Emma.

466
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,793
Emma.

467
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:33,592
See, I don't want it.

468
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,016
- Take it.
- What?

469
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,268
She's clearly an Emma.

470
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:46,814
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

471
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,567
Yeah. But I love you more.

472
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:56,907
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.

473
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:08,251
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like
to say hello to his future bride.

474
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,587
Oh.

475
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,264
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,
doesn't he?

476
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,183
He's a keeper.

477
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:28,313
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, I'm fine.

478
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:35,362
I really admire what you're doing.
Just raising her all alone.

479
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:38,115
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

480
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:43,787
Sure. Now. But what happens when he
meets somebody else and gets married?

481
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:48,291
Well, then he gets a divorce.
It's Ross.

482
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,380
I'm telling you. Listen to Janice.

483
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:59,762
They all say they're gonna be there,
until they start their real family.

484
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:04,391
- That's never gonna happen with Ross.
- That's what I thought.

485
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:08,771
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend
a weekend with her father...

486
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:11,356
...and little Miss New Boobs.

487
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:14,318
Really?

488
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:17,070
I hate to be the one to say it...

489
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:22,326
...but, honey, you two are on your own.

490
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,330
Well, that's, you know, that's...

491
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:30,834
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.

492
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,712
Maybe we won't be alone.

493
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:38,884
Because lately things have been
happening between me and Ross.

494
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:43,764
And right before I went into labor,
we had this kiss. You know?

495
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:49,895
So it might be the beginning
of something.

496
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:53,190
- Hey, Janice.
- Oh, hi.

497
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:57,819
Who's this little guy?

498
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:02,449
- Aaron, your future son-in-law.
- Oh, no, no.

499
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:07,204
- I'm gonna leave you three alone.
- Okay.

500
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:10,958
Man, you see the kid on that nose?

501
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:17,131
You know what I was thinking about?

502
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:25,431
That kiss before we left the apartment.
That was something, huh?

503
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:29,559
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

504
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,479
But we, we gotta be careful.

505
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:37,025
We... You know, we can't let
that happen again, you know?

506
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,612
Right.

507
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:47,328
- We don't want to go down that road.
- No. That's why I brought it up.

508
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:54,668
- They didn't have any sodas?
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

509
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:58,923
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.

510
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:03,551
And so it begins.

511
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,268
She in there?

512
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:14,980
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.

513
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:19,943
- Look at Emma.
- I can't decide who she looks like.

514
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,489
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.

515
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,707
I'm sorry. For the last time,
why aren't you two together again?

516
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:37,878
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.

517
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:41,215
Which would be fine,
except you totally are.

518
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:45,093
It's complicated, okay?

519
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:50,265
You love her, you always have,
you have a child together.

520
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:52,851
There's no right answer.

521
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:59,358
Look, we've been together.
Then apart. Then together, then apart.

522
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:02,528
And now we have a baby.

523
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:09,617
It's just, if we got together again
and it didn't work out?

524
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,413
I could never do that to Emma.

525
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:20,879
I mean, she came into this world
thinking everything... Now me.

526
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:24,842
What, do they put something
in the water here?

527
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:28,971
It's just, Rachel and I,
we're doing really well now.

528
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:32,974
I know. If you try to make it more,
you might wreck it.

529
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:36,061
- Yeah, exactly.
- Right.

530
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:41,901
Or you might get everything
you've wanted since you were 15.

531
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:52,577
Hey.

532
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:56,331
I saw a woman breastfeeding
twins at the same time.

533
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,251
It is like a freak show up here.

534
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,837
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

535
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:03,631
What is it? Hey?

536
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,135
- Really, it's nothing. I'm...
- Rach, come on. What?

537
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:14,016
I've just been thinking about how
my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

538
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:17,269
What are you talking about?
What about Ross?

539
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:23,650
Please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New Boobs.

540
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:27,029
Okay, how long
was I watching that woman?

541
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:30,240
I'm just saying that, you know...

542
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,576
...someday Ross is gonna
meet somebody...

543
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,621
...and he's gonna have his own life.

544
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,165
Right?

545
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,168
Yeah, I guess so.

546
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:48,509
I just never thought I'd be raising
this baby all by myself.

547
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:50,427
That's pretty dumb, huh?

548
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:53,763
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

549
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:58,101
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

550
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:03,023
Okay? I promise I
won't let that happen.

551
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:09,947
Joey. Oh, sweetie,
what would I do without you?

552
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:13,700
You don't have to worry about that,
okay?

553
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:20,415
Could you grab me my other box
of tissues?

554
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:24,169
- They're under Ross' coat.
- Sure.

555
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,639
Oh, my God!

556
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:38,183
Joey?

557
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:42,813
Oh, my God.

558
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:50,153
Okay.

559
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,900
- That was amazing.
- I know.

560
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:35,699
Hey, do you realize that we may have
just changed our lives forever?

561
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:40,162
We may have started our family.
In nine months we could be here...

562
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,581
...having our own baby.

563
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:46,293
And if not, we got to do it
on a bucket.

564
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:52,174
