1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:09,260
- What are you doing?
- I reorganized the fridge.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,305
See? Bottom shelf,
meats and dairy.

3
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,516
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:21,230
And top shelf, expired products.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,648
Why are you doing this?

6
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,067
Because I'm bored out of my mind.

7
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:29,112
I've already been to the bank,
post office and dry cleaners.

8
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,950
Dude, you just described
seven days worth of stuff.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,704
Spread it out a little.
Haven't you ever been unemployed?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,248
I'm not unemployed.
I'm on sabbatical.

11
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,835
Hey, don't get religious
on me, okay?

12
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:47,006
A guy in your position needs to be
better at relaxing.

13
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:52,261
That's why we have comfortable chairs.
Here, sit down.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,722
Ready? Watch.

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,559
And then...

16
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,521
- So, what? We just sit?
- Oh, no, no.

17
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:07,484
We're not going to just sit.
Watch.

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,406
<i>- Hello, Chandler Bing.</i>
- Hello, Mr. Bing.

19
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,950
I love you!

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,579
<i>All right, whoever this is,</i>
<i>stop calling me!</i>

21
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>It's been 6 months!</i>
<i>It's not funny!</i>

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,169
But I love you!

23
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,881
<i>Leave me alone!</i>
<i>For the love of God, leave me alone!</i>

24
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,468
And that's Wednesday.

25
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,096
The One with
The Inappropriate Sister

26
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,896
Hey, you guys! Guess what?

27
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,109
The British are coming?

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,862
Oh, you and your ways.

29
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:38,492
Since it's Christmas,
I'm going to be collecting donations.

30
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:43,330
I have my bell,
and later on I get my bucket.

31
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,915
I'll be spreading joy
to the people.

32
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,086
Last year I spread a little joy,
but not enough.

33
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,507
So this year, I'm doing
the whole city.

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,178
I knew a girl in high school who
did that. She was very popular.

35
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,598
So, Pheebs, where are you
doing your bell ringing?

36
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,435
They gave me a great spot
right by Macy's.

37
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,062
They never give a good spot
to a rookie...

38
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:12,067
...but I'm the only one who can say
"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.

39
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,611
I lied!

40
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,864
Oh, my God. Here's Danny.

41
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,534
Just watch this.

42
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:26,957
See? Still pretending
he's not interested.

43
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,711
He's coming over.
Pretend we've forgotten who he is.

44
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,922
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Danny.

45
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,010
Oh, Danny! Hey!

46
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,806
You know Rachel. She's nice.
She's not bad to look at, right?

47
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,641
Thanks, Mon.

48
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,143
Of course.

49
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:50,188
Do you want to go out
on a date with her?

50
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,318
Absolutely. Is Friday okay?

51
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,196
Friday is perfect.
She can't wait.

52
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:01,367
On the date, I'll be able
to talk to her directly?

53
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,245
See you Friday.

54
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:08,123
Okay, what the hell was that?
You know what? Don't answer me.

55
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,835
I have a date with Danny!

56
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,964
How could I not get the part?

57
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:19,969
The play was about a 29-year-old
Italian actor from Queens!

58
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:23,222
Well, Talia Shire
suddenly became available.

59
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,557
She's a woman!

60
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:30,186
What can I say? She nailed it!

61
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,982
Is there anything else?

62
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,526
You'll just say no again, but...

63
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,821
...gay porn?

64
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,615
Happy Holidays!

65
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,409
"Feliz Navidad"!

66
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,954
"Allo" and Merry Christmas!

67
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:51,333
Oh, thank you, sir!
Here's some joy.

68
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,794
- How's it going?
- It's going okay.

69
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,922
Good. Let me help you out.

70
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,925
Oh, thanks!

71
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:05,973
Is that a new suede jacket?
It looks really expensive.

72
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:10,352
Yeah. I guess.

73
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,314
Just get your nails done?

74
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,525
Yes, Phoebe, but this
is all I have, okay?

75
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:20,320
Thanks. Happy Holidays!
Here's your joy.

76
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,157
Thank you! Happy Holidays and...
Wait.

77
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,994
- You can't take money out.
- I'm making change for the bus.

78
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,788
Can't you leave the
dollar for the poor?

79
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,791
I'm poor.
I got to take the bus.

80
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,335
Okay. Seasons Greetings!
But still...

81
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,339
Bite me, blondie!

82
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:45,471
I'm going to give him
something besides joy. Just...

83
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,060
I can't believe
I didn't get that part.

84
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,646
I'm sorry, man.

85
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,398
What you should do...

86
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,150
...is make something happen
for yourself.

87
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,652
You know, like write a play.

88
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:04,407
Or a movie. What about those
"Good Will Hunting" guys?

89
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,368
Be realistic, you know?
If I did write something...

90
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:13,833
...what are the chances I could
get those guys to star in it?

91
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,419
Wait a second.
I could star in it!

92
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,213
Or that.

93
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,634
I can't write.
I mean, I'm an actor.

94
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:28,138
I don't have the discipline
that it takes. I can't do it.

95
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,389
I'll help you.

96
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,727
Yeah. I'll make up a schedule
and make sure you stick to it.

97
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,229
Plus it'll give me
something to do.

98
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,732
You'd do that for me?
Thanks.

99
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,360
We'll start slow. All you have
to come up with tonight...

100
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,447
...is the name
of your main character.

101
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,449
- Done.
- And it can't be Joey.

102
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,326
- It's not.
- Or Joseph.

103
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,953
Oh.

104
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,459
What's up?

105
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,670
I just saw Danny on the subway
with a girl...

106
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,006
...and he had his arm
around her.

107
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,341
Honey, I'm sorry.

108
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,470
You should be.
This is all your fault.

109
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,432
You meddled in our relationship!

110
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,392
You had no relationship!

111
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,061
But I was doing my thing,
and everything...

112
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,396
...was going according to the plan!

113
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,901
Oh, God stop with the plan!

114
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,236
So what if you saw him
with a girl?

115
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,322
That doesn't mean anything.

116
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:32,078
You'll go out with Danny and be
so charming he'll forget all about...

117
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,454
...that stupid subway girl.

118
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,374
She was kind of stupid.

119
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,961
You're right.
I'm just going to go on the date.

120
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:47,050
I'm just going to go on the date.
That is the new plan.

121
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,178
Hurry!

122
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,112
- How do you spell "suspicious"?
- Why?

123
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:12,659
I think this character is going
to be suspicious about stuff.

124
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:19,040
Chandler Bing, seven!
Chandler Bing, zero!

125
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,918
You're driving me crazy.

126
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,878
- I'll stop.
- Don't stop.

127
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:28,342
Move the bowl further away.
Ross could make that shot.

128
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:36,308
You suck. But at least you suck
at a man's game now.

129
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,769
- Want to play?
- I can't play games.

130
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:43,315
Ross'll be home soon. I have to write
5 pages to stick to his schedule.

131
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:47,652
So play for 30 minutes,
then write until he gets home.

132
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,947
All right.

133
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,866
But listen, what do you say we...

134
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,993
...crank it up a notch?

135
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,787
I'm intrigued.

136
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,040
All right. All we need
is a little lighter fluid.

137
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,376
But be careful.
I want our security deposit back.

138
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:07,965
We said goodbye to that
when we invented hammer darts.

139
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:13,595
Do you even remember which part
of the wall is not spackle?

140
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:19,560
Thank you! Happy Holiday.

141
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,397
No, that's trash, young lady.
You can't...

142
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:29,403
Stop that young lady!
She donated trash!

143
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,907
The charity's on fire!

144
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,744
Help!
Thank you. I need that!

145
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,413
What is this?

146
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:43,333
It's nine o'clock in the morning!

147
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,045
All right. "A room."

148
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:50,424
"A man enters. He looks suspicious."

149
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,012
That's it?

150
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:59,141
You're supposed to
have five pages done by now...

151
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:03,145
...including an exciting incident.

152
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:09,109
What is all this?
"The Official Rulebook of Fireball."

153
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,027
That's the game we played.

154
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:17,201
It's great. You take a
tennis ball, a bowl and lighter...

155
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,997
This is helping your career?
You wanted to be an actor.

156
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,500
Not the creator of
"Crazy Lawsuit Game".

157
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,920
You're right.
I'll get back to work.

158
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,757
Shame on you! You should know better!
Joey needs to work.

159
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,468
Now come on.

160
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:40,140
You can have this
when the 5 pages are done.

161
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,237
- I had a nice time tonight.
- So did I.

162
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:57,866
I'm really glad Monica asked us out.

163
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:08,210
I'd love to ask you in
but my sister's visiting.

164
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,797
- I think she's asleep on the couch.
- Your sister?

165
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,508
Your sister's asleep on the couch?

166
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:20,931
I saw you with her on the subway
and now she's asleep on the couch!

167
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,101
- I thought I heard you.
- Hey, great, you're up.

168
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,395
Rachel, my sister Krista.

169
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,855
Nice to meet you.

170
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,983
I wish you'd warned me.
I'd have fixed myself up.

171
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,027
- Like it would help.
- You are so bad.

172
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,362
- You are.
- You are.

173
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,031
- You are.
- You are!

174
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,700
You are so dead!

175
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,662
I'm going to get you.
Come here!

176
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:54,798
It's very nice to meet you.

177
00:11:56,884 --> 00:12:00,096
Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!

178
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,473
You wouldn't believe
what people put in here!

179
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,769
Does this look like a
garbage can to you?

180
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,230
Does it look like an ashtray?

181
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,149
Does it look like a urinal?

182
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:17,780
- So you going back out there?
- Yeah, but I won't take anymore crap.

183
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,992
No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.

184
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,953
Good. You're tough.
You lived on the street.

185
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,749
I'll go back to being
Street Phoebe.

186
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:35,631
But not totally back. Street Phoebe
wouldn't be friends with you guys.

187
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,219
Can I ask you guys something?

188
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:45,182
I don't have brothers so I don't know,
but did you guys wrestle?

189
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,059
- Oh, yeah.
- All the time.

190
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,938
In fact, I was undefeated.

191
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:55,067
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.

192
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,570
Still, I was quick as a cat.

193
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,072
I met Danny's sister yesterday.

194
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:04,576
- That was the girl on the subway.
- You're kidding.

195
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,245
They were very, you know...

196
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,998
...wrestle-y.

197
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:11,459
But I guess that's normal?

198
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,086
We don't wrestle now.

199
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:19,175
Not since I got too
strong for you.

200
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,468
Too strong for me?

201
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,887
You want to go right now?

202
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:28,516
I'll take you right now, buddy!
You want to go?

203
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,311
Oh, fine.

204
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,814
Ready?

205
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,942
Wrestle!

206
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,530
Okay, you know what?

207
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,909
Actually, that helps a lot.
Thanks.

208
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,457
Let's go!
The puck drops in 20 minutes!

209
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,001
Joey's not going.

210
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:57,504
I didn't finish my 5 pages.

211
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,464
Finish them tomorrow.

212
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,301
Tomorrow he's redoing
yesterday's pages.

213
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:06,346
Yesterday's pages
did not reflect my best work.

214
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:10,518
Cut him some slack. If he relaxes,
he'll get some work done.

215
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,271
I think he's been relaxing enough,
thanks to you...

216
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,065
...and Fireball.

217
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:21,487
If you think Fireball's relaxing,
you've never played.

218
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,281
You're doing this
because you're bored.

219
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,658
It's not his fault
you're unemployed.

220
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:30,329
I am not unemployed.
I'm on sabbatical!

221
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,164
Guys, don't fight.

222
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,834
And I'm doing this because
I am Joey's friend.

223
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,045
If you were a friend,
you'd be doing the same.

224
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,465
So being a friend means
being a jerk?

225
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,135
If it does, then you're
an amazing friend of mine.

226
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,888
Let's settle this
over a game of Fireball.

227
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:52,768
- I'll unhook the smoke detectors.
- Let's settle this right now.

228
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:57,105
There. Now no one's going
to the game.

229
00:14:57,356 --> 00:15:01,110
- I paid for those!
- You said you would, but you didn't.

230
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,779
Oh, yeah.

231
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,162
We finally get
to the top of the mountain...

232
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,332
...and airhead here
forgets the camera.

233
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,669
The same thing
happened to me one time.

234
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,090
When did that happen to you?

235
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,343
Remember? We were jogging
and saw that bird.

236
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,930
I wanted to take a picture
but I didn't have my camera.

237
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,518
Chasing the churro
guy is not jogging.

238
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:39,397
Oh, this is so good.
You have got to try it.

239
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:54,413
- Damn. I got it on my pants.
- Here, I'll get it.

240
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,380
We better take them off
or the stain will set.

241
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,759
- I want to wear them tonight.
- Oh, great.

242
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,555
Okay, bye. Oh, my God!

243
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,350
- That was unbelievable.
- See? I told you.

244
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,893
Yeah, wow. Sorry.

245
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,895
I don't believe they're
brother and sister.

246
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,732
They're brother and sister?!

247
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:36,079
Wait a minute. Open your hand.
Let me take a look.

248
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,376
Quarter, dime. Lint?
Not interested in that.

249
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,753
What's this?
A Canadian coin?

250
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,548
Get out of here!

251
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,344
Whoa!
No drinks near the bucket.

252
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:54,515
Set it down there and then
you can make a contribution.

253
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:58,686
You can leave the "hurt bunny"
look over there too.

254
00:16:58,936 --> 00:16:59,854
Hi, Bob.

255
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:04,274
I thought I told you
to get out of here!

256
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,319
Phoebe, we've been
getting complaints.

257
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,281
We're moving you to a
less high-profile spot.

258
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:16,537
- Ginger's taking this corner.
- That chick can't handle my corner.

259
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,790
Look, either you leave
or we remove you.

260
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,626
Fine.

261
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:32,845
I'll give you one pointer.
Look out for that bitch.

262
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:45,816
- I thought we said seven.
- You know what? Let's skip it.

263
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,235
What? Why?

264
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:52,322
You and your sister seem to have
a very special bond...

265
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:57,745
Oh, great.
That "special bond" again.

266
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:01,873
Why do women have a problem
with my being close to my sister?

267
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:05,711
- I don't know, but...
- Do you have brothers?

268
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:11,258
No, I have two sisters. But one
has a very masculine energy.

269
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:16,596
- Are you close?
- No. They're not very nice people.

270
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,684
I like you.
I think this could go somewhere.

271
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:24,938
So I'm close to my family.
Don't let it stand in our way.

272
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,733
Well, I don't know...

273
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,943
When you put it that way...

274
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:35,241
Danny? Hurry up.
The bath's getting cold.

275
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,788
I'll see you later.

276
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,835
There's some kids
playing in the street.

277
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,589
Want to go give them a project,
ruin their day?

278
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,259
If they have a ball,
you could stick razors in it...

279
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,140
...and teach them a new game:
"Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball."

280
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:04,311
Hey, guys! I was at the library.
I already finished my 5 pages.

281
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:09,107
Now we can go
to the Ranger game... last night!

282
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:14,071
No, dude.
Ross tore up the tickets.

283
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:21,703
I guess without so many distractions
it's easier for you to focus, huh?

284
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:28,586
Also without somebody breathing
down your neck all the livelong day!

285
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:33,215
The important thing is I finished it.
And I think it's really good.

286
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:38,220
But it would help if I could hear it.
Would you guys read it for me?

287
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,556
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

288
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,644
"It's a typical New York apartment."

289
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:50,357
"Two guys are hanging out."

290
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,860
"Hey, man."

291
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:57,239
"What is up?"

292
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:01,076
"About yesterday.
I was really wrong. I am sorry."

293
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,746
"No, it was me. I'm sorry.
I overreacted."

294
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:10,920
"Maybe it was both of us.
But we had our best friend's inter...

295
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:16,801
But we had our best friend's
interest at heart."

296
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,804
"Could I be more sorry?"

297
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:28,270
"I don't know. I am one sorry...

298
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,315
...polontologist."

299
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,362
All right, Joey, we get it.

300
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,657
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

301
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:44,328
Keep reading.
The good part's coming up.

302
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,332
"I am sorry, Chandler."

303
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:52,336
"I am sorry, Ross."

304
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:56,798
"A handsome man enters."

305
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,513
"I don't know what you're talking
about, but I'd like to thank you both."

306
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,350
"You. You wouldn't let me
give up on myself."

307
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,935
"And you."

308
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:11,689
"You co-created Fireball."

309
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,691
"The End."

310
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:18,028
This took you all day?

311
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,197
No, this took five minutes.

312
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:26,828
I spent the rest of the day coming up
with New Ultimate Fireball!

313
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,127
"It's a typical
New York apartment."

314
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:37,172
"Two girls are just
hanging out. " Go.

315
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:41,051
- "Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?"
- "I'm doing just fine."

316
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:45,597
"God, Tiffany, you smell so great."

317
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,641
"It's my new perfume."

318
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:53,855
"Why don't you come closer where
you can really appreciate it."

319
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:57,401
- Joey, you are sick.
- This is disgusting.

320
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,528
I'm not reading this.

321
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:05,409
Wait, wait, wait!
The handsome man was about to enter!
