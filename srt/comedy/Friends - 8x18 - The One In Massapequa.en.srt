1
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:07,675
Is it okay if I bring someone
to your parents' anniversary?

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:08,926
- Sure.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:12,387
- Who's the guy?
- Parker, we met at the cleaners.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,767
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?

5
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,395
Who said that?

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:25,692
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.

7
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:31,699
He treats me like a queen. Except
when he treats me like a naughty girl.

8
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,786
Would it be okay if I give the toast?

9
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,914
Even after what happened
at their 20th?

10
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:43,668
- I'd really like to.
- Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.

11
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:49,257
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it always makes them cry.

12
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:55,138
- This year, I'm gonna make them cry.
- You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

13
00:00:55,347 --> 00:01:00,477
Any time Ross makes a toast, everyone
cries and pats him on the back.

14
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,398
And they all come up to me and say,
"God, your brother."

15
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,987
You know what they're gonna say
this year? "God, you."

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,491
Well, at least one
person will be crying.

17
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:18,912
I'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.

18
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:23,208
- Really? You can do that?
- Oh, you kidding me? Watch.

19
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,555
Well, I can't do it
with you guys watching me!

20
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,140
The One in Massapequa

23
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,390
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on my toast.

24
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,103
Or as I like to call it:
"Sob-fest 2002."

25
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,481
- Hey, check this out.
- It's a dog.

26
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,275
It's a dead dog.

27
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,445
Chi-Chi. She died
when I was in high school.

28
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,533
- You're talking about a dead pet?
- It's good stuff, huh?

29
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,581
Joey? You got a present
for my parents?

30
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,586
In honor of their 35th anniversary,
I had a star named after them.

31
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:56,010
- That is so cool.
- And I got "Kama Sutra for the Elderly."

32
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,554
- Do you guys have any extra ribbon?
- Sure.

33
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:06,311
What do you need? We got lace,
satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt...

34
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,191
And I think my testicles
may be in here too.

35
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:18,449
Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog.

36
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:23,245
Monica couldn't get braces
because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.

37
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:29,501
- What?
- You're the 200-pounder that rode her!

38
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,675
Hey! Everybody, this is Parker.
Parker, this is...

39
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:41,888
No, don't tell me. Let me guess:
Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel...

40
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,851
...and I'm sorry,
Phoebe didn't mention you.

41
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,897
Chandler, I'm kidding!
Already you're my favorite.

42
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:55,027
- Tell me a little about yourselves.
- Actually, we should get going.

43
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,405
Classic Ross!

44
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,537
Rachel, look how you glow! May I?

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,080
I think you already are.

46
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,751
Rachel, you have life
growing inside you.

47
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:16,632
Is there anything more miraculous...
A picture of a dog! Whose is this?

48
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,386
That's my old dog.
He passed away years ago.

49
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:27,684
Well, at least you were lucky to have
him. Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.

50
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,231
- So where's the party?
- It's in Massapequa.

51
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:39,154
Massapequa, it sounds magical. Is it
steeped in Native American history?

52
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,908
Well, there is an Arby's
in the shape of a tepee.

53
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,827
I got my notes. You got the presents?

54
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:50,082
- I've got the car keys.
- We're driving? Aces.

55
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:57,006
- So he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah, I like him a lot.

56
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:02,178
- You want to hang back and take a cab?
- Okay, otherwise I'm not going.

57
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:14,064
- Hey, Mom.
- This is such a great party!

58
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:19,403
Thirty-five years. Impressive.
Do you have any pearls of wisdom?

59
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:24,699
- Jack?
- Why serve food on such a sharp stick?

60
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,453
It's a good question, Dad.
It's a good question.

61
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,542
- Congratulations, you two.
- Thank you, we're so excited.

62
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,463
And also, congratulations
on your wedding.

63
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:43,260
- Can we talk to you for just a moment?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,555
It's just a little thing.

65
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:52,644
While we think it's marvelous you're
having this baby out of wedlock...

66
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,106
...our friends are less open-minded.

67
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,900
- We told them you're married.
- What?

68
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,612
Thanks for going along with this.

69
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:07,117
- We have to pretend that we're married?
- I had to shave my ears.

70
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,619
You can do this.

71
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,497
- Can you believe that?
- I know.

72
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:17,086
If you do the ears, you may as well
take a pass at the nose.

73
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,589
I don't want to have to lie
about being married.

74
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,718
I don't either. But it's their party,
and it's one night.

75
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,513
We don't have to lie.
We won't talk.

76
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,058
If it comes up,
we'll smile, we'll nod along...

77
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,309
- Ross?
- Rachel?

78
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,813
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.

79
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:40,943
Congratulations on the baby
and on the wedding.

80
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:46,824
- Here's something to start you out.
- How's marriage treating you?

81
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,619
- Unbelievable. It's great!
- I love marriage.

82
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,245
We'll see you later.

83
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,665
- Hey!
- Hi!

84
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,544
What a beautiful place.
What a great night.

85
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:04,174
I have to tell you, being here
with all of you in Event Room C...

86
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,429
...I feel so lucky. Think of the good
times that happened here.

87
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:14,726
The birthdays, the proms,
the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!

88
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,856
None will compare with tonight.
I don't want to forget it.

89
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:25,320
It's like I want to take a mental
picture of you all. Click.

90
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,199
I don't think the flash went off.

91
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,163
- I'm gonna find the men's room.
- Me too.

92
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:41,962
There is someone with a tranquilizer
gun and a net looking for that man.

93
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:47,092
I have to go too, but I don't
want him complimenting my thing.

94
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,137
Glad we weren't in the car.
Did he let up?

95
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,641
He called the Long Island
Expressway a "concrete miracle."

96
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:58,104
This room. This night.

97
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:04,276
That waiter! His shoes!
I must take a mental picture!

98
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,111
Sorry.

99
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,202
Were you guys making fun of Parker?

100
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:16,956
That depends, how much did you hear?

101
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,752
He's a little enthusiastic.
What's wrong with that?

102
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,922
- It's so much.
- Well, so what? I like him.

103
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,301
Do I make fun of the people you date?
Tag, Janice, Mona.

104
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,889
No, because friends don't do that.
Do you want my opinion?

105
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:40,563
Your collective dating record reads
like a who's who of human crap!

106
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:45,359
- I feel terrible.
- I know.

107
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,362
What was wrong with Mona?

108
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,995
- Open it, open it, open it.
- Yeah, baby!

109
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:01,125
So we never got to hear
about your wedding.

110
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:07,422
- We were surprised we weren't invited.
- No, it was a small wedding.

111
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:12,344
But it was beautiful.
It was small, but kind of spectacular.

112
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:17,349
- Where did you have it?
- On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

113
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:22,813
And Stevie Wonder sang "Isn't She
Lovely" as I walked down the aisle.

114
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:27,025
- Stevie's a family friend.
- Oh, my God. That's amazing.

115
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:31,071
- I'd love to see pictures.
- Yeah, so would I.

116
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,827
You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz
would forget to put film in the camera.

117
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,664
Would you excuse us for a second?

118
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:49,757
- What are you doing?
- What? This may be my only wedding.

119
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:54,386
- And I want it to be amazing.
- Okay.

120
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,974
- Maybe I rode in on a Harley.
- Ross, it has to be realistic.

121
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:08,150
Say, are you okay?
You seem kind of quiet.

122
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:14,072
- No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
- And I'm with you. What a great time!

123
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:18,535
Look at this plate bouncy thing.

124
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,957
What an inspired solution to man's
plate-dispensing problems.

125
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,836
Oysters! Let me feed you.
That's not necessary.

126
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,547
- Please?
- I don't eat...

127
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:33,133
- I won't quit until you try one.
- Okay, fine.

128
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,847
- Good.
- What're they like? I've never had one.

129
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,185
- Try one.
- They look too weird.

130
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:51,276
- What are you doing?
- Going over my toast.

131
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:56,657
I can't wait. They'll cry so hard,
they'll be fighting for breath.

132
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,495
If you want to, I could just
hold them down and you could just...

133
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:07,667
And my veil was lace,
made by blind Belgian nuns.

134
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,338
- Blind?
- Not at first, but it's intricate work.

135
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:15,842
They said even though they lost
their sight, it was worth it.

136
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,638
- I bet you looked beautiful.
- Well, I don't know.

137
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:24,851
But there were some people that said
I looked like a floating angel.

138
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,899
- How did you propose?
- Oh, yeah, that's a great story.

139
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:35,196
Well, actually, I took her
to the planetarium.

140
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:39,241
That's where we had our first date.

141
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:44,204
I had the room filled with lilies,
her favorite flower.

142
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:48,626
- That is so sweet!
- I want to hear the rest!

143
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:55,091
Then Fred Astaire singing,
"The Way You Look Tonight" came on...

144
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,260
...the lights came down,
I got on one knee...

145
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,848
...and written across the dome,
in the stars, were the words:

146
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,726
"Will you marry me?"

147
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,689
And the ring was the size of my fist.

148
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,318
Hey, Phoebe? Look...

149
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:20,532
...I want to apologize. Okay?
We were being jerks.

150
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,828
- Parker's nice, I'd like to know him.
- You better do it now.

151
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:27,498
- Why?
- Because I'm gonna kill him.

152
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:32,419
- What?
- He's too excited about everything.

153
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:37,007
I'm all for living, but this is
the Gellers' 35th anniversary.

154
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,261
Let's call a spade a spade.
This party stinks.

155
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,387
I'm having the worst time.

156
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:46,725
There was a line for the buffet,
and when I got to the plates...

157
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:50,146
...I slipped on a giant booger.

158
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,400
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

159
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,113
It could've been.
I didn't look at it.

160
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:03,325
I wiped it on Chandler's coat
and got the hell out.

161
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:07,496
I thought he was a great guy.
I was so excited about him.

162
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,124
Well, hey, you should
be excited about him.

163
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,711
There's nothing wrong with him.

164
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,921
- You think?
- Yeah, know what?

165
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,883
- We were all just being too negative.
- You're right.

166
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:25,180
He's just embracing life. We could
all stand to be more like Parker.

167
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,976
You know what? I'm like him!
I'm a positive person!

168
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:32,438
- Actually, you have an edge.
- What's that?

169
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,318
- Oh, it's Parker!
- Look, the Bunny Hop!

170
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,195
- Oh, I love it!
- You do?

171
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:44,116
Are you kidding? People acting
like animals to music? Come on!

172
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,745
Okay, it's time for the toast.

173
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:53,708
I know normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year I'll do it.

174
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,630
No, it's gonna be great. Really.

175
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,882
Okay.

176
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:05,471
Mom, Dad, when I got married...

177
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:11,769
...the thing that made me sure I could
do it was the example you two set.

178
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:16,064
For that, and other things,
I want to thank you.

179
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:20,235
I know I probably don't
say it enough...

180
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,738
...but I love you.

181
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:40,214
When I look around, I'm saddened by the
thought of those who could not be here.

182
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:45,886
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
who would so want to be here.

183
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,013
But she can't...

184
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,890
...because she's dead.

185
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,605
As is our dog, Chi-Chi.

186
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,652
I mean, look how cute she is... was.

187
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,824
Do me a favor,
pass this to my parents.

188
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:12,120
Remember she's dead, okay?
Her and Nana, gone.

189
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,793
Wow!

190
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,592
Does anybody remember when...

191
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:30,389
...Debra Winger had to say goodbye to
her children in "Terms of Endearment"?

192
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,351
Didn't see that?

193
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,812
No movie fans?!

194
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,732
You want to hear something sad?

195
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:45,237
I was watching a "60 Minutes"
piece on orphans in Romania...

196
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:50,534
...who have been so neglected
that they were incapable of love.

197
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,293
You people are made of stone!

198
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,838
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever!

199
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:12,682
Thank you, Monica.
That was interesting.

200
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:17,644
- Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
- Why don't I remember this dog?

201
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,192
Ross? Why don't you give us
your toast now?

202
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,279
Oh, no, Mom.
It's just Monica this year.

203
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:31,908
You're not saying anything?
On our 35th wedding anniversary?

204
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,161
No, of course.

205
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:43,503
Everybody? I just wanted to say...

206
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,924
...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel...

207
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:54,140
...and myself, that if...

208
00:16:54,848 --> 00:17:00,312
...if in 35 years, we're half
as happy as you guys are...

209
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:04,775
...we'll count ourselves
the luckiest people in the world.

210
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,235
Oh, Ross.

211
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,910
I just wish Nana were alive
to hear Ross' toast.

212
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,421
My God, what a fantastically
well-lit hallway.

213
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,468
Can I get you something to drink,
like a water and Valium?

214
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,973
I must say, this apartment,
it's... there are no words.

215
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,809
- Thank God.
- It's a haven.

216
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:44,356
- A third-floor paradise, a modern Eden.
- Yeah, I know, I know. Gotcha.

217
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:50,988
Listen, why don't we just sit and
relax, just be with each other quietly.

218
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,573
That sounds great.

219
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:58,287
This is the most comfortable couch
I've ever sat on.

220
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:01,415
Let's try something.
Let's play a game.

221
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,417
- I love games.
- Shocking.

222
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:08,380
Let's play the game of...

223
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:12,551
...who can stay quiet the longest.

224
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,761
Or Jenga.

225
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:22,352
Let's play this one first, and
remember, whoever talks first loses.

226
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:30,277
- I lose, now Jenga.
- Oh, my God.

227
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,490
- Is something wrong?
- You know the word "wrong"?

228
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,284
Everything isn't perfect or magical?

229
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:41,246
Everything isn't aglow
with the light of fairies?

230
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:48,003
- They were just brake lights, Parker!
- Excuse me for seeing good in traffic.

231
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,007
You don't have to put
a good spin on everything!

232
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:56,971
- I'm sorry. I'm a positive person.
- No, I'm a positive person.

233
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:01,350
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

234
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:05,229
At Disneyland, getting laid!

235
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:10,275
You want me to be negative?
You want me to be less happy?

236
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,528
Much less happy.

237
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:16,865
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,
"I better be going."

238
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,785
So long!

239
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:26,333
Don't let the "best door in the world"
hit you in the ass on your way out.

240
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:34,925
Isn't this the most incredible fight
you've had in your life?

241
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:43,767
We could've gone from the ceremony to
the reception with you in the sidecar.

242
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,853
It just isn't feasible.

243
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:51,650
But a dove placing the ring on your
finger would've been no problem.

244
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:58,324
- It was fun being married to you.
- Yeah, and it was an easy 400 bucks.

245
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,412
- Okay, Ross, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

246
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:08,292
- That proposal at the planetarium?
- I know, I know. It was stupid.

247
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:14,423
Are you kidding? With the lilies,
and the song and the stars?

248
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,678
It was really wonderful.
Did you just make that up?

249
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,139
I thought of it
when we were going out.

250
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,103
That's how I imagined
I would ask you to marry me.

251
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,606
Wow.

252
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:36,028
Well, that would've been
very hard to say no to.

253
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:44,453
It's a good thing I didn't do it, it
sounds like a very expensive wedding.

254
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:54,379
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

255
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,637
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen
to protect your hair?

256
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:05,182
- I will think about it.
- That's all I'm asking.

257
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,271
Okay, that's it. I give up.

258
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,109
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,
you give the speech.

259
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:19,071
You know, I don't understand
why they didn't cry.

260
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,365
- Come on.
- That stuff you said about true love?

261
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:27,121
You were right. We did learn
a lot from Mom and Dad.

262
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:31,083
That picture of Chi-Chi
with her mischievous grin.

263
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:37,756
And what you said about Nana? Yeah,
she really would've wanted to be there.

264
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:40,676
And you know what?

265
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,887
I think she was.

266
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:49,017
Oh, good God, Ross,
how the hell do you do it?

267
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:54,857
