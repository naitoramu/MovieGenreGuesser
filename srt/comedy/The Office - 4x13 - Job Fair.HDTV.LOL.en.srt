1
00:00:02,017 --> 00:00:03,940
Hey. Ready?

2
00:00:05,646 --> 00:00:07,396
Come on!
Show me excited.

3
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:11,654
- Yes!
- Yeah. I'm pretty excited too.

4
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:15,539
Today I'm headed over to the Job Fair
at Valley View High School

5
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:18,032
to find some new interns.

6
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,921
Wanna get some fresh blood...

7
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:21,900
youthanize this place.

8
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:23,527
- We doin' this thing?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:25,544
Oh, my god, Darryl.

10
00:00:25,664 --> 00:00:28,448
You look like Barack Obama.
Everybody, I'm dating Barack Obama.

11
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:30,378
- Why you dressed like that?
- Like what?

12
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:32,220
Like you're applying for a loan.

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,578
Maybe he's going to church.
Or court.

14
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:36,342
Figured I'd look presentable.

15
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:38,500
You... went a different way.

16
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:40,195
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

17
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:41,821
Here's what we're going to do.

18
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,090
I'm going to instruct the kids
about management and sales.

19
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:47,343
Oscar will be
in charge of accounting.

20
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:49,575
Pam will be eye candy.

21
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:53,056
No, and also because
that is your alma mater.

22
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:56,222
Darryl will hire some kids
for the warehouse.

23
00:00:56,342 --> 00:01:00,229
No need to worry with them because
they definitely ain't goin' to college.

24
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:02,031
What college did you go to, Mike?

25
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:03,483
Let's go!

26
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:14,828

27
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:39,853
Today I am meeting a potential client
on the golf course because...

28
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,634
Ryan put me on probation.

29
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,517
You remember Ryan.
He was the temp here.

30
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,538
Yeah. And...

31
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:50,817
It is not a good time for me
to lose my job since I have some...

32
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,568
pretty big long-term plans
in my personal life with Pam

33
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:55,534
that I'd like her parents
to be psyched about.

34
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,855
So I am about to do
something very bold at this job

35
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:00,784
that I've never done before...

36
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:02,250
Try.

37
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,504
Mr. Maguire.
It's been a couple of years.

38
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:09,549
Hey, Jim, how are ya?
Nice to see you, man.

39
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:12,429
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.

40
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,979
My grandfather
would be spinning in his urn

41
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,265
if he knew that I was out here
with a Dartmouth boy.

42
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:21,435
You take that shirt off right now,
or I will take it off for you, sir.

43
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:22,896
I am totally

44
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:24,615
and completely kidding!

45
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:27,858
Andy Bernard.
Cornell, '95.

46
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:29,485
Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, '74.

47
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:31,987
- Got some blisties.
- Yeah, you do.

48
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:34,838
Hit about 1,200 balls last night
in preparation for today,

49
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,123
so hands are a little tender.

50
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:40,370
It's actually not funny at all.
It's incredibly painful.

51
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,290
Let's make it interesting.
Say... 10 bucks a hole?

52
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:44,871
- Great.
- What are we talkin'?

53
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:47,837
Skins? Acey deucy?
Bingo bango bongo?

54
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:49,464
Sandies, barkies, arnies?

55
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,870
Wolf?
What?

56
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,251
I'm gonna take

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,312
this petty cash
that I got from Oscar

58
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:58,737
and turn it into next month's rent.

59
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:04,818
So many memories in this old gym.

60
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:08,802
Pretending I have PMS
so I didn't have to play volleyball.

61
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:12,152
Pretending I have PMS
so I didn't have to play basketball.

62
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,155
Those were the days.

63
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:21,675
Little over the top,
don't you think?

64
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:23,696
Show 'em what you brought, Mike.

65
00:03:24,884 --> 00:03:26,758
- That's all we brought.
- This is all we need.

66
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,299
- We'll see.
- Yes, we will see, Oscar.

67
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:32,743
We will see,
because a blank sheet of paper

68
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:34,813
equals endless possibilities.

69
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:36,764
Conceptual.
All right.

70
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,476
We are...

71
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,153
open for business.

72
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,990
Hello.

73
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:54,361
- Andy, you're up. Let's go.
- Giddy-up. Let's do this.

74
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,616
People assume I'm great at golf,
but like everybody,

75
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:00,850
I hated golf lessons
when I was a kid, so...

76
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,531
I used to just hang out
with the sailing club instead.

77
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:05,306
Got my knot on.

78
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:08,500
Damn it!

79
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:14,393
Guys, do we have to stay all day?

80
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:16,466
I mean, Michael's gone.
Can't we just go?

81
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,913
Yeah. And I finished
my work months ago.

82
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,305
Excuse me, people.

83
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:23,283
It has come to my attention
that some of you have forgotten

84
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:24,875
who is in charge here.

85
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:26,585
When Michael is gone,

86
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,313
Jim is in charge.

87
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,232
When Jim is gone,
Andy and I are in charge.

88
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:34,569
When Andy is gone,
you answer to me.

89
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:35,706
Okay?

90
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:38,188
Excuse me, where do you
think you're going?

91
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:40,211
Oh, no, no.
You're not leaving.

92
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:41,951
No! Stanley.

93
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,828
Do not walk out that door!

94
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:47,012
If you walk out that door,
so help me, I will...

95
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:50,124
He left.

96
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,509
Last time I checked,

97
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:55,924
the american workday
ends at 5:00 P.M.

98
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:59,588
You will all stay at your desks
until that time

99
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:02,138
or you will suffer
the consequences.

100
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:03,890
What consequences?

101
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:06,762
I will tell on you.

102
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,938
There's some filing,
restocking the supply shelves,

103
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:14,135
replacing the water jug,
which nobody likes to do.

104
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:17,246
We...

105
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,999
- eat a lot of cake.
- Cool.

106
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,304
Yeah, and... you know, you basically,
you learn how an office runs.

107
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,430
- Hello.
- So...

108
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,361
Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec?

109
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:29,725
- Excuse me.
- This is Michael, my boss. Justin.

110
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:31,999
Hey...
remember what we talked about

111
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,760
in the car on the way out?

112
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,297
"Only the best and the brightest"?

113
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,261
He's nice, and he seems interested.

114
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,093
He's totally wrong, Pam.

115
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:43,633
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

116
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:45,390
Listen, I don't think

117
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:48,197
that a handsome, funny, smart,

118
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:51,322
funny-looking kid like you
should limit himself.

119
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:54,857
You could do whatever you wanna do.
You could be a classy janitor

120
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:57,694
or a cashier with dignity or a...

121
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,613
migraine worker.

122
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:04,993
Maybe for you,
paper should be more of a hobby.

123
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:07,828
- Sorry for wasting your time.
- Oh, no problem.

124
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:09,715
And he signed!

125
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,078
He put his name on the piece of...

126
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:13,521
Okay, that...

127
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:18,257
was supposed to be a blank canvas
on which to put their hopes and dreams,

128
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,593
and he just...

129
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,573
made it
into a stupid piece of paper.

130
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:24,594
We need another one immediately.

131
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:26,803
Yeah. The booth is lame without it.

132
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:29,224
- I only brought the one.
- Are you mental?

133
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,325
Michael, do you remember
you specifically told me

134
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:34,230
to only bring one sheet of paper?

135
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,606
You said it only takes
one sheet to make a difference.

136
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:40,076
And I said, "Are you sure, Michael?"
And you said, "Pam, Pam, Pam."

137
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:41,662
And then you sneezed in my tea.

138
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:44,615
And then you said, "Don't worry.
It's allergies." Do you remember that?

139
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:46,044
I... don't.

140
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:50,954
Okay. I'll go look for another one.

141
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:53,361
And that...

142
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,458
is why I need a smart intern.

143
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:00,380
So... how's the direct mail
business going?

144
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,391
I can't complain.
People love their junk mail.

145
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:05,052
Now, are you gettin'
all your paper from PPC, or...

146
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:08,765
You know what, Jim? I'm not really
looking to change things up right now.

147
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,059
I just came out here
to get out of the office,

148
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,101
so why don't we just play, okay?

149
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:14,713
Absolutely. Will do.

150
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,363
So I guess I'll just...

151
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:19,631
work on my short game.

152
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:27,265
Hello, there.

153
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,952
What is this company?

154
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:33,407
Well, it's funny that you should ask,
because it's really...

155
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:35,791
- more than a company.
- Dunder Mifflin. Paper.

156
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,413
- Thanks.
- It...

157
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,595
Okay...

158
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:39,796
Damn it, Oscar!

159
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:42,360
Yeah, I'm trying to lure
these kids into my booth.

160
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,697
But...

161
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:47,204
kids are very wary
of being lured these days.

162
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:48,963
Thank you, dateline.

163
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,320
Thank you.

164
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,949
- Extension 128.
- <i>Hiya, pumpkin. It's Creed.</i>

165
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,076
Say we're gonna ditch this bitch...
You in?

166
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,995
- No.
- You out?

167
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,211
Pumpkin's out!
Let's go, gang.

168
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,100
My old art room.

169
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:49,126
Oh! Maybe it's still here.

170
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:53,295
No.

171
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:55,927
No, they must have taken it down.
Never mind.

172
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:06,860
- What do you want?
- Michael, I know you're swamped.

173
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,298
I just thought you should know
that everyone in the office has left

174
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:11,986
except for Angela and I.

175
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:13,296
Do not worry, though.

176
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,349
I have taken down their names,
and I have docked them a personal day.

177
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:19,353
Who cares? I'm not there, neither's Jim.
Why should they have to be there?

178
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:23,190
So... what else is up?

179
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:27,294
Mich...

180
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:36,870
Thank you!

181
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:38,747
Wha... What is this?

182
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:42,488
- Piece of paper.
- This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper.

183
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:44,252
It's some sort of Pendleton crap.

184
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,546
I think they'll get
the spirit of it.

185
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:49,549
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam!
We're dying here.

186
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,765
I want you to go back to the office,
and I want you to get the real stuff.

187
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,598
I want you to get
ultra white card stock.

188
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,920
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

189
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,681
And don't call me Shirley.

190
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:01,922
Okay.

191
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:10,912
Ah, damn it!

192
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,953
You could just pick it up,
take the triple bogey.

193
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:19,117
Yeah, I...

194
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:20,665
I'll get it out.
Thank you.

195
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:21,627
Yep.

196
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,635
Come on, Tuna!

197
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:56,618
Hey. Can't really talk now.
What's up?

198
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:58,619
<i>Just checkin' in.
How's it going?</i>

199
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:01,437
You know.

200
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,291
We'll see. We'll see.

201
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:05,376
<i>I just drove 20 miles round trip</i>

202
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:08,587
<i>back to the office to get Michael
a single sheet of white paper.</i>

203
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:11,731
<i>So... I could have just had them
fax it to me, I guess.</i>

204
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:13,934
Oh, I like you.

205
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:15,405
<i>Talk to you later?</i>

206
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:16,891
Yeah, all right.

207
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:18,193
Bye.

208
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:25,501
All right.

209
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:28,297
I'm sorry, I got to annoy you
one more time.

210
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:30,941
What if I bring down
shipping costs?

211
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:32,111
You can try.

212
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,945
But I looked at your prices.

213
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,248
Even with free shipping...

214
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:39,032
doesn't work.

215
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:41,286
It's just...
it's not in the stars, Jim.

216
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,122
Six.

217
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,294
- Yeah...
- All right, race to the next hole!

218
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:52,661
Winner gets ten bucks.

219
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,634
Wait... wait for me!

220
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:56,573
- Andy!
- Shortcut! Shortcut!

221
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:05,691
I fell in the sand trap.

222
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,012
All of these jobs suck.

223
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:30,288
I would rather live jobless
on a beach somewhere

224
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:32,445
off the money
from a large inheritance

225
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:34,881
than to have to work
in any one of these crapholes.

226
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:36,953
They suck.

227
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:40,316
Hey.

228
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,940
Game over.

229
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:49,620
Justintime.

230
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,380
- Hi.
- Justincase.

231
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:55,443
- What's your last name?
- Polznik.

232
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,745
"This... just in:

233
00:12:58,467 --> 00:12:59,726
"Justin Polznik."

234
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:04,368
Justin is the ugly girl
in the movie

235
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:06,978
who takes off her glasses,
and she's hot.

236
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,934
And you realize that she was always hot,
she was just wearing glasses,

237
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:11,951
and that you were the blind one.

238
00:13:13,368 --> 00:13:14,436
He's the most...

239
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:16,714
important thing in my life
right now.

240
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,593
I want you...
to meet my family. Come on.

241
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,561
Oscar Martinez,
accountant extraordinaire.

242
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:24,724
- This is Justin.
- Hey.

243
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:27,685
This is Darryl Philbin.
Isn't he big?

244
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,007
And you already met her,
Pam Beesly, office hottie.

245
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,588
She will do you.

246
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:35,498
No. No.

247
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:39,113
But she has already dated two guys
in the office that we know of, so...

248
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:41,649
this could be number three,
you never...

249
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:43,617
Come here.

250
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:46,910
I would never say this to her face,
but she's a wonderful person

251
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,025
- and a gifted artist.
- Why wouldn't you say that to her face?

252
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:50,980
So...

253
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:52,485
What do you think?

254
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:55,546
Think these guys are nice?
Guys I didn't bring are even better.

255
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:56,902
Justin...

256
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:00,442
I'm willing to commit right now.

257
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,220
Would you do me the honor...

258
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,446
of spending the summer with us

259
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,005
at Dunder Mifflin?

260
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,003
I think...
I think you are very special.

261
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:13,130
You didn't want me before.

262
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:16,130
- That's what you said.
- No, I didn't.

263
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,692
You were... you were
kind of a jerk to me.

264
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:19,709
I...

265
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:21,029
And I'm gonna go now.

266
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:22,275
Why don't...

267
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:49,378
Bless you.

268
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,567
Thank you.

269
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:01,064
Okay, Jim, you owe me 120.

270
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:04,685
And Phil, you owe me 230.

271
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,885
Let's open a tab, 'cause you and me
are gonna be playin' more often.

272
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,428
- Count me in.
- No.

273
00:15:10,682 --> 00:15:11,622
All right.

274
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:13,447
Okay.

275
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:16,376
You had some fun and...
and got paid for it.

276
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:19,643
So let me just get
my last shot in there.

277
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,637
- Is there anything you can do for me?
- I'll tell you what.

278
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:25,928
My fiscal year ends in two months.
Let's talk then.

279
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,201
- Sound good?
- Absolutely.

280
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:29,890
Good playing with you guys.

281
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,771
You know, it's a tough thing
seeing a grown man take six shots

282
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:38,884
to get out of a sand trap, but...

283
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:41,561
I had to give Phil credit
for not quitting.

284
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:43,237
Which is what I told him.

285
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,513
I also told him
that I don't quit either...

286
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:48,978
and I'd call him every single day
until he gave me his business.

287
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:50,828
Which he then did,

288
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,110
after...

289
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,373
15 minutes of me blocking his car.

290
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:57,070
So I am now his paper supplier.

291
00:15:58,538 --> 00:16:01,949
And I shot a 102 today,
so I'm feelin' pretty good.

292
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,759
<i>The Job Fair will be closing
in five minutes.</i>

293
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:09,188
<i>Eighth period will commence
as scheduled.</i>

294
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:12,469
Hold down the fort.
I have to do something.

295
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,032
<i>Excuse me.</i>

296
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,778
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

297
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:29,198
<i>I would like you to look around
at all these companies</i>

298
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,762
<i>and know</i>

299
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:34,121
<i>that none of them
are good enough for you.</i>

300
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:35,704
<i>H&R block?</i>

301
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:37,271
<i>Come on!</i>

302
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:39,739
<i>I mean,
I don't even know what they do.</i>

303
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,622
<i>"Frank Regan Funeral Home"?</i>

304
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:44,464
<i>Too much formaldehyde.</i>

305
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,632
<i>The Air Force?</i>

306
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:49,176
<i>Air Force is cool.</i>

307
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:50,882
<i>The refreshments?</i>

308
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,514
<i>Bush league, you know?</i>

309
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:54,579
<i>That's not what you want.</i>

310
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:56,936
<i>Dunder...</i>

311
00:16:57,252 --> 00:16:59,938
<i>That... Okay.
I see security is coming,</i>

312
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:02,459
<i>so I just wanted to say
come to Dunder Mifflin.</i>

313
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,585
<i>Dunder Mifflin,
a great place to work.</i>

314
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:08,022
<i>Anybody? Show of hands?
Anybody wanna intern at Dunder Mifflin?</i>

315
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:11,741
<i>We do not offer college credit,
we cannot give you any sort of pay,</i>

316
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:14,202
<i>but it is a really fun
work environment.</i>

317
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:17,998
<i>Anybody?
Show of hands?</i>

318
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:21,772
<i>Damn it. Okay.</i>

319
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,982
<i>I'm gonna wrap it up here.</i>

320
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>Thank you...</i>

321
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,591
<i>for your time,</i>

322
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:29,468
<i>and drive safe.</i>

323
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:53,492
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

324
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:13,842
Beers?

325
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:16,348
- You closed it?
- I closed it.

326
00:18:16,843 --> 00:18:17,843
Yes!

327
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:30,194
- Congratulations to you, sir.
- Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

328
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:32,261
- Well done. Nice job.
- Thank you.

329
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,699
You know what?
Screw this.

330
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,125
Today I did something stupid.
I questioned myself,

331
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,109
and I'll never do that again.

332
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:48,170
'Cause I look at somebody
like Jim Halpert,

333
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,592
and I think that guy
can do anything he wants to do.

334
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:52,983
He could...

335
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,423
do anything,
and he chooses to work here

336
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:58,182
selling paper.

337
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,536
Just like me.

338
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:02,479
Yeah. Kiss her.

339
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:04,646
Kiss her good.

340
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:17,784
- Hi.
- Hello.

341
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:20,745
I was just wondering
what kind of jobs do you guys have?

342
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,664
- Are you interested in graphic design?
- Yeah.

343
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,292
- Can I fill out an application?
- Absolutely. Here.

344
00:19:27,412 --> 00:19:28,526
Take a seat.

345
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:31,854
I should let you know right away
this is just an entry level job.

346
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:34,383
It's really basic.
We're looking for like a self-starter,

347
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:38,639
someone who can meet deadlines and
just pretty much just go the extra mile.

348
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,527
- I can do that.
- Great, and...

349
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,817
Obviously, we're looking
for someone who knows Photoshop

350
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:46,277
and Dreamweaver, Corel Painter,
Illustrator, After Effects...

351
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:47,793
All the basics.

352
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:50,359
I don't know any of those.

353
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:54,571
It's actually not super-complicated.
I'm sure there's some sort of, like,

354
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:57,044
adult education classes
in the area.

355
00:19:57,484 --> 00:20:01,010
But if you're really serious, one thing
about New York or Philadelphia...

356
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,289
They got amazing programs
out there for design.

357
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:05,866
- New York or Philadelphia.
- Yeah.

358
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:07,414
All right.

359
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:09,298
Cool. Well, thanks.

360
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,291
- And I'll look into those.
- You should.

361
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,115
- New York or Philadelphia.
- Absolutely.

362
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:15,287
- That's where the action is.
- Thanks.
