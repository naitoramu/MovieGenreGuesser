1
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,760
That was the 10th time
I've peed here.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,846
It's also the 10th time
you've told us.

3
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,181
Sorry, it must be hard to hear.

4
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:21,939
It's easier having babies playing
"Bring in Da Funk" on your bladder!

5
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,858
I am so sick of being pregnant!

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,485
My only happiness
is from a cup of coffee...

7
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:31,949
...which is decaf
because I'm pregnant!

8
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:36,244
You want a cookie?

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,248
Thank you so much!

10
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:45,212
So, honey, how are those
mood swings coming?

11
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,632
I haven't had any yet.

12
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,511
The One with the
Worst Best Man Ever

13
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,770
Here's the ring.

14
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,316
Yes, yes!
A thousand times, yes!

15
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:51,487
Any ideas for the bachelor party?

16
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,031
Before rings and bachelor parties...

17
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,242
...you have to decide
who your best man will be.

18
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,620
Oh, it's awkward.

19
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,165
I already asked Chandler.

20
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,793
He got to do it
at your first wedding.

21
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,256
I figured you'd understand.
I've known him longer.

22
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:14,468
I don't have any brothers.
I'll never be a best man.

23
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,429
You can be the best man
when I get married.

24
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,600
I'll never get to be a best man!

25
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,893
Wait, wait.

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:28,023
So you'll be my best man twice,
and I won't be yours at all?

27
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:33,278
Of course, you can be my best man.

28
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,699
What about me?
You said I could.

29
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,493
I'm not getting married!

30
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,871
It's a question
for science-fiction writers.

31
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,873
I can't believe it's not me.

32
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,333
How could it not be me?

33
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,876
I'm not even...

34
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,045
You know what?
That's it.

35
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,549
From now on,
Joey will be my best man.

36
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,845
Shame about you, though.

37
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,684
- Stop it.
- What?

38
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,978
One of the babies is kicking.

39
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,271
That's a good thing.

40
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:11,859
It's not kicking me.
It's kicking another baby.

41
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,614
Don't make me come in there!

42
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,366
Do you have a big bowl
I can borrow?

43
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,285
There's one under the cabinet.

44
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,495
Why do you need it?

45
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,414
We're having a party tomorrow night.

46
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,542
Are you planning on inviting us?

47
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,211
No. Later!

48
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,423
Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!

49
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,845
Hormones.

50
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,557
How come you're having a party
and we're not invited?

51
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,810
It's Ross' bachelor party.

52
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,688
Are you bachelors?

53
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,651
Are you strippers?

54
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,278
Then you're not invited.

55
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,906
Then you're not invited
to our party either.

56
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,285
What party?

57
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,373
Phoebe's baby shower.

58
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:14,255
Baby shower? That so doesn't sound
like something I want to do.

59
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,966
I can't believe
I'm going to have a party.

60
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:22,263
That's so great.
A party!

61
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,689
I don't know why.

62
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,234
This is what I got going
for the party liquor-wise.

63
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,987
- Get a lot of liquor.
- Great.

64
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:42,158
In terms of the invite list,
I got you, me and Chandler.

65
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,702
I'll invite Gunther because
we're talking pretty loud.

66
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,205
I'll be there.

67
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,374
I know it's your party...

68
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,961
...but I'd like to limit
the number of museum geeks.

69
00:04:54,211 --> 00:05:00,801
Let's not invite any anthropologists.
Just the dinosaur dudes.

70
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:06,556
We'll need a six-pack of Zima.

71
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,559
Hey, what are you doing?

72
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,855
Just planning my bachelor party
with my best man.

73
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,441
Good luck trying
to top the last one.

74
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:19,403
It won't be that difficult
since this one won't be...

75
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,573
...in the basement of a Pizza Hut.

76
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:27,619
I'm Ross, I'm Ross.
I'm too good for the Hut.

77
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,624
I gotta go pick up Ben.
Everything sounds great.

78
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:35,086
Keep it on the mellow side.
A few guys hanging out.

79
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,128
No strippers or anything.

80
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,171
You got it.

81
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,508
See you later.

82
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,346
Have fun planning your mellow party.

83
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:51,811
There will be strippers. He didn't
say anything about no strippers.

84
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,645
He just said, "No strippers."

85
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,982
I chose not to hear that.

86
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,570
Look what I got, look what I got!

87
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,785
They make these for little people!

88
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,288
Little Village People.

89
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,377
Look at this one.
This is my favorite.

90
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,755
That is so sweet.

91
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,550
Phoebe will love dressing them.

92
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:30,099
Except she won't be the one
who gets to dress them.

93
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,684
She won't get to keep the babies.

94
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:38,649
My God, we are throwing
the most depressing baby shower!

95
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:43,153
Unless we give her all gifts
she can use after her pregnancy.

96
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,655
Like regular coffee.
Tequila!

97
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,867
And those leather pants
she's always wanted!

98
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,619
She'll love that!

99
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,955
What the hell is this?

100
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,250
You thought it'd make me feel better?

101
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,962
To give me something
I can't use for two months?

102
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,257
This sucks!

103
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,967
What's my next present?

104
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,930
We don't have anything.

105
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,849
Listen, about the stripper...

106
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,519
Good call!

107
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,189
A little announcement.

108
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:25,153
I've decided that my best man
is my best friend Gunther.

109
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,199
What's my last name?

110
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,494
Central Perk?

111
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,456
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.

112
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,084
Hey, Gunther!
Don't forget your shirt.

113
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,877
What are those?

114
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:45,341
Little party favors.
Check it out.

115
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:57,811
Just want everybody to know the
position of my best man is still open.

116
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,106
So is the position of the bride.

117
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,983
Great.

118
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,151
Smooth, man.

119
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:08,447
You got some chili on your neck.

120
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,827
I just want to say thanks, everyone.
This was great!

121
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,831
See you guys Monday morning.

122
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,878
- Thanks, Joey.
- Don't forget your shirt.

123
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,009
Hey, museum geeks!
Party's over.

124
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,512
Wave bye-bye to the nice lady.
There you go.

125
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:37,685
Back to your parents' basement.
All right.

126
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,939
Boys, come on out.
Here you go.

127
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,443
Look at the birdies!
Are those yours?

128
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,238
They let you keep
chickens and ducks as pets?

129
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,409
And I got the duck
totally trained too.

130
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,328
Stare at the wall.

131
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,456
Hardly move.

132
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,126
Be white.

133
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,921
You are good at that.

134
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,756
I had fun tonight.

135
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,716
You throw one hell of a party.

136
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,719
It was great meeting you.

137
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:16,765
If any of my friends ever get married
or have a birthday or a Tuesday...

138
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,018
Yeah, that'd be great.

139
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,897
So, I guess, good night.

140
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:28,151
Unless you want to hang around.

141
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,323
I'll let you play with my duck.

142
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:50,508
Stripper!

143
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,270
The stripper stole the ring!

144
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,232
Chandler, get up!
The stripper stole the ring!

145
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,819
- What?
- The ring is gone!

146
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,907
Just give me a minute
to wake up for this.

147
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,829
You lost the ring.
You're the worst best man!

148
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,333
This isn't funny.
I go to sleep, everything's cool.

149
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,629
I wake up, the stripper's gone,
and the ring is gone!

150
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,299
- You slept with her?
- Of course!

151
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:45,187
I wanted to apologize if I seemed
a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.

152
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,688
Just the hormones.

153
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,233
- No, we...
- Hormones.

154
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:54,071
I wanted to say thank you.
It was so sweet.

155
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,077
You seem to be doing much better.

156
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,497
- How are things going?
- Good.

157
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:08,752
Everything's been about me lately.
So what's happening with you?

158
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,882
We were just talking about me
not going to Ross' wedding.

159
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:18,511
It just might be too hard,
given the history and all that.

160
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,724
This reminds me of the time
when I lived on the street.

161
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:27,688
This guy offered to buy me food
if I slept with him.

162
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,108
How is this like that?

163
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:35,279
Well, let's see.
It's not really like that.

164
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,990
Because that was an actual problem.

165
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,702
And yours is just a bunch
of high-school crap...

166
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:46,165
...that nobody really gives!

167
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,920
I'm sorry. I just thought...

168
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:56,175
Here come the water works.

169
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,429
I called the company that sent her,
and they don't care.

170
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:06,310
I called 911 and they yelled at me,
This is an emergency!

171
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:15,027
Thanks again for the party.
The guys from work had a blast.

172
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:19,198
One of them had never been
to a bachelor party before.

173
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:24,078
Another one had never been
to a party before.

174
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:28,249
So that wedding ring.

175
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,001
Man, that is nice.

176
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,421
I might pick one of those
babies up for myself.

177
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,340
Where might one get one of those?

178
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,178
When my grandmother first came
to this country...

179
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:47,809
...that ring and the clothes on her back
were all she had with her.

180
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:54,149
So you might say
that the ring is irreplaceable.

181
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,610
It's been in my family
for generations.

182
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,614
Every bride who's worn it
has lived a long and happy life.

183
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:05,494
So you might say it's a magic ring.

184
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:13,126
Yeah, the stripper stole it.

185
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,379
My ring?
My wedding ring?

186
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,133
The stripper stole my wedding ring?

187
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,510
How could this happen?

188
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,432
It all started when you said,
"Joey, you be my best man!"

189
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,019
All right.
I'm going to call the cops.

190
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,565
I screwed up.
But you don't have to turn me in.

191
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,026
Not on you, on the stripper.

192
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,736
I already did that.

193
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:42,990
They said they'd look into it
after they solve all the murders.

194
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,744
- We'll call the company that sent her.
- I did that too.

195
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:51,040
They said if I bother them again,
they'd call the police.

196
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,377
I said, "You talk to the police,
you tell them I'm missing a ring."

197
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,213
So there's nothing we can do?

198
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,298
How could this happen?

199
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:05,846
Look, Ross, I am so sorry.

200
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,601
What if we just called her...

201
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,854
...used a fake name
and had her come to my office?

202
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:19,109
That sounds like fun,
but we got a ring to find!

203
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,868
Here's your tea, Phoebe.

204
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,125
It's so good.

205
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,668
Thanks.

206
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,589
- Good.
- So glad you like it.

207
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:41,631
What?

208
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,593
She made the tea.

209
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,763
I think I just had a contraction.

210
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:48,889
- What?
- My God!

211
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,433
I felt one a few minutes ago.

212
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,476
That definitely was one.

213
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,646
You can't have the baby here.

214
00:14:55,896 --> 00:15:00,025
I haven't sterilized the apartment
since the guys moved out!

215
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:05,906
It's okay. I'll boil some water
and rip up some sheets.

216
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,449
It's probably false labor.

217
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,077
That can happen near the end.
Just get the book.

218
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,581
Get the book!

219
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:20,629
- The Bible?
- I don't know!

220
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,926
All right.
This is great.

221
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,803
You get behind the desk.

222
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,306
When she comes in,
she won't recognize you because...

223
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,976
Well, why would she?

224
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,270
And then you buzz Ross and I.

225
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,692
You be Mr. Gonzales,
and I'll be Mr. Wong.

226
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,945
Diverse.

227
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,532
Anybody call for security?

228
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,536
You be cool.

229
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,294
Which one is Gunther Central Perk?

230
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:07,801
Where's my ring?
My dead grandmother's wedding ring.

231
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,179
Way to be cool, man.

232
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,973
What?

233
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:17,477
There was a ring in a box.
After you left, it was gone.

234
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:21,315
You think I stole some ring?

235
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,694
Just save yourself the time
and confess.

236
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:29,197
Who are you, the Hardy Boys?

237
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:36,204
I don't need to steal a stupid ring.
I make $1,600 a week.

238
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:39,291
Any of you guys make that?

239
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,711
Marry me.

240
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,258
It was in my room all night.
She didn't take it.

241
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:53,139
I didn't take it.
You didn't take it. Then who did?

242
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,768
We're trying to think.

243
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,699
I don't get how you know
it's false labor.

244
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,911
Do you see any babies?

245
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,455
How do you feel?

246
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,373
Okay, I guess.

247
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,292
I don't know.

248
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:25,755
I know it's going
to be over soon so...

249
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,548
But isn't that a good thing?

250
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,428
- You said you were sick of this.
- I know.

251
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,431
Usually, when you're done
with the pregnant thing...

252
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,476
...you get to do the mom thing.

253
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:46,317
But I'll be sitting around in my
leather pants, drinking tequila.

254
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,820
Some moms do that.

255
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,864
That's even sadder.

256
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:57,078
Look, I know what I got myself into.

257
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:01,873
It's just that
now that they're in me...

258
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:06,211
...it's like I know them and...

259
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:10,757
It just won't be easy
when these babies have to go away.

260
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,968
I know, sweetie.

261
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,637
But it's not like
you won't have anything.

262
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:20,476
You'll have nieces and nephews.
That's even better.

263
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,853
No, really.

264
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,274
You won't be the one
worrying about saving for college.

265
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,860
Or yelling at them when they're bad.

266
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,490
Or putting them on Ritalin
when they just won't calm down.

267
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:41,038
You'll be the one they run away to.
The one they talk to about sex.

268
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,958
You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.

269
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,379
Cool Aunt Phoebe.

270
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:51,173
I am pretty cool.

271
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:56,678
And you know what else?
Are they going to love you!

272
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:00,099
They are going to love me.

273
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,810
Thanks, you guys. Again.

274
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,605
Oh, sweetie.

275
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,400
What?

276
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,236
Just kidding.

277
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,487
Oh, my God!

278
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,074
Got you again.
You're so easy!

279
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,286
If anything happens to him...

280
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,457
The vet said
it's a simple procedure.

281
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,751
Things can go wrong.
What if he doesn't make it?

282
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:28,835
He will, Joe.

283
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,589
But what if he doesn't?

284
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,801
He's such a good duck.

285
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,590
I'm so worried about him!

286
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,885
Somebody lose a ring?

287
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:23,140
Oh, my God!
Thank you! Thank you so much!

288
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,602
How's the duck?

289
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:29,521
Just fine.
You'll see him in a bit.

290
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:30,772
Great.

291
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,775
Thanks for being so cool.

292
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,276
No, that's all right.

293
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:39,114
You made me your best man
and I totally let you down.

294
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,449
- It's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.

295
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,452
You wouldn't have lost it.

296
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:48,040
Ross, you were right.
He should be your best man.

297
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,251
- No, you should.
- Don't argue.

298
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:54,839
I get to choose my best man.

299
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:58,384
I want both you guys.

300
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,719
Really?

301
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,972
Both you guys should be
up there with me.

302
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:07,184
You two are my...

303
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:12,147
I'm lucky to have just one good...

304
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:15,859
Thanks, man.

305
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:20,530
I got to go check something, okay?

306
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:27,704
- What a baby!
- Total wuss.
