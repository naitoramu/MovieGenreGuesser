1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,599
Brain teaser.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,699
I have two coins totaling 15 cents.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,734
One of them is not a nickel.
What are they?

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:11,999
A dime and a nickel.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,834
No, I said one of them is not a nickel--

6
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:14,851
But the other one is.

7
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:16,299
I've heard that before.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,834
Okay, a man and his
son get into a car accident.

9
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:21,434
They are rushed to the hospital.

10
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:22,090
The doctor says,

11
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:24,133
"There's no way I
can operate on this boy."

12
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:25,190
"Because he's my son."

13
00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:27,193
The doctor is the boy's mother.

14
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:29,420
A man is found hanging from the ceiling.

15
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:31,133
He stepped on a block of ice,
hung himself,

16
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:33,292
and the ice melted.

17
00:00:33,308 --> 00:00:33,890
A hunter...

18
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:35,723
It's a polar bear because
you're at the North Pole.

19
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:36,800
Damn it!

20
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:03,311
Episode 5
"Initiation"

21
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,880
The catch 22 team
Raceman

22
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:08,810
www.theofficeus.fr
www.1000fr.com present

23
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,852
Tell me what you did yesterday.

24
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,153
Uh, nothing.

25
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:15,692
Nothing? Yeah, nothing.

26
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:16,792
How was your day?

27
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:18,903
I don't care how your day was, Michael.

28
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:20,491
Wow.

29
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:22,093
Well, okay.

30
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:24,241
I don't care how your
day was either, Jan.

31
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:26,433
I was just asking you
because you asked me.

32
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:28,150
Tell me what you did yesterday.

33
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,770
I worked.

34
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,400
And then I went home to my condo.

35
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:33,822
And Carol came over.

36
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:37,390
And we had sex.

37
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:38,491
Is that what you want to hear?

38
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:41,791
Never, ever, ever sleep with your boss.

39
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:43,260
I'm so lucky that Jan and I

40
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:45,392
only got to second base.

41
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:45,992
Hi, Pam.

42
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:47,991
Hi. I'm great.

43
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:49,681
So, Pam, I'd like you to keep

44
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:51,883
a log of everything
Michael does hour by hour

45
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:54,093
so that we can analyze
it at corporate, okay?

46
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:55,761
- Oh, I don't know...
- Thanks, Pam.

47
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:58,193
It's weird.

48
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:00,811
Jan used to treat Michael
like he was a 10-year-old.

49
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:03,893
But lately it's like he's five.

50
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,692
So, are you excited?

51
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:07,591
Yeah.

52
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:09,490
Very excited?

53
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,893
Yes, I'm very excited.

54
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:14,591
Extremely excited?

55
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:17,441
Just very. That's cool.

56
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:19,580
I have spent a year here.

57
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:24,361
And I have to commit or get out, so...

58
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:26,293
Dwight's the top salesman
in the company,

59
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:28,981
and he's taking me
on my first sales call today.

60
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:31,693
And, I'm excited.

61
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:35,533
I am very excited.
Ryan hasn't made a sale yet.

62
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:39,020
But more importantly,
he hasn't made an ally yet.

63
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:42,502
Is he gonna be a slacker-
loser-wise-ass like Jim was,

64
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:45,953
or is he gonna join the
Dwight Army of Champions?

65
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:47,933
So, what if they're not talking much?

66
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:51,093
Then does it make sense
to kind of lead the conversation?

67
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:53,402
You know, just until it
gets to a point where

68
00:02:53,536 --> 00:02:55,412
they are asking questions?

69
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:05,273
So, where's the sales office?

70
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:07,972
When you are ready
to see the sales office,

71
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:10,881
the sales office will
present itself to you.

72
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:14,172
Your journey begins now.

73
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:22,192
Hey.

74
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:23,600
What?

75
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:26,020
My chair's squeaking.

76
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:27,411
Is it?

77
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:29,131
You took my chair.

78
00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:30,930
No, I didn't.

79
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:32,740
I took back the chair
that you took from me.

80
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,351
But I didn't take your chair.

81
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:37,380
When you get up, I'm just
gonna take it back anyway, so...

82
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,353
So I guess I can't get up.

83
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:57,983
Hey, Coselli!

84
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,231
The Coz! The Cosby.

85
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:01,992
Hey, hey, hey!

86
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,332
I love Jell-O Pudding Pops!

87
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:08,690
<i>My  son Theo love
Jell-O Pudding Pops too.</i>

88
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:11,751
Do you know where we are, Temp?

89
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:13,621
I know where we're not.

90
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,892
I hold in my hand a beet seed.

91
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:18,400
Take it.

92
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:22,161
When you...

93
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,240
Damn it.

94
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:31,182
Hey, Big Tuna.
Can I talk to you for a second ?

95
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:32,352
Sure.

96
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:33,533
Can you stand up

97
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,320
and talk to me over there?

98
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:40,990
That's it?

99
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,791
That's what you came up with?

100
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:44,481
I'm acting my heart out here.

101
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,562
Really, huh? Yeah, really.

102
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:49,812
You asked for my help, so I helped.

103
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:56,681
<i>Attention, Scranton Business Park.</i>

104
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:58,291
<i>There will be complimentary pretzels</i>

105
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:00,843
<i>available in the
lobby from now until 4:00</i>

106
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,643
<i>as a thank-you to our loyal tenants.</i>

107
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:12,530
Once a year, they bring
in a little cart.

108
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:14,390
And they give away free pretzels.

109
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:16,293
It's really not a big deal.

110
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:19,293
To  some people it is.

111
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:22,391
Productivity is important.
But how can I be productive

112
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:24,331
if I have this one little
thing in my brain

113
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:25,991
that I cannot get out? 

114
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:28,271
And that one little
thing is a soft pretzel.

115
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,370
So I'm just gonna have my soft pretzel.

116
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:32,483
And I'll get to work.
And I'll be super productive.

117
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,330
Look at for me.

118
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:36,653
Oh, sh...

119
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:39,803
Come on.

120
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,650
And just as you have
planted your seed in the ground,

121
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:55,680
I am going to plant my seed in you.

122
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,533
I don't think you
know what you're saying.

123
00:05:57,605 --> 00:05:59,240
Smells  pretty bad, doesn't it?

124
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:00,412
Uh-huh.

125
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,251
It's called bullcrap.

126
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:05,420
And a client can
smell it from a mile away.

127
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,192
- Gotcha.
- Oh, hey...

128
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:09,023
I forgot something in my car.

129
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,412
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

130
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:27,931
Of course.

131
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:33,353
I wake up every morning
in a bed that's too small.

132
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,860
Drive my daughter to
a school that's too expensive.

133
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:39,470
And then I go to work to a job
for which I get paid too little.

134
00:06:39,576 --> 00:06:42,062
But on pretzel day...

135
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:44,692
Well, I like pretzel day.

136
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:46,682
Cause they're acting
all tough and everything.

137
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:48,572
But what they were rapping
about was cupcakes

138
00:06:48,636 --> 00:06:50,592
and The Chronicles of Narnia.

139
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:51,933
Who invented cupcakes, right?

140
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:54,212
I want to kill them.
Hey! Hey, Phyllis !

141
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:55,472
What are you doing?

142
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:56,990
I'm just saying hi to Bob.

143
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:58,730
No, I think you're cutting in line.

144
00:06:58,732 --> 00:06:59,493
Well, settle down, Scott.

145
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:01,090
- No, I'm not gonna settle down.
- No, no way.

146
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:02,873
Uh-uh, boo! Get in the back, please.

147
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,652
- Boo! Back of the line!
- Thank you!

148
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:10,813
That's right.

149
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:12,592
What a pair of Marys.

150
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:14,112
This is pretzel day.

151
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,540
"Hey, Dwight, you're a great salesman.

152
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:16,592
Can you teach me?"

153
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:17,393
Sure, Ryan.

154
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:18,980
I'll make you kneel in cow manure.

155
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:20,532
And I'll abandon you in a beet field."

156
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:22,472
Oh, that sounds great, Dwight.

157
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:23,793
"I really appreciate that.

158
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:27,462
Thank you so much for your mentorship."

159
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:34,293
Congratulations, resourceful salesman.

160
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:37,092
You have passed the second challenge.

161
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:40,991
Welcome to Schrute Farm!

162
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:51,542
"Love me, love me"

163
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,970
"Say that you love me"

164
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:56,031
- "Fool me, fool me"
- Stop.

165
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:58,373
"Go on and fool me"

166
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:00,391
"Love me, love me"

167
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:02,232
- "Say that you love me"
- This is not fair.

168
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:04,610
It's gonna be in my head all day.
Please?

169
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:06,823
- "Go on and fool me"

170
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:08,291
"Love me, love me"

171
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:09,952
This is not a proportionate response.

172
00:08:10,078 --> 00:08:11,553
"Say that you love me"

173
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,420
"Fool me, fool me"

174
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,890
"Go on and fool me"

175
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:21,591
"I don't care 'bout anything but you"

176
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:26,340
Whatever happened to those guys?

177
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,610
- Michael.
- No cuts!

178
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:34,550
Pam.
Just the woman I'd like to see.

179
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:36,091
- You read my mind.
- Great.

180
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:37,701
I thought you might
want to use this time

181
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:39,102
to authorize some checks.

182
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,193
I thought that maybe you could

183
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:42,193
wait in line for me
while I go to the bathroom.

184
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:42,902
You're an angel.

185
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,190
Hey, why don't you
just go up to your office,

186
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:45,991
get some work done,

187
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:47,172
and I'll bring you a pretzel?

188
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:48,733
Because I like them a certain way.

189
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:49,910
And if it gets screwed up,

190
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,591
then this whole thing's blown.

191
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:53,730
You know, I just think
it's really important that

192
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,292
you be productive today.

193
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:59,390
Pam, productivity starts with
patience and determination.

194
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,473
I ll be back..

195
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:11,093
It is time for your next test.

196
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:12,990
You have planted the beet seed.

197
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:16,131
You have walked the long,
lonely walk of loneliness.

198
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:18,200
Look, man.
I was in a frat in college.

199
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:19,831
So I know what you're doing.

200
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:20,691
I get it.

201
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:22,093
You know what your problem is?

202
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,892
You know why you haven't made any sales?

203
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:25,393
Because you think you know everything.

204
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:27,982
You have to trust that maybe
there are other people

205
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:29,990
that can teach you things.

206
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:32,192
Are you ready to learn?

207
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:35,693
Are you ready for the final test?

208
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:37,422
- Yeah.
- Come on!

209
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,390
Thank you.

210
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,382
Hi, please tell me you have
a sweet pretzel left.

211
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:45,993
- We do.
- Thank God.

212
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:47,390
And we have 18 different toppings.

213
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,232
We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar,

214
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:50,492
chocolate, white chocolate,

215
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,631
fudge, M&Ms, caramel dip,
mint chip, chocolate chip,

216
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,391
marshmallows, nuts,
toffee nuts, coconuts,

217
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:58,130
peanut butter drizzle, Oreos,
sprinkles, cotton candy bits,

218
00:09:58,207 --> 00:09:59,590
and powdered sugar.

219
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:02,032
Is there any way that you could do all?

220
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,892
All of them?
The works? You got it.

221
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,101
All right!

222
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:06,511
Thank you.

223
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,662
Please be seated.

224
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:16,612
What was that?

225
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:18,133
Pay no attention to the spirits

226
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:20,401
- that haunt this hallowed ground.
- Is that your cousin Mose?

227
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:22,210
Y es.

228
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,473
Mose is my cousin, and he lives here.

229
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:27,991
He will always be my best friend.

230
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:30,133
Unless things go well with Ryan today.

231
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:32,340
In which case I won't hang
out with Mose so much anymore.

232
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,442
What is the greatest danger
facing Dunder-Mifflin?

233
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:38,933
Outsourcing and consolidation
of competition.

234
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:41,290
Wrong. Flash floods.

235
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:46,030
What is the true cause
of Robert Mifflin's suicide?

236
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:48,693
Depression?

237
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:50,490
Wrong. He hated himself.

238
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:52,940
What is the Dharma Initiative?

239
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:56,000
I can't believe that
Ryan is not back yet.

240
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:57,191
Where could they be?

241
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,632
Sales take a long time.

242
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:00,593
Oh, my God. I'm so worried.

243
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:02,480
I'm sure Dwight will protect him.

244
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:05,192
I don't know. Dwight's so weird.

245
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:06,690
He's not weird.

246
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:08,690
He's just individualistic.

247
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:09,790
No, he's a freak.

248
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:11,662
You're a freak!

249
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,693
Final question,

250
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:21,692
young Ryan Howard.

251
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,053
What...

252
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:29,431
is Michael Scott's greatest fear?

253
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:33,833
Loneliness.

254
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:36,032
Maybe women.

255
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:37,400
Wrong.

256
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:39,690
He's not afraid of anything.

257
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:42,360
Also, I would've accepted snakes.

258
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,391
Fear is what it's all about.

259
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:48,873
You cannot sell while undergoing fear.

260
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,493
You need to vanquish fear!

261
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:56,402
One must wrestle fear to the ground.

262
00:11:56,706 --> 00:11:59,132
You will now wrestle my cousin Mose!

263
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:00,683
No! Okay, all right!

264
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,591
- Wrestle him to the ground!
- This is over, okay?

265
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:04,092
You're a freak.

266
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:05,913
I'm not doing this
anymore and this is over.

267
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:06,822
- Ryan.
- Goodbye.

268
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:07,991
Ryan, you don't have to wrestle him.

269
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,293
Ryan, just get in the coffin.

270
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:14,493
Ryan...

271
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:15,990
Bye, Ryan.

272
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:19,540
He seemed nice.

273
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,053
Where are all the animals?

274
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,733
Ryan, come on. I am sorry.

275
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:29,492
I am sorry.

276
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:30,831
Mose is sorry too.

277
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:31,391
Look!

278
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:34,430
He sent over a basket with eggs

279
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:36,331
and some fat back bacon.

280
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:37,921
And look-
Something he whittled.

281
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:59,203
You still mad? 

282
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,703
It's just...

283
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,393
Jim and I didn't get along.

284
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:10,761
And...I didn't want
it to be that way again.

285
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:13,891
You know, I wanted us to be a team.

286
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,431
An unstoppable team

287
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:19,182
- that competed against other teams.
- Look, that's not what I wanted, okay?

288
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:21,913
I just wanted to go on a sales call.

289
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:24,913
"Screw gun! The sales call!"

290
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:46,912
" Hey"

291
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:50,771
<i>"Hey"</i>

292
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:52,790
Mr. Coselli.

293
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:55,683
Hey, hey, hey!
The Cos! What's going on?

294
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:57,093
Do we have a deal?

295
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:58,690
Deal or no deal?

296
00:13:58,706 --> 00:13:59,762
Let's make a deal.

297
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,521
So what is the deal?

298
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,990
Establish time frames.

299
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:05,150
Keep the phrase
"real dollars" in their heads.

300
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:07,153
And always keep the
power in the conversation.

301
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:09,230
That's why you're losing
them on the cold calls.

302
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:11,493
Because you say the
word "please" too much.

303
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:14,760
- Wait, can you go back?
- Michael always says K-I-S-S.

304
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,232
"Keep it simple, stupid."

305
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:17,592
Great advice.

306
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,792
Hurts my feelings every time.

307
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:22,133
Okay, I'm gonna establish time frames.

308
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:22,490
Good.

309
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:24,320
I'm gonna put everything
in terms of real dollars.

310
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:25,892
- Right.
- I'm gonna ask a lot of questions

311
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,430
that all have sort of positive answers.

312
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:28,990
So they'll say "That would be better" or

313
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,041
- "We would like that."
- Exactly, yes, good.

314
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:32,831
I'm going to try to be confident

315
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:33,672
"but not cocky."

316
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,402
Oh, hey, everyone.

317
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:40,831
I am officially streamlining
the efficiency of this corporation.

318
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:41,813
- Second.
- Second.

319
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:43,890
Yes, second, Toby.

320
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:46,532
Second, I am insisting on
increased accountability

321
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:47,991
from every single one of you.

322
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:49,582
Account. Michael, what's going on?

323
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:51,091
And I will be taking questions.

324
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:52,530
Did you have a lot
of sugar today, Michael?

325
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,332
What's on your suit?

326
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:54,992
Caramel dip.

327
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,531
But one question at a time, please.

328
00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:58,621
Phyllis, Stanley...
I want you to switch desks.

329
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:00,091
I'm going to reorganize

330
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,113
and restructure the physical layout

331
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:04,282
of the office to maximise everything.

332
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,041
I think we're getting maxi
a lot done, don't you?

333
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:07,293
On paper, at least.

334
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,232
And we are, after all, a paper company.

335
00:15:09,236 --> 00:15:10,193
Are we not? Are we not?

336
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:11,290
Are we not? Are you with me?

337
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:13,931
Are you with me? Thank you very much.

338
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:17,632
They really didn't like me.

339
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:18,792
They did not.

340
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:20,892
But they didn't have
to say it to your face.

341
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:22,890
I don't get it.

342
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:24,432
I don't get what I did wrong.

343
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:25,931
Not everything's a lesson, Ryan.

344
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:27,693
Sometimes you just fail.

345
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:29,433
It's those online paper jerks.

346
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:31,133
The whole business is changing.

347
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,081
You know what?
They're gonna be screwed

348
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:34,213
once this whole Internet fad is over.

349
00:15:35,437 --> 00:15:37,231
What are you doing?
Oh, no, no, no!

350
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:40,150
No, no, no! No, Ryan!

351
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,860
Yes! Ryan the Temp, yeah!

352
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:45,491
Come on, come on!

353
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:47,032
Courtesy of Dunder-Mifflin!

354
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:49,191
Oh, come on!

355
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:54,390
Drive! You drive!

356
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:56,431
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.

357
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:58,202
Oh, hi, Jan.

358
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,422
He's, on a sales call.

359
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:03,020
No message?

360
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:06,223
Bye, Jan.

361
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:21,450
Temp! Temp!Temp! Temp!

362
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:27,190
Ryan! Ryan!
Yes!

363
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:30,753
Just think. That temp agency
could've sent you anywhere.

364
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:32,883
I think about that all the time.

365
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:37,873
Good night, Pam. Good night. 

366
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:40,590
Hey, what time is it?

367
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:41,670
5:20.

368
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:42,911
AM or PM?

369
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:43,993
PM.

370
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:45,162
Oh, good.

371
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:46,532
These came for you.

372
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:47,902
Contracts.

373
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:49,190
Brent  Coselli.

374
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,531
Oh, Coselli. With the Jell-O.

375
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:54,353
This is a huge sale.

376
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,163
Yes, right. Good.

377
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:00,613
- Good night, Michael.
- Good night.

378
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:07,632
Dunder-Mifflin.

379
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:08,711
Oh, hey.

380
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,532
Oh, my God.

381
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:12,190
- Hi.
- Hi.

382
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,132
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension.

383
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:16,030
It's a fantasy football thing.

384
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:16,593
Oh.

385
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:18,183
And I was just gonna
go through the system,

386
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:21,291
because I didn't think you'd be there.

387
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,033
Why are you still there?

388
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:25,290
I had to work late.

389
00:17:25,306 --> 00:17:28,830
Jan's making me keep a log
of everything Michael does all day.

390
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:33,293
Wow.

391
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:35,223
Do you think you could send
me a copy of that?

392
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:37,252
Yeah, totally.

393
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:41,742
So...So...

394
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:43,753
- Do you
- Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.

395
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:45,590
- Uh, no-- I, um...

396
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,731
Everything's pretty much the same here.

397
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:48,691
Oh, good.

398
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:50,013
A little different

399
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:53,043
What time is it there?

400
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:56,061
What time is it here?

401
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:59,633
We're in the same time zone.

402
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:01,280
Oh, yeah. Right.

403
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,830
How far away did you think we were?

404
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:05,892
I don't know. It felt far.

405
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,992
Yeah.

406
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,731
- I have a question for you.
- What?

407
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:16,063
How many words per minute
does the average person type?

408
00:18:16,437 --> 00:18:17,450
I type 90.

409
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:18,983
Shut up.

410
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,231
Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.

411
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:22,393
It's true.

412
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:23,930
Okay, I said average.

413
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,790
70?

414
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:26,061
How many do you type?

415
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:28,541
Forget it.
I was just about to brag. Forget it.

416
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:30,593
Come on, tell me. No.

417
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:32,430
You have to tell me now.

418
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:33,600
65.

419
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:36,560
Okay, no need to laugh.

420
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:39,702
No, it's...
That's respectable.

421
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:40,890
Respectable?

422
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:43,451
So, okay, I'm watching the movie.

423
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:46,103
By myself, because I just wanted

424
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,491
a relaxing evening at home.

425
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:49,493
Okay.

426
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:52,033
And I'm freaking out!

427
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:52,490
Yeah.

428
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,790
That movie is so scary.

429
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:58,443
But I'm holding on because I keep
waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.

430
00:18:58,536 --> 00:18:59,790
No way!

431
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:03,330
How do you confuse
28 Days with 28 Days Later?

432
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:06,380
Because I got it at Blockbuster and
they don't put the pictures on the box.

433
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:08,600
No,You're making this up.

434
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:10,722
Would I make that up?

435
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,192
Yes!

436
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,332
Fancy New Beesly would make that up.

437
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:16,752
New apartment, new stories...

438
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,940
Oh, yeah, My fancy new apartment.

439
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:22,530
I have one bedroom,
one bathroom, and a closet.

440
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:23,800
And how many kitchens?

441
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:24,993
I have one kitchen.

442
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:28,311
Wow, you got totally taken
for a ride, Beesly.

443
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,003
It's actually.

444
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:32,381
"Most apartments these
days have, like, three."

445
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:33,530
Three kitchens?

446
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:35,100
Yes.

447
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,583
How are you gonna cook every meal
of the day in one kitchen?

448
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,690
Hey, Ryan. Are you okay?

449
00:19:39,706 --> 00:19:40,390
Pam?

450
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:41,210
Yeah. 

451
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:42,853
Yeah.

452
00:19:43,035 --> 00:19:44,210
<i>Pam?</i>

453
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:46,430
Um, okay.

454
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,891
Bye.

455
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:50,030
Oh, yeah. I should probably...

456
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:51,340
Oh, no-- I was,

457
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:52,390
I don't know.

458
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:53,980
-<i>You have to go?</i>
- Yeah.

459
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:55,432
No, I should probably go too.

460
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:56,093
Okay.

461
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:58,062
I mean, yeah.

462
00:19:58,686 --> 00:19:59,492
Yeah.

463
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,931
Bye, Pam.

464
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:05,882
Bye, Jim.

465
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:37,702
364 days... Until the next pretzel day.
