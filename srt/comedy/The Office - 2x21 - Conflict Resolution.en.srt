1
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:08,841
So, you found a band yet
for your wedding ?

2
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:12,643
'Cause I'm in a band.
We really rock.

3
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:14,294
Yeah, I mean, it's inevitable.

4
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:17,380
I definitely overhear some wedding
preparation, but I'm fine with it.

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,437
She hears me arranging
my social life...

6
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:24,194
and we both have to hear Dwight
order deer urine over the internet,

7
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,744
so it evens out.

8
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:27,597
So I got the Save The Date.

9
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:29,121
- Yeah ?
- Yeah, pretty stationary.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,100
- Oh, thanks.
- I didn't get mine yet.

11
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:38,495
There are a few people
I decided not to invite.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,122
And that might make things
kind of awkward, but...

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,014
it's my wedding.

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,129
And I don't want anyone there
who has called me a hussy.

15
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,293

18
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:25,235
Yes, thanks. Fantastic Sam's.
Adult cut plus.

19
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,065
Comes with a shampoo and blow dry.

20
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,622
We're doing I.D. photos today.

21
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:31,901
Gotta represent.

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,364
On or off ?

23
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:35,748
Off.

24
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:39,391
What is on your face ?

25
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:41,184
Is that a disguise ?

26
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,307
Excuse me.

27
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:45,852
Clown paint.

28
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,849
I.D. badges are long overdue.

29
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,891
Security in this office park
is a joke.

30
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:53,632
Last year I came to work with
my spud gun in a duffel bag.

31
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,037
I sat at my desk all day

32
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:59,389
with a rifle that shoots potatoes
at 60 pounds per square inch.

33
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:02,298
Can you imagine if I was deranged ?

34
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:04,315
That's a nice tie.

35
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:09,172
Thank you. That is...

36
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:11,096
- who makes that ?
- I don't know.

37
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:13,032
Do you mind if I wear that
for the photo ?

38
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,527
Let's... let's keep our clothes.

39
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:18,951
<i>It's like child abuse!</i>

40
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:23,502
<i>I say, if Jesus saw that,
he'd freak out!</i>

41
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:25,027
<i>He'd freak out, Toby.</i>

42
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:27,616
<i>I mean, on so many levels!
And I'm supposed to work there!</i>

43
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:30,326
- I'm supposed to...
- What's the deal... e... o ?

44
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:32,144
Just letting Oscar vent a little.

45
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,959
We would use the break room,
but the photographer's back there.

46
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:36,607
- What's the problem ?
- Angela.

47
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,642
It's just a little dispute over
a poster in their workspace.

48
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:43,352
- Since Christmas.
- So what, you're having a little spat ?

49
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:45,100
I forget, are you guys dating ?

50
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:49,076
Michael, can I talk to you
for a second, please ?

51
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:52,556
Here's how I usually handle this.
All I do is listen.

52
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:55,353
You know, these things just have
a way of working themselves out.

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,208
It's like if you write someone
a letter when you're really angry.

54
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,449
They say to keep it in your drawer
for a couple days,

55
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,232
and then you just never
end up sending it.

56
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,191
What do you know about
conflict resolution ?

57
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,819
Your answer to everything
is to get divorced, so...

58
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,520
- Okay.
- Okay, what ?

59
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:10,725
That was a right decision
for me and my marriage.

60
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:13,036
Well, that's not gonna fly here
because in this office

61
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,502
it is till death do us part.

62
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,379
Assuming that we don't get
downsized.

63
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,665
Pam,

64
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:21,255
would you get Angela and meet us
in the conference room, please ?

65
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:24,211
A Mediator's Toolchest.

66
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,248
Okay, well, before we get started,
you should know

67
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:34,002
that there are five
different styles of conflict.

68
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:38,161
My Shaolin Temple style
defeats your Monkey Style.

69
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:40,428
Can we go ?
I have a lot of work to do.

70
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:41,566
This is important.

71
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,463
- The first style is "lose-lose".
- What's the next one ?

72
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:47,358
Just, hold on, please.

73
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:51,733
Okay, if we do lose-lose,
neither of you gets what you want.

74
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:55,088
Do you understand ?

75
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:58,737
You... you would both lose.

76
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,118
Now, I need to ask you,

77
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:04,637
do you want to pursue
a lose-lose negotiation ?

78
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:08,944
Can we just skip to whatever
number five is ? Win-win or whatever ?

79
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:14,246
Win-win, is number four,
and number five is win-win-win.

80
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,005
The important difference here is
with win-win-win, we all win.

81
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:23,169
Me too. I win for having successfully
mediated a conflict at work.

82
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,652
Okay, so this is the disputed poster.

83
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,426
Now, one at a time,
I want you to express your feelings

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,980
using "I" emotion language and
no judging, or "you" statements.

85
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:43,039
I got this poster for Christmas, and
I feel I want to see it every day.

86
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:46,075
It makes me feel like the babies
are the true artists,

87
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:48,351
and God has a really
cute sense of humor.

88
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:49,899
Come on, seriously. That ?

89
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,835
I don't like looking at it.

90
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,873
It's creepy and in bad taste,
and it's just offensive to me.

91
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,976
It makes me think of the horrible,
frigid stage mothers

92
00:04:58,024 --> 00:04:59,455
who forced the babies into it.

93
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,778
It's kitsch.
It's the opposite of art.

94
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,032
It destroys art. It destroys souls.

95
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:06,554
This is so much more offensive
to me than hard-core porno.

96
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,701
- I'm talking about the kind...
- Oh my God.

97
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:14,175
Let's see if we can't just brainstorm
and find some creative alternatives

98
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:15,513
- that are win-win.
- Win

99
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,955
Yes. Thank you, Pam.

100
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:22,840
How about, Angela makes the poster
into a t-shirt which Oscar wears.

101
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:26,735
That way he can never see it,
and whenever she looks at Oscar,

102
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,724
she can see it. Win-win-win.

103
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,436
- No.
- That's... no.

104
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,677
Well, brainstorm. Own the solution.

105
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:36,597
- How about I leave it up ?
- How about she takes it down ?

106
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:41,068
How about Angela can keep it up
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

107
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,083
Okay, that is called a compromise.

108
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:47,931
And it is style three,
and it is not ideal.

109
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:51,591
To sum up, win-win,
make the poster into a t-shirt.

110
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:53,992
Win-lose, take the poster down.

111
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:58,109
Compromise, Tuesdays and Thursdays.
And the answer is...

112
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,429
make the poster into a t-shirt.

113
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,719
- Win-win.
- Win.

114
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,021
- Fine.
- But...

115
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:05,886
It is done!

116
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,718
- No, you're all good.
- Great.

117
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:19,012
Hey, Angela.
I didn't have your zip code.

118
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,399
Thanks.

119
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:24,941
<i>It was hand-delivered.</i>

120
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:27,569
but I did get a Save The Date
after all.

121
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:30,337
It's not my taste.

122
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:31,815
You solved it.

123
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,155
We can, throw that one out.

124
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,923
Are those all the other complaints ?

125
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,683
I would like to see those please.

126
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:44,079
- I can't do that.
- You can't do that, huh ?

127
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,868
Now you and I have a conflict.

128
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,991
I order you to give me that file.

129
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:51,129
That...

130
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:57,201
There! No more conflict.

131
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,579
I had to use the win-lose on that.
It was not pretty.

132
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,233
All right. Is that it ?

133
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:10,290
It's all Dwight's.

134
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,892
Every Friday at 4:00,  I have
a standing appointment with Dwight

135
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:16,497
for him to file a grievance
against Jim.

136
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:19,441
<i>I tell him that I'm sending them
to a special file in New York.</i>

137
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:22,456
That box is the special file
in New York.

138
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:25,423
Oh, God. All right.

139
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,520
Why do I have to do everything ?

140
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:28,670
Are you sure ?

141
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:30,500
Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.

142
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:35,923
This, is from Kevin.

143
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,372
He says Stanley uses his
Miracle Whip without asking.

144
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:43,325
Meredith complains that everyone
talks too loud in the morning

145
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:45,273
and the lights are too bright.

146
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:47,080
Creed...

147
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,889
Creed is sick of looking
at the redhead all day

148
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,892
and wants a seat
facing the receptionist.

149
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,288
Nice.

150
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,358
You will notice that not one
of these complaints is against me.

151
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:04,182
Actually, I have a separate folder
for complaints against Michael.

152
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,109
This is January through March
of this year.

153
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:16,251
How many of you have at one time

154
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:19,172
gone to Toby to complain
about another employee ?

155
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:24,839
And, did you get what you wanted,
or were you merely listened to,

156
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,561
you forget about your problem,
and you move on ?

157
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:32,625
That is outrageous!
I love this place...

158
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:36,824
and it pains me to see
all of the negativity...

159
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:38,502
festering...

160
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:44,842
Today we are going to get
everything out of these files

161
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:47,188
and into the open,
where it can be resolved.

162
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,304
All right, how about
the Phyllis-Angela dispute ?

163
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,060
- You already did me.
- That's what she said.

164
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:58,412
The thing is, Angela,
you are in here an awful lot.

165
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,653
You have complained about
everybody in the office,

166
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,550
except Dwight, which is odd

167
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:05,658
because  everyone else
has had run in with Dwight.

168
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:07,746
Toby, by the way,
what does "redacted" mean ?

169
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:10,878
There is a file full of complaints
in here marked "redacted."

170
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:14,037
It just means whoever complained
came to me later and withdrew it,

171
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:15,550
so I took their name off.

172
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:19,386
There were a bunch of complaints
about Dwight

173
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,943
that were put in the redacted file
about six months ago.

174
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:24,172
Wait! If someone has
a problem with me,

175
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:26,261
why would they withdraw it
six months ago ?

176
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:33,073
Let's move on. I volunteer.

177
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:34,927
Did anyone have a problem with me ?

178
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:37,601
All right, Pamela. Come on down!

179
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:43,047
Let's do it. And... okay.
Just one complaint.

180
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,252
Actually, it has been withdrawn.

181
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,941
So that is no help to us. Next.

182
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:48,337
Wait, what did it say ?

183
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,270
"Does she have to plan her wedding
on office time ?"

184
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,981
"Shouldn't she do that at home ?"

185
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,054
Who else ?

186
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:59,585
Why don't we just warm up first ?
Warm up emotionally, all right ?

187
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:01,873
<i>I have this kind of big secret
about Angela.</i>

188
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:05,283
And I've been really nice to her
and I haven't told anyone, and...

189
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,547
what the hell ?!

190
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:10,058
Here is a Kelly complaint.

191
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:13,565
"Ryan never returns my calls."
Ah, join the club.

192
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,385
My voice mail's real spotty...
sometimes.

193
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:19,403
I didn't file a complaint.
I was just talking.

194
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:20,901
To your HR representative.

195
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,434
To my friend, I thought.
I want that withdrawn.

196
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:27,164
Fine, I'll take your name off.
So no one will know.

197
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,186
Making progress.

198
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,544
- Dwight tried to kiss me.
- What ?

199
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:35,673
And I didn't tell anyone 'cause I'm
not really sure how I feel about it.

200
00:10:35,732 --> 00:10:37,433
That is not true.
Redact it. Redact it!

201
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,544
Well, I'm not actually making
a formal complaint.

202
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,456
I just really think
we should talk about it.

203
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,227
Okay, question.
When a name is withdrawn,

204
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:46,473
does that also apply to the permanent
misbehavior file in New York ?

205
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:48,382
Sure.

206
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:50,927
Stanley.

207
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,713
Thanks for ratting me out.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,021
I didn't do it.

209
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:56,352
I find that hard to believe

210
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,718
considering you have problems
with every single person

211
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,852
in this entire office
except Bobblehead Joe.

212
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:07,994
Someone complained that
the men's room is "whites only".

213
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:09,812
Stanley, you know that's not true.

214
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:11,266
I didn't say that.

215
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,964
Then why is there a picture
of a white man on the door ?

216
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:22,179
Okay, Phyllis. You complained
that Angela is giving you dirty looks.

217
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:24,666
And you tried to get off
the party planning committee.

218
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,845
No, I never said any such thing.
Angela and I are close.

219
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:32,065
And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says
that you cry too much,

220
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,227
and that bugs him.

221
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,904
Stanley and I are close too.

222
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:37,238
- We sit close.
- O... kay.

223
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,440
Just take it.

224
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:45,053
I can't believe Angela.

225
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:48,303
I went against my better judgment,
and I gave her a Save The Date.

226
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:50,678
And now it turns out
she complained about me to Toby.

227
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:52,133
Well, it was redacted.

228
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:56,567
Look, if she wants an invite,
maybe she's just trying to be friends.

229
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:58,315
Don't take her side.

230
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:02,679
Well, what does Roy
think about everything ?

231
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:05,327
I don't know. I try not to bother him
about this kind of stuff.

232
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:07,533
You mean like your thoughts
and your feelings ?

233
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,152
I know you keep
saying it's your space,

234
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,875
even though there's no assigned
parking, but I keep forgetting.

235
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,810
- Yes, that's the problem.
- I guess so.

236
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:18,983
Okay, well, all settled then.

237
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:22,815
I don't like you.

238
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:29,360
Okay, Ryan, you told Toby that
Creed has a distinct old man smell ?

239
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:33,474
I know exactly
what he's talking about.

240
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,665
I sprout mung beans on a damp
paper towel in my desk drawer.

241
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:39,773
Very nutritious.
But they smell like death.

242
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,165
All right, Kevin. You are accused of

243
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,781
making sexually suggestive
remarks to Angela

244
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:46,986
that made her feel uncomfortable.

245
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:48,335
Solution.

246
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,889
Angela, you are to make
sexually suggestive remarks

247
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:52,824
to Kevin that will make him
uncomfortable.

248
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:54,162
I accept your decision.

249
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:57,865
You know what, Dwight ?

250
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,035
Maybe we should get our photo I.D.
taken together.

251
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,373
That doesn't make any sense.

252
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:02,768
Well, it saves time, you know.

253
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:05,290
'Cause we could just meet
in the parking lot every morning.

254
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,980
Walk in together. Perfect.

255
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,368
- Smile.
- No.

256
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:10,972
I never smile if I can help it.

257
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:13,729
Showing one's teeth is a
submission signal in primates.

258
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,465
When someone smiles at me,

259
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:18,292
all I see is a chimpanzee
begging for its life.

260
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,494
This came out really well.

261
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,981
There you go.

262
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:30,901
This is humongous.

263
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,496
am not a security threat.

264
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,649
And my middle name is Kurt. Not Fart.

265
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,138
What did I write ?

266
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,424
I have another complaint
for Jim's permanent file.

267
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:46,406
Talk to Michael.
I gave him the box.

268
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:48,623
What box ?

269
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:54,132
- But I didn't report your snoring...
- Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays...

270
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,869
Four years of malfeasance
unreported. This cannot stand.

271
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,623
- Okay. Calm down.
- No! You calm down.

272
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,711
Whose side is Toby on ?
Whose side are you on ?!

273
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:08,732
- Him or me ?
- Stop.

274
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:10,913
Him or me ?
I cannot work with Jim anymore.

275
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,675
- Either he goes, or I go.
- Dwight...

276
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:13,731
- You choose!
- Stop...

277
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,901
One of us is out of here
by the end of today.

278
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:23,762
I am not bluffing!

279
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,050
Do the right thing here, Michael.

280
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,419
Okay, I have served you
loyally for years.

281
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:30,624
I deserve this, you know I do!

282
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:35,469
You know your I.D. says
you're a security threat ?

283
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:37,674
You have 'till 5:00.

284
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:46,961
Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales
manager position open in Stamford.

285
00:14:48,064 --> 00:14:50,785
Want me to call Jan
and tell her you're interested ?

286
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:54,457
I could put in a good word for you.
'Cause I'll still be working here.

287
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,388
Transfer, transfer, everybody.
Transfer, transfer, transfer!

288
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:03,754
You two, in the conference room,
with me.

289
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:07,103
Nobody leaves until
we work this out.

290
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,719
Cage match.

291
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:12,640
Cage matches ? Yeah, they work.
How could they not work ?

292
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:15,772
If they didn't work, everybody
would still be in the cage.

293
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:17,949
Okay, so, Dwight, in your own words.

294
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:20,799
"Someone replaced all my pens
and pencils with crayons."

295
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:22,665
"I suspect Jim Halpert."

296
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,827
"Everyone has called me
Dwayne all day."

297
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:28,071
"I think Jim Halpert paid them to."

298
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,159
Yes, five bucks each.
And it was totally worth it.

299
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:36,630
"This morning I found a bloody glove
in my desk drawer"

300
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:40,079
"and Jim Halpert tried to convince me
I committed murder."

301
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,332
"I think he may be the real murderer."

302
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,710
"Jim Halpert said there was
an abandoned infant"

303
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:47,020
"in the woman's room.
When I went to save the child,"

304
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:48,721
"I saw Meredith on the can."

305
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,786
Gaaad.

306
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,795
"This morning I knocked myself
in the head with the phone."

307
00:15:58,329 --> 00:15:59,537
That actually took a while.

308
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:02,529
I had to put more an more
nickels into his handset,

309
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:06,837
'till he got used to the weight,
and then I just...took 'em all out.

310
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:10,567
"Everytime I typed my name
it said 'Diapers'."

311
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:14,333
Just a simple macro.

312
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:18,677
You know, these actually don't
sound that funny one after another.

313
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,105
But he does deserve it, though.

314
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,360
"By the end of the day,"

315
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,706
"my desk  was about
two feet closer to the copier."

316
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:29,427
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every
time he went to the bathroom.

317
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:33,228
And that's how I spent
my entire day that day.

318
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,681
The Japanese have this thing
called shiatsu massage

319
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:04,059
where they dig into
your body very hard.

320
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:07,473
And it is very painful.
And apparently, some people throw up.

321
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:10,207
But the next day they feel great.

322
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:13,374
I've never had one.
They sound awful.

323
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,320
Maybe Stamford would be cool.

324
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:26,155
It's a good market.

325
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,595
Higher volume.

326
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:33,688
Maybe we should both go.

327
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,788
I have a girlfriend.

328
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,665
Sure you do, Dwight, sure.

329
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:41,473
Hey, there's like, 300 more of these.

330
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,975
Let's get to them later.

331
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,723
So you're gonna transfer Jim or not ?

332
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:46,729
Maybe, I haven't decided yet.

333
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,798
- Let's get to work.
- I want an answer by tomorrow.

334
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:54,349
Actually, tomorrow's not good.
How about later in the week ?

335
00:17:55,722 --> 00:17:56,965
Fine.

336
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:58,146
Good. Okay.

337
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,967
Wait. How about a group
picture while you're here ?

338
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:09,235
I can't. I only get reimbursed
for the I.D. photos.

339
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,393
Well, that's, what,
a computer camera, right ?

340
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:14,838
- You mean, digital ?
- Yeah, it'll take, like, two seconds.

341
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:17,055
20 bucks.

342
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:21,607
All right. Everybody, come on.
Group photo for the newsletter.

343
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:23,718
You gotta be kidding.

344
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:26,041
Come on, everybody.
Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin,

345
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:28,248
Oscar, andale, let's go.

346
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,852
One, two, three, smile.

347
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,148
- Try to smile.
- We resolved a lot today, everybody.

348
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,251
Think happy thoughts.

349
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,168
Alright, I'm just gonna take it
on three whether you smile or not.

350
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,619
Good, let's check that out.

351
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:44,866
All right. One more.
We'll take one more.

352
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,535
- That'll be another 20.
- What ?

353
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,104
Angela, I want to talk to you
about something.

354
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:50,248
- What ?
- No, Pam, don't.

355
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:53,129
- It's about the Save The Date.
- Pam it wasn't her.

356
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:54,190
What ?

357
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,083
I'm the one who complained
about you.

358
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:01,623
<i>Alright, come on, one more time!</i>

359
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:03,758
I didn't know that Toby
was gonna write it down.

360
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,931
I was just venting.
You know, it was one day.

361
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:07,860
<i>That's terrible.</i>

362
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:10,415
And I took it right back.
It was like...

363
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:13,634
<i>Let's pay Mr...</i>

364
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:14,807
Oh, dear.

365
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,191
<i>Price gouger.</i>

366
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,735
We can do this. Come on, everybody.

367
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,674
All right. Here we go.

368
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,166
<i>It was really hard getting
a good picture of 15 people.</i>

369
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:32,982
<i>He would not give me a discount.</i>

370
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,654
<i>And eight tries added up.</i>

371
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:37,657
One, two...

372
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,278
Didn't say three, did I ?

373
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:41,894
<i>But I'm sort of an expert
at Photoshop.</i>

374
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:43,829
<i>So it turned out fine in the end.</i>

375
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:47,172
<i>When people work together
there is going to be conflict.</i>

376
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,753
<i>You can't outrun your problems.</i>

377
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,421
<i>Hey, Pam, it's Jim. I have
a doctor's appointment in the city.</i>

378
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:55,673
<i>So I probably won't be in
'till the late afternoon.</i>

379
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:57,902
<i>Just thought I'd let you know.
Okay, bye.</i>

380
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:01,902
- Okay, Jan will see you now.
- Oh, thanks.

381
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:07,192
<i>And that is why the idea of a cage
match is so universally appealing.</i>

382
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,973
<i>But here's the thing
about cage matches.</i>

383
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:13,405
<i>Sometimes you have to open the cage.</i>

384
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,414
<i>And that is something that
Toby will never understand.</i>


9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
