1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:03,525
Oh, hey, Kevin.

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:04,545
Nice of you to join us.

3
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:05,712
<i>Where were you?

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,998
My tire blew out 
on the way here, Michael.

5
00:00:08,185 --> 00:00:09,552
I almost died.

6
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:10,632
I went into this skid-

7
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:11,638
Pop quiz.

8
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:12,371
What?

9
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:15,263
- Why is today special day?
- I almost died...

10
00:00:15,263 --> 00:00:16,644
Today is a special day

11
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:19,535
Because I am being honored...

12
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:24,382
As a visiting professor...

13
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:26,870
Special lecturer emeritus...

14
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,263
How did you- 
How did you put it?

15
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:29,887
You will be a quest speaker.

16
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:31,796
In my Emerging Enterprises class.

17
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:35,297
In business school, Kevin.

18
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:36,476
Business school

19
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:38,886
If you bring your boss to class,

20
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:42,321
it automatically bumps you up 
a full letter grade.

21
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:44,113
So...

22
00:00:44,113 --> 00:00:47,914
I'd be stupid not to do it, right?

23
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,419
A boss is like a teacher.

24
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:52,722
And I am like the cool teacher.

25
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:54,516
Like Mr. Handell.

26
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:57,564
Mr. Handell would hang out with us.

27
00:00:57,564 --> 00:00:59,486
And he would tell us awesome jokes.

28
00:00:59,486 --> 00:01:02,583
And he actually hooked up with 
one of the students.

29
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:06,152
Um- and then, 
like 12 other kids came forward.

30
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:08,784
It was in all the papers.

31
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:11,427
Really ruined eighth grade for us.

32
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:30,269

Original Air Date: Feb 15, 2007 (NBC)

34
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:34,524
Here we go.

35
00:01:34,524 --> 00:01:35,283
College road show.

36
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:37,702
Gotta bring our a game,

37
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:40,706
What is the most inspiring thing 
I ever said to you?

38
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:41,798
"Don't be an idiot"

39
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:43,134
Changed my life.

40
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:46,339
Whenever I'm about to 
do something, I think,

41
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,112
"Would an idiot do that?"

42
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:50,788
And, if they would, 
I do not do that thing.

43
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,803
- Will they throw their hats, you think?
- What?

44
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,410
A lot times at a school 
or naval academy,

45
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,484
after a rousing speech,

46
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:02,907
the crowd will throw its hats 
high into the air.

47
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:04,929
You... you understand 
nobody's graduating.

48
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:06,237
Yeah, I know, I know.

49
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:06,739
I'm just saying,

50
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:09,242
if they did throw their hats,
I've got a great line for that.

51
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,958
May your hats fly 
as high as your dreams.

52
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,712
Thought it was a pretty good line.

53
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:23,299
it doesn't apply.

54
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,324
I understand. Wow.

55
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:27,670
Relax, spazzy boy.

56
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,927
Sometimes you're such a little spazz!

57
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:30,556
God, I'm driving! 
Quit it!

58
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,147
We have fun

59
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:35,368
I can't wait for your art show tonight.

60
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:36,310
Okay, just so you know,

61
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,743
It's just the students 
from my class in a little studio.

62
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:41,156
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

63
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:42,071
Thanks.

64
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:44,674
<i>I'm really happy 
to be back with Roy.

65
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:47,658
I think it shows maturity.

66
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:49,829
Maturity and dignity.

67
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,564
Is that braggy?

68
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:54,791
I don't mean it to be braggy.

69
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:56,026
Love you.

70
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:56,668
You too.

71
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,091
<i>Pam's with Roy.

72
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:01,236
<i>I'm with Karen.

73
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:04,078
<i>And Brangelina is with Frangelina.

74
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:05,502
Moving on.

75
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,063
I can't believe 
you're back together with Roy.

76
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,593
Oh, yeah.

77
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:12,783
We have such a 
solid foundation, you know.

78
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,486
Oh, my God. 
You're so in love now.

79
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:18,779
Yeah. Oh, you should come to 
my art show, by the way.

80
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,829
Oh, art show.

81
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,336
I mean. It's not a big deal.

82
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,632
But I think a lot of people 
from the office are gonna be there.

83
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,460
Oh, yeah.

84
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,255
Definitely I'll be there, for sure.

85
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:33,759
Campus.

86
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,832
Brings back so many memories...

87
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:38,091
That I would've made.

88
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:40,381
Hey, Frisbee. 
Check that out- oh!

89
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:43,348
<i>What do you say 
we get out Fris on before class, huh?

90
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:52,533
Dude

91
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:02,364
Oh, my God.

92
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,195
Animal stool.

93
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:23,759
Dwight, what are you doing?

94
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,222
Solving a mystery, 
if that's quite all right with you.

95
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:34,715
Come to papa.

96
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:38,718
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

97
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:40,323
What we have here is a bird.

98
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,881
That has been trapped in a vent.

99
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,866
Fortunately, I have found it before-

100
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:46,781
Bat! Bat!

101
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:49,390
Bat! Bat!

102
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,469
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,164
Bat!

104
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:54,916
No, everyone remain calm!

105
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:58,832
There it goes!

106
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:00,930
Good bye!

107
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:09,512
Okay, this is it.

108
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:11,993
Ryan is doing 
my intro right now.

109
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:15,362
Dunder-Mifflin can't compete 
with the modern chains,

110
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:19,099
And management is unwilling 
or unable to adapt.

111
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,820
Their customers are dying off...

112
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:23,700
I can't here 
what he's saying.

113
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,650
But he looks like 
he's really into it.

114
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:37,628
We have a bat in the office.

115
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,349
The simple solution 
would be to open a window.

116
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:43,477
If we had windows 
that could open.

117
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:46,587
Poop is raining 
from the ceilings.

118
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:47,737
Poop!

119
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,489
Okay, thanks.

120
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:53,319
Animal control 
will be here at 6:00

121
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,762
At 6:00?

122
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:56,590
No, that is unacceptable.

123
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,527
Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office.

124
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:00,466
You need to step up and show some leadership.

125
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:02,882
I'm sorry, what did you say?

126
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,340
So weird.

127
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,089
What? What's so weird?

128
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:06,828
The bat.

129
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:08,031
I mean I know 
I felt it bite me.

130
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:09,708
But look. There's no mark.

131
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:12,812
I feel so...

132
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:14,796
Tingly.

133
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:17,588
So strangely powerful.

134
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,816
Oh, well.

135
00:06:25,274 --> 00:06:28,024
And now, 
without further ado,

136
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:31,474
I present the regional manager 
of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton,

137
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,594
Michael Scoot.

138
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:47,219
Hello everyone. I am Michael Scott.

139
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:48,530
<font color=lightblue>Hello, I'm Tom Rollins,

140
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,967
<font color=lightblue>CEO of the Teaching company...

141
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:55,182
And, I'd like to start today

142
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,656
by inspiring you.

143
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,555
May I borrow 
someone's textbook, please?

144
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,364
Thank you.

145
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,392
What have we here?

146
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,100
Oh, economics.

147
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,235
Very very interesting.

148
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:15,896
You cannot learn...

149
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:18,083
from books.

150
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:23,183
Replace these pages...

151
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,155
With life lesson.

152
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:26,257
And then...

153
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:30,345
You will have a book...

154
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:34,190
That is worth 
its weight in gold.

155
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:37,941
I know these are expensive,

156
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,996
But the lesson is priceless.

157
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,394
<i>Good.

158
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:45,447
All right, 
I think you're inspired.

159
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:47,066
Shall we proceed?

160
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,743
There are 
four kinds of business.

161
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:51,122
Tourism.

162
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,365
Food service.

163
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:54,671
Railroads.

164
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,393
And sales.

165
00:07:57,053 --> 00:08:00,320
And hospitals/manufacturing.

166
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,851
And air travel.

167
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:08,510
This is your job, Halpert.

168
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:11,793
What happened?

169
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:13,778
<i>That bread on your desk? 
I just picked it up.

170
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:16,070
It's white-hot.

171
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,770
But, Jim...

172
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,026
This garlic bread is cold.

173
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:20,616
What?

174
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,505
No.

175
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:24,261
It burned me. I-

176
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:27,318
Bizarre.

177
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:30,133
No.

178
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,641
One crisis at a time.

179
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,682
If a vampire bat was in the U.S.,

180
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,393
It would make sense for it 
to come to a "sylvania".

181
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:41,121
Like Penn-sylvania.

182
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:42,472
<i>Now, that doesn't mean

183
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:44,858
<i>that Jim is gonna 
become a vampire.

184
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:48,631
<i>Only that he carries 
the vampiric germ.

185
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:51,340
So... you want to start a business?

186
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,628
How do you start?

187
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,863
What do you need?

188
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:56,198
Well... first of all...

189
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:57,066
You need a building.

190
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:00,938
And, secondly, 
you need supply.

191
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:03,084
You need something to sell.

192
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,712
Now, this could be anything.

193
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,144
It could be a "thingamajig"

194
00:09:09,144 --> 00:09:11,503
Or a "whosi-whatsi".

195
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:15,237
Or... a "whatchamacallit"

196
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:19,944
Now, you need to sell those

197
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:24,167
in order to have 
a "PayDay"

198
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:28,822
And, if you sell 
enough of them,

199
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:33,348
You will make 
a "100 grand"

200
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:37,620
"Satisfied?"

201
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,478
Oh, this looks great.

202
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,670
I'd love to be there.

203
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,366
But my daughter's play 
is tonight.

204
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:45,821
Damn it.

205
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:49,452
You know one of the other 
parents will probably videotape it.

206
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:51,892
Oh, no. you should go.

207
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,845
Well, it's important 
to support to local art.

208
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:58,505
And- and what they do 
is not art.

209
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:02,864
Okay, I'm seeing some 
confused faces out there.

210
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:03,752
Let me slow down 
a little bit.

211
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:04,707
Break this down.

212
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:06,399
<i>Okay.

213
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:10,532
The more stickers you sell, 
the more profit...

214
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:12,337
Fancy word for money

215
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:16,604
You have to buy Playstations 
and Beanie Babies.

216
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:17,158
Michael.

217
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,440
- <i>And products!</i> 
- What we normally do here is

218
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,879
More of a question 
and answer type thing.

219
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,678
Well, okay.

220
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:22,041
I was just kind of getting going.

221
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:22,727
Yeah, I know.

222
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:24,301
Um- alright.

223
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:26,401
Okay, well, 
we can do questions. Okay.

224
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,670
<i>Very good. First hand up.

225
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,513
Sir, as a company 
that primarily distributes paper,

226
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,683
How have you adapted 
your business model

227
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:35,622
To function in an increasingly 
paperless world?

228
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:39,019
We can't overestimate 
the value of computers.

229
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,751
Yes, they are great 
for playing games,

230
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:43,917
And forwarding funny emails.

231
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:48,331
But, real business 
is done on paper, okay?

232
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:50,275
Write that down.

233
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:57,650
Hey, Jim. Here's 
the aspirin you wanted.

234
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,587
Oh, thank God.

235
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:01,474
I have such a headache 
from that glare.

236
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:02,489
What glare?

237
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:04,973
The glare of 
Angela's crucifix.

238
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,282
<i>It's blinding.

239
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,931
I don't have a lot of 
experience with vampires,

240
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:11,736
But I have hunted 
werewolves.

241
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:13,262
I shot one once,

242
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,238
But by the time I got to it,

243
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:18,142
It had turned back into 
my neighbor's dog.

244
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:24,877
Extraordinary events

245
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:27,333
Call for extraordinary actions.

246
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,411
- We form an allegiance... 
- Sure.

247
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,746
- To use sudden violence. 
- Okay

248
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:36,690
Do you have the tools to turn 
a wooden mop handle into a stake?

249
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:39,671
What size?

250
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:41,704
What do you say 
to a customer

251
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:43,681
Who wants to leave you 
for the convenience

252
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,451
and savings of 
a nationwide chain?

253
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:47,978
I say, 
"You will miss our service."

254
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:51,042
"And, I absolutely guarantee 
you'll come back."

255
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:52,462
Has anyone ever come back?

256
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:54,498
We don't want them back.

257
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:55,706
They're stupid.

258
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:58,377
How far has your Herfindahl Index 
declined since the merger?

259
00:11:58,377 --> 00:11:59,021
Nice try.

260
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,635
How's your 
Polack-says-what index?

261
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:01,776
What?

262
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:02,943
Thanks, Kowalski.

263
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,032
Can we get back on track here?

264
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:07,245
By your own employee's calculation,

265
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:09,537
You'll be obsolete 
in the next five to ten years.

266
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:13,306
Wait, Ryan said that?

267
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,803
What are you doing?

268
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:27,242
You better not hurt 
that little bat.

269
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:28,873
Animals can't feel pain.

270
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,425
Don't hurt that bat, Creed!

271
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:32,472
It's a living thing 
with feelings and a family.

272
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:33,974
<i>Flush him towards the door.

273
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:36,112
On my go... now!

274
00:12:36,762 --> 00:12:37,347
Bat!

275
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,782
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

276
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:44,236
I...

277
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:45,994
am a hero.

278
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,141
Yeah, sure, 
you know business.

279
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:51,099
Sitting up here

280
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,210
In your ivory tower.

281
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,000
And your ebony tower.

282
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:56,749
But you know what?

283
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,050
I tell you one thing.

284
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,064
Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.

285
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:01,922
<i>But, how can you compete 
against a company

286
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,545
With the resources of 
a nationalwide chain?

287
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:05,860
David will always beat Goliath.

288
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,637
But there's five Goliaths.

289
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:09,589
There's Staples, OfficeMax...

290
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,518
Yeah, You know what else is 
facing five Goliaths?

291
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,969
America.

292
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,830
Al-Qaeda.

293
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,585
Global warming.

294
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,408
Sex predators.

295
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:22,831
Mercury poisoning.

296
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:24,718
So do we just give up?

297
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:26,786
Is that what we're learning 
in business school?

298
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,249
But in the big picture...

299
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:30,379
Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture.

300
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,560
Can't you understand that?

301
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,071
No, you can't.

302
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:34,208
You're too young.

303
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:36,243
Ryan

304
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,728
has never made a sale.

305
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:43,646
And he started a fire

306
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,581
<i>trying to make a cheesy pita.

307
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:48,573
And everybody thinks 
he's a tease.

308
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:50,607
Well, you know what?

309
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:51,980
He doesn't know anything,

310
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,615
and neither do you.

311
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:01,085
So, suck on that!

312
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:25,910
It wasn't personal.

313
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,168
Business is always personal.

314
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:28,780
It's the most personal thing 
in the world.

315
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,309
When we get back to the office, 
pack your thing.

316
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,798
- Pack my... 
- You heard me.

317
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:32,873
Pack your things.

318
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,296
I really wanna come out!

319
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:45,669
Good night, Mary Beth!

320
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:01,700
So, you're cool to just wait here 
for animal control?

321
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:03,384
Animal control?

322
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:06,199
I've been controlling animals 
since I was six.

323
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:09,106
Cool, okay.

324
00:15:09,377 --> 00:15:11,498
I'm gonna go home 
and lie down.

325
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:13,685
Draw the shades.

326
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:15,859
There's just 
so much sun in here.

327
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:22,886
Bye, Dwight.

00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:44,664
Specifically

335
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:47,035
in the kitchen.

336
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:49,487
And it's all 
from the same series.

337
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:50,728
Oh...

338
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:51,924
Called "Impressions,"

339
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,398
Oh...

340
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,289
Not that I would call myself 
an Impressionist, per se.

341
00:15:58,102 --> 00:15:59,846
But maybe one day.

342
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:01,483
I  hope so.

343
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:04,065
I still need, you know

344
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:05,871
my breakthrough 
or whatever.

345
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,364
Hey, babe, how are you?

346
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:13,504
Good.

347
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,355
Look who I brought. 
My brother, huh?

348
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:17,020
- Hey, Kenny 
- Hey, Pam

349
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,555
Hey...

350
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:20,033
How about this, huh?

351
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,006
I show up with my brother,

352
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:24,192
And no one from work is here?

353
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:27,282
That's pretty cool, huh?

354
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:35,435
Magic time.

355
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,907
My hair! Ah- get off!

356
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:47,185
Get off me!

357
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:48,548
Get off me!

358
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:51,411
Hold still, woman!

359
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:53,158
Oh, my God, oh my God!

360
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,680
You're welcome.

361
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:12,078
It's cool if I go, right?

362
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:13,532
I mean, 
I looked at all of them.

363
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:15,664
Yeah, I'll just- 
I'll drive myself home.

364
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:18,443
To my place?

365
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:21,045
Maybe. I'm a little tired.

366
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:25,160
Your art was the prettiest art

367
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,668
Of all the art.

368
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,649
Thank you.

369
00:17:30,328 --> 00:17:31,074
Look...

370
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:34,093
I'm sorry, okay?

371
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:36,143
I was just trying to do 
my presentation.

372
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:39,280
And... of course 
I was wrong to suggest

373
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,133
that Dunder-Mifflin might 
ever go out of business.

374
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:44,245
But you don't have to fire me.

375
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:46,910
Fire you? No, no, no.

376
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:50,753
You are moving to the annex.

377
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,056
To the annex?

378
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:54,418
Where Kelly is?

379
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:55,770
A good manager
doesn't fire people.

380
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,692
He hires people 
and inspires people.

381
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:02,177
People, Ryan.

382
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:07,303
And people will never 
go out of business.

383
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:12,515
You're the one who said 
we needed more culture.

384
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:13,912
This is culture to you?

385
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:15,649
It's her first try.

386
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:17,893
Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try,

387
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,370
he drew the hands of 
the peasants.

388
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,085
Meaning what?

389
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:24,196
Meaning real art 
takes courage, okay?

390
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:25,542
And- and honesty.

391
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,188
Well, those aren't 
Pam's strong points.

392
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:28,034
Yeah, exactly.

393
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:30,689
That's why this is motel art.

394
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,165
Thanks for coming.

395
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:52,773
Pam-casso!

396
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:53,866
Sorry I'm late.

397
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,147
I had to race across town.

398
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:56,111
Oh, Michael.

399
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,165
Wow!

400
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:02,463
You did these freehand?

401
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:03,278
Yep.

402
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,372
My God, 
these could be tracings.

403
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:09,938
Look at this one.

404
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:12,013
Wow!

405
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:13,395
You nailed it.

406
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,159
How much?

407
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:21,151
What do you mean?

408
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:24,297
I don't see a price.

409
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:27,240
Um, you want to buy it?

410
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:28,860
Well, yeah.

411
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:31,199
Yeah, we have to take it 
for the office.

412
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:34,971
I mean, 
there's my window.

413
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:36,478
And, there's my car!

414
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,402
Is that your car?

415
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:46,820
That is our building.

416
00:19:50,094 --> 00:19:52,194
And, we sell paper.

417
00:19:58,178 --> 00:19:59,771
I'm really proud of you.

418
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,331
Thank you.

419
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:14,281
What?

420
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:20,731
Do you have something 
in your pocket?

421
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:24,179
Chunky.

422
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:29,966
Do you want half?

423
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,041
No, thank you.

424
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:36,040
<i>It is a message.

425
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:38,244
<i>It is an inspiration.

426
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:41,927
<i>It is a source of beauty.

427
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,714
And, without paper,

428
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:47,546
It could not have happened.

429
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,863
Unless you had a camera.

430
00:20:54,599 --> 00:21:00,949
Oh, my God, Oh, my God, Oh, my God, Oh, my God

431
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:02,431
It's only temporary, okay?

432
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:03,692
Don't get excited.

433
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:16,232
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't

434
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:20,232
