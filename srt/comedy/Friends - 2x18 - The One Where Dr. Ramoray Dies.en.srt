00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,086
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:05,255
<i>- Oh, Drake.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, Amber.</i>

4
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,843
<i>It's like Brad to have</i>
<i>to have the last word.</i>

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,635
Sorry I'm late.
What happened?

6
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,179
We wanna see the end.

7
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,722
<i>I want you, Drake.</i>

8
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,098
<i>I know you do.</i>

9
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,893
<i>But we can never</i>
<i>be together that way.</i>

10
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:18,977
<i>What?</i>

11
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,313
<i>There's something I never told you.</i>

12
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:25,859
<i>I'm actually your half-brother.</i>

13
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,323
So what happens next?

14
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,868
I get the medical award
for separating the Siamese twins.

15
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:40,415
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela
to meet our other half-brother, Ramon...

16
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,420
...where I find the world's
biggest emerald. It's really big.

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,964
But it's cursed.

18
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,006
So cool!

19
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:51,635
God, that is good TV!

00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,514

22
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,519
Pheebs, play with me!

23
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,104
This game is grotesque!

24
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,358
Twenty armless guys joined
at the waist by a steel bar...

25
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,862
...forced to play soccer forever?

26
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,781
Hello? Human rights violation!

27
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,201
Don't feel so bad.
After playing...

28
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:02,957
...I break out the plastic women
and everybody has a good time.

29
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,710
Why don't you play with your roommate?

30
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,712
He's not a big fan of foosball.

31
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,631
Are we not getting along
with the new boy?

32
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,803
No, he's all right. He spends
most of his time in his room.

33
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,556
That's because you haven't
gotten to know him.

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,598
Let's remedy that, shall we?

35
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,353
- We don't need to.
- It'll be fun!

36
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,607
What was that?

37
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:33,070
I thought it'd be fun if we had
beers and got to know each other.

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,154
All right.

39
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,031
Oh, good! Okay.

40
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,744
Oh, no! I have to go,
because I'm late for...

41
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,623
...my "Green Eggs and Ham"
discussion group.

42
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,376
Tonight, it's "Why he would not
eat them on a train."

43
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,754
- Have fun! Bye!
- That was so lame.

44
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,964
I know.

45
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,093
Okay, talk to him.

46
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:05,101
So you think that "Speed Racer" guy
gets a lot of tickets or...?

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,897
That's good.
So who broke up with who?

48
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,273
I broke up with her.

49
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:15,237
She actually thought Sean Penn
was the capital of Cambodia.

50
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:20,325
When everybody knows that
the capital of Cambodia is...

51
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,203
It's not Sean Penn.

52
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,746
I got a funny one.

53
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:28,501
My last girlfriend, Tilly.
We're eating breakfast, right?

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,086
I made these pancakes.
Like, 50 pancakes.

55
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,381
All of a sudden,
she turns to me and says, "Eddie...

56
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,550
...I don't wanna see you anymore."

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,678
It was literally like she had
reached into my chest...

58
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:44,182
...ripped out my heart
and smeared it all over my life!

59
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,353
There was this incredible abyss
and I'm falling.

60
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:52,858
I keep falling and
I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!

61
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,197
That wasn't such a funny story.

62
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,745
<i>And a crusty old man</i>
<i>Said I'll do what I can</i>

63
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,875
<i>And the rest of the rats</i>
<i>Played maracas</i>

64
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,755
That's it! Thanks! Good night.

65
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,175
Phoebe's got another job, right?

66
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,135
Great set tonight, Pheebs.

67
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,304
I know.

68
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,389
We should get going.

69
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,393
We should too.
I've got patients at 8 in the morning.

70
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,895
You know how we always stay
at your apartment?

71
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,648
I thought tonight
we'd stay at my place.

72
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,610
I don't know.
I don't have my jammies.

73
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,237
You don't need them.

74
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:42,574
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

75
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,411
Shut up. I'm happy.

76
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,206
Oh, this is so nice!
I have to make a speech.

77
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:55,671
Of all the guys that Monica has
been with, and that is a lot...

78
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,091
...I like you the best.

79
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,261
Thank you, Pheebs.
That's very sweet.

80
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,679
You hear that?

81
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:08,976
She likes me best. And apparently,
there have been a lot.

82
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,352
Not a lot.

83
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,606
Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.

84
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,152
Phoebe's dead.

85
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,701
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.

86
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,203
He's not here right now.
I'm Chandler.

87
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,247
Can I take a message or...
Or a fish tank?

88
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,916
Thanks.

89
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,669
Come on in.

90
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,504
I'm Tilly.

91
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,054
I gather by that "Oh",
he told you about me.

92
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,140
Yeah, your name came up...

93
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,020
...in a conversation that
terrified me to my very soul.

94
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,605
He's kind of intense.

95
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,608
Yes! Hey, can I ask you,
is Eddie a little...

96
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,734
A little what?

97
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,070
...bit country?

98
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,950
Come on in, you roomie!

99
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,493
Hello, Tilly.

100
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,371
Eddie, I just came by
to drop off your tank.

101
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,498
That was very thoughtful of you.

102
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,834
It's very thoughtful.

103
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,631
Well, okay then.

104
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,385
I'm gonna go. Bye.

105
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,930
So we getting a fish?

106
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,934
You had sex with her.

107
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,272
Check it out, check it out!

108
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:41,902
"Soap Opera Digest"!
That's one of my favorite digests!

109
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:46,198
Page 42! Page 42!

110
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,410
"New Doc on the Block,
'Days of our Lives' Joey Tribbiani."

111
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,705
Cool picture!

112
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:56,167
Oh, I look good.

113
00:06:56,291 --> 00:07:00,003
Is this true? That you write
a lot of your own lines?

114
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,798
Well, kind of, yeah.

115
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,926
Remember last week
when Alex was in the accident?

116
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,928
The line in the script was...

117
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,640
..."If we don't get this woman
to a hospital, she's going to die."

118
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,851
But I made it, "If this woman
doesn't get to a hospital...

119
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,564
...she's not gonna live."

120
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:23,652
Oh, okay.
I see what you did there.

121
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:30,158
Aren't you afraid the writers will be
kind of mad when they read this?

122
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:36,248
I never thought about the writers.
The scripts just come to my house.

123
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,959
But you know what?

124
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,629
This makes me look good,
which makes the show look good...

125
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,802
...which makes the writers look good.
So how could they be mad?

126
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,053
<i>Makes up most of his lines.</i>

127
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,098
<i>Son of a...</i>

128
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,268
<i>Write this, jerk-weed.</i>

129
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,228
I fall down an elevator shaft?

130
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,398
What does this mean?
I fall down an elevator shaft?

131
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:06,653
I don't know.
I just bring the scripts.

132
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,157
They can't kill me!
I'm Francesca's long-lost son!

133
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,035
Right.

134
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,286
Could you sign?

135
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,414
No! No way! I'm not signing that!

136
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,918
I don't think that will affect
the plot of the show.

137
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,923
How can they do this to me?

138
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,177
All right, I'm just gonna go.

139
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,013
Sorry.

140
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,811
Well, it wasn't that many guys.

141
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:43,107
If you consider how many guys
there actually are...

142
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,693
...it's a very small percentage.

143
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,696
It's not that big a deal.
I was just curious.

144
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,614
- Good night.
- Good night, Richard.

145
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,657
Good luck, Mon.

146
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:58,705
Before I tell you, you tell me
how many women you've been with.

147
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,374
Two.

148
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,669
Two? Two?

149
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,004
How is that possible? I mean...

150
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,884
...have you seen you?

151
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,802
I mean, what can I say?

152
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,223
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,
my high-school sweetheart.

153
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,850
Now you. That's two.

154
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,353
Two it is.

155
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,689
Time for bed.
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

156
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,567
No, wait a minute now!

157
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,527
Come on, it's your turn.

158
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,613
Oh, come on!

159
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:36,786
You know, I don't need the
actual number. Just a ballpark.

160
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:41,623
Okay, it is definitely
less than a ballpark.

161
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,295
I am so glad
I'm not Monica right now.

162
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,214
Tell me about it.

163
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:53,635
So what's your magic number?

164
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:59,516
Come on, you know everyone
I've been with. All both of them.

165
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,352
Well, there's you.

166
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,898
Better not be doing these in order.

167
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,193
Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.

168
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,655
Barry.

169
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:13,823
Paolo.

170
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:18,660
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

171
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,497
Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

172
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:26,335
I'm so much happier with you
than I ever was with him.

173
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,629
- Really?
- Oh, please!

174
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,965
That Paolo thing was
barely a relationship.

175
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:37,346
All it really was
was just meaningless, animal sex.

176
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:45,604
Okay, you know, that sounded
so much better in my head.

177
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,023
I didn't sleep with
your ex-girlfriend.

178
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,568
That's exactly what someone
who slept with her would say.

179
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,904
This is nuts! Crazy!
She came over for two minutes...

180
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,407
...dropped off a fish tank and left!

181
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,826
Where's Buddy?

182
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,119
Buddy?

183
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,621
My fish, Buddy.

184
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,123
There was no fish
when she dropped it off.

185
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,501
This is unbelievable!

186
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,755
You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,
insult my intelligence by lying...

187
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,090
...then you kill my fish?
My Buddy?

188
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,968
I didn't kill your fish!

189
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,555
Look, Eddie...

190
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,892
Would you look at what I'm doing?

191
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,187
Now that can't be smart.

192
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:32,192
So we're just gonna
take this guy right off you...

193
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:36,446
...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

194
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,867
Tangelo?

195
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:52,671
That's it? That's the giant number
you were afraid to tell me?

196
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,965
Well, that's not bad at all.

197
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,094
You had me thinking it was,
like, a fleet.

198
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,345
You're okay with it?

199
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,849
Oh, honey, I'm fine.

200
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,063
Okay, about that two.

201
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,356
What?

202
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,233
All right.

203
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,608
What about my two?

204
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,445
It just seems like
a really small number.

205
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,281
Right.

206
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,952
Don't you have a lot
of wild oats to sow?

207
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:29,166
Or is that what you're doing with me?
Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

208
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,126
Honey, you are not an oat.

209
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:35,130
I don't know, I guess
I'm just not an oat guy.

210
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,716
I've only slept with women I love.

211
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,261
You've only slept with two people.

212
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,226
Right.

213
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,443
You know I love you too, right?

214
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,863
Now I do.

215
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,787
Ross, please listen to me.

216
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,040
You are so much better for me
than Paolo ever was.

217
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,335
You care about me, you're loving,
you make me laugh.

218
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,046
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.

219
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,381
Invite Paolo to have
a romp in the sack...

220
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:23,220
...and I'll stand in the corner
and tell knock-knock jokes!

221
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,183
What we have is special!
All Paolo and I ever had was...

222
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,144
"Animal sex"?

223
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,648
So what are you saying?

224
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,776
There's nothing between us
"animal" at all?

225
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,947
There's not even,
like, a little animal?

226
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,907
Not even, like...

227
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,951
...chipmunk sex?

228
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,915
Try to hear me, okay?

229
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,626
I'm not gonna lie to you.

230
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:59,715
- It was good with Paolo.
- Knock-knock.

231
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,385
But what you and I have
is so much better.

232
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,931
We have tenderness,
we have intimacy, we connect.

233
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,642
You know? I swear.

234
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,977
This is the best...

235
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:16,440
...I have ever had.

236
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,942
Until now.

237
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,618
Richard told me he loved me.

238
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:28,952
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

239
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,496
Honey, that's great!

240
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:31,914
I know!

241
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,832
- I just can't find...
- Top drawer.

242
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:38,295
- Hurry.
- Why? You need one too?

243
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:42,133
Found them!

244
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,763
There's only one.

245
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:54,978
We'll be right there.
We're just trying to decide something.

246
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:16,459
- They're trying to decide something.
- Good. Good, good.

247
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:26,969
So was your mustache...
Did it used to be different?

248
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:37,104
How do you, you know,
keep it so neat?

249
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,940
I have a comb.

250
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,028
- What is that?
- A mustache comb.

251
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,740
Thank you.

252
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,370
Okay, I will do your laundry
for one month.

253
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,998
I will, I will, I will...

254
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,917
I will clean the apartment
for two months.

255
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:04,965
I'll give this to you now, if you
tell me where we keep the dustpan.

256
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:16,352
So were you in Nam?

257
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,982
- Rock, paper, scissors?
- Gotcha.

258
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,984
One, two, three.

259
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,903
Yes!

260
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,824
Fine. Go have sex.

261
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,078
No! You have got it completely wrong!

262
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,164
John Savage was "Deer Hunter",
no legs.

263
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,250
Jon Voight was "Coming Home",
couldn't feel his legs.

264
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:44,630
You've got it totally the other way
around, my friend. Jon Voight...

265
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,217
- Honey?
- What?

266
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,099
Shall we?

267
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,768
It's not gonna happen.

268
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:02,814
They're doing it tonight.
We can do it tomorrow.

269
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:09,070
In the future, if I could see
the schedule beforehand...

270
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,075
So when I woke up this morning...

271
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,703
...he'd stolen all the insoles
out of my shoes!

272
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:17,746
Why?

273
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:21,833
He thinks I slept with his
ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

274
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:25,421
Why would you kill his fish?

275
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,966
Because sometimes
after you sleep with someone...

276
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:34,096
...you have to kill a fish.

277
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,098
Chandler, honey...

278
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,432
...I'm sorry.

279
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,269
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?

280
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,021
Wait. He's not here yet.

281
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,357
He knows what happens.

282
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:49,736
I'm fine about my problem now,
by the way.

283
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,032
<i>Amber...</i>

284
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,659
<i>... I'll always be there for you...</i>

285
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,412
<i>... as a friend and as your brother.</i>

286
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,664
<i>Oh, Drake.</i>

287
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,207
<i>Hard day, huh?</i>

288
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,126
First the medical award, now this?

289
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,672
Some guys are just lucky, I guess.

290
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:13,593
<i>Dr. Ramoray, report to</i>
<i>first floor Emergency stat.</i>

291
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,388
Well, then...

292
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,891
...I guess that's me.

293
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:25,272
Anyone else need to go on the elevator?
Dr. Horton? Dr. Wall?

294
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,984
They only said you.

295
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,279
Oh, okay. All right.

296
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,697
I love you.

297
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,199
Yeah, whatever.

298
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,451
Oh, no!

299
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,579
Drake, look out!

300
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:47,502
- Did they just kill off Joey?
- No!

301
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,673
Now maybe.

302
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,676
Come on! Open up!
We want to talk to you!

303
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,345
I don't feel like talking!

304
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,472
Come on! We care about you.

305
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:04,394
- We're worried about you.
- And some of us really have to pee!

306
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:10,067
I'm sorry, Joey.

307
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:14,530
Listen, sorry about your death.
That really sucks.

308
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,075
- We came over as soon as we saw.
- How could you not tell us?

309
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:23,288
I don't know. I was kind of hoping
no one would ever find out.

310
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:27,376
Well, maybe they could find
a way to bring you back.

311
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:31,964
They said that when they found my body,
my brain was so smashed in...

312
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:37,344
...that the only doctor
who could've saved me was me.

313
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:41,390
It's supposed to be
some kind of irony.

314
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,475
But Joey, you're gonna be fine.

315
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:47,103
You don't need that show.
It was just a dumb soap opera.

316
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,482
This was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

317
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,611
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

318
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:59,492
Here's Monica.
She'll have something nice to say.

319
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:04,163
I straightened out your shower curtain
so you won't get mildew.

320
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,291
What? To me, that's nice.

321
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,793
It'll be okay. You know that.

322
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,754
No, I don't.

323
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:16,300
It's like you work
your whole life for something...

324
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,677
...and you think
that when you get it...

325
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,221
...it'll never be
as good as you thought.

326
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,348
But this so was.

327
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,142
It changed everything.

328
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,604
Like, the other day,
I got this credit card application...

329
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:32,691
...and I was pre-approved!

330
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:37,029
I've never been pre-approved
for anything in my life!

331
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,781
I'm sorry, man.

332
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:42,284
I don't know if this'll mean
anything to you...

333
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:46,204
...but you'll always be
pre-approved with us.

334
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,667
That means nothing to me.

335
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,758
Pecan sandy? Just made them.

336
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,803
Yeah, all right.

337
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:04,098
Are these raisins?

338
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,725
Sure, why not?

339
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,484
Listen, Eddie.

340
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:18,946
I've been thinking about
our living situation.

341
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,322
Why are you smiling?

342
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:24,242
I got a little surprise.
Look. There's a new fishy.

343
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,786
I named him...

344
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:30,123
...Chandler, you know, after you.

345
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:41,551
Well, that's not even a real fish.

346
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:45,806
