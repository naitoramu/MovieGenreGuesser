00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,140
Hello.

2
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,520
Hello.

3
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,313
I love my new job!

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,316
- Honey, you're screaming.
- You bet your ass I am!

5
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,443
I just had the best first day ever!

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,779
The kitchen?
Twice as big as Allessandro's.

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,780
Oh, that's great.

8
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:35,243
And clean? Not just health
department-clean, Monica-clean!

9
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:36,996
Awesome.

10
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,748
Oh, and the people are so nice.

11
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,001
There's this one guy, Jeffrey,
he's the maitre d'.

12
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,336
Chandler, you will love him!

13
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:48,507
He is without a doubt
the funniest guy I have ever met!

14
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,761

17
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,062
- This is nice.
- I know.

18
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,949
- You need both hands for that?
- Yeah, I kind of do.

19
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,160
Well, how's this?

20
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:15,552
Look at you two holding hands.

21
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,805
Is this getting serious?

22
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,808
Have you not talked about it yet?

23
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,563
Am I making you uncomfortable?

24
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,733
If you were bigger you'd hit me.

25
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,864
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,952
It's obviously way too early
for us to be having that conversation.

27
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,287
- Is it?
- Maybe not. Is it?

28
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,540
When I got divorced...

29
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,834
...I didn't think I'd feel this way about
someone for a really long time.

30
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,837
Then again, I didn't think I'd meet
someone like you. And...

31
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:55,091
This may be crazy-soon,
but I want you to have this.

32
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,512
No, not... That's gum.

33
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,059
Oh, five bucks!
I love it when that happens, you know?

34
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,311
- You don't know it's there...
- I know. Keep digging.

35
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,813
Sorry.

36
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,402
It's a key.

37
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,947
To be honest, I think I'd prefer
the five dollars.

38
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,533
- It's to my apartment.
- Wow!

39
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,203
Big step for Phoebe and Mike.

40
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,582
I don't want you to feel like you
have to give me your key...

41
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,501
- No, I want to.
- Thank God.

42
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,591
Wow. I was starting to think
I'd never meet someone that...

43
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,550
...I wanted to do this with.

44
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,137
Here you go.

45
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,015
- This is cool.
- It really is.

46
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:49,897
I know it. It is amazing.
These little things open doors!

47
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,027
So I don't go back to work
for another four weeks...

48
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,155
...but we would like our nanny
to start right away...

49
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,074
...so that Emma could get
a chance to know her.

50
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,409
I think that's really smart.

51
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,953
The easier we can make the
transition for her the better.

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,163
That's great. Great.

53
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,707
- So do you have any questions for us?
- Not really.

54
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,210
All right. Well, thank you
so much for coming.

55
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,962
- Thank you.
- It was really nice to meet you.

56
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,632
- We will call you.
- Oh, you know, wait.

57
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,508
I do have one question.

58
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,636
Do you guys do random drug testing?

59
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,642
Boy, we hadn't really thought of that.

60
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,770
That's cool. But if you do,
I'm gonna need three days' notice.

61
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,397
Okey-dokey!

62
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,650
We're never gonna find a nanny.

63
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,362
Come on, Rach. We will. I promise.
We have more interviews.

64
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,659
Worse comes to worst, we can always
reconsider the first one we met with.

65
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,621
- What, the blond with no bra?
- She was blond?

66
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,250
Just a sec.

67
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,044
Okay, this one's name is Sandy.

68
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:58,048
She's got a degree in
Early Childhood Education.

69
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,719
She worked for her last family
for three years.

70
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,933
Hi. I'm Sandy.

71
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,814
And she's a little mannish.

72
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,906
Oh, my God! David!

73
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:28,370
- Is this a bad time?
- No, it's a great time! Come in!

74
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,664
Wow! Hi!

75
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,418
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?
Are you back from Minsk?

76
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,878
Just for a couple of days.

77
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,630
I'm here to explain to the people
who gave us our grant...

78
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,134
...why it's a positive thing that
we've spent all their money...

79
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:45,054
...and accomplished nothing.

80
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,556
Who cares? It got you here.

81
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,893
It got me to New York.
Then I got in a cab at the airport...

82
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,727
...and the guy said, "Where to?"

83
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,690
I just gave him your address.
I didn't even think about it.

84
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,194
Where's your luggage?

85
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,656
Damn it.

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,242
All right, I'll call the cab company.

87
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:11,497
We can call them later.
Can you just stand there for a moment?

88
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,125
Boy.

89
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,128
There's an old Russian expression
that goes:

90
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,301
Roughly translated, that means:

91
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,721
"This thing that I'm looking at: Wow."

92
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,267
Thank you.

93
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,020
You should see me when...
Actually, no, I look pretty good.

94
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,606
Are you kidding?

95
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,442
You know, when you don't see
someone for a long time...

96
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,070
...you build them up in your head,
you start thinking:

97
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,990
"Come on, don't be crazy,
nobody's that beautiful."

98
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,659
But, well, you are.

99
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,622
Well, so are you seeing anyone?

100
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,709
No.

101
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm just the worst person ever!

102
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,173
How can I not tell David
that I'm seeing Mike?

103
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,967
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.

104
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,595
He said, "Are you seeing someone?"
And I said, "No."

105
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,558
Well, that would've been your window.

106
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,478
I mean, I don't know.
I was looking in his eyes...

107
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:20,232
...and I was just thinking,
"Oh, my God, it's David. David's here."

108
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,818
He's so irresistible.

109
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,321
- Really? The scientist guy?
- Really? Chandler?

110
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,496
Continue.

111
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,832
Then it gets worse...

112
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,084
...because I told him
I would see him tomorrow night.

113
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,712
- Phoebe!
- I know! Evil!

114
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:50,387
I like Mike so much, you know?
It's just going really well. Oh, my God!

115
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,932
Isn't it ironic that David
would show up...

116
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,601
...on the same day that
you and Mike exchange keys?

117
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,482
Yeah. You know, and given
my lifelong search for irony...

118
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,692
...you can imagine how happy I am!

119
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,281
- What are you gonna do?
- I mean, I guess I just have to...

120
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,952
...tell David that nothing
can happen between us.

121
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,413
Unless I don't.

122
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,581
You know, complicated moral situation?

123
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,417
- No right, no wrong?
- You have to tell David.

124
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:24,380
I knew I should've had this conversation
with Joey.

125
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,552
Funniest guy she's ever met.

126
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,803
I'm funny, right?

127
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,515
What do you know? You're a door.

128
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,434
You just like knock-knock jokes.

129
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,523
Save it for inside.

130
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:50,322
So Oklahoma's a crazy place. You know,
they call it the Sooner State.

131
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,950
Frankly, I'd sooner be in any other state!

132
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,538
And what's with Oklahoma
having a panhandle?

133
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,414
Can all states have stuff like that?

134
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,959
Hey, yeah, I'm from the waistband
of Wyoming.

135
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:07,214
But when I was 7,
we headed over to the crotch.

136
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,550
Was your cabin pressurized?

137
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,972
And don't get me started on the way
the people from Tulsa talk.

138
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,932
Okay.

139
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:22,980
What's with the word "y'all"? You know,
just two words just pushed together?

140
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,858
Are we all allowed to do that?
Because if so, I say why stop there?

141
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,237
You know, your new poodle
could be your noodle.

142
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,115
And fried chicken could be fricken.

143
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,201
Waiter? Waiter, excuse me,
I'll have the fricken!

144
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,665
See, that's funny with the fricken, right?

145
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,711
No, it just reminds me of something
this guy did today at work.

146
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,880
I told you about that funny guy, Jeffrey,
right?

147
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,965
Yeah, he came up.

148
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:55,137
Well, he did this bit.
You probably had to be there...

149
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:59,975
...but it was Liza Minnelli locked
in our freezer eating a raw chicken.

150
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:08,317
- Were you there?
- No, but it sounds fricken funny.

151
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,282
I really understand how hard it's gotta be
to leave your child with another person.

152
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,744
I mean, it's like leaving behind
a piece of your heart.

153
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:23,081
Sandy, that's exactly what it is.

154
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,418
Are you gay?

155
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,422
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do.

156
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,925
But I am straight. I'm engaged, actually.

157
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,220
- Her name's Delia.
- That's pretty.

158
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:42,351
So you're just, like,
a guy who's a nanny.

159
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,857
I realize how it's a bit unorthodox
for some people.

160
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:52,069
But I really believe the most satisfying
thing you can do with your life...

161
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,738
...is take care of a child.

162
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,822
Okay.

163
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,868
Like at my last job.

164
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,162
I met Daniel when he was
3 weeks old.

165
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,958
And I got to watch him grow
into this awesome person.

166
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,252
When I left, I said, "I'll see you soon."

167
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,464
And he said to me, "Skadandy?"

168
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,510
That was his name for me.

169
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:21,723
"I'll see you every day right in..."

170
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:31,566
- It's okay.
- Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.

171
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,281
Oh, God, she must need
her diaper changed.

172
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:43,161
- I can take care of that, if you want.
- That would be great.

173
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,834
I love him, I love him, I love him!

174
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,086
Come on. Rach, he's a guy!

175
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,546
So what? He's smart. He's qualified.

176
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,883
Give me one good reason
we shouldn't try him out.

177
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,553
Because it's weird!

178
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,179
Why?

179
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,849
What kind of a job is that for a man?
A nanny?

180
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,102
I mean, it's like if a woman
wanted to be...

181
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,562
Yes?

182
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,315
King?

183
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:17,738
I hope you don't mind. I used
some of my homemade lotion on Emma.

184
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:22,034
It's a mixture of calendula and
honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up.

185
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:25,329
Plus, it keeps the hands young.

186
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,254
Yes! Sandy, you're hired!

187
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,507
That's great!

188
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,469
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:45,099
It's just such an emotional thing
when you're welcomed into a new family.

190
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,600
Oh, God. Come here.

191
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,648
You gotta be at least bi.

192
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,167
I need you to set me up for a joke.

193
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,795
When Monica's around,
ask me about fire trucks.

194
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,966
I don't know, Chandler. I'm not
so good with remembering lines.

195
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,930
Thank God your livelihood
doesn't depend on it.

196
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:26,932
I know, right?

197
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,434
Why are we doing this?

198
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,230
Monica says that her maitre d' is
the funniest guy she's ever met.

199
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:37,401
- Seriously? She actually said that?
- Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?

200
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,529
- No! Being funny's your thing!
- Yeah!

201
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:44,283
Without that, you just got
"lame with women"!

202
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,410
Hi! There you are.

203
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,828
Fire trucks!

204
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:03,051
Wow. You look even more beautiful
than you did yesterday.

205
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,306
In fact, I'm going to kiss you now.

206
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,434
- Wait, wait.
- I can't get away with stuff like that.

207
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,604
It sounded sexy in my head, so I...

208
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,981
No, no, it's not that.

209
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:21,403
Remember when you asked me if
I was seeing someone and I said no?

210
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,615
Well, I am. His name's Mike.

211
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,454
- I should've told you.
- No.

212
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,250
Well, yeah.

213
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:40,798
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Well, it's okay. I understand.

214
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,841
Well, are you happy with this guy?

215
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,135
- I am happy.
- Damn it.

216
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,764
I'm sorry. I don't mean that.
I want you to be happy.

217
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,226
But only with me. No, that's not fair.
Who cares. Leave him.

218
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,645
I don't mean that. Yes, I do.
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:56,021 --> 00:15:00,192
I think I should probably go.

220
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:04,404
But, David, I just want you to know that,
you know...

221
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:09,160
...telling you this is one of the
hardest things I've ever had to do.

222
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,079
Well, just so you know...

223
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,374
...hearing it wasn't exactly
a Vladnik carnival, either.

224
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,880
- Can we at least hug goodbye?
- Of course. Yeah.

225
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,933
You know, and a kiss on the cheek
wouldn't be totally inappropriate.

226
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,894
- No. No.
- I mean...

227
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,274
- In Minsk?
- Yeah?

228
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,068
It's two on each cheek...

229
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:48,198
...and one on the lips.
- Well, if that's what they do in Minsk.

230
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,081
In New York, it's...

231
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,341
Oh, boy.

232
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,264
Is everything all right?

233
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,641
Oh, yeah. No, it's fine. It's fine.

234
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,645
Sandy was just telling me about how he
proposed to his fiancee...

235
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,689
...and it was so beautiful.

236
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:24,109
Her favorite flower is the camellia.
From the poem...

237
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,486
I can't hear it again!

238
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,030
You know, I can't tell it again!

239
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,575
And I'm fine never having heard it.

240
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:38,415
- Rach, can I see you for a sec?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

241
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:46,757
Do you realize that man has cried
in our apartment three times?

242
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:50,261
I haven't cried that many times
since I moved in!

243
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:53,806
Look, Ross, Sandy's just sensitive.
That's all.

244
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:58,393
Okay, okay. See, that is the problem.
He is too sensitive.

245
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,521
Too sensitive to take care of our baby?

246
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,900
No, I mean, that guy...
These are amazing!

247
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,110
Sandy made madeleines.

248
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,572
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

249
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,286
What kind of a guy makes delicate
French cookies?

250
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,915
They're not even butch,
manly cookies with...

251
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:23,669
You know, with chunks!

252
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:29,508
Well, you know,
I don't know what to say.

253
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:33,596
I mean, I never thought of you as a guy
who needed his men to be men.

254
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:39,434
I gotta tell you, Ross, it's not like you
just came in from branding cattle.

255
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:46,483
Hey, there's sensitive and
there's too sensitive.

256
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,528
Okay, what is too sensitive?

257
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:17,347
No, I can't. I can't do this. It's bad.

258
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:22,269
But it's nice. And nice is good.

259
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:26,023
And good is not bad.
Ergo, we should keep kissing.

260
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,734
- No, no. No.
- But...

261
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,319
Ergo.

262
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,740
Look, David, if you had never left, then...

263
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,661
...yeah, we'd probably still be together
right now.

264
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:45,292
But you did leave. And I'm with Mike
and I really care about him.

265
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,257
Goodbye.

266
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,099
The key works.

267
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:06,688
And, you, thanks for the face massage!
Thank you!

268
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,361
Did Rachel tell you we hired
a male nanny?

269
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,029
I think that's great!

270
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:19,868
Did she tell you he plays the recorder,
recites poetry and bakes madeleines?

271
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:27,334
- How are they?
- Lighter than air, but that's not the point.

272
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,047
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

273
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,466
Really?

274
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,718
Guys do that?

275
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,346
- That's weird.
- Thank you!

276
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,765
- That's like a woman wanting to be...
- What?

277
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,519
- What's the end of that sentence?
- Yes. What is the end of that sentence?

278
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,607
A penis model!

279
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,115
Anyway, did you tell Chandler
that some guy from work...

280
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,160
...is the funniest guy you ever met?

281
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,496
- Yeah. So?
- Wow!

282
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,624
Really? Do you not know Chandler?

283
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:14,048
Is that why he's acting so weird?
He's jealous?

284
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,382
Oh, my God, that is crazy.

285
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,968
- It's not like I'm attracted to Jeffrey.
- So what?

286
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:23,015
Being funny is Chandler's thing.
Like Ross' thing is...

287
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,813
Science?

288
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:33,483
Academia? Being a good father?

289
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:41,408
- I can't believe he's that upset.
- You have to do some damage control.

290
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,910
Because he's feeling like...

291
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,081
What are you guys talking about?

292
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,711
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

293
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,298
You got a man who's a nanny?

294
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:57,758
You got a "manny"?

295
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,436
You know, I don't mind a male nanny...

296
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,438
...but I do draw the line
at male wet nurse.

297
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,279
You are on a roll, mister!

298
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,074
If I'd known you guys were coming over,
I would've brought more pizza.

299
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,539
Okay! Okay! Stop it, you!
You stop it!

300
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,752
What is so funny about that?

301
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:37,840
I don't know, it's...
Just the way you say it.

302
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:41,968
I mean, you're funny. You have
that funny thing. You're a funny guy!

303
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:48,142
Did you tell her what we talked about?

304
00:21:57,234 --> 00:22:01,029
So those were pity laughs?
Pity laughs?!

305
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,074
Honey, listen.

306
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,493
You have nothing to worry about
with Jeffrey.

307
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,787
Oh, yeah? Is he funnier than me?

308
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,665
Well, you're different funny.

309
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,168
I mean, you're more sarcastic.

310
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,921
Well, he does bits and impressions
and limericks.

311
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:19,340
I do limericks.

312
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:25,012
There once was a man named Chandler
whose wife made him die inside.

313
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:29,182
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious.

314
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,268
You know that joke
you told me last week?

315
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:34,313
The one about Jerry Lewis
and the girl with the lazy eye.

316
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,064
That slayed me.

317
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:40,652
Hey! I made up that joke
and told it to you.

318
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:48,743
- Not knowing when to shut up.
- Yep, that's my thing.

319
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,294
So how many guys have your key?

320
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,339
It's not as bad as it looks.

321
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,591
I was saying goodbye to an old friend.

322
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,968
Your lipstick's on his mouth.

323
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,847
We just happen to wear the same shade.

324
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:13,310
No, David and I did used to go out.

325
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:18,607
But years ago. And he lives in Minsk.
He's only in town for a couple days.

326
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,984
- Did you...?
- No. No.

327
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,819
- Kiss him?
- Oh, well, yeah.

328
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:27,574
Yes, but you should know,
she really likes you.

329
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:31,203
In fact, I don't think you realize
just how lucky you are, fella.

330
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,747
- Don't point your finger at me!
- Why?

331
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,499
What are you gonna do about it?

332
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,585
Well, I'll show you
what I'm gonna do about it.

333
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,255
- Oh, really? Really?
- You want some of that?

334
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,261
Stop it! Stop it!
Before someone gets really hurt!

335
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:53,434
Here, David, you should just go.

336
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,893
All right.

337
00:23:56,144 --> 00:24:00,857
But if I ever do come back from Minsk,
well, you just better watch out.

338
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:04,278
- Lf I go to Minsk, you better watch out.
- Oh, you're going to Minsk?

339
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,322
- Well, I might.
- Really?

340
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:10,826
Well, if you do, come in the spring.
It's just lovely there.

341
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,620
Okay, well, guys?

342
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,582
- Goodbye, Phoebe.
- Bye.

343
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,335
- Hey, what, are you kidding me?
- Right-o. Right-o.

344
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,966
Take good care of her.

345
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,971
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

346
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:34,475
If you want your key back,
I totally understand.

347
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,145
- It's never gonna happen again, right?
- Right. Never. I swear.

348
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:47,028
I just want to say, if you do ever
come to Minsk, that's my number.

349
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:50,658
We'll party up Vladnik-style.

350
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,175
Yeah! All right!

351
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,763
Hey, Ross! Check it out!
Sandy taught me "Hot Cross Buns"!

352
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,891
Really? Sounded like "Three Blind Mice."

353
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:19,019
- "Three Blind Mice" goes like this.
- I swear to God.

354
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:26,443
- Who's up for puppets?
- Me! I'm up for puppets!

355
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,446
Well, please welcome:

356
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,573
The Snufflebumps!

357
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,410
Who wants to be Mr. Wigglemunch and
who's gonna be the Grumpus?

358
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:40,791
How exactly is a 2-month-old
supposed to appreciate puppets?

359
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:45,295
Studies show that the movement and
colors help their cerebral development.

360
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:49,007
The whimsical characters are just for us.

361
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:55,973
I want to be Mr. Wigglemunch!

362
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,391
Oh, my God.

363
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,353
Well, I guess we know who's
gonna be the Grumpus!

364
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,486
- That was kind of rude.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

365
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:13,699
Please apologize to Sandy
and the Snufflebumps for me.

366
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:17,203
- You know, he was just doing his job.
- You know what?

367
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:23,584
I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't
in love with Gary Poppins out there.

368
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,630
But I just... I can't go through with this.

369
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,466
- Come on.
- No! You know what?

370
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:35,679
I would never force you to hire someone
you were this uncomfortable with.

371
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,226
That's true.

372
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:42,561
Thank you.

373
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,147
You want to fire him,
so you have to go do it.

374
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:53,822
So you see, Wigglemunch,
that's why it's important to share.

375
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:59,453
I am learning so much from you.

376
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:05,625
Well, I'm off to Tulsa.

377
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:09,254
So if your maitre d' friend
has any funny Oklahoma jokes...

378
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:14,176
...tell him to e-mail me at
www-dot-ha-ha-not-so-much-dot-com!

379
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,971
Honey, you can relax.

380
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,558
Last night at work Jeffrey
told this really sexist joke.

381
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,645
- After that, not so funny anymore.
- Really?

382
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,649
See, that's the thing.
You gotta keep it smart, people!

383
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,152
Don't miss that flight.
You know I love you.

384
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,697
I love you too.

385
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:38,659
- And I like you as a friend.
- Right.

386
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,369
- See you later.
- See you.

387
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:46,459
- Did the guy really make that joke?
- No, he still kills me.

388
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:50,921
Last night he had me laughing so hard,
I swear a little pee came out.

389
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,431
Here goes.

390
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,934
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.

391
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:09,982
Sandy? Hi.

392
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,900
- Hi.
- We...

393
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,111
We kind of need to talk.

394
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,409
I'm afraid it's not working out.

395
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:30,586
I mean, Rachel and I think you are great
with Emma.

396
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:34,005
- We just feel...
- You! You feel!

397
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:39,387
I just feel...

398
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,931
...that the chemistry isn't right.
I'm sorry.

399
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,767
We're more than happy to give you
a good recommendation.

400
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:50,356
No, that's okay. I had a lot of offers
from other families.

401
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,816
I just picked you guys because...

402
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:57,070
...I liked you the best.
- Oh, damn you, Geller!

403
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:03,327
Anyway, well I'm glad
there's no hard feelings.

404
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:08,373
None at all. You need to be happy
with whoever is in your home.

405
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:12,127
Although, if you don't mind telling me...

406
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:15,756
...what was the problem? Maybe it's
something I can work on in the future.

407
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:22,096
No, you know, it's nothing you did.
It's my issue.

408
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:24,807
What is it?

409
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,894
Please?

410
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:38,946
You know, I'm just not that comfortable
with a guy who's as sensitive as you.

411
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:41,031
That's fair.

412
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:45,703
Although, can I ask,
why do you think that is?

413
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:48,163
Why? I don't know.

414
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:58,423
Maybe because of my father?

415
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:05,264
You know, when I was growing up,
he was a tough guy.

416
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:11,394
You know, and as a kid,
I wasn't the athlete I am now.

417
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:15,482
I play squash!

418
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:24,658
Anyway, I always got the feeling
he thought I was too sensitive.

419
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,493
That must have been hard.

420
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:30,080
It was hard.

421
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:36,545
I remember I was in my bedroom,
playing with my dinosaurs...

422
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:38,964
Playing and learning.

423
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:47,472
And my father walks in and says,
"What are you doing with those things?

424
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:53,604
What's wrong with you? Why aren't you
outside playing like a real boy?"

425
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,191
- But you are a real boy.
- I know I am!

426
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:04,614
And when it's summer and it's hot,
why can't you wear a tank top?!

427
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:12,206
It's all right. Crying is good.
It lets the boo-hoos out.

428
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,709
Here comes some more!

429
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,303
And what's the one kind of boat
that can never ever sink?

430
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:31,474
- What kind?
- A friend ship!

431
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:36,689
Wow! You blow my mind!

432
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:40,693
I gotta go.

433
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,652
- How much do I owe you?
- Twenty bucks.

434
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,323
It's like the cheapest college ever!

435
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,037
