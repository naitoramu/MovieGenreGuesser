1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,300
Hey, hon? Would you help me
get the plates down?

2
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,595
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't
we use our wedding china today?

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,932
No, I think we should save our china
for something really special.

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,434
Like if the queen of England
comes over.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
Honey, she keeps
canceling on us. Take the hint.

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,232
What if something breaks?
They're expensive.

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,486
What is the point of having them
if we never use them?

8
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,614
Okay. But if something breaks
and then the queen comes over...

9
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,451
- I will explain it to her.
- Like I'd let you talk to the queen.

10
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,414
The parade is really good this year.

11
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,375
Man, those horses can crap.

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,546
<i>Next up is a marching band</i>
"from Muskogee", "Oklahoma."

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,840
Muskogee?
That's like four hours from Tulsa!

14
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,929
<i>Here's the float with the stars</i>
<i>of the popular daytime soap...</i>

15
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,264
...Days of our Lives.

16
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,645
Oh, my God!

17
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,691
Aren't you one of the stars of the
popular daytime soap "Days of our Lives"?

18
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,860
I forgot! I'm supposed to be there!

19
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,907
I can't believe I forgot! I usually write
stuff like this down on my arm!

20
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,455
Stupid long sleeves!

21
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,709
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll come up with a good reason...

22
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,461
...why I wasn't there.

23
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,421
The producers are gonna be mad.
They sat us down and said:

24
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:33,636
"Everyone has to be there, 6 a.m. Sharp.
That means you, Tribbiani."

25
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,638
Like I was some kind of idiot.

26
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,684
Well, you proved them wrong.

27
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,313

30
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,110
Oh, Emma.

31
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,322
This is your first Thanksgiving.

32
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,866
What are you thankful for?

33
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,077
Mommy's boobies?

34
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,580
A lot of people are thankful for those.

35
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,918
Hello? Rachel?

36
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,252
Who is it?

37
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,505
It's your favorite sister.

38
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,050
- Jill?
- Amy!

39
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,136
Hide my rings.

40
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,269
Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.

41
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,151
Do you have a hair straightener?

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,404
Hi.

43
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,030
- Hi.
- Hi.

44
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,574
Hair straightener.

45
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:24,120
- I haven't seen you in, like, a year.
- I know. I know. I've just been crazed.

46
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,541
Well, me too.
I had a baby.

47
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,128
I decorated Dad's office.

48
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:36,759
Yeah? Well, unless you pushed a desk
out of your vagina, not the same thing.

49
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,429
About that hair straightener,
honey, I really need one.

50
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,390
I'm gonna have dinner
at my boyfriend's house.

51
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,476
Oh, my God.

52
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,020
Is this Emmett?

53
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,902
It's Emma.

54
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,528
It's a girl?

55
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,075
- Hey, Amy.
- Amy, you remember Ross?

56
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,119
Not really.

57
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,998
But you are much cuter
than that geeky guy she used to date.

58
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,836
That was me.

59
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:17,383
No, he was this creepy guy from high
school who had this huge crush on her...

60
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,426
...since, like, the ninth grade.

61
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,011
Still me.

62
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,513
No, I'm not talking about you.

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,516
It was your fat friend's brother
with that bad Afro.

64
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,729
Okay, Amy, I'm gonna save you
some time, okay? All me!

65
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,946
Careful. Careful.

66
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,115
Careful!

67
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,826
I'll tell you what.
For the rest of our lives...

68
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,411
...I'll be careful until told otherwise.

69
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,083
- This isn't the china we picked out.
- I know.

70
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,628
After you left the store,
I chose different ones.

71
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:59,258
- Why?
- Your taste is a little feminine for me.

72
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,010
Suddenly flowers are feminine?

73
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,056
Hey, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!

74
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,601
- Happy Thanksgiving. Pheebs!
- What's going on, Joe?

75
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,019
Listen, I need a good lie.

76
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,562
Okay.

77
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,859
How about the whole "man walking
on the moon" thing, you know?

78
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,904
You can see the strings, people!

79
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:24,950
No, no, no. I need a good lie to explain
why I wasn't at a work thing today.

80
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,912
- Honey, you stink at lying.
- I do not.

81
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,457
Really? Let me ask you something.
Yesterday at the coffeehouse...

82
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:35,293
...I went to the bathroom. When I came
back, my muffin was gone. Who took it?

83
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,964
Somebody opened the door
to the coffeehouse...

84
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:43,093
...and a raccoon ran in and went
straight for your muffin. I said:

85
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,555
"Hey, don't eat that!
That's Phoebe's! " And he said...

86
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,602
He said, "Joey, you stink at lying."
What am I gonna do?

87
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,480
Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie.
I'll help you.

88
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,651
- Great. That'd be great. Thank you.
- Sure. What was the work thing?

89
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,239
- "Pick up Grandma at the airport."
- Oh, man!

90
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,786
She's precious.

91
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:14,041
Do you ever worry
that she's gonna get your real nose?

92
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,127
Amy...

93
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,629
Yes, I do. I really do.

94
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,636
Hello?

95
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,347
Yeah, hang on, one sec.
Can I take this upstairs?

96
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,767
Sure. We don't live there, but...

97
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,730
Seriously? It's just these rooms?

98
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,276
- I thought you were a doctor.
- Yeah. No, Ross has a Ph.D.

99
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:50,369
God, she is unbelievable.

100
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,663
I know. I mean, a Ph.D.
Is just as good as an MD.

101
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,624
Sure, Ross, yeah!

102
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,212
If I have a heart attack at a restaurant,
I want you there with your fossil brush.

103
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,257
- Stupid Thanksgiving.
- What?

104
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,594
- What? What happened?
- My boyfriend canceled on me.

105
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,264
I mean, I finally find a real relationship.

106
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,393
Someone that I can spend this day with,
and then his wife comes back into town!

107
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,814
I swear, it's almost not even
worth dating married guys.

108
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,025
Don't say that.

109
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,903
God, I was so looking forward to this.

110
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,115
It was gonna be such
a beautiful Thanksgiving.

111
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,701
We were gonna have sushi.

112
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,579
Amy, don't cry.

113
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,459
- Ross, can I talk to you in private?
- Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or...?

114
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,342
Look, I was thinking,
if it's okay with Monica...

115
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,095
...I would like to invite Amy
to Thanksgiving.

116
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:56,352
I think that's a great idea. It'll be like
the Pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.

117
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,606
Look, I know she's a little tough to take.

118
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:05,110
But she has nowhere else to go,
and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.

119
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:10,282
- And I would like them to bond.
- I don't want them bonding too much.

120
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,993
I don't want her telling Emma
she needs a nose job.

121
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:17,164
Ross, she may need one. We're just
gonna have to make our peace with that!

122
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,339
- Hi!
- Hey.

123
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,719
Hey, you guys. This is my sister, Amy.

124
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:33,972
This is Chandler, Joey,
Phoebe, and you know Mon.

125
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,683
Oh, my God.

126
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,060
You're on "Days of our Lives"!

127
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,603
Yeah.

128
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,190
Wow! They must put
a lot of makeup on you.

129
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,695
Happy Thanksgiving.

130
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,572
- Hey.
- Hi.

131
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,953
So welcome. Is this the first time
you're seeing Emma?

132
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,289
Yeah, I think so.
It's nice to meet you, Emma.

133
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,837
- Phoebe.
- That's a funny noise.

134
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,386
- Pheebs? I still need some help here.
- Right. Okay.

135
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:16,974
So it's not just the lie you tell,
but it's the way you tell it. For example...

136
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,477
...if you look at the ground when
you talk, people know you're lying.

137
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:25,357
I don't know why this is so hard for me.
Lying is basically just acting...

138
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,944
...and I am a terrific actor.
- You are a terrific actor.

139
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,701
- Hey. Where's the baby?
- We just put her down for a nap.

140
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:39,580
Listen, I was just thinking.
You know what would be incredible?

141
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,499
If you guys died!

142
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,003
Thank you, Amy.

143
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,047
No, no, then I would get the baby.

144
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:53,552
It would be just like a movie. At first
I wouldn't know what to do with her.

145
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:57,848
And then I would rise to the occasion.
Then I'd get a makeover and get married.

146
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,392
That's a great movie!

147
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,021
Yeah. Listen, not that you guys
could stop me or anything...

148
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,607
...because you know, you'd be dead.

149
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,068
But I was thinking about
changing her name.

150
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,654
I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.

151
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,908
Emma.

152
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,577
Emma? Ross wants you.

153
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,998
Phoebe!

154
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,294
Why does she keep making that noise?

155
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,174
Honey, I don't know
how to tell you this...

156
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:36,679
...but if something were to happen
to Ross or myself...

157
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:40,140
...you wouldn't get the baby.
- Well, who would?

158
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,436
Well, we haven't officially
asked them yet...

159
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,314
...but we would want
Monica and Chandler.

160
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,775
I can't believe you'd want us
to raise Emma.

161
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,861
Oh, my God, I'm so moved.

162
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,738
I don't believe this. Hold on a second.
You guys die...

163
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,408
...and I don't get your baby?

164
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,953
Amy, see, we're a lot closer
to Monica and Chandler.

165
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:05,373
We see them every day. And truthfully,
you don't seem connected to the baby.

166
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:09,169
Connected? To what? She's a lump.

167
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,633
You know, guys, I've gotta say
this means so much to me.

168
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:18,137
I mean, that you would
trust me with your child.

169
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,931
I mean, we all know
that Monica and I have been...

170
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,434
...trying to have a baby of our own.

171
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,814
You know, I've had my doubts
about my skills as a father, but...

172
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,400
That you two...

173
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:36,071
- That you two...
- This guy?

174
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,865
Seriously?

175
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,499
Okay, it's time for dinner.

176
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,376
Everyone, we're using our fancy china...

177
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:53,464
...and it's very expensive,
so please be careful.

178
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:04,016
Okay, just to be clear, comedy with
the plates will not be well-received.

179
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,441
Hey!

180
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,530
How come my plate's less fancy
than everyone else's?

181
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,241
Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?

182
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,536
No, honey. That's a special plate.

183
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,415
See, it's a game.
Whoever gets that plate wins.

184
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,752
I can't believe I won!

185
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,007
You know, this is such a slap
in the face. I mean, I'm your sister...

186
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:41,136
...and you would give your baby
to these strangers over me.

187
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,848
Monica is Ross' sister.

188
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,184
No, Ross' sister was really fat.

189
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,146
That was me.

190
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:56,318
No, she was this dorky girl in school who
followed Rachel around like a puppy...

191
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,862
Amy, you've got to stop doing that!

192
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,830
Okay, listen, I know you're having
a bit of a family crisis...

193
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,582
...but you don't have to take it out
on the plates.

194
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,585
I mean, in fact, I think that everyone...

195
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:17,673
...should cut their food like this:

196
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,887
Now, see? This way,
you protect the plates...

197
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,139
...and let's face it, you have fun.

198
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,684
Okay, how about this?
If you guys die...

199
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:33,689
...and the crazy plate lady dies...

200
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,901
...then do I get the baby?
- No, if crazy plate lady...

201
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:44,491
If Monica dies,
then I would get Emma. Right?

202
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,747
- Well, actually...
- Actually what?

203
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,334
It's just...
It's just that in that case...

204
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,420
...then Emma would go
to my parents.

205
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,047
- What?
- Hurts, doesn't it?

206
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,805
Who has to die for me to get her?

207
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,564
So if Monica's not around,
I'm not good enough to raise Emma?

208
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,191
No, that is not what we're saying.

209
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,110
Yeah, he's lying. He looked down.

210
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,781
Well, what's wrong with me?
Am I incompetent?

211
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,577
Because I managed to survive whatever
it is that killed the three of you!

212
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,377
You're taking this the wrong way.
We think you'll be a wonderful parent.

213
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,213
It's just... You're more
the, you know, fun parent.

214
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,593
Yeah, and we wanna make sure
Emma also has someone like Monica...

215
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,637
...who's more of a disciplinarian.

216
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,681
Someone who can be firm and strict.

217
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,434
That's not how you see me, is it?

218
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,063
No, you're all about the fun.

219
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,906
I may not know a lot about babies,
but do you really think I'm not capable?

220
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,825
No. You both are equally capable.

221
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,578
It's just you're strongest
when you're together.

222
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:15,624
Okay. So if we both had Emma,
and I died...

223
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,001
...she'd have to give her up.

224
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,296
Sure. Monica would have to give her up.

225
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,800
I lie better than that, right?

226
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:30,138
Let me just get this straight.
So my two friends die, I get Emma.

227
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:34,392
Then my wife dies. Then Emma,
the one tiny ray of hope left in my life...

228
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,064
...gets taken away from me?
- There's your movie.

229
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,444
Hey, there you are.

230
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,823
- You disappeared after dinner.
- Did somebody miss me?

231
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,951
Was there a child to raise poorly?

232
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,704
Ross and Rachel don't know
what they're saying.

233
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,789
It's not like they're so responsible.

234
00:15:55,956 --> 00:16:00,419
Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot
and a five-year-old condom.

235
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:06,258
No, but they're right. I'm not a strong
father figure, and I never will be.

236
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,094
No, you learn these things.
You grow into it.

237
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,096
Yeah, but it's not who I am.

238
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:16,435
Everything they said is exactly why I was
worried about having a kid. And it's true.

239
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,563
- And look, everybody knows it.
- I don't know it.

240
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,317
I wanna have a kid with you because
I think you'll be an amazing dad.

241
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,111
At the fun parts and at the hard parts.

242
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,824
Well, can you picture me saying,
"Go to your room, you're grounded"?

243
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,034
Can you hear me say,
"You're grounded"?

244
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,663
You said that to me last week.

245
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,001
How hard is it?
"No shoes on the furniture!"

246
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,678
The producer from "Days" left a message
asking why I wasn't at the parade.

247
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:56,058
They said everybody's really pissed off
at me. And they all got to meet Santa!

248
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:00,145
It's okay.
I thought of the perfect lie for you.

249
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,816
It's easy to remember,
and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.

250
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:07,861
You weren't at the parade
because you had a family emergency.

251
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,614
I like that! Yeah!

252
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,659
I wasn't at the parade
because I had a family emergency.

253
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,827
What happened?

254
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:19,080
- My sister's raccoon came...
- No, nothing with a raccoon!

255
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,045
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Setting the table.

256
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:29,049
We thought it might be nice
to use the fancy china for dessert too.

257
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,845
How nice. Maybe later we can all
blow our noses on my wedding dress.

258
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,438
Hey, dude, you okay?
Sorry about before.

259
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:46,817
That's okay. You're totally right. I don't
know anything about disciplining a child.

260
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:51,530
But it did hurt my feelings,
and I want you to know that if I die...

261
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,949
...you don't get Joey.

262
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,758
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm not talking to you.

263
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:15,638
You know, this is just...
This is classic Rachel.

264
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:20,309
Right. Remember in high school when
I died and didn't give you my baby?

265
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,815
This might be my one chance
to have a child, Rachel.

266
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:29,360
I mean, you know that I have been
so busy focusing on my career...

267
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:33,321
- What career?
- I'm a decorator.

268
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,908
You decorate Dad's office
and now you're a decorator?

269
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:41,746
Okay, I went to the zoo yesterday,
now I'm a koala bear.

270
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:48,378
- Why can't you ever be supportive?
- You want to talk supportive?

271
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:52,340
You didn't come and visit me when
I was in the hospital having the baby!

272
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:56,512
You didn't come see me in the hospital
when I was getting my lips done!

273
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,182
I did the first time.

274
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:05,813
You know what? You want to know
why I am not giving Emily to you?

275
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,398
- Emma.
- Whose side are you on?!

276
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:14,321
I'm not giving you Emma because you
can't handle the responsibility of a child.

277
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,199
Well, how hard could it be?
You do it.

278
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,874
You wanna know why
you don't want me to have the baby?

279
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,293
Because you don't want me to be happy.

280
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,089
- You have always been jealous of me.
- Jealous of what?

281
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:35,968
Of your lack of responsibility?
Your immaturity?

282
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:39,137
Your total disregard
for other people's feelings?

283
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,682
To name a few.

284
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,186
You've always been like this.

285
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:48,772
You had to have everything,
and I couldn't have anything.

286
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:52,151
Like in junior high,
when you stole Timmy from me.

287
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,195
I mean, do you even realize
how much that hurt me?

288
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,865
Timmy was my boyfriend,
and you made out with him!

289
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,159
Come on, that was 20 years ago.
Get over it.

290
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,412
I cannot believe
that I invited you here today!

291
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,501
Yeah, well, you know what I cannot
believe? That my so-called sister...

292
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:13,505
...gets a 30%"%" discount from Ralph
Lauren, and I still have to pay retail?

293
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,467
It's 45.

294
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,679
You bitch.

295
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,183
You just think you're so perfect...

296
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,062
...with your new baby
and your small apartment.

297
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:35,694
Well, let me tell you something.
Your baby isn't even that cute.

298
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,782
Too far, Amy. Too far.

299
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,037
- You take that back.
- No.

300
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,664
- Take it back!
- No. What are you gonna do? Make me?

301
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:50,793
Hey, man, I work out!

302
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,296
- So do I.
- I do Pilates.

303
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,215
- I do yoga.
- Bring it on!

304
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,635
Put the plates in the boxes!
Put the plates in the boxes!

305
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,514
- Did you just push me?
- Yeah, I think I did.

306
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,016
All right, that's it.

307
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:09,019
Forget the bubble wrap!
There isn't time!

308
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,064
Frizzy, frizzy, frizzy!

309
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,530
- Shouldn't we stop this?
- Are you out of your mind?

310
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,074
Let's throw some Jell-O on them!

311
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,372
Gross!

312
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:46,014
All right, that is it! This is our apartment,
and you cannot behave this way!

313
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,934
If you can't act your age,
you shouldn't be here at all.

314
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:54,022
Those plates may not be as nice as
the pretty pink ones that I picked out...

315
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:59,986
...but they're important to Monica.
And I want you to apologize to her, now.

316
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,781
- I'm sorry.
- Mon, I'm so sorry.

317
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,867
Okay. That's better.

318
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,411
Now, I want you to apologize
to each other and mean it.

319
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,414
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

320
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,959
By the way, that fight
was totally arousing.

321
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:20,091
Dude, well done.

322
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:25,346
If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies,
you can totally take care of Emma.

323
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,847
Yeah? Well, thanks.

324
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:31,476
So...
So now do I get Joey?

325
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:38,191
Okay. But you should know he eats a lot
and shoves pennies up his nose.

326
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,491
Are you okay, Mon?

327
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:49,369
I mean, these things happen.
I mean, it's just a plate.

328
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:53,290
- It's not like somebody died.
- It's all right. You can mourn.

329
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:57,627
Thank you. It was so beautiful!

330
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:02,007
I'm gonna go to Joey's
and get the pies.

331
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:05,970
Actually, not pies. It's just pie.

332
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,557
I don't care.

333
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:13,310
Oh, my God, I've lost the will to scold.

334
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,483
Look, Amy...

335
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,527
...we got a little...

336
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,529
...a little out-of-control over there.

337
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,699
And I'm sorry.

338
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:29,451
You're my sister...

339
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:32,037
...and if it really means
that much to you...

340
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:35,332
- So you're gonna give me the baby?
- No, I was...

341
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:38,585
I was gonna let you use
my Ralph Lauren discount.

342
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,882
You are not gonna regret this.

343
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,971
- She needs changing.
- No, no, no. I'll get her.

344
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:53,684
I am super confident, totally responsible
and fourth in line to raise Emma.

345
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:58,230
I'll be right there, Emma! Just let me
get my trusty diaper bag here.

346
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,863
Well, what do you know?
I guess I'll be the one who dies first.

347
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:20,502
- Does Monica know about her plates?
- Nope.

348
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:22,213
- Broke them all, huh?
- Yep.

349
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,256
- You gonna tell her?
- Nope.

350
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:29,928
Hey. So I'm gonna
put the plates back.

351
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:33,640
I think you're right. We shouldn't
use these plates for a long time.

352
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:37,353
- Like only if the queen comes?
- Maybe not even then.

353
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:39,938
Hey. I did it.

354
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:43,651
I told my producer I had a family
emergency. He totally bought it.

355
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:48,488
- Thanks for teaching me how to lie.
- No problem. Next week, stealing.

356
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,826
- Bye, plates.
- You told her you broke all the plates?

357
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,998
What?!
Something happened with the plates?

358
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,379
Yeah, this raccoon came in...

359
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:09,760
