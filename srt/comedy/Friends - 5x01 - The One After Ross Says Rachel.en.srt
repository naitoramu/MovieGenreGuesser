1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:06,048
Friends, family,
we're gathered to celebrate...

2
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,802
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

3
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,513
Now Ross, repeat after me.

4
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,265
"I, Ross."

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,766
I, Ross.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,518
"Take thee, Emily."

7
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,896
Take thee, Rachel.

8
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,698
Shall I go on?

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,784
He said "Rachel", right?

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,787
Do you think I should go up there?

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,956
Yes. Yes. Do go on.

12
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,459
I think we'd better start again.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,211
Repeat after me.

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,545
"I, Ross."

15
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,047
I, Ross.

16
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,884
"Take thee, Emily."

17
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,515
Take thee, Emily.

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,561
Like there'd be anybody else.

19
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,315
"As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

20
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,108
...till death parts us."

21
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:11,113
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

22
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,949
...until death parts us.

23
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,077
Really, I do. Emily.

24
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,247
Do you have the rings?

25
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,333
Place this ring on Ross' finger...

26
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:27,922
...as a symbol of
your bond everlasting.

27
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,344
Ross, place this ring...

28
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,597
...on Emily's hand as a symbol...

29
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,767
...of the love that
encircles you forever.

30
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,811
Happy to.

31
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,438
They have made
their declarations...

32
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,862
...and it gives me great pleasure
to declare them husband and wife.

33
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,949
You may kiss the bride.

34
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:04,124
This is worse than when
he married the lesbian.

35
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,297
Just keep smiling.

36
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,635
Well, that went well.

37
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:20,557
It could've been worse.
He could've shot her.

38
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:25,896
That was pretty funny, wasn't it?

39
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,733
The One After
Ross Says "Rachel"

40
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,322
You spoiled everything!
It's a nightmare!

41
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:22,078
My friends and family are out there!
How can I face them?

42
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,496
No matter what happens with them...

43
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,791
...we still get cake, right?

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,714
That's all right. You take your time.
I'll be right out here.

45
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,426
She's just fixing her makeup.

46
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,677
I hate you!

47
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:43,140
And I love you!

48
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,978
A bad time
to say the wrong name, huh?

49
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,608
That's true. Thanks, Dad.

50
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,110
People should be dancing.

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,988
This is a party! Come on!

52
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,408
Joey! Dance!

53
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,962
Yes, Waltham Interiors.

54
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:20,344
This is Ross Geller's
personal physician, Dr. Filangie.

55
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,637
Who?

56
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,724
I discovered that Ross forgot
to take his brain medicine.

57
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,602
Without it, in the brain of Ross...

58
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,064
...women's names are interchangeable.

59
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,983
Through no fault of his own.

60
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,028
Oh, my God! Phoebe.

61
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,947
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Filangie.

62
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,785
Oh, no! You have it too!

63
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,423
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

64
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,594
...but I know we had plans
to meet up tonight.

65
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:06,057
I'm worried about what it
might do to our friendship.

66
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,099
I know.

67
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,397
- How could we have let this happen?
- Seven times!

68
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,734
You know, look.
We were away.

69
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:20,237
In a foreign, romantic country.

70
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,863
I blame London.

71
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,075
Bad London!

72
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,242
So, look...

73
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,414
...while we're still in London,
we can keep doing it, right?

74
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,375
Well, I don't see that
we have a choice.

75
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,253
But when we're back home,
we don't do it.

76
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,423
Only here.

77
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,550
You know, I saw
a wine cellar downstairs.

78
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,388
I'll meet you there in two minutes.

79
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,307
Mon? I got to ask you something.

80
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,476
Now?

81
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:55,231
Ross said my name.
I can't just pretend it didn't happen.

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,315
I don't know.

83
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,651
Monica, what should I do?

84
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:03,280
Just do the right thing.

85
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,742
Tow the line! Thread the needle!
Think outside the box!

86
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,288
I'll talk to Ross
about what he thinks it meant.

87
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,707
Wait! Rachel, no.

88
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,292
He's married.

89
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,710
Married.

90
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,963
If you don't realize that,
I can't help you.

91
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,133
Okay. You're right.

92
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,927
You're right.
You can't help me.

93
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:31,558
Jack, is it all our fault?
Were we bad parents?

94
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,187
Who serves steak
when there's no place to sit?

95
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,147
How are you supposed to eat this?

96
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,358
Hey, what's up?

97
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,777
We were supposed to meet.

98
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,072
- Forget it. That's off.
- Why?

99
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,659
The next tour of the wine cellar...

100
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:54,331
...will commence in two minutes.

101
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,167
Joey, what are you doing?

102
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,543
You promised, no meat
till Phoebe has the babies.

103
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:02,131
We're in another country,
so it doesn't count.

104
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,676
- True.
- He's got a point.

105
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,933
I'm sorry things aren't working out.

106
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,353
It could be better.
It'll be okay, right?

107
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,731
Oh, yeah! Of course.
She'll get over this.

108
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,317
So you said my name.

109
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,153
You just said it
because you saw me there.

110
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,031
If you'd seen a circus freak,
you would've said:

111
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,743
"I take thee, Circus Freak."

112
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:33,078
It didn't mean anything.
It's a mistake.

113
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,623
It didn't mean anything.
Right?

114
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:40,753
Oh, no! Of course
it didn't "mean" anything.

115
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:44,298
I can understand why Emily
thought it meant something...

116
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,799
...because it was you.

117
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:50,595
But it absolutely didn't.
It didn't! It didn't!

118
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,932
The band's ready
for your first dance with Emily.

119
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,811
Oh! The band's ready!

120
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:03,441
We got to do what the band says.
I don't care about the stupid band!

121
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,612
You spit on me, man!

122
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,447
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,533
Emily is taking kind of a long time.

124
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,952
When I locked myself up
at my wedding...

125
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:17,456
...I was trying to pop
the window out of the frame.

126
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:22,169
Get the hell out of there.
You know?

127
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,303
I'm coming in!

128
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,725
Oh, look at that.
Same thing.

129
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:45,693
In the middle of everything,
if I scream "Yippee!", just ignore me.

130
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:51,073
- Oh, my God! Rachel!
- Oh, hello, Rachel.

131
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,242
Ross said my name.

132
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,035
Okay? My name!

133
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,995
Ross said my name up there.

134
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:00,583
That obviously means
he still loves me!

135
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,834
Don't believe me.
I know I'm right.

136
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,212
Do you guys want to go
and get a drink?

137
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,215
Yes, we do.

138
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,342
But we have to change first.

139
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,303
Yes, I want to change.

140
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,390
- Go get a table.
- We'll only be five minutes.

141
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,685
Fifteen minutes.

142
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,482
Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!

143
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,568
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Oh, great.

144
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,112
So what happened?

145
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,364
Well, Ross said my name.

146
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,033
But I don't think
that means anything.

147
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,369
Let's look at this objectively.

148
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,037
Ninth grade, right?

149
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,249
The obsession starts.

150
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,961
Then he sees me in
a two-piece for the first time.

151
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,797
His obsession begins to grow, right?

152
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,924
Why don't we go change in my room?

153
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,136
My clothes are...

154
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,901
Wow, you look...

155
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,155
No time for that.

156
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:20,120
Hey, dude! Let me in!
I got a girl out here!

157
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,873
I got a girl in here!

158
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:27,878
No, you don't.
I saw you go in with Monica.

159
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,131
Well, we're hanging out.

160
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,719
Which one of us will be
having sex in there? Me or you?

161
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:40,015
I suppose I would
have to say you.

162
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,310
- What if we're watching a movie?
- Which we are!

163
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,145
And we've paid for it.

164
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,647
It's "My Giant."

165
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:48,899
"My Giant"?

166
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,778
I love that movie!

167
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,533
Think this is okay?

168
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,744
Well, Ross and Emily
aren't going to use it.

169
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,664
Oh, it's so beautiful!

170
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,460
I don't feel right about this.

171
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,755
This is the honeymoon suite.

172
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,967
The room expects sex.

173
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,846
The room would be disappointed
if it didn't get sex.

174
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:25,436
All the other honeymoon suites
would think it was a loser.

175
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,610
Nope! Not under here!

176
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,364
- You didn't find her?
- I've looked everywhere.

177
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,200
You couldn't have,
or you would've found her.

178
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,242
Keep looking!

179
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,078
Yeah! For about 30 minutes?

180
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,331
Or forty-five?

181
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:51,670
In 45 minutes,
you could find her twice.

182
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:58,719
For all I know, she's trying to find me
but couldn't because I kept moving.

183
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,638
From now on,
I'm staying in one place.

184
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,850
Right here.

185
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,731
- It's getting late.
- We're going to go.

186
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,735
Do you guys mind staying here
for a while?

187
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,488
We got to get up early
and catch that plane.

188
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:21,283
Yeah, it's a very large plane.

189
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:25,287
That's cool.

190
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,957
But we'll stay here with you.

191
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,253
Thanks, guys!

192
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:38,633
I really appreciate this,
but you don't need to rub my butt.

193
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,313
We have to leave in an hour.

194
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,191
I know. I've been looking
at those doors.

195
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,527
They look pretty soundproof,
don't you think?

196
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,072
We can't do that.
That's insane.

197
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,826
I mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know...

198
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,996
...let's go for it.

199
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,256
Nope.

200
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:21,135
- She's not with us.
- We've come for her things.

201
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,470
Where is she?

202
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,058
She's in hiding. She's humiliated.
She doesn't want to see you again.

203
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:34,898
We're very sad that it didn't work out
between you and Emily, monkey.

204
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:39,069
But I think you're
absolutely delicious!

205
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:44,491
Excuse me,
I'm standing right here.

206
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,951
Oh, yes.

207
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:49,830
There you are.

208
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:54,251
Hurry up! Get some!
There's a whole cart outside.

209
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,419
Goodbye, Geller.

210
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,629
Now, hold on. Hold on.

211
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,802
Your daughter and I are supposed
to leave tonight for our honeymoon.

212
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:07,556
Tell her I'll be at that airport,
and I hope she will too.

213
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,809
I said Rachel's name,
but it didn't mean anything.

214
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,269
She's just a friend.

215
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,271
Tell Emily I love her and...

216
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,816
...I can't imagine spending my life
with anyone else.

217
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:23,029
Please, promise me that
you'll tell her that.

218
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,949
All right, I'll tell her.

219
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,410
Come on, bugger face!

220
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,744
Call me.

221
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:36,627
You spend your life in the bathroom.
Why do you never go out the window?

222
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,520
Maybe it's best we never
got to do it again.

223
00:14:55,771 --> 00:15:00,442
Yeah, it kind of makes
that one night special.

224
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:07,407
Technically, we still are
over international waters.

225
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:12,955
I'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe I'll see you there?

226
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,922
Can I ask you something?

227
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:28,053
Felicity and I watched
"My Giant". And I thought...

228
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,556
...I'll never be as good an actor
as that giant.

229
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:36,979
Do you think I'm wasting my life
with this acting thing?

230
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,189
The giant's five years
younger than me.

231
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,859
You think I'll ever get there?

232
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,865
- Thanks, man.
- Okay, man.

233
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,745
But what about how much
taller he is than me?

234
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,957
I mean, there's no way
I can make myself taller now.

235
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:00,961
Who knows what science will
come up with in the future...

236
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:06,466
...but what if I die an unsuccessful,
regular-size man?

237
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,679
You've been in the
bathroom for a half-hour.

238
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,722
I know!

239
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,185
Had the beef tips, huh?

240
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,579
You ate meat!

241
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,915
You had sex!

242
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,085
No, we didn't.

243
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:45,381
I know you didn't.
I was talking about Monica.

244
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,049
I did not have sex.

245
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,427
This pregnancy is
throwing me all off.

246
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,430
- I'll say "hi" to the chick and duck.
- Me too!

247
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,308
Why would you need to?
You've been feeding them.

248
00:16:56,558 --> 00:17:00,771
Oh, right.
Maybe I'll just go home.

249
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,448
We certainly are alone.

250
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:16,036
Good thing we have that
"not New York" rule.

251
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,748
Listen, since we're on that subject...

252
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,709
...I just wanted to tell you that...

253
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,963
I was going through
a hard time in London...

254
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:32,344
...with my brother getting married and
that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.

255
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,679
Well, anyway, I just...

256
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,977
That night meant a lot to me.
And I'm trying to say thanks.

257
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,232
You know, that night
meant a lot to me too.

258
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,652
It wasn't because I was
in a bad place or anything.

259
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:53,615
It just meant a lot because
you're really hot.

260
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,494
Is that okay?

261
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,871
That's okay.

262
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,666
And I'm cute too?

263
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:04,835
And you're cute too!

264
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,628
Thank you.

265
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:10,633
All right, I got to go unpack.

266
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:31,237
I'm still on London time.
Does that count?

267
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,823
- Oh, that counts!
- Oh, good!

268
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,836
What are you doing here?

269
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:51,965
I've been on standby for
a flight home for hours.

270
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,758
So no sign of Emily?

271
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,720
Not yet.

272
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,267
When do you have to leave?

273
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:06,355
<i>This is the last call</i>
<i>for flight 1066 to Athens.</i>

274
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,065
<i>The last call.</i>

275
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,610
Pretty soon, I guess.

276
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,697
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,656
I don't understand.

278
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,826
How could she do this?

279
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:24,999
Am I a complete idiot for
thinking she'd actually show up?

280
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:30,004
You're not an idiot, Ross.
You're a guy very much in love.

281
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,589
Same difference.

282
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,927
<i>All passengers for flight 1066</i>
<i>to Athens should now be on board.</i>

283
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,138
I get it!

284
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,436
Well, that's that.

285
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,146
No, you know what?

286
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:50,232
I think you should go.

287
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,025
I think you should go...

288
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,653
...by yourself.
Get some distance.

289
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,531
Clear your head.
It would be really good.

290
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,449
I don't know.

291
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,954
Come on.
It would be really good for you.

292
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,459
I could do that.

293
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,086
I can't even believe her.

294
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,255
You know what?
I am going to go.

295
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,589
- Good.
- Why not?

296
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,133
- Right?
- Right.

297
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,342
Thanks.

298
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,053
I'll see you back at home.

299
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:22,932
If I ever get a flight out of here.

300
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:28,187
What? Wait, what?

301
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,688
Why don't you come?

302
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,984
I mean, I have two tickets.
Why not?

303
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,655
Well, I don't know, Ross.
Really?

304
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,534
Yeah. It'd be great.
I mean, you can...

305
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,576
You can lay on the beach...

306
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:47,164
...and I can cry over
my failed marriage.

307
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,125
You see how I make jokes?

308
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,294
Really. I mean...

309
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,129
I could use a friend.

310
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:59,384
Oh, wow. Maybe.

311
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,179
Yes, I can do that!

312
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:06,099
- Cool.
- All right, cool.

313
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,686
Okay, we're going to Greece.

314
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,771
I forgot my jacket!

315
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,273
Well, you tell them to wait.

316
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:16,527
Wait! Wait!

317
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:39,132
I'll have a glass of Merlot...

318
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:43,637
...and he'll have
a wine spritzer.

319
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,271
Look!
The airport's moving.

320
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,689
Are we moving?

321
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:57,192
Are we?
Why are we moving?

322
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:02,113
Does the captain know
that we're moving?

323
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,783
Oh, my gosh!
