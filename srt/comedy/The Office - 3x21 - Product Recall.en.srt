1
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:15,107
It's kinda blurry.

2
00:00:19,317 --> 00:00:20,317
That's better.

3
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:27,333
Question.

4
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:29,322
What kind of bear is best?

5
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:31,559
It's a ridiculous question.

6
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:33,428
False.
Black bear.

7
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:34,874
Well, that's debatable.

8
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:36,811
There's basically
2 schools of thought...

9
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:38,906
Fact.
Bears eat beets.

10
00:00:39,312 --> 00:00:40,314
Bears.

11
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:42,982
Beets.
Battlestar Galactica.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,120
Bears do not...

13
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:47,224
What is going on?
What are you doing?

14
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,592
Last week, I was in a drugstore,
and I saw these glasses.

15
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:52,130
$4.

16
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,526
And it only cost me $7

17
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:57,796
to recreate the rest of the ensemble,
and that's a grand total of...

18
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:00,758
$11.

19
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:04,461
Imitation is the most sincere
form of flattery. So I thank you.

20
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:09,077
Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!

21
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,808
Millions of families suffer every year!

22
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,804
- Michael!
- Oh, that's funny.

23
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,217

The Office US - 3x21
Product Recall

59
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,372
Yes, I understand.

60
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,801
Can I transfer you
to Customer Relations?

61
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,091
Absolutely.
I couldn't be

62
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,331
I know, I know. We're all trying
to get to the bottom of this.

63
00:01:57,473 --> 00:02:00,590
Yes, I am upset.
Don't I sound upset?

64
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,557
It's disgusting.
I totally agree.

65
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:07,108
Well, we're going to be
recalling all of that paper.

66
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:08,643
We have a crisis.

67
00:02:09,114 --> 00:02:11,535
Apparently,
a disgruntled employee at the paper mill

68
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:14,508
decided that it would be funny
to put an obscene watermark

69
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:17,861
on our 24-pound cream letter stock.

70
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:19,877
500 boxes

71
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,880
has gone out with the image
of a beloved cartoon duck

72
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:26,065
performing...

73
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:29,738
unspeakable acts upon a...

74
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:32,790
certain cartoon mouse
that a lot of people like.

75
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,153
I've never been a fan.

76
00:02:35,596 --> 00:02:37,292
Everybody in here, STAT.

77
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:39,816
No time to lose.

78
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,136
Cry-Man Squaw, F and C, double time.

79
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:44,262
Cry-Man Squaw?

80
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,845
Crisis Management Squad.

81
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,111
F and C, double time?

82
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:49,485
Front and center,
twice as fast as you'ld normally go.

83
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:50,947
- Other questions?
- One more.

84
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:53,547
- Why are you talking like that?
- To save time, Jim.

85
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:56,034
I think you could make
the argument that it wastes time.

86
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:57,654
Yeah, she has a good point.

87
00:02:58,113 --> 00:02:59,990
For example,
with the last thing you said,

88
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,677
by the time you explained it,

89
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:03,403
it actually took up more time.

90
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:05,045
Forget it.

91
00:03:05,347 --> 00:03:06,349
Where's Creed?

92
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:07,570
- Creed,
- Here.

93
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:09,838
quality assurance.
Your job.

94
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,259
I really think you screwed
the pooch on this one, Creed.

95
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,469
Because of you, the entire
company is in jeopardy.

96
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:20,022
Every week,
I'm supposed to take 4 hours

97
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:22,532
and do a quality spot-check
at the paper mill.

98
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:26,051
And, of course, the one year
I blow it off, this happens.

99
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:29,120
We have a lot of angry
customers out there.

100
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:30,816
This puts us
at threat level Midnight.

101
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:34,187
Accounting, you are on customer
service duty today.

102
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:36,947
- That's really not our job.
- Midnight, Oscar!

103
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:39,405
Don't worry,
Kelly'll be training you.

104
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:41,242
Kelly's training us?

105
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:45,707
This day is bananas.
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

106
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:48,505
This day is bananas.
B-A-N-A...

107
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:52,744
I don't have a headache.

108
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,955
I'm just preparing.

109
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,847
Jim, big fire in your house.

110
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:00,938
Your client, Dunmore High School,

111
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:04,103
sent out their prom invitations
on this paper. To all the kids.

112
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,270
- Yeah, I got a call out on them.
- No, no.

113
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:08,201
Not good enough.
This is a keystone account.

114
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:10,566
I want you in the school.
In person.

115
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:11,898
- Sure.
- Bring a partner.

116
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:13,024
- I'll go.
- No.

117
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:16,085
We need somebody who's actually
made a sale. Andy, you go.

118
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:18,929
William Dolittle, at your service.

119
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:21,143
AKA, Will Do.

120
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:23,244
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.

121
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:25,428
No, no.
I need two men on this.

122
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:28,424
That's what she said. No time!
But she did. No time!

123
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:30,703
Guys, get on this!
Dwight,

124
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:32,710
you're in charge
of the press conference.

125
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:35,856
Yes! You're entering
the "No Spin Zone."

126
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:37,429
We're having a press conference?

127
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:39,816
No, the press is just
gonna find out by themselves.

128
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:41,950
Not.

129
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:44,540
Here's the thing.
When a company screws up,

130
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:46,443
best thing
is to call a press conference.

131
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:49,702
Alert the media,
and then you control the story.

132
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:53,045
Wait for them to find out,
and the story controls you.

133
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:54,807
That's what happened to O.J.

134
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:56,690
I have invited Barbara Allen,

135
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,158
one of our oldest clients,
to come in here

136
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:01,692
and meet with me
for a personal apology.

137
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,259
The press wants a story.
I will give them a story.

138
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:06,953
- Did the press ask for a story?
- Here

139
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:08,554
is your headline.

140
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:12,473
"Scranton-area paper company,
"Dunder-Mifflin,

141
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:15,948
"apologizes to valued client.

142
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:21,882
"Some companies
"still know how business is done."

143
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:23,361
Okay?

144
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:26,582
Battle stations, everybody.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

145
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:31,010
Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality
Assurance. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton.

146
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:34,118
I was supposed to meet
with one of your floor managers

147
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,329
last week for a quality inspection,
and he or she wasn't there.

148
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,484
And I'm trying to remember who it was.

149
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,367
Mm-hmm.
Who wasn't there last week?

150
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:48,775
Debbie Brown.
And which day was that?

151
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:51,667
Wednesday the 11th.
Perfect.

152
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,238
The difference between me
and a homeless man is this job.

153
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:56,724
I will do whatever it takes to survive.

154
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,015
Like I did...

155
00:05:58,335 --> 00:05:59,899
when I was a homeless man.

156
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,438
I know the reason
that you guys became accountants

157
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,367
is 'cause you're not good at interacting
with people. But guess what?

158
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,826
From now on,
you guys are no longer losers.

159
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:09,813
So give yourselves a round of applause.

160
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,717
I wonder how many
phone calls you're missing

161
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,361
while you're teaching us to answer it.

162
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,689
I know.
Probably a lot.

163
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:19,298
Can you just tell us
what we need to do so we can go?

164
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:21,739
Okay, Angela.
I love your enthusiasm.

165
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,906
All you need to do
is pick up the phone and say,

166
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:25,535
"Customer Service.
This is Kelly. "

167
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:27,701
Except don't say Kelly.
Say your own name.

168
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:29,754
Or, if you're bored,
just make up a name.

169
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:31,958
Like one time
I said I was Bridget Jones,

170
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:34,501
and I talked like this
for the whole conversation.

171
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:37,271
Ooh, can I be...
Australian, mate?

172
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,928
- Absolutely!
- 'Ello, mate.

173
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:42,593
I like ice cream.
I need a boyfriend.

174
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:45,297
I like ice cream, too, mate.

175
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:49,018
Alli-gators and dingo babies.

176
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:52,325
Beer me.

177
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:53,973
What's that?

178
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:56,563
Hand me that water.
I always say, "Beer me."

179
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:58,711
Gets a laugh, like,
a quarter of the time.

180
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:00,284
So how's what's-her-name?

181
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:01,829
You know her name.

182
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,607
Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only
one of my oldest friends.

183
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,716
How's the apartment hanging?

184
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:08,902
It's fine.

185
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:11,097
Nice.

186
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,035
Check out this sunshine, man.

187
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:15,749
Global warming, right?

188
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,661
Today was supposed to be
really cold, I bet.

189
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:21,402
What about music?
Do you have any music?

190
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:23,975
Uh, yeah.
Should have said so.

191
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:42,726
I was thinking more like a CD or...
a CD?

192
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:45,175
Your call, dude.

193
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:48,114
My girlfriend made
an awesome mix. Beer me that disc.

194
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:51,844
Lord, beer me strength.

195
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:56,732
So, Tuna, when we get in there,
let's do a really good job, okay?

196
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,711
Did that really need to be said?

197
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,056
Well, not everything
a guy says needs to be said.

198
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:04,252
Sometimes it's just about
the music of a conversation.

199
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,080
Whoa, what the...

200
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:08,303
why is my girlfriend here?

201
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:10,733
Oh, is she that
teacher in the white?

202
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:13,912
No, she's a part-time
frozen yogurt chef.

203
00:08:15,142 --> 00:08:16,250
Which one is she?

204
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:17,953
The one in the green hoodie.

205
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:21,472
I wonder if she's, like,

206
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:24,027
- a guidance counselor or something?
- No.

207
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:25,150
I don't think so.

208
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,102
- She's probably a tutor.
- Nope.

209
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:28,669
- She's probably a te...
- No.

210
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:29,957
- She's...
- No.

211
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:34,539
Okay, press conference in 45.

212
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,415
Dwight, make sure
this place looks nice.

213
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:37,629
On it.

214
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,544
Okay, Karen, Ryan, Pam.
Center stage.

215
00:08:43,664 --> 00:08:45,051
Pam, run a comb through your hair.

216
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:49,663
First rule in roadside beet sales:
put the most attractive beets on top.

217
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:51,803
The ones that make you pull
the car over and go,

218
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,018
"Wow, I need this beet right now.

219
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:56,053
"Those are the money beets."

220
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,452
Hey!

221
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,643
Look sharp.
Hey.

222
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,820
Hu, hi!
Hello. Dwight Schrute.

223
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:07,443
And you must be, uh,
from <i>The Washington Post</i>.

224
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,238
<i>Scranton Times.</i>
Chad Lite. "Lighter Side of Life. "

225
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:13,162
- And "Breaking Corporate News."
- And obits.

226
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:15,694
Oh, dear God.

227
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,759
Okay, here are your credentials.

228
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,208
You've been granted
level 3 security clearance.

229
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:22,265
Don't get too excited.
That's out of 20.

230
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:24,401
Right this way.
Regional Manager Michael Scott

231
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:26,590
will address the client
in the press room shortly.

232
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,514
Have a seat.
Can I get you a beverage?

233
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:31,218
- Uh, yeah, I'd like a...
- Great.

234
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:36,204
Andy, you know what?

235
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,520
We don't have a lot of time,
so we should probably...

236
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:41,894
Jamie.
What are you doing here?

237
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,258
Are you a student here?

238
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,669
Oh... yeah.

239
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,487
You never told me
you're in high school.

240
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:51,737
This is weird.

241
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:54,082
I gotta go to Spanish.

242
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:00,195
Oh, my God!

243
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,324
Oh, my God.

244
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:06,883
I had no idea.

245
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:11,179
Well... that's not gonna
hold up in court.

246
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,430
We didn't do anything illegal.

247
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,708
Except knock over a mailbox
with her friends.

248
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,938
Sir, yes, you have a valid point.

249
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,888
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:25,214
No, I am so sorry.

251
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,551
Really?
Dickson City.

252
00:10:26,683 --> 00:10:27,898
Excuse me?

253
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:29,933
Well, I don't see how that's our fault.

254
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:33,295
And I've already told you the official
position of Dunder-Miflin is apologetic.

255
00:10:33,418 --> 00:10:35,122
So I don't know what you want from me.

256
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:38,466
Okay...
First,

257
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:42,036
I just wanna say
that you are doing so good.

258
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,039
You have so many good qualities

259
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,978
that the one that you
might wanna work on is...

260
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:50,212
apologizing?

261
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:54,808
When I went over Wednesday
for the spot check,

262
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:56,683
I got a call from Debbie Brown

263
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:59,348
saying she has an emergency
dentist appointment.

264
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,590
Emergency dentist appointment.

265
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:04,516
Now I'm told
she told her manager she had the flu.

266
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:06,399
I'm a trusting guy, but, uh...

267
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:10,535
I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.
We would have caught this.

268
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:14,933
Yes.

269
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:17,287
I'll be sure someone returns your call.

270
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:19,322
I'm so sorry.
Bye.

271
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,629
Hello.
I'm looking for Michael Scott.

272
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,372
Mrs. Allen

273
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:25,021
is our most important client.

274
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:28,704
Because every client
is our most important client.

275
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:32,123
Even though she's a pretty
unimportant client, really.

276
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:36,060
And so,
with the eyes of the nation upon us,

277
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:37,840
I would like to say

278
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:42,540
that Dunder-Mifflin truly regrets
this unfortunate incident.

279
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,677
And,
as a gesture of gratitude

280
00:11:45,884 --> 00:11:49,426
for your continued loyalty,
Mrs. Allen,

281
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:53,306
I would like to present you
with this novelty check

282
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:56,950
for six months of free paper,
or 25 reams,

283
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:58,491
whichever comes first.

284
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,692
- You look good in this.
- So...

285
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,450
let us consider this matter ended.

286
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,088
Well, it isn't ended.

287
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,508
I'm very angry.
I could have lost business.

288
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,298
I know.

289
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:17,508
I know you're angry.
And we are truly, truly sorry.

290
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:20,136
I don't accept your apology.

291
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:22,095
The watermark
was obscene and horrifying.

292
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,148
Well...

293
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:26,098
we are extremely sorry.

294
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:27,493
I don't accept.

295
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:34,614
I'll be with you in a moment.

296
00:12:34,736 --> 00:12:35,744
All right.

297
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:42,996
Who was that guy she was talking to?
At her locker?

298
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:44,447
Not important.

299
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:47,395
Because you're not dating her.
Because it's a felony.

300
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:49,585
But who was that guy?

301
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:52,058
Probably another high school student.

302
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:58,181
The issue with the watermark
is very serious.

303
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,053
- Absolutely.
- We teach our students

304
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:02,055
- that character counts.
- And you should.

305
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,634
You don't teach it well enough.

306
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:07,224
One of your students is

307
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:11,274
- a bitch.
- Andy is having a real rough day today.

308
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,568
I wanna take out an ad
in your yearbook.

309
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:17,479
- A full page, two words.
- "Good luck."

310
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:19,987
That's not what I had in mind.

311
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:22,048
Ask where he's from.

312
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:23,848
Where are you from?

313
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,663
Ohio? That's nice.
So what do you want?

314
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:29,877
He's upset about the watermark.

315
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:32,419
Okay, great. Now tell him
that it was an unfortunate error,

316
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,470
and we're doing everything we can do
to fix it, and that you're sorry.

317
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:38,095
It was an unfortunate error.
We're fixing it.

318
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,989
- And you already got your money back...
- And you're sorry.

319
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,262
And the company has already apologized,
so you can take that apology or not.

320
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,895
I think he had Tourette's or something.

321
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:53,339
We are going to do
everything humanly possible

322
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,276
to ensure that this
never happens again.

323
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:58,599
Well, it doesn't help.
Because it already happened to me.

324
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:01,072
The watermark...
it's a one-time thing.

325
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:03,106
I don't care.
It was disgusting!

326
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:04,741
Cartoon characters having sex?

327
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:08,530
May I point out that the sex
appeared to be consensual.

328
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,376
- Both animals were smiling.
- Okay.

329
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,200
I grew up on a farm.

330
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:15,847
I have seen animals having sex
in every position imaginable.

331
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:19,065
Goat on chicken,
chicken on goat.

332
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,591
Couple of chickens doing a goat.
Couple of pigs watching.

333
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:25,327
Whoever drew this got it exactly right.

334
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:26,721
What...

335
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,515
can I do for you?

336
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:31,642
For starters,
I think that you should resign.

337
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,003
Okay.
Well...

338
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,317
Um, wasn't really my fault.

339
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,405
- The guys at the pape...
- You're the head...

340
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,282
- It's a guy at the paper mills.
- You're the head of the company!

341
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,454
The head of the company?
I'm a regional manager!

342
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,865
- And you should lose your job!
- What? Okay,

343
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,768
this is insane.
You can get out of here.

344
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:50,793
- Get out! That's insane.
- Fine.

345
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,376
Somebody else will appreciate it.

346
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:54,711
- It's nontransferable.
- Doesn't matter. Out, please!

347
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,406
I'm calling the Better Business Bureau.

348
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:59,660
Yeah, well, I'm calling
the Ungrateful Bee-otch Hotline!

349
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:03,834
Did you get all that?

350
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,407
Everything.

351
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,181
We gotta do something.

352
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:15,061
This is spinning out of control, Pam.

353
00:15:15,184 --> 00:15:18,067
- This is just not...
- It's just the <i>Scranton Times</i>.

354
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:22,484
No, then <i>Newsweek</i> picks it up.
And then CNN does a story about it.

355
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:25,490
- And then... YouTube gets a hold of it.
- You know what?

356
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:29,258
I really think the whole thing is just
gonna blow over in, like, a week or two.

357
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:33,035
You're right.
It will blow over.

358
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,313
But it's not

359
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:38,056
going to take...

360
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:40,722
a week or two.

361
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,624
Do you know what this is for?

362
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:44,724
Yes.

363
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:48,897
Michael likes me to run the camera
when he makes his apology videos.

364
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,128
He says he needs a woman's touch.

365
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,237
I think that's good.

366
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:06,610
"Hello, I am Michael Scott,

367
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,794
"Regional Manager
of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton.

368
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,643
"By now, you are probably
sick of hearing about

369
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:16,161
"Dunder-Mifflin and our
embarrassing watermark boner.

370
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:19,953
"Let me tell you something.
Something from the heart.

371
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,305
"I am not leaving this office.

372
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:25,360
"It will take a SWAT team

373
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:29,068
"to remove me from this office,
and maybe not even that. "

374
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:30,970
You'ld never withstand a SWAT team.

375
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,382
That's how devoted I am to this job.

376
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:35,353
- I'm just saying.
- I know.

377
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,822
They would flank you,
throw in a concussion grenade.

378
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:38,980
You'd be on the ground...

379
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:42,417
Do you think you're taking it
a little... literally, Dwight?

380
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:45,526
And now we're wasting tape.
I'm gonna have to cut this all out.

381
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:47,268
- Can you say "cut"...
- Cut.

382
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,577
- So I know where...
- Cut.

383
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:49,952
I'm asking Pam to do it.

384
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,034
- Cut.
- Okay, ready?

385
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:55,076
Kevin, what's four plus seven?

386
00:16:56,273 --> 00:16:57,375
Eleven.

387
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,312
Well, you didn't know that
when you filled out this payroll form.

388
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:04,665
Yeah, well, at least
I didn't suck at customer relations.

389
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,689
Yes!
Facial!

390
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:09,826
You two are apes.

391
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:12,849
I expect you
to apologize for that, Angela.

392
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,441
I'm sorry.

393
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:16,692
That you're both morons.

394
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:18,501
But you still said,
"I'm sorry."

395
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:20,104
I called you morons.

396
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:21,602
Still said it, so...

397
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,701
Five, four, three.

398
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:36,450
"There is no way
"I will resign.

399
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:37,872
"It wouldn't be fair.

400
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:42,120
"Not to the good workers I work with,
"not to my clients,

401
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:44,645
"and especially not to me.

402
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:47,291
"Let's not forget who this whole

403
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:49,777
"resigning business is about, anyway.

404
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:54,063
"If I could leave you
"with one thought, remember...

405
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:55,447
"it wasn't me.

406
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,555
"They are trying
"to make me an escape goat.

407
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:01,437
"If I am fired, I swear to God

408
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:05,780
"that every single piece
"of copier paper in this town

409
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:09,285
"is going to have the F-word on it.

410
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:11,065
"The F-word.

411
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,731
"You have one day."

412
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:16,556
One day for what?

413
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,458
That's... they always
give an ultimatum.

414
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,521
Okay.

415
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:23,800
- Good? Cut?
- Cut.

416
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,002
That was your best apology video ever.

417
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:28,594
I thought so too.

418
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:32,381
Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.
I thought maybe you'd like to sign it.

419
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:35,513
Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there
for her. She's got children.

420
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:39,390
I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.
She got fired because of Dwight.

421
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:41,726
So I thought I'd pass around
a good-bye card.

422
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,768
Maybe everyone
could put in a couple of bucks

423
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,850
to help her through
these difficult times.

424
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:51,059
Why do bad things
always happen to the good people?

425
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:54,817
It's tragic.
Just tragic.

426
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:02,104
- You want music?
- I don't care.

427
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:07,058
Come on, man. Just give it a couple
days. I think you'll be all right.

428
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:08,424
Yeah.

429
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,325
You know what?
I don't...

430
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:52,918
Hey, Dwight.

431
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:55,302
You look really nice today.

432
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,214
Psh!
I look like an idiot.

433
00:19:58,872 --> 00:19:59,880
Hey, Karen.

434
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:01,557
Hey, Dwight.
Lookin' sharp.

435
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,469
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm...

436
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:05,381
your boyfriend, Jim Halpert.

437
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:09,541
Wanna get together later

438
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,065
and have sexual intercourse,
'cause you're my girlfriend?

439
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:13,732
- Do you?
- No.

440
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:15,239
- Okay.
- I'm good. Thanks.

441
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:23,454
Look at that.

442
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:25,065
I'm Jim Halpert.

443
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:28,365
Spot on.

444
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,746
Blah, blah, a little comment.
Yeah.
