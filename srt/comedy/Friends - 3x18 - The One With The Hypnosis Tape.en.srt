1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,120
What's so funny?

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,230
Nothing. It's an acting exercise.
I'm practicing my fake laugh.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,000
What? What's so funny?

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,950
No, no. There's none of that in here.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,160
Come on. At least let me
finish this last one.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,030
Only if you give me a drag.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,600
Oh, dark mother, once again
I suckle at your smoky teat.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,710
Why don't you hold on to that one.

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,630
That's like the least fun game ever.

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,630
I'm sick of your smoking,
so I brought something. . .

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,310
. . .that is going to help you quit.

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,120
That patch is no good.

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,920
It's a hypnosis tape.

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,630
A woman at work used it for two weeks
and hasn't smoked since.

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,040
What's your problem?

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,910
Nothing. It's just that
hypnosis is beyond crap.

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,710
I watched you get hypnotized
in Atlantic City.

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,270
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,310
You always pull your pants down
and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,510
Forget hypnosis.

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,230
The way to quit smoking is to
dance naked in a field of heather. . .

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,520
. . .and then bathe in the sweat
of six healthy, young men.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,670
Or what my father calls
"Thursday night. "

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,710
The One With the Hypnosis Tape

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,960
-Here you go.
-I didn't want cinnamon on this.

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,520
Sorry.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,030
Oh, my God! Frank!

29
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,670
How are you?

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,510
What are you doing here?

31
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,320
I would've called,
but I lost your number.

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,590
And then my mom locked me out of
the house, so I couldn't find it.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,150
Then I tried to find a pay phone,
and the receiver was cut off.

34
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,280
What happened?

35
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,790
vandalism.

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,590
But also, what happened
between you and your mom?

37
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,120
We got in a fight. She said that
I was too immature to get married.

38
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,320
You're getting married?

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,310
My little brother's getting married!

40
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,190
I knew you'd be so cool about this.
Do you wanna meet her?

41
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,550
Do l?

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,150
Do you?

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,110
Yeah, I do.

44
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,560
Cool, all right.
She's just parking the truck.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,120
I'd have bet good money that he'd be
the first one of us to get married.

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,040
Isn't it fantastic?

47
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,270
Don't you think he's
a little young to get married?

48
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,470
Well, he's 1 8.

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,030
It'll be illegal for him to drink
at his own bachelor party.

50
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,830
Yeah, or to get a hooker.

51
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,830
Always illegal, Joe.

52
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,310
. . .Mrs. Knight.

53
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,710
That's my sister.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,430
You know, it's funny.

55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,670
Frank told me so much about you, but
you're not how I pictured you at all.

56
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,550
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,630
Here, grab a seat.

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,310
So how did you guys meet?

59
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,120
I was in Mrs. Knight's. . . .

60
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,150
I mean, Alice. Sorry.
I always do that.

61
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,960
I was in her home-ec class.

62
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,550
He was my best student.

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,920
She was my best teacher.

64
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,840
If that doesn't keep kids in school,
what will?

65
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,640
And so now you guys
are gonna be married?

66
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,950
We talked about
just living together. . .

67
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,030
. . .but we want kids right away.

68
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,120
Oh, my God!

69
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,160
Great!

70
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,680
Kids. Frank, are you sure
you're ready for that?

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,710
How hard can it be?

72
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,030
You know, I mean, babies.
Who doesn't want babies? Right?

73
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,510
And besides,
I never had a dad around.

74
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,430
And now I always will,
because it'll be me.

75
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,550
Really, we do realize that there's
an age difference between us.

76
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,270
Good. Because you were
acting like you didn't.

77
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,310
But when it comes to love,
what does age matter?

78
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,310
You are falling fast asleep.

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,190
Deeper, deeper, deeper.

80
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,950
You are now completely asleep.

81
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,320
You don 't need to smoke.

82
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,030
Cigarettes don 't control you.

83
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,270
You are a strong, confident woman...

84
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,910
... who does not need to smoke.

85
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
A strong, confident woman.

86
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,000
You know what?

87
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,070
I realized in the last year I've
only gone out with Richard and Julio.

88
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,710
You gotta help me out, set me up.
Get me back in the game.

89
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,950
Not a problem.

90
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,710
I work in fashion, and all I meet
are eligible straight men.

91
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,920
Can I get you something else?

92
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,830
Cheesecake and a date,
if you're giving them out.

93
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,200
Haven't we covered that topic?

94
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,960
You just said to her--

95
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,760
You wanna go out with me. . .

96
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,160
. . .because of my wig, the big boobs,
and I serve you food.

97
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,750
If that were true,
I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.

98
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,520
And the two times we went out,
it was plain awkward.

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,310
You think she should go out with me,
don't you?

100
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,760
You sure you wanna go out with her?

101
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,000
That ain't a pretty picture
in the morning.

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,440
That wig all in disarray,
and boobs flung over the nightstand.

103
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,230
Think about it.

104
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,350
Oh, I will.

105
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,190
No, I know.
I know that this is Frank's life.

106
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,390
I don't wanna be judgmental,
but it's sick. It's sick and wrong!

107
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
What, is it the age thing?

108
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,510
I'm fine with the age thing. . .

109
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,710
. . .until it sticks its tongue
down my brother's throat.

110
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,430
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

111
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,710
You think he'll enjoy it when he's
up to his elbows in diapers. . .

112
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,710
. . .of all the babies
they have to have right away?

113
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,230
This is not fair to Frank,
and it's not fair to the babies.

114
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,950
You know what?
It's not good home economics.

115
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,440
Have you told him how you feel?

116
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,950
Yes. Not out loud.

117
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,190
If you don't tell him, soon he'll be
married, then you'll hate yourself.

118
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,720
Yeah, but if I do tell him,
then he's gonna hate myself.

119
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,320
Look at him and his mom.
I can't.

120
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,590
But you guys can.
You talk him out of it.

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,640
Come on, you guys.

122
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,960
You have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose.

123
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,510
Do you want me to lose everything?
Everything?

124
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,630
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.

125
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,320
We're walking down the street,
and I turn to you and say:

126
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,550
"Let's go hang out at
Totally Nude Nudes. " Remember?

127
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,160
And then you say, "Let's just
hang out at your place. "

128
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,830
Well, that was a nice move, dumb ass.

129
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,710
I think you should
go out with this guy.

130
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,630
He doesn't do anything for me.

131
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,920
Last Saturday night, what happened
on Walker, Texas Ranger?

132
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,120
Walker was looking for
this big busload of kids.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,720
All right, I get your point.

134
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,160
I forgot the combination to this
about a year ago.

135
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,040
I just carry it around.

136
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,510
You got any Chap Stick?

137
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,110
How are those tapes working out?

138
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,670
Good. I haven't smoked yet today.

139
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,070
I feel great and confident.
That is a stunning blouse.

140
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,150
Thank you.

141
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,510
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,430
Let's give Pete a chance.
He was funny. He seems really nice.

143
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,480
That check thing was adorable.

144
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,160
What check thing?

145
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,310
As a joke, this customer who has a
crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.

146
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,150
His number's on the check.
He did it so I'd call.

147
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,110
Pete Becker. Pete--

148
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,070
Is this him?

149
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,790
That's Bill Clinton.

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,480
Who's he hugging?

151
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,830
Oh, my God. That's Pete.
Why is Bill hugging Pete?

152
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,670
This guy invented Moss 865.

153
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,310
Every office in the world
uses that program.

154
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,600
-We use it!
-There you go!

155
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
Monica's gonna go out
with a millionaire.

156
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,870
I'm not gonna go out with him.

157
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,710
I can't believe this is a real
$20,000 check. This is so exciting.

158
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,160
Or incredibly offensive.

159
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,720
Yeah, sure. That too.

160
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,630
What?

161
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,840
All we're saying is,
don't rush into anything.

162
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,990
Come on, think about it.
You're 1 8. She's 44.

163
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,520
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

164
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,110
You don't think I know that?

165
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,910
The point is. . .

166
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,560
. . .there's a lot of women
you haven't had sex with yet.

167
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,630
He's right. He's right.
This is your time.

168
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,710
You're young. You're weird.
Chicks dig that.

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,040
Isn't sex better when it's with
one person that you really care about?

170
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,520
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.

171
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,920
No, the man's right.
That's what I had with Rachel.

172
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,390
Not anymore?

173
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,510
No. I slept with someone else.

174
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,710
So wait. So how did that
make things better?

175
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,680
It didn't.

176
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,520
What you used to have with Rachel
is what I got with Alice.

177
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,240
Now, what is that like?

178
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,750
It's so cool, man.

179
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,200
It's because being with her is so
much better than not being with her.

180
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,710
-Why can't I find that?
-I had it and I blew it.

181
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,240
Well, I want it!

182
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,350
You can have it.

183
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,030
Maybe there's something wrong with me.

184
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,950
No, it's out there, man.
I've seen it! I got it!

185
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,470
-Then, you hold on to it!
-All right, man!

186
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,280
All right! Congratulations,
you lucky bastard!

187
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,510
You're Frank's best man?

188
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,430
I couldn't help it.
Their love is so pure.

189
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,510
What about you, huh?

190
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,390
I'm the ring bearer.

191
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,710
I'm so glad you could come.
I've got a real home-ec emergency.

192
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,510
Oh, my God. Who died on this?

193
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,840
It's a real "mustard-tastrophe. "

194
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,120
Can you help?

195
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,350
Absolutely. First, we'll start
with a little club soda and salt.

196
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,560
-Then if that doesn't work--
-Forget it. It's ruined.

197
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,310
Never say that. If you can't
get it out, cut around the stain. . .

198
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,840
. . .add a little lace,
you make a stylish throw.

199
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,030
Or instead, maybe you could just
not marry my brother, Frank?

200
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,680
Can we make it smaller?
Make it fit on the head of a pin?

201
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,710
I love when we make things
fit on the head of a pin.

202
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,520
You have Monica Geller here.

203
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,750
Absolutely. Yeah, send her in.

204
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,830
What the hell is this?

205
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,870
Hang on for a sec.
I'll talk to you in the morning?

206
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,880
You got it.

207
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,310
I'm sorry. What?

208
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,990
What's this supposed to mean?

209
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,270
Well, you know,
I never know how much to tip.

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,150
You double the tax.
Not double the tax of Romania.

211
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,950
Are you buying me? ls this how
you get girls to go out with you?

212
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,350
I'm still here.

213
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,320
You're taking this wrong.
If I didn't leave you that tip. . .

214
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,640
. . .you wouldn't have come,
we wouldn't have this argument. . .

215
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,310
. . .and there wouldn't be
this heat between us.

216
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,550
You gotta admit that our relationship
is hitting a new level now.

217
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,150
You were the chef
and I was the customer.

218
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,390
But now we're this couple that fights.

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,320
You're a loon.

220
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,950
Look, forget the check, okay?
I like you.

221
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,110
I think you're great.

222
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,360
Come on, what do you say?

223
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,150
I don't know.

224
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,590
Why not?

225
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,870
I don't wanna encourage
this behavior.

226
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,790
One meal.
That's all I'm asking for. Please?

227
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,710
We go out, we eat.

228
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,430
If you don't have a good time,
I'll give you 1 0 grand, we're even.

229
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,750
Wait, no. Just put the mail down.
It's me.

230
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,150
Sorry. Why were you
just all in the dark?

231
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,190
Your laundry smelled so good
that I thought I'd curl up in it.

232
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,390
-Is that all right?
-Yeah, sure.

233
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,960
So how was your day?

234
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,910
It's just probably the worst one
since I've been alive.

235
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,510
What happened?

236
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,560
Alice. . . .
She called it off.

237
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,950
Did she say why?

238
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,510
No. Just that I was too young.

239
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,320
I don't see how I could
suddenly be too young. . .

240
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,960
. . .because I'm older than I was
when we first got together.

241
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,550
I don't know. But you know what?
Maybe it's just all for the best.

242
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,190
Well, yeah, if the best is
like unbelievable pain.

243
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,390
Oh, sweetie.

244
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,720
You know, I was just finally happy.

245
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,510
For the first time in my life. . .

246
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,990
. . .after my dad left me. . .

247
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,110
. . .and then getting arrested
for stealing those birds. . .

248
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,920
. . .and then the whole
punctured-lung thing.

249
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,510
It's still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather. . .

250
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,510
. . .but with Alice,
all that stuff kind of went away.

251
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,950
And now it's gone,
and I don't know why.

252
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,320
Well, I can tell you why.
It's because of me.

253
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,880
But you know what? I only did it
because I love you, okay?

254
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,840
What?

255
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,760
I kind of had a little chat
with Alice. . .

256
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,670
. . .and I sort of made her see
why you two shouldn't be together.

257
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,950
And you'll see it too, one day.
You really, really will.

258
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,590
Wait a minute.
This is because of you?

259
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,920
My mother didn't want us
to be together. . .

260
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,920
. . .but the worst thing she did
was tie me to the porch.

261
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,680
I came to you because
I thought you'd understand.

262
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,520
I would storm out of here. . .

263
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,030
. . .if I had some money
or a place to go.

264
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,230
Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!

265
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,960
Oh, my God!

266
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,470
I'm just gonna have dinner with him.

267
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,120
Okay, just because he buys you dinner
does not mean you owe him anything.

268
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,710
I know.

269
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay, then get the lobster.

270
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,030
How much cash you got
in your pocket now?

271
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,720
And that's why I'm not
inviting you in for a drink.

272
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,480
Why not? Hey, come in for drink.

273
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,310
-Where do you wanna go?
-You like pizza?

274
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,390
-That sounds great.
-I know a great little place.

275
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,240
You're not paying for the pizza.

276
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,510
Come on, it's only fair.
You paid for the flight.

277
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,510
Is that enough lira?

278
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,920
I'd throw another 1 000 on that.

279
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,870
-How much is that?
-That's about 60 cents.

280
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,750
Every night!

281
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,720
You don 't need to smoke.

282
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,430
Cigarettes don 't control you.

283
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,960
You are a strong, confident woman...

284
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,750
... who does not need to smoke.

285
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,080
A strong, confident woman...

286
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,920
... who does not need to smoke.

287
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,230
Look, I know that you think I did
this totally evil thing.

288
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,910
But I so didn't.

289
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,960
Someone's here who can explain this
better than I can.

290
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,040
Hi, Mrs. Knight.

291
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,360
Phoebe's right, Frank.

292
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,750
It's hard to hear, but it would've
been wrong to go through with it.

293
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,520
I was being selfish.

294
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,350
Even though we want
the same things right now. . .

295
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,350
. . .in the future, we may not.

296
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,830
-Is that what it is?
-Yes, but not just that.

297
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,310
Not just that.

298
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,750
Even though we love each other
as much as we do. . .

299
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,000
. . .nonetheless. . . .

300
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,720
Nonetheless.

301
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,110
You're too young. . .

302
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,760
. . .to really know what you want.

303
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,880
That's right, exactly.

304
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,080
That's a goodbye kiss.
That's good.

305
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,710
Bye-bye.

306
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,910
The important thing is,
is that you see what I'm saying.

307
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,710
This is clearly wrong.

308
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,550
I've decided I'm gonna
let this happen.

309
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,720
Can I just get my purse?

310
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,190
Okay, all right, good.

311
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,030
Cigarettes don 't control you.

312
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,160
You are a strong, confident woman...

313
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,200
... who does not need to smoke.

314
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,120
Joey's your best friend.

315
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,550
You wanna make him
a cheese sandwich every day.

316
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,830
And you also wanna buy him
hundreds of dollars worth ofpants.
