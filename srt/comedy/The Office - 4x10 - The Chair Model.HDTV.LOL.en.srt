00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,136
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices

2
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:11,633
and their cruise are taking up some of
the parking spaces we used to get.

3
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:14,518
So we had to park
at a satellite parking lot over there.

4
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,080
Which just means we get to see more
of our lovely street.

5
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:18,900
Tell them what we saw today, Jim.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,272
Oh, today we saw a junkyard dog

7
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:23,907
attacking the bones
of a rotisserie chicken.

8
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:25,027
Nature.

9
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:28,725
I've been here 9 years, and suddenly
I'm supposed to park half a mile away.

10
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:32,063
I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.

11
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:33,869
I will quit.

12
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:38,290
As God is my witness, I will quit...
if this is not fixed.

13
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:41,052
Some of us like the walk
more than others.

14
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:42,879
It hurts like hell.

"CHAIR MODEL" (1.00)

17
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:10,774
Did you pick a new chair?
It's been a while.

18
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:13,244
Pam,
when I first opened this catalog,

19
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:15,995
I thought I was just going
to be picking out a chair.

20
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:19,791
But instead you found something to
distract you from picking out a chair.

21
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:23,604
Michael started the process of selecting
a new chair about three weeks ago.

22
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:26,519
And normally I wouldn't care
but he promised me his old one.

23
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,738
It's way better.
It's one of these:

24
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:32,094
I really want it.

25
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,189
- Have you ever seen this woman?
- Her?

26
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:40,060
The one in the really great mesh,
black, hi-back swivel chair?

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,443
Look at her smile.

28
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:43,648
It's the eyes. Look at her eyes.
She's got...

29
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:46,197
I don't know what it is exactly.

30
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:48,573
She dresses like a professional,

31
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,390
and yet you know
there is a side of her

32
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,760
that could just curl up on a couch.

33
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:55,117
Or in a great chair.

34
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:57,328
Yeah, maybe, but...

35
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:02,291
Remember after my dinner party when
I said that I was swearing off women?

36
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:04,902
I definitely remember your dinner party.

37
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:08,378
I think what I meant was that I am
completely swearing off one woman:

38
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,507
Jan.

39
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:15,333
I think that fate
put this catalog in my hands.

40
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:18,515
Actually, I put the catalog in your hand
'cause you have to pick out a new chair.

41
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:20,678
What is it like being single?

42
00:02:20,798 --> 00:02:23,482
I... like it.
I like...

43
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,172
starting each day
with a sense of possibility.

44
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,497
And I'm optimistic,

45
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:32,714
because every day
I get a little more desperate

46
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:36,075
and desperate situations
yield the quickest results.

47
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,054
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please
open your supply catalogs

48
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:41,456
and kindly turn to page 85?

49
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:48,462
- <i>Yo, is this his new chair?</i>
- No, he hasn't picked one yet.

50
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:53,459
When Pam gets Michael's old chair,
I get Pam's old chair.

51
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,680
Then I'll have two chairs.

52
00:02:56,238 --> 00:02:57,632
Only one to go.

53
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:00,422
I am ready to start dating again.

54
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:02,477
Getting back on the market.

55
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:03,548
So...

56
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:07,294
FYI, for those of you
who're thinking about fixing me up,

57
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,356
with any of your friends,

58
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:14,063
use the woman on page 85
as a template.

59
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:16,021
That will be all.

60
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:26,258
I left my cell phone in my car.

61
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,503
Call us when you get there
so we know you're okay.

62
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:35,614
Listen, man...

63
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,594
I am completely over Jan.

64
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:38,689
So...

65
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:41,034
would you set me up?

66
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,399
If I had somebody
to set you up with, Michael,

67
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,469
then I'd take her for myself.

68
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:47,844
- I thought you were engaged.
- Nope.

69
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:49,917
Stacy broke up with me.

70
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:54,100
What?
God, that's terrible, man.

71
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:57,014
She's crazy.

72
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,909
Um, are you still on good terms
with any of her friends?

73
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,342
Not anymore.

74
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:02,786
It's a bitter situation.

75
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:04,425
Yeah...

76
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:06,062
She's...

77
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,208
You don't deserve her.

78
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:09,871
All right.

79
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:14,184
Hello, Oscar Meyer weiner lover.

80
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:16,528
I bet that you have

81
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:20,395
a bunch of very liberal
girl-type friends

82
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,427
who trust you implicitly

83
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:25,333
because they know you'd never touch 'em
'cause of your condition.

84
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:27,607
- Michael?
- What?

85
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:29,351
I have a friend who's single.

86
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:31,205
Sandy.

87
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:34,694
She's gorgeous
and she's got a feisty personality too.

88
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:36,797
Feisty...

89
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:39,187
So she's not jolly or sassy?

90
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:41,116
Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?

91
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,703
No,
she's a professional softball player.

92
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:48,248
- Catcher or in field?
- I don't know, Michael.

93
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:51,877
Is she a dress-wearer
or a pants-wearer?

94
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:56,423
Could we share a rowboat?
Could a rowboat support her?

95
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,799
What are you asking?

96
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:00,203
I think I'm being very clear
what I'm asking.

97
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:04,056
Would an average-sized rowboat
support her without capsizing?

98
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:09,981
It bothers me that you're
not answering the question.

99
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,105
No, all right?
She can't fit in a rowboat.

100
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:14,525
Damn it! I knew it!
I knew it, Phyllis!

101
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:17,769
What is wrong with these people?
I would do anything for them,

102
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,571
and they're just
hanging me out to dry.

103
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,810
Dating shouldn't be hard
for somebody like me

104
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,583
but it is, and you know why?

105
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:27,150
Because nobody here
is willing to help me.

106
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,749
Nothing would ever get done

107
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,221
in this office without
a formal request, would it?

108
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:34,330
Well fine, here goes.

109
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,005
- I don't think that...
- Now okay,

110
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:38,521
I know that this
is probably not appropriate.

111
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:41,225
But I need help.

112
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:47,390
Because I want to play ball
with my kids

113
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,061
before I get too old.

114
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,729
And before that happens,
I need to get laid.

115
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:57,652
And before that happens,
I need to be in love.

116
00:05:58,282 --> 00:05:59,445
And I don't wanna hear,

117
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:03,382
"I don't know, I can't help, na na na."
No, no, I am a catch,

118
00:06:03,502 --> 00:06:05,617
and I am not going
to be the one who got away.

119
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:08,508
So this is what we're going to do.

120
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,271
Dwight is going to hand out index cards,

121
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,781
and I want you all
to write down the name

122
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:16,546
of an eligible woman for me to date

123
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,320
by the end of the day.

124
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:21,079
No, by the end of the hour,

125
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,689
or you are fired.

126
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,555
Write legibly, people.

127
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:30,757
Because of the construction
at W.B. Jones,

128
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:33,437
half of us have to park
in the satellite lot.

129
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:36,607
- It's, like, a 10 minute walk.
- No, 30.

130
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:39,890
Look, I have an assigned
parking place in front, so...

131
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,354
All right, all right.

132
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:46,058
Let me try to think about
what it would be like to not have one.

133
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:55,543
Okay, yes, that would be bad.

134
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:58,371
- That would be bad.
- Okay, so...

135
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:00,547
- help us out.
- Wish I could, but I can't.

136
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:02,912
Well can, but won't.

137
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:05,428
Should, maybe, but...
shorn't.

138
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:06,928
Michael, please...

139
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,243
What part of shorn't
don't you understand, Kevin?

140
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,186
Look, I could
probably handle it, yes, but...

141
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,895
I think it would be a good exercise
for you to do it yourselves.

142
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,940
- We won't let you down.
- You can't because I don't care.

143
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:20,677
Don't forget
to fill out those cards.

144
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:22,733
My love cards.

145
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,990
There's nobody I hate enough
to write her name on this card.

146
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:30,451
Well, I'm setting Michael up
with my fat friend anyway.

147
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:31,787
He can just deal with it.

148
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:35,004
- Who are you putting down?
- Oh, you don't know her.

149
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:36,955
- Who is it?
- Your mom.

150
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:38,584
Yeah, whatever.

151
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,089
Give that to me!
Give that to...

152
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:44,356
Okay, "Wendy"...

153
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,623
Hot and juicy redhead.

154
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:48,832
Let's give this a try.

155
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,946
<i>Wendy's.</i>

156
00:07:57,356 --> 00:07:58,986
Hello, Wendy.

157
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:01,156
This is Kevin's friend Michael.

158
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:03,171
<i>This isn't Wendy.</i>

159
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:05,071
Sorry.
Could you put her on, please?

160
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
<i>Dude, this is a Wendy's restaurant.</i>

161
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:10,930
Damnit, Kevin.
Okay...

162
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:15,705
Could I just have a frosty
and a baked potato, please?

163
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:17,563
<i>You've to come here to order food.</i>

164
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:19,735
I'll send somebody to pick it up,
just have it ready.

165
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:21,015
<i>It's ready now.</i>

166
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:22,810
Well, put it aside.

167
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:28,803
- I've collected the rest of the ladies.
- Good, good.

168
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:30,804
Because this batch was awful.

169
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:34,803
- This one says "chair model."
- I wrote that.

170
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:37,102
Michael,
you shouldn't have to settle.

171
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:39,871
This is my pledge to you.

172
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,211
I will find her,
and I will bring her to you.

173
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:45,288
And as God is my witness,

174
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,196
she shall bear your fruit.

175
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,992
That sounds good.

176
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,742
Go get her.

177
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:54,216
Wait!

178
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,788
First go to Wendy's, get my food,
come back, and then go.

179
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,258
That is fantastic.

180
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:04,744
Thank you, thank you very much.
This is just what I needed.

181
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:08,065
The furniture company gave me
the name of the advertising agency.

182
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:09,975
They gave me the name
of the photographer.

183
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:14,005
The photographer, a spaniard,
used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency.

184
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:16,925
The agency gave me
the following information:

185
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:20,198
Debrah Shoshlefski,
142 South Windsor Lane.

186
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:22,689
Dead, car accident.
Case closed.

187
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:24,704
She's dead?

188
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:27,111
She's so young.

189
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:30,102
She was so young
and now, she's dead.

190
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,949
As dead as every dead animal
who has ever died.

191
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:35,660
God.

192
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:40,889
Why don't you sit down, Michael?

193
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,224
Come on.

194
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:46,076
There we go.

195
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,157
Michael, you didn't even know her.

196
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,726
Try not to be so hurtful, Jim.

197
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,517
- Jim, how dare you?
- Not at time like this.

198
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:07,776
Okay, Michael, you know what?
I might have someone for you.

199
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,933
Oh, really? What's her name?
Burgerking?

200
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:12,405
No, I mean it.

201
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,585
She's really nice and sweet and...

202
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,517
you guys might actually get along.

203
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:23,210
I don't think I'm ready...
Is she hot?

204
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,001
I'm setting Michael up
with my landlady.

205
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:27,973
She's really sweet and...

206
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:31,342
Whatever, I just can't
take Michael like this.

207
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:34,737
No question about it,
I am ready to get hurt again.

208
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,543
We need to assemble
the five families.

209
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:40,101
- No, not the five families.
- We have to!

210
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:44,621
The five families are the five companies
of Scranton business park.

211
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:46,559
The bosses rarely meet.

212
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:49,734
There's Michael Scott,
regional manager, Dunder Mifflin.

213
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,405
Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.

214
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:55,658
Paul Faust
of Disaster Kits Limited.

215
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:57,535
They call him "Cool Guy Paul".

216
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:01,520
W.B. Jones
of W.B. Jones heating and air.

217
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,040
Grade a badass.

218
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:05,945
And Bill Cress
of Cress Tool and Die.

219
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,920
Bill Cress is super old
and really mean.

220
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:11,631
Kevin, I don't have
time for this right now.

221
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:14,284
I'm trying to get a date
with Pam's hot friend.

222
00:11:14,764 --> 00:11:16,659
And she needs to meet me right now.

223
00:11:20,474 --> 00:11:22,183
I'm calling the meeting anyway.

224
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,970
Thank you very much.

225
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:29,531
Our suspect
has straight brown hair.

226
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:32,559
She is wearing blue jeans
and a black top.

227
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:34,065
So...

228
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:37,319
behold our bachelorette.

229
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:42,360
Give her a 10 for her looks and
a 3 for her ability to describe herself.

230
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,848
Hello, my lady.

231
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:54,508
Are you Michael Scott?

232
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,053
Is who a Michael what?

233
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:00,870
I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be meeting
someone named Michael.

234
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,432
That's not...
Yeah, I'm not...

235
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:03,594
Michael?

236
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:09,773
Large hot chocolate with caramel
and a shot of peppermint.

237
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:17,831
So you...

238
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:22,210
get the rent checks
every month and...

239
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,564
What happens next?
What...

240
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:29,378
You're asking me what I...

241
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:31,837
do with the checks
that people write to me?

242
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:34,923
Just making conversation.

243
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:37,884
Why is it so hard to meet people?
I... You know, it's...

244
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,012
All I want

245
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:43,432
is somebody nice,
and sweet,

246
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,400
and someone I can talk to

247
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,397
and share an experience with,
you know?

248
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,566
Why is it so hard
for people like us?

249
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:55,985
I don't know.

250
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:01,715
You wanna see what I walked out on?

251
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:04,976
This is going to blow your mind.
Look at that!

252
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,498
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah.

253
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,292
And you can't see her whole body,
down here, she has a boob job.

254
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:12,830
Just...

255
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:17,508
She was just crazy smart
and really manipulative and...

256
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:19,300
I don't know.

257
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:21,137
<i>Michael?
Hello...</i>

258
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:26,600
Well, I'm gonna head out.

259
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:29,679
Well...

260
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,564
I enjoyed this conversation.

261
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,001
It was very nice.

262
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,429
It was like talking to...

263
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:40,320
the sweet, old lady on the bus.

264
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,326
That's incredibly rude.

265
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:47,472
Now you ruined it.

266
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:50,651
Where's Scott?

267
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:54,478
Michael Scott could not make it today
due to an unforeseen prior engagement.

268
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:57,322
- Let's just meet back in an hour.
- Gentlemen, please.

269
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:00,993
We called this meeting.

270
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,448
Andrew Bernard...

271
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:08,489
is the name of me, and this is
my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.

272
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:09,643
I have things.

273
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:11,822
All right, what do you want?

274
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:16,587
Well, first of all, I'd just like to say
what an honor it is to be sitting here

275
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,359
- with you...
- You've 10 seconds.

276
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,499
We want our parking spaces back.

277
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:24,598
- Whose parking spaces?
- W.B. Jones's construction guys

278
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:27,119
park in our parking spaces
every morning,

279
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,220
and some people
have to park really far away

280
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,285
and walk all the way to the office.

281
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,794
And some people...
sweat too much for comfort and...

282
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:36,867
My God.

283
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,269
I don't have time for this, guys.
Just give 'em back their spaces.

284
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,260
- Okay.
- We good? Okay.

285
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:45,596
Could've done this over email.

286
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:52,292
After Stacy left, things...

287
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:55,235
did not go well for a while.

288
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,627
And it was hard to see...

289
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:02,927
It's just nice to win one.

290
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:09,953
Margaret the landlady? Really, Pam?
Is that what you think of me?

291
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,957
She's sweet and... cute.
I thought you would get along.

292
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:17,273
Oh, okay. Well,
I'm looking for a passionate affair,

293
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:18,917
not companionship.

294
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,699
I'm a man of intensity.

295
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:25,490
Of... of cool, and youth,

296
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,638
and...
and passionately.

297
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:28,688
God...

298
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,997
- Margaret?
- I know...

299
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:40,223
You just got yourself
kicked out of your apartment.

300
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:43,691
Oh, I don't care. I don't really like
that place that much anyway.

301
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:45,990
- I'll just move.
- Oh, really?

302
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:48,567
Who's gonna take you in?
You're messy.

303
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,702
You're a klutz,
you spill everything.

304
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:54,497
And you leave the volume on the TV
way too loud.

305
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:55,931
Yeah.

306
00:15:56,374 --> 00:15:59,460
Maybe I'll move in with my boyfriend
'cause he's kind of a slob too.

307
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:00,969
Okay. Sure.

308
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:02,840
Let's do it.

309
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:07,497
No, I...
Well, I'm not gonna... I'm...

310
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,743
I'm not gonna move in
with anyone unless I'm engaged.

311
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,461
Have I not proposed you yet?

312
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:16,185
I don't... No.

313
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:19,846
Well, that's comin'.

314
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:22,334
Oh, right now?

315
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:25,982
No. I'm not gonna do it right here.
That would be rather lame.

316
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,041
Okay, so then when?

317
00:16:28,678 --> 00:16:31,535
I'm not gonna tell you. I hate to break
it to you, but that's not how it works.

318
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:33,367
Oh, right. Yeah.

319
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:35,331
Wait, I'm serious.

320
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:37,152
- It's happening.
- Okay.

321
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:40,985
And when it happens,
it's going to kick your ass, Beesly.

322
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:44,423
So...
Stay sharp.

323
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,252
I've been warned.

324
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:51,469
I am not kidding.

325
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:00,147
Got it a week after we started dating.

326
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:03,276
I don't know, man.

327
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,637
I was with Jan for so long...

328
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:09,520
I was excited
about meeting somebody new.

329
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,020
Put my heart out there.

330
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:17,829
You know what you need?

331
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:20,257
Closure.

332
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:22,536
You're right.

333
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,910
What do you mean though?

334
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:30,087
There was a woman in your life
who affected you very deeply,

335
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,377
and she left
before you could say good-bye.

336
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:35,612
I think you need to say good-bye.

337
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:39,910
Come on.

338
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:41,119
I'll drive.

339
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:43,614
- We did it!
- I did it.

340
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,567
We got our spaces back.

341
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:49,613
Nice job.

342
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:50,796
- Nice.
- Yeah.

343
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,746
There it is.
You're welcome.

344
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:55,994
Did I do this for me?
No.

345
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:58,596
I did this for the little guy.

346
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:00,432
For Joe six-pack,

347
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:03,517
the guy who wakes up every morning
in his $400 a month appartment,

348
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:06,707
wonders how he's gonna pay
his mortgage this month.

349
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,867
Wonders how he's gonna fill
his car up with oil.

350
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,804
Wonders how am I going to pay
my kids' orphanage bills?

351
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:15,077
That guy...

352
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:19,518
shouldn't have to wonder
where he's gonna park.

353
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:38,006
How did she die?

354
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:42,581
I guess you could say
she died of...

355
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,221
blunt force trauma and blood loss.

356
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,813
She got in a car accident and ploughed
into the sight of an airplane hangar.

357
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,189
- God...
- Yeah.

358
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,070
She was so innocent.

359
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,099
She was stoned apparently.

360
00:18:57,388 --> 00:18:58,866
You know, I used to think that...

361
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:02,239
I had this perfect person
out there waiting for me.

362
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,761
But now I know that that's just silly.

363
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:07,025
Because she's dead.

364
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,206
What do you do?

365
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:14,218
You wait till next year's
chair catalogue comes out

366
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:16,405
and find someone who's still alive.

367
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:18,908
- You move on.
- Yeah.

368
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,353
Where do you wanna go for dinner?

369
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:24,554
I don't know. I kinda hate
all our regular places right now.

370
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:28,545
You know what?
That one...

371
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:32,610
Hey, Pam.

372
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:37,929
Will you wait for me one second
while I tie my shoe?

373
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:41,307
- I hate you.
- What?

374
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:44,040
My shoe is untied.
What is your problem?

375
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,510
Oh, my god!
You thought I...

376
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:50,609
- No, no, no.
- How could I have thought that?

377
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:02,454
<i>Bye, bye, miss chairmodel lady</i>

378
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:06,977
<i>I dreamt that we were married</i>

00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:09,857

00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:17,592
<i>Drinking whiskey and rye</i>

382
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:21,849
<i>Why d'you have to go off and die?</i>

383
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:28,179
<i>Why d'you have to go off and die?</i>

384
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,444
<i>You believe in rock'n roll?</i>

385
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:38,018
<i>Can music save your mortal soul?</i>

386
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:40,735
<i>And then, can you have to dance</i>

387
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:44,289

388

<i>Well, I know

389
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:51,366
<i>'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym</i>

390
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:54,083
<i>- Kicked off both her shoes
- Turned off her shoes</i>

391
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:58,361
<i>- No more rhythm and blues!
- No verdict was returned!</i>

392
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:00,407
<i>Rhythm and blues.</i>

393
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:07,728
<i>This will be the day that I die</i>



9999
