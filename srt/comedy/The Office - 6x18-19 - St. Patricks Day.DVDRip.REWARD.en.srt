1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,025
I just wanted to check and see
if there was anything you needed

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,968
before I went on
my maternity leave.

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,169
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.
I'm pregnant.

4
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,270
Great. Well,
I'll write up the order.

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,401
Wait a minute.
Okay, thanks.

6
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:15,346
You can't do that. You cannot
exploit your baby for sales.

7
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,383
Hey, did I tell you
we're gonna have a baby?

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,283
(CHUCKLES) Thank you very
much. I'm excited... Oh.

9
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,985
Definitely.
No. No!

10
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,748
You need to come by
your sales honorably.

11
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,384
There is nothing dishonorable
about talking about your life.

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,984
People like it.

13
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,394
Hey, there.
Dwight Schrute here.

14
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:36,026
Listen, uh, would you be
interested in restocking on paper?

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,303
Yeah, I could sure
use the money.

16
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,205
My cousin came down with a case
of that nasty new goat fungus.

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,738
Oh, it's just horrific.

18
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,712
The doctor says he's never
seen it beard so quickly.

19
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:48,873
Okay.

20
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:56,381
I need a baby. I'll never
outsell Jim and Pam without one.

21
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,220
Also, I've been noticing
a gaping hole in my life.

22
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,855
Sometimes I wake up
cradling a gourd.

23
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,943
Kevin, you're
such a gourmand.

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,012
I cooked my way through
Julia Child's cookbook,

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,820
<i>and now I'm halfway through
The Twilight Cookbook.</i>

26
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,884
Last night, I had
Edward's cornflake chicken.

27
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,287
Hmm.

28
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,764
<i>KEVIN: Pregnant Pam and I, we
get hungry at the same times,</i>

29
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,232
so we've been eating
together a lot. Not all meals.

30
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:49,635
Just second breakfast, lunch,
second lunch and first dinner.

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,308
I thought that maybe we should do
something special for early dinner.

32
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,781
One last ultra feast.

33
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,752
Mmm. That sounds great.
What are you thinking?

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,310
I think it should be
a surprise.

35
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,412
(GROANS)

36
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,785
Getting there, huh?

37
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,451
No, no. I still have time.

38
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,894
I'm having contractions, but
they're irregular and far apart.

39
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,263
So I'm not really in labor,
I'm near labor.

40
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,666
Yeah. We're slow-playing it
because of our stupid HMO.

41
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:17,828
<i>PAM: If we check in
after midnight,</i>

42
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,395
<i>I get an extra day to
recuperate surrounded by doctors.</i>

43
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,940
<i>JIM: Not to mention
the extra night's sleep</i>

44
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,339
<i>in the hospital
will be very nice,</i>

45
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,343
because once we
bring the baby home,

46
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,471
if it's crying all night, one of
us is gonna have to take care of it,

47
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,415
and I do not plan on
helping unless it's a boy.

48
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,044
I cannot wait for
that joke to be over.

49
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,176
Oh.

50
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,654

contrapting! Okay, you know what?

52
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,124
I think that I should drive you guys
to the hospital, and here is why.

54

Michael.
I gassed up the car.

55
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,860
Actually, I put diesel in this
time. Tried to save some money.

56
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:50,960
Michael, you shouldn't
have done that.

57
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,061
Happy to do it.

58
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,107
Also, I did a heck of a job
baby-proofing this office.

59
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,767
You know the baby's not
gonna live here, right?

60
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,435
Well, the baby
was conceived here,

61
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,069
so might as well live
here a little bit, too.

62
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,547
Mmm. That logic's airtight, but
unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.

later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!

Ooh! Spooky. But why?

69
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,854
Because the insurance company
only covers two nights.

70
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,696
Everything's fine.
We have plenty of time.

Well, you don't want
to wait too long, Pam.

Otherwise the baby's gonna
become a teenager in there,

73
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,432
and you'll be up all night

Are you serious? Pam.

95
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,999
No, the doctor said
every five to seven minutes.

96
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,437
I'm gonna be okay. We should
really try to make it to midnight.

Pam, please.

Yeah, no,
you really should,

baby's born tomorrow,

Five minutes apart.

So the plan was seven minutes,
but we're calling an audible,

'cause she's the quarterback.

Guys, a word of advice,
speaking as a former baby.

119
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,090
Don't get too hung
up on baby names.

120
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:38,001
I was named Walter Junior
after my father,

121
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,602
until I was about six or so, when
my parents changed their minds.

122
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,108
I thought you said your younger
brother was named Walter Junior.

123
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,236
My brother was born

124
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,543
and my parents felt he better
exemplified the Walter Junior name,

125
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,345
so they gave it to him.
I was given Andrew,

126
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,613
which they got out
of a baby-name book.

127
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,684
You know what? It's getting
really crowded in here.

128
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,088
Maybe you guys should all go back
to work 'cause the day's not out yet.

No, no, no.
You know what?

You can't tell us
what to do

co-manager anymore.

is gonna prevent Pam

134
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,057
from being able to listen
to her body's signals.

make it till midnight

thinking about it.

Distractions are good!

139
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,569
That means conference room, five
minutes. No, no, five seconds!

to distract others in class.

No, actually, music

Okay. I need complete silence, okay?

You're clapping.
I need complete silence.

Before we conceive a child,

187
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,731
it is important that we bang
out a parenting contract.

Of course.

I've printed out
10 ways to induce labor,

209

the opposite of those things

your labor.

Okay, nobody touch
Pam's nipples.

Think of Pam's nipples
as Toby's grundle.

215
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,428

we should cut holes in her shirt.

like that in my car.

Okay, uh, the second one
is "walk around."

219
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,966
We're already doing
the opposite of that.

Perfect. Okay, number three,
eat spicy foods.

Remember yesterday, when we

We were just kids.
What did we know?

Great.

She can.

Yes.

00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,932
Why was I hiding
behind the plant?

733
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,300
Well, in college
I took a botany class,

734
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,363
and there was lots of
drama in that class. Uh...

735
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,968
Kids would gossip about me,
so I would eavesdrop on them

736
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,781
by hiding behind different
plants in the botany class.

737
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,677
And then they
would say things like,

738
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,378
"Oh, this guy's gonna
fail this class,"

739
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:59,514
or, "What's this guy doing
spying on us from behind plants?"

740
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,183
And then I would
jump out at them

741
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,557
and confront them
and be like,

742
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:07,894
"You think all I do is hide behind
plants and spy on people? Busted."

743
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,431
Oh. The reason?

744
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,961
The reason I was hiding behind
that plant in this situation

745
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:17,030
was that I thought that Erin and
Kevin were kind of hitting it off,

746
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,905

the nipple? PAM: Mmm-hmm.

00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,465
CLARKE: The baby
should grab onto that.

776
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,598
I think she will.

777
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,508
I'm just not sure if I'm releasing,
though. I'm not sure if...

778
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:27,976
We'll figure it out,
probably. CLARKE: It doesn't...

779
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,513
Why don't you bring
your baby over here?

780
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,138
Okay.

781
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,506
She's beautiful. Yes.

782
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,914
Oh, thank you.

783
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,014
Congratulations.
Thank you.

784
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,714
Well, you're doing a good
job. Just stay relaxed

785
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,451
and I'll come back in a
bit to check on you. Okay?

786
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,152
Okay.
Please do.

787
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,023
Oh, shoot. Shoot,
she fell off.

788
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,696
Oh. Uh...

789
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,165
Try the torpedo thing.

790
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,758
Will you just grab
Clarke real quick?

791
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,327
No need. I saw him
do it. I can try it.

792
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,772
Jim, please, please, please. I think
it would be weird if you did it.

793
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:01,005
That makes sense. I'll
just go get the other guy.

794

Hey, what's up, kid?</i>

795
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:08,611
Have you had a chance to look over the
revisions on the contract I prepared for you?

796
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:12,520
Nothing left to do except dot
the I's, the J's and the umlauts.

797
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:16,821
Why don't you meet me here
at exactly mid-late afternoon?

798
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,089
I look forward to it.

799
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,289
Very well.

800
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:21,793

803
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,833
Hmm?

804
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,342
Get the baby.
Get her, come on.

805
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,674
JIM: Okay. (SHUSHING)
I know, I know.

806
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,984
Okay. Come here.

807
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,959
All right.
I got her.

808

(SIGHING)

809
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:00,964
Okay. Okay. Okay.

810
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,003
Jim. She latched.
She latched!

811
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,136
That's amazing.

812
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,874
Oh, my God. I didn't even
have to do the C thing.

813
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,279
That's awesome.

814
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,341
Oh! We're doing it.

815
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,611
That's great.

816
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,313
We're really parents now.

817
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,458
Kevin, Erin would like
a few words with you.

818
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,953
Hey.
Hi.

819
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,358
I've really enjoyed
our time together.

820
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,657
Yeah. Me, too.

821
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,129
I want to continue
working on our friendship...

822
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,392
It was really, really fun.

823
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,559
...'cause I think our friendship
could be a really cool thing.

824
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:31,829
Yeah. Me, too.

825
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,495
And you're my friend.

826
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,770
Yeah. I hope that I'm your friend.

827
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,932
Yeah.
And...

828
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,407
Oh, my God.
This is agonizing.

829
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:43,140
Look, Kevin, do you really think
that you could have dated Erin?

830
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,346
You said she liked me.

831
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,384
Okay, even if someone told
you that, you should know

832
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,251
that that could
never be possible, Kevin.

833
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,456
And I'm surprised that you didn't
question me in the first place.

834
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:55,822
I've done better
than Erin.

835
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:56,917
No, you haven't.

836
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,757
Lynn was way hotter
than Erin, Michael.

837
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,298
Lynn was as hot as Erin.

838
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,263
Yeah, Michael, but
you dated Holly and Jan

839
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,236
and they were so
much hotter than you.

840
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,671
This isn't about me,
and that is debatable,

841
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,834
and I have a personality,
whereas you...

842
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,241
Yes, Andy?

Nice going.

Oh, hey.

00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,364
Pam, she's gorgeous.
Can I hold her?

00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,494
Yes.

851
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,034
She was a little
fussy earlier,

852
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,130
but she's totally
quieted down.

853
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:47,075
Here. Let me just burp her. I
don't want her to spit up on you.

No. Not at all.

How's it going?
Well,

870
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,999
I feel like she needs to eat,
but she just won't latch on,

871
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,563
which is weird,
because the other baby...

(LAUGHING)

873

take your baby home?

We definitely are.
At 3:00, right?

stay until 3:00?

Yeah. You can.

bring the car around.

Right. Okay. Yes. That
would be a smart thing to do.

I will be right back.

have dinner with me? From, Andy."

immediately or you're fired.

00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,158
You read the fax.

935
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,096
I'm asking you out.

936
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:36,131
(CHUCKLES) Oh, my God.
That's amazing!

937
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,870
Let me just fax this
and I'll check my planner.

938
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,579
So, it's a date?
Yes!

939
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,349
Do you have
a day in mind?

940
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,908
ANDY: Yeah, what day?
What day?

941
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,453
ERIN: Every day is fine.

942
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,749
ANDY: What's that one?

943
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,856
ERIN: Thursday?
Okay. Let's do it.

944
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,323
ERIN: (CHUCKLES)
We... Okay!

945
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,856
Would you like me to help
you up out of the chair?

946
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,763
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

947
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,321
We've just got a lot
of discharges today.

948
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,630
Okay. Okay.

949
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:05,726
Thanks.

950
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:06,861
All right, thanks.

951
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,029
All right.

952
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,902
(CECELIA CRYING)

953
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:19,343
Hey. You want to eat?
You want to try eating?

954
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,078
Okay.

955
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,615
Okay. Come here.

956
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:32,519
Just you and me.
Just you and me. Come on.

957
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,722
(CRYING STOPS)

958
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,197
There we go.

959
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,531
Yeah. Oh, yeah!

960
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,239
Like that. Oh.
There we go.

961
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,536
You got it.

962
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,340
Five tickets on
the windshield.

963
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,679
Hey.
Hi.

964
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,584
We did it.

965
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,415
You used my move,
didn't you?

966
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,483
I used a variation
of your move.

967
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,051
(LAUGHS)

968
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,926
<i>MICHAEL: There is no
greater feeling</i>

969
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,192
than when two people who
are perfect for each other

970
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:13,168
overcome all obstacles
and find true love.

971
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:18,272
And that's what I thought that Erin
and Kevin were going to find today.

972
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,508
I think I'm going
to be sick.

973
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,522
Two forms of ID, please.

974
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,151
(CLEARS THROAT)

975
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,454
And now you.
Two forms of ID, please.

976
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:47,362
All right, all is in order.
I just need your signature.

977
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,673
What is it?

978
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,341
Nothing.

979
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,752
All right. How would
you like to celebrate?

980
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,057
Just pour yourself a cup
of apple juice. I feel sick.

981
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,357
What?

982
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,557
I couldn't find your iPod.

983
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:25,074
Give me a couple days.
Be out of your hair.
