00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:08,425
Hi. So I'm doing the "Soap Opera Digest"
crossword puzzle...

2
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,388
...and guess who is the clue
for three down?

3
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:16,183
"Days of Our Lives" star,
blank Tribbiani."

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,311
That's me! I'm blank!

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,941
How cool! We know three down!
I'm touching three down.

6
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,817
Yeah, you are, baby.

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,947
Three down knows I'm married.
What's three down doing?

8
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,783
Do they call to tell you you're in it?

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,661
No. They wanted to do
a profile on me. I said no.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,288
Why'd you say no?

11
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,125
Remember the last interview I did?

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,753
I said I write my own lines,
the writers got mad...

13
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:49,675
...and I fell down an elevator shaft.
Who knows what I'd say now?

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:54,554
If only there was something
in your head to control what you say.

15
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,849
Come on, you'll keep it
in check this time.

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,437
The publicity would be good for you.
You deserve that.

17
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:08,193
In the interview, you could mention,
I don't know, "gal pal Rachel Green."

18
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,531
Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?

19
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:18,329
- Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
- Fine, all right, I'll do it.

20
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:22,708
You have to be there to stop me
if I say something stupid.

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:27,796
Just then, or all the time?
Because we have jobs, you know?

22
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:32,259
We'll be there the whole time.
Just remember:

23
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,720
Gal pal, Rachel Green.

24
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:42,394
I'm gonna be in "Soap Opera Digest"!
And not just in the dumb crossword.

25
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,814
Seriously, proud of you.

26

29
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:30,692
- Thanks for taking the time for this.
- Not at all. Happy to do it.

30
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,487
You think we're being obvious?

31
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:38,992
No. We're just four people with
neck problems, who talk like this.

32
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,370
It's great that we met here.

33
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:47,584
When people hear the magazine's paying,
they want a big, fancy restaurant.

34
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,588
Actually, I didn't know
the magazine was paying.

35
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:56,677
Wouldn't have mattered. I do this
for the fans, not the free food.

36
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,388
- Can I get you anything?
- Coffee.

37
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,599
And I'll have all the muffins.

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,854
- Hey.
- We're not talking.

39
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,357
Oh, finally.

40
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,530
According to your bio,
you've done quite a bit of work.

41
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,116
Anything that you're
particularly proud of?

42
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,539
<i>All you want is a dingle</i>

43
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,708
<i>What you envy's a shwang</i>

44
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,212
<i>A thing through which you can tinkle</i>

45
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,424
"Or play with", "or simply let hang"

46
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,483
<i>This ever happen?</i>
<i>You want a glass of milk...</i>

47
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,904
<i>... but these darn cartons</i>
<i>are so hard to open!</i>

48
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,989
"Boy", "you said it", "Mike."

49
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:05,245
<i>- There's gotta be a better way!</i>
"- There is", "Kevin!"

50
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,792
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>he's ever used this. It's easy.</i>

51
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,754
<i>- This works in any milk carton.</i>
<i>- It is easy.</i>

52
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,466
<i>Now I can have milk every day.</i>

53
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,553
So this is it, Victor?

54
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,725
Yeah, I guess it is. And so...

55
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,771
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

56
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,073
...and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7
in search of alternative fuels.

57
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:48,873
But when I return 200 years from now,
you'll be long gone.

58
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,667
But I won't have aged at all.

59
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:59,841
So you tell your great-great-
granddaughter to look me up.

60
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,012
Because, Adrian...

61
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,056
...baby...

62
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,102
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

63
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,530
Here I come.
I'm coming to fix the copier.

64
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:26,284
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

65
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:32,708
So I just watch them have sex.
And then I say... Wait, here's my line:

66
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,211
"You know", "that's bad"
<i>for the paper tray.</i>

67
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,341
- Nice work, my friend.
- Wait, you see me again.

68
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,636
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

69
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,973
There I am. There I am. There I am.

70
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:52,937
There are so many things,
it's hard to pick just one.

71
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,273
I'm getting coffee. Want anything?

72
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,694
- A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.
- Double latte.

73
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:04,448
- A bagel with only...
- I was just being polite.

74
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:10,787
How about when you're not working?
What do you do in your spare time?

75
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:17,460
Look at this clown. He thinks
he can take up the whole river.

76
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,131
Get out of the way, jackass!

77
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,510
Who names their boat
"Coast Guard", anyway?

78
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,806
That is the Coast Guard.

79
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:33,644
What are they doing out here?
The coast is way over there!

80
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,271
This is unbelievable.

81
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,360
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

82
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,200
Dude, are you trying to kill me?

83
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,543
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

84
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,880
- Isn't the cowboy hat a little much?
- Come on, it's fun!

85
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,844
All right.

86
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,561
Isn't this a woman's hat?

87
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,314
Dude, stop talking crazy
and make us some tea.

88
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,068
We have to turn off the porn.

89
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,405
I think you're right.

90
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,491
- All right, ready?
- One.

91
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,453
- Two, three.
- Three.

92
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,375
That's kind of nice.

93
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,920
- It's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.

94
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,721
- You wanna see if we still have it?
- Yeah.

95
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,140
Free porn! We have free porn here!

96
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,686
In my spare time, I read to the blind.

97
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,232
And I'm also a mento for kids.

98
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,443
- A mento?
- You know, a mento. A role model.

99
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,407
- A mento?
- Right.

100
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:14,161
- Like the candy?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

101
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:22,293
Our readers always want to know how
soap stars stay in such great shape.

102
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,922
Do you have a fitness regime?

103
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,926
We stars usually just try to eat right
and get lots of exercise.

104
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:34,890
You know we've thrown this
without dropping it for an hour?

105
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,349
Are you serious?

106
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:41,730
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't want to jinx it.

107
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:45,526
- Wow, we are pretty good at this.
- Yeah.

108
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,570
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

109
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,283
That's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

110
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,452
My pants are a little loose.

111
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,455
What's wrong with you?

112
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:03,669
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights.

113
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,588
And then I passed out.

114
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:11,969
I haven't been able to stand up since.
But I don't think it's serious.

115
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,097
Sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

116
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,556
No way!

117
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:22,396
If I go to the doctor, it's for this
thing sticking out of my stomach!

118
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,777
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

119
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,613
Damn you, fifteens!

120
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,782
- What is it?
- A trifle. It has layers.

121
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,369
A layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam.

122
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,831
Then custard,
which I made from scratch.

123
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,835
Raspberries, more ladyfingers,
beef sauteed with peas and onions.

124
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,964
Then a little bit more custard.

125
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,093
It tastes like feet.

126
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,388
I like it.

127
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:03,187
- Are you kidding?
- What's not to like? Custard, good.

128
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,398
Jam, good. Meat, good!

129
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,821
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

130
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,909
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

131
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,745
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

132
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,664
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

133
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,793
- That's still in there?
- Not anymore.

134
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,795
This piece doesn't have floor on it.

135
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,633
- Stick to your side.
- Hey, come on, now.

136
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,813
All right, what are we having?

137
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:55,614
I don't believe in these crazy diets.
Just everything in moderation.

138
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,615
Your muffins.

139
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,745
I'll take those to go.

140
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,289
For the kids.

141
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,501
I know what I wanted to ask.

142
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,713
They killed you off years ago.
What happened there?

143
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:16,260
I said some stuff in an interview
I shouldn't have said.

144
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,681
- But that is not gonna happen today.
- Understood.

145
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,810
- So, what'd you say back then?
- I said that l...

146
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,979
- Hey, Joey!
- How you doing?

147
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:37,156
This is Shelly. She's interviewing me.
Shelly, these are my friends.

148
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:42,369
Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.
If you want the dirt, come to me.

149
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:46,457
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?

150
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:51,211
I'm just kidding.
Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.

151
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,633
Who just lost the respect
of her unborn child.

152
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,594
I'm gonna go get this warmed up.

153
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:02,222
- You're doing great.
- So far, nothing stupid.

154
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,475
- Mento?
- No, thanks.

155
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:11,648
As Joey's friends, is there anything
our readers should know?

156
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,860
No, just that he is a great guy.

157
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,029
That'll get you
into "Soap Opera Digest."

158
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,656
Well, l...

159
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,034
I'd like to say that Joey...

160
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:26,955
...truly has enriched
the days of our lives.

161
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:32,002
I think that you don't expect
someone so hot to be so sweet.

162
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:36,799
- I like that. What's your name?
- Phoebe Buffay.

163
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:42,262
- How do you spell that?
- It's P as in Phoebe. H as in Heebie.

164
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,723
O as in Obie. E as in Ebie.

165
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:49,937
B as in Beebee.
And E as in, "'ello there, mate!"

166
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,023
Great. It was nice meeting you.

167
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,026
- Yeah, you too.
- Thanks.

168
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:01,323
It seems you have a lot of friends.
Who is your best friend?

169
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,579
How come you have two?

170
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,749
Well, this one's for you.

171
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,794
- Get out!
- No, I can't.

172
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:20,301
I know how much this means to you.
This isn't just about jewelry.

173
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:25,723
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're best buds.

174
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,769
Is this friendship? I think so!

175
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,898
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!

176
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,650
That's what they'll call us!

177
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,739
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

178
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,451
That's gonna leave a stain.

179
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,663
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

180
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,833
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

181
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:01,675
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know!

182
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:09,308
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food. Jeez!

183
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,020
I feel guilty.
I wanna be a good friend...

184
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:18,066
...and damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

185
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,282
You are a good friend.

186
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,327
The audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.

187
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,292
But that was a hell of a kiss.
Rachel is a very lucky girl.

188
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,840
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

189
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,926
And they're off!

190
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,429
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge!

191
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,307
Judge rules: No violation.

192
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:56,271
- The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
- No! That's just an old won ton.

193
00:14:56,522 --> 00:15:00,109
Judge rules: Nutter Butter!

194
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,569
Tough call.

195
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:08,742
- I saw it on the Discovery Channel.
- Wait a minute. I saw that!

196
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,912
Yeah, about jellyfish,
and how if you...

197
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,877
You peed on yourself?

198
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,673
You can't say that! You don't know!

199
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,968
I thought I'd pass out from the pain.

200
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:31,682
Anyway, I tried,
but I couldn't bend that way.

201
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,061
So...

202
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,861
That's right, I stepped up!

203
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,075
She's my friend and she needed help!

204
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,913
If I had to,
I'd pee on any one of you!

205
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,252
Nope. No best friend.

206
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,380
Just a lot of close friends.

207
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,925
So now back to the show.

208
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:11,347
How does it feel
to have a huge gay fan base?

209
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,724
Really? Me?

210
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:18,145
Wow, I don't even know
any huge gay people.

211
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,982
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.

212
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,737
Now, off the record, you're not...

213
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,074
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

214
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,287
At first, it just looked good,
but it's practical.

215
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,624
It's got compartments for stuff:
Your wallet, your keys.

216
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,044
Your makeup.

217
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:46,840
Should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

218
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:52,596
...or should I climb down your back
so we're butt to face?

219
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,516
- I think face is best.
- Yeah, face.

220
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:59,895
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

221
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:06,193
Oh, my...
How much do you weigh, Ross?

222
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:11,740
I prefer not to answer that. I'm still
carrying a little holiday weight.

223
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:24,879
When we said "face to face," we didn't
think it all the way through!

224
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,131
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey!

225
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,594
Check it out.

226
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,309
How much of a man am I?

227
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,106
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.

228
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,691
You're turning into a woman.

229
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:52,239
No, I'm not! Why would you say that?
That's just mean!

230
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,201
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

231
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,205
Not what you said,
it's just the way you said it.

232
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,500
Oh, my God! I'm a woman!

233
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,930
- Great nap.
- It really was.

234
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,695
Me? Gay? No. No. No.

235
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,407
But I have a number
of close friends who are.

236
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,995
So let's talk about women.

237
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:44,125
I'm sure our female readers are
interested in your romantic life.

238
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:48,087
What I do is, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

239
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:52,049
"Hey. How you doing?"

240
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,761
Oh, please.

241
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,972
Hey. How you doing?

242
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,188
Hey. How you doing?

243
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,274
He has an amazing Porsche under there.

244
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:14,071
I'd love to show you, but I just
tucked her in. She's sleeping.

245
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,741
Would you two girls
like to go for a drink?

246
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:27,000
- Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
- Oh, my God! Jill!

247
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,294
- Oh, my God! Rachel!
- Oh, hi!

248
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:33,757
- Oh, my God! Introduce us!
- Well, this is Chandler.

249
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:37,845
You know Monica and Ross.
That's Phoebe. That's Joey.

250
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:41,306
- Hey, how you doing?
- Don't!

251
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:48,897
You're a really nice guy. I'm happy
to be your roommate and friend.

252
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:54,278
I'm just... You know, I just
don't feel that way about you.

253
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:59,158
I see what happened.

254
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,995
It's because I was trying
to repel you. Right?

255
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:08,625
Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

256
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,754
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do.

257
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,049
How you doing?

258
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,845
I'm okay.

259
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,224
What? Oh, dear God!

260
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,731
Not much to tell there.
I'm really shy.

261
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:36,111
So that's it.
I guess that's all I need.

262
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,491
Thank you so much.
I think they'll run this next month.

263
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,744
Oh, great. Great. Thank you.

264
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,371
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

265
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,875
- I did it.
- Amazing.

266
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:54,254
Wait, I almost forgot.
We have to ask everybody this:

267
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:58,008
Other than "Days",
what's your favorite soap opera?

268
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:04,014
Oh, I don't watch soap operas.
Excuse me? I have a life, you know?

269
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,353
The readers at "Soap Opera Digest"
will be happy to learn that.

270
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,230
Good enough.

271
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,611
So close.

272
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:26,746
They didn't put in the part
about you not watching soaps.

273
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:31,625
I called the lady and said I
was joking. She was nice about it.

274
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:35,087
- You slept with her, didn't you?
- A little bit.

275
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,258
This picture of you is steamy.

276
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:43,887
That's just a little something
for my huge gay fan base.

277
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:48,517
- Did you just wink at me?
- You're the one who loves the picture.

278
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:54,732
