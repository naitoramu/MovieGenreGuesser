1
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,291
Chef Cesare!

2
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,166
Welcome to L'Allegria!

3
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:56,125
-Let's all applaud Chef César.
-Bravo! Ha ha!

4
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,083
<i>-Forza!</i>
<i>-Forza!</i>

5
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,291
How are you, <i>buono?</i>
Is the pasta good?

6
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,875
Huguito, how much did we make?

7
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,250
This here, $54,200.

8
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,833
Ah, nice, nice, nice.

9
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,791
In a year, no more having
to repay the bank.

10
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,166
Take it slow. You know, it'll get better.

11
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,291
Whoa! Is that a new shirt?
You meetin' someone?

12
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,208
Ah, my classes for mambo.

13
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,916
And Huguito's trying it out!

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,083
Sunday at seven
is your meet date? Get out with that.

15
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,833
This is called being social!

16
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,708
Yeah, I still have a family.

17
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,625
-Okay, see you. Get some rest.
-Mambo!

18
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,416
Hey, Papa.

19
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,541
Hey, how's it goin'?

20
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,375
-Good, good. And you?
-Good.

21
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,125
-What are you up to?
-My homework for tomorrow.

22
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,750
Do you believe our neighbors
got themselves a parrot?

23
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,166
-A parrot?
-Yeah. They made it speak.

24
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,333
Hello!

25
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,416
Hello.

26
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,791
-How are you? How's it going?
-I'm good. Are you?

27
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,125
-Oh, yes.
-That's great.

28
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,375
-Mwah!
-And we'll be much better on vacation.

29
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,166
You don't say.
Can you guess what I just did?

30
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,250
-What?
-To our Europe trip?

31
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,166
I added Vienna and Prague.

32
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,458
Oh… kay.

33
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,041
-That's pretty awesome, right?
-Yeah.

34
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,833
-We'll talk later, okay?
-Okay.

35
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,291
You up for soccer?

36
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,500
Yeah? Come play!

37
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,833
-Oh, I'll join you!
-Come!

38
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,833
-Yeah, I'll put my tennis shoes on.
-Okay.

39
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,250
All right, you're goin' down.

40
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,791
-Let's go!
-Yeah.

41
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,708
Go!

42
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,208
That's it! That's it.
Go, go, go! Get it! Get it!

43
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,166
Hey, listen.

44
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,958
You gotta analyze players
on the other side

45
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,416
in order to learn their strategy.

46
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,166
-You don't wanna be surprised, okay?
-Yeah.

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,416
-Yeah, attaboy.
-Hey, wait, please don't mess up my hair.

48
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,375
When you're hanging out
with Lupita, you don't talk like that.

49
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,916
How do you know I like Lupita?

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,208
About your special friend Lupita?
Please. I'm your dad! I know everything!

51
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,666
Your party. Invite her to it.

52
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,166
-Sure.
-Invite her.

53
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,625
-I already did it.
-Okay, then.

54
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,791
-Who are you talking about?
-No one.

55
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,083
-Oh, the two of you.
-Go!

56
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,375
-Man, that's cruel.
-Go!

57
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,791
-Go!
-Enrique, shoot it!

58
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,208
-Ready?
-Okay.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,125
Fine.

60
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,208
Go.

61
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,416
-The parrot!
-Fuck you.

62
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,000
His diction is perfect!

63
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:11,916
Mom…

64
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,375
Come here.

65
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,875
Are those pajamas with animals all over?

66
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,291
Eh?

67
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,500
Ame…

68
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,375
Keepin' those to wear
for the next 40 years?

69
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,958
-Exactly.
-Yeah?

70
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,083
Forty is the new 12 after all.

71
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,666
Well…

72
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,041
How's organizing Enrique's First Communion
been going?

73
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,375
-Very good.
-Good.

74
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,625
-My best.
-Yeah? Guests? Music?

75
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,250
-Totally, totally under control.
-Perfect.

76
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,500
It's always perfect
because you know how I handle things.

77
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,416
When have I let you down?

78
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,958
-When have I let you down?
-Never.

79
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,416
Never. Mm…

80
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,375
Pajamas make me act like an animal.

81
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, do they?

82
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,208
Almost like I'm… a lion.

83
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,125
A lion?

84
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,666
Well, come eat me, lion.

85
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,583
You're planning something
for your birthday?

86
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,125
No. Gotta plan First Communion
for Enrique.

87
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,916
-This vacation, so much going on.
-Fine.

88
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,333
You're planning Communion for Enrique.

89
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:23,875
Amelia is planning her vacation in Europe.
And your birthday?

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,375
Okay, listen.

91
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:30,125
You're trying too hard
to act familial, all altruistic.

92
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,625
Trust me,
it's gonna come back to bite you.

93
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:37,666
Or you'll turn into a heroin aficionado,
or alcoholic, or a sudoku fanatic.

94
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,708
-Sudoku?
-Yes, sudoku.

95
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,000
-No.
-Come on, Cesare. Come on!

96
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,458
-Yeah!
-How about all that gastritis?

97
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,166
Is it helping, that medicine?

98
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,416
Eh, not much.

99
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,500
Now you're throwing medicine out
or is it that the medicine's not working?

100
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,916
I mean, my gastritis is emotional.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,166
-I know how to make it better.
-How?

102
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,291
When it's you and me going solo in Cancún.

103
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,208
-Cancún?
-Mm-hm.

104
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,833
And get ready.

105
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,250
We're invited by <i>Delicacies</i> magazine.

106
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,958
Which means we're taking part
in the Grand Prix

107
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,625
for all the major small restaurants
in Mexico.

108
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,000
-They selected us?
-Oh, we're in!

109
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:16,958
Yeah?

110
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,750
Yeah! Great! Great!

111
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,625
Ten years paying off like this finally!

112
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,291
Finally, yeah!

113
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,041
Mr. Paolo, telephone from Italy.
It's your ex-spouse.

114
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,083
Which one?

115
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,041
Uh, it's, uh, Sabrina.

116
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,666
The worst.

117
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,166
Thank you, Juan Pablo.

118
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,333
Believe that?

119
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,708
Two former spouses,
living with my children in Italy.

120
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,291
And it's me they pursue.

121
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,166
I'm a good example.
My exes all love me. Love me.

122
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,041
Eh…

123
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,125
-What?
-Go. Go talk to her.

124
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,208
Yes, Sabrina.

125
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,708
Yes, I know college is important,

126
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,791
but 10,000 euros?

127
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,041
No, Sabrina. Don't call the lawyer.

128
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,500
I'll take care of it. Give me a few days.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,250
Ciao, Sabrina. No lawyers!

130
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,375
<i>Cazzo!</i>

131
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,625
Hey, what's happening?

132
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,500
César, we have to win
this contest for the magazine

133
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,833
because the prize is $20,000.

134
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,041
Plus, the publicity if you
and I end up beating everyone.

135
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:27,166
Yes, the publicity, yes, but it's $20,000.

136
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,458
We could surprise them
with a <i>pennette al </i>pesto

137
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,708
with caramelized red snapper?

138
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,708
Or simply present them a pizza
with artichokes? Or something like that?

139
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,250
I like that approach,
but to win will take all our concentration

140
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,416
because the prize is--

141
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,291
-$20,000.
-$20,000.

142
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,791
<i>Ecco.</i>

143
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,458
Thank you.

144
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,625
Hello, Mom.

145
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,041
Hey! Mwah!

146
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,333
How are you?

147
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,458
-Ah, marvelous.
-I'm glad you came.

148
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,625
Champions in your forties!

149
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,916
Could be, could be.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,666
Getting into this contest is fantastic,
no matter what happens.

151
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,583
Yeah, we'll see.

152
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,541
Your middle age shines bright
and successful.

153
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,791
Your father, at your age,
looked like he wanted to be done.

154
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,333
Hm. Maybe he didn't just look like that.

155
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,500
His stamina just gave out on him.

156
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,750
Only made it to the age of 41.

157
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,041
Anyway, I think you look great,
by the way.

158
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,666
You eat healthy,
you seem well, and you exercise.

159
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,833
I've got no doubt at all
you'll live to 100.

160
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,625
No more, no more. Don't jinx it.

161
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,916
But even if I don't live to 100,

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
may you forever remember one thing, César.

163
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,000
What?

164
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,416
If not for poor old me--

165
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,166
Without you, he'd have nothing.
And certainly, he'd lack direction.

166
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,500
Paolo…

167
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,875
Wait a second.
Yes, soon I could have Alzheimer's,

168
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,666
but my famous proverbs
aren't so easily forgotten.

169
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,833
They're not even yours.

170
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,000
-Anyway, you look fantastic, Yolanda.
-Doesn't she?

171
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,333
-Thank you.
-A beauty.

172
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,625
-Uh?
-<i>Ay, ay, ay.</i>

173
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,958
-Huh?
-My poker match today.

174
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,958
Excuse me. I'm here to say hello
and congratulations to you two.

175
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,125
Mwah!

176
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,500
Thank you for coming.

177
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,833
And, really, my thanks for all the advice
you've given me in the kitchen.

178
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,583
Ah, for you, always.

179
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,666
Bye.

180
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,333
Make sure you behave in Cancún.

181
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,666
-Of course.
-And conquer!

182
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,500
The boy's here.

183
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,416
Quiet. You should've called.

184
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,125
-Don't show up to the house like this.
-Amelia, I missed you.

185
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,750
No, no, no. Cut it out! Cut it out!

186
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,958
-Hello?
-Oh, it's César!

187
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,916
-Hey.
-This is Horacio, my friend from…

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,875
-Good evening. My pleasure.
-Evening. Pleasure.

189
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,166
-How are you?
-Good.

190
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,166
My wife's friends are always welcome.

191
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:54,291
Well, I might use something
other than "friend"--

192
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,083
Horacio, he spent some time away.

193
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,333
Yeah? Where? The United States?

194
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,166
No. A penitentiary at San Rafael.

195
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,416
Ten years.

196
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,500
-Oof. What a long time.
-Just got out yesterday.

197
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,541
And I wanted to catch up
with Amelia immediately.

198
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,000
-And the boy.
-The boy?

199
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:13,916
Hi.

200
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,833
When I started seeing you,
I was still dating Horacio.

201
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,458
He was unfairly imprisoned a month later…

202
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,666
but I realized I was pregnant.

203
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,083
How do you know he's the father?

204
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,958
The timing.

205
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,625
-But did you get a paternity test or--
-Yes.

206
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,208
Horacio was incarcerated
and all I had was you.

207
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,208
Thank you.

208
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,291
If you've never partaken
in <i>polpette alla calabrese,</i>

209
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,416
you've never lived, eh?

210
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,958
Beautiful selection.

211
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,125
My friends, the secret to beef's flavor

212
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,958
isn't just marinating it in <i>cirò rosso,</i>

213
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,750
it's in the airplane too.

214
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:40,666
Air travel enhances
the beef's exceptional sensory qualities.

215
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,125
Cesare!

216
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,666
Hey!

217
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,458
Beautiful selection, truly.

218
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,750
Three orders on their way!

219
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:47,958
Cesare!

220
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,250
Come on.

221
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,166
Cesare!

222
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,500
So?

223
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,916
What's happening?

224
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,416
How am I supposed to deal with this?

225
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,958
What can I do?

226
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:10,958
Hm. Well…

227
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,708
César,

228
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,833
tell me, what will make this better?

229
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,375
I don't know.

230
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,208
All people ever want
is to give things meaning,

231
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,416
but what for?

232
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,666
Because one day you realize it's the end.

233
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,375
This is the end.

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,208
Please excuse us.

235
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,541
I mean, it's not hopeless.
I get it. You're suffering.

236
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,791
My marriage.

237
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,916
Amelia's made me a fool.
For ten years, my marriage's been a joke!

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,583
-Well, sure, but--
-So what? I've been used!

239
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:57,208
I have raised her family because for her,
I acted like a complete idiot!

240
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,916
-It's all my fault.
-Do not blame yourself for this.

241
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Because you are an excellent father

242
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,916
and may I say an incredible husband?

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,458
-That's right.
-Yes.

244
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,666
In this case,
it's clear the responsible one

245
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,125
is that… bitch,
that motherfucking bitch Amelia.

246
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,541
Hey, hey, hey…

247
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,083
don't say things like that.

248
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,500
What a motherfucking bitch!

249
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,208
Enough with that fucking horn!

250
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,166
<i>Vaffanculo!</i>

251
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,958
But seriously,
you gotta stop honking the horn. Stop!

252
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,166
-Hey, I have an idea.
-Huh?

253
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,416
Or how about this?
How about you park your car right now,

254
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,875
you come up, and sleep on the sofa?

255
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,625
-On the sofa? No.
-Yes.

256
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,333
I promise you,
tomorrow you'll wake up feeling better.

257
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:46,375
You'll see. Don't be so depressed
since there's so much good in your life.

258
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,625
There's your family,
and your buddies, your job,

259
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,125
and oh, your mom
and her excellent health. Hm?

260
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,083
I swear I didn't see this coming at all.

261
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,541
Dearest Yolanda,

262
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,250
a mother, a friend.

263
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:15,916
It's our responsibility
to take part in laying you to rest.

264
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,958
Did your mom find out
about the situation with Amelia?

265
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,125
No. No, I didn't tell her.

266
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,541
Well, that's for the best.

267
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,416
DELICACIES - GRAND PRIX
BEST SMALL RESTAURANTS

268
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,875
What do you think of the hotel?

269
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,458
Fine. Fine, let's go.

270
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,791
César, promise me,
do me a favor, if only for five days

271
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,375
that you'll forget your worries.

272
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,000
You'll have plenty of time
to think about Enrique, Amelia,

273
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,750
about all your pending issues.

274
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:06,333
But we're here, so simply concentrate
on your well-being and the contest.

275
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,541
Too much to beg for?

276
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,291
-I promise.
-Okay.

277
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,625
Hm?

278
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No, wait a second. I packed my pants,
but they're not in there.

279
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,208
-Check your suitcase.
-All right. I'll check.

280
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,708
-What the hell?
-Come here, honey.

281
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,833
Hey, the water's great! Yeah.

282
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,041
You should get in!

283
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,541
Look! Look at how beautiful!

284
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,291
Yeah, gorgeous.

285
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,083
What are they called?

286
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,041
No idea, but I'm sure we could find out.

287
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,833
I'd love to take 'em to my hotel suite.

288
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,291
Oh, me too, buddy.

289
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,416
I love those flowers.
A favorite of my mama.

290
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,083
Flowers?

291
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,875
Yeah, so pretty.

292
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:06,791
Hey!

293
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,916
-Hey!
-Chef Marini!

294
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,916
Nice to meet you, Mr. Director.

295
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,625
Hey, Chef Benavides!

296
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,416
Pleased to have you at my hotel.
How have you been?

297
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,458
It's excellent! It's perfect.
We're just enjoying a peek at the flowers.

298
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,291
Ah, right.

299
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,333
Please, I'd like to present
one of my assistants at your service

300
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,916
Ignacio Méndez.

301
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,875
-How do you do?
-Pleased to meet you.

302
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,583
As I said, a pleasure, truly.

303
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,833
Well, Ignacio will help you
with anything at all.

304
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,791
Not only this contest.

305
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:44,125
Whatever hotel services,
activities, excursions. Anything.

306
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,208
Well, thanks so much.

307
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,416
Please enjoy your day
and also the flowers.

308
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,250
So you know…

309
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,000
their names, lilies.

310
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,916
Those two?

311
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,833
Mm…

312
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,375
Lilies.

313
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,666
All of you will be working
with the exact same equipment.

314
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,958
Although you can personalize
the dishes as you like.

315
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,458
A panel of five experts
will be examining each of your dishes.

316
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:17,333
This panel will be made up
of foreign colleagues and critics,

317
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,500
and bear in mind that a public jury

318
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,833
will be randomly selected
each and every night

319
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,000
and composed of five guests staying
at the hotel.

320
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,291
-Is that clear for all of you?
-Yes!

321
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,833
Then you will begin at once!

322
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,666
Chef Marini.

323
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,500
-Permit me a moment, if you please.
-Sure, why not? Let's talk.

324
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,333
How are you?

325
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,833
Oh, happy to be here.

326
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:43,458
It pleases me to know
that you, chef, along with Chef Benavides

327
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,833
form a part of our very select group.

328
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,000
But…

329
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,208
I should be honest with you.

330
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,958
A few of the partners
of <i>Delicacies</i> magazine

331
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,250
said that they don't buy
that you should be participating

332
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,083
in this culinary contest.

333
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,375
The respected reputation
of L'Allegria has been due to its concept,

334
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,208
cuisine, and entertainment.

335
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,250
Well, thank you.

336
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,000
Your clients all leave… enchanted

337
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,583
'cause of your jokes,

338
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,375
or 'cause of your songs,

339
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,750
and maybe your cooking as well.

340
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,541
But before you can convince my colleagues,

341
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:26,916
on this occasion, the only thing
that better shine is the cuisine.

342
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,958
So for that reason,

343
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,541
not a single joke.

344
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:33,958
Yes?

345
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,333
Not a single song

346
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,833
or anything that will act as a diversion.

347
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,750
-Mm?
-Don't worry.

348
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,458
No diversions whatsoever.

349
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,875
That's a promise.

350
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,458
-How are we on time?
-Good. We're good.

351
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,333
There. We got this.

352
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,333
<i>Signorina.</i>

353
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,625
Thank you.

354
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,583
<i>Signore.</i>

355
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,750
My dear Chef Robles.

356
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,750
<i>Forza!</i>

357
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:25,666
Hm.

358
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:38,916
Hey.

359
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,958
Sh-sh.

360
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,666
Um, is this lobster?

361
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,791
Yes.

362
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,000
Is it true that…

363
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,208
that lobster is…

364
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,500
an aphrodisiac?

365
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,041
Huh?

366
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,750
Well, let's hope not.

367
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,250
We've passed through
the preliminary round.

368
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,000
Mm.

369
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,875
We are extremely lucky.

370
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,583
The garlic's overpowering. It's a lot.

371
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:32,958
Ah…

372
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,666
<i>"The Concept of Anxiety,</i> Kierkegaard."

373
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,125
-Eh, no more of that.
-Hey! Seriously?

374
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,958
<i>"Death of a Salesman, </i>by Arthur Miller."

375
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,000
-Stop! Wait. Let go.
-What's goin' on with you? No!

376
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,833
-My crosswords! Please don't take it.
-Let go!

377
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,000
The only thing keeping me sane
is doing a task that I can pull off.

378
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,833
Okay, if it helps.

379
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,958
But promise me you'll let go
of acting so nihilistic. Yeah?

380
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,083
By being a bit happier.

381
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,000
Jesus.

382
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,875
"Nihilism" and "being happier"
don't mix like that.

383
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,458
All right, let's go, chef.

384
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:11,458
The paella. You've got rice,
you've got shrimp, chicken,

385
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,666
plus fish, pork,
and anything else you like.

386
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,000
The paella has demonstrated
that everything goes with everything!

387
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,125
Very well, very well.
Yeah, I'll compromise.

388
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,083
Well, we going exploring today?

389
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,541
You two, like the place?

390
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,750
Oh, it's rad, Méndez,
everything here is incredible!

391
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,791
Paolo, can you stop saying "rad"?
You sound like my father.

392
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,083
Are you really looking at old photos?

393
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,958
Okay, this is gonna stay with me
until your mood improves.

394
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,458
-Hey! Give it back!
-Look out there!

395
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,625
This is for you!
Pay attention! Take this in!

396
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,000
It's so hot here.

397
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,000
Plan on staring much?

398
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,208
Please, my eyes
could gaze forever upon you.

399
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:02,958
If you please.

400
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,708
As long as it doesn't bother you.

401
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,708
This cenote has been there for many years.

402
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,583
You, on the other hand,

403
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:14,125
are a wonderful mirage
that may disappear at any second.

404
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,583
See that?

405
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,291
A Don Juan.

406
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,000
He mixes his shamelessness with poetry.

407
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:22,916
Let's go.

408
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,458
He says if you can make paella with,
you know, shrimp, chicken, and sausage,

409
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,333
then anything can be mixed with anything.

410
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,500
-Uh-huh.
-Hm?

411
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,083
Hey, Selina, let's go, yeah?

412
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,166
What?

413
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,250
Okay!

414
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,000
Hey, hey! Help me!

415
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,833
-Help me!
-Ma'am, what's wrong?

416
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,500
Get me out of here, please!

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,208
-Please help! Someone!
-Okay, okay, okay, okay!

418
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,500
Ah! Please hurry!

419
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,625
Help me!

420
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,875
Help me! Get me out of here!
Something bit me!

421
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,708
-My leg! It got bit!
-Relax, relax. Don't look.

422
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,708
-Tell me what happened. What happened?
-Something bit me in the leg.

423
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,833
Nothing bit you. It must have been…

424
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,958
-What? What in the world is it?
-A snake!

425
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,708
Relax! No, you've gotta relax.

426
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:12,833
Take it easy, take it easy.
Let me go. Let me go.

427
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,875
-Let go, let go, let go!
-Please.

428
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,500
-Please. Take me back.
-Hold on. Careful. Careful.

429
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,458
Here. Careful.

430
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,208
-Is it gone?
-Yes, it's gone.

431
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:23,083
-I'm going.
-This step. Put it here.

432
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,000
Put it here. Careful.

433
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,416
-Ah! Eh…
-Yep. Step up here.

434
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,416
Ah, careful.

435
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,916
Uh…

436
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,125
You okay?

437
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,708
Tell you, when I saw you, I said,
"She's a musician

438
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,041
or the leader of a band."
That's what I thought.

439
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,500
-You serious?
-Mm-hm.

440
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,625
Well, I used to play in a band.

441
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:46,791
Then, well…

442
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,083
I moved on.

443
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,333
My study is interior design.

444
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:57,125
Oh, me, I'm interested
in studying interior design

445
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:01,250
or, like, being in touch
with my own interior. Staying zen.

446
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,833
Eh, it's designing interiors?

447
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,291
I'm joking.

448
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,208
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

449
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,708
Hey, and does that…

450
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:13,250
Have you had those…
those great opportunities in life?

451
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,666
-Yes.
-Ah, well, what are they?

452
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,541
It's right here.

453
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,833
With you.

454
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,083
Hm.

455
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,375
Heh.

456
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,875
Oh, uh, my God.

457
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:32,708
Eh…

458
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,416
Mm, hm-hm.

459
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,833
Eh, pretty funny!

460
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,291
You bastard!

461
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,750
Oh wow!

462
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,416
-Yeah.
-I thought she was a crazy lady.

463
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,875
-You know?
-Uh-huh.

464
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,250
Believed you completely.

465
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,500
It's been almost an hour, no?

466
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:55,416
-And sitting next to a lunatic.
-Eh…

467
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,750
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

468
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:57,958
Ow! Ow!

469
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:02,166
The bandages should be changed every day.
And be sure to take these for a week.

470
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,958
Doctor, are you really sure,
absolutely sure that nothing bit me?

471
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,791
Because I'm in pain like I was bitten--

472
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,791
Don't worry about it.
The bite was just a cut from a rock.

473
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,625
-Mm…
-And you, sir, are gonna need some rest.

474
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,291
-I'd say two weeks.
-Huh?

475
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,666
For that sprained ankle.

476
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,875
Fourteen days?

477
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:18,541
Have a nice afternoon.

478
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,833
Ha ha.

479
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:23,708
And who thought this vacation
would've brought me to a hospital?

480
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,166
Eh, to be fair,

481
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,791
I think you're a little bit better off
than I am.

482
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,791
You seriously have to cook
with your injury?

483
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,958
Oof.

484
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:14,416
Go.

485
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:45,208
Mm…

486
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:47,958
Mm!

487
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,708
Mm! Very good. Fine.

488
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:50,750
Very good.

489
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,583
-Let's go! Woo!
-Hey!

490
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,333
-Second victory!
-Yeah.

491
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:58,583
<i>Grandissimi!</i>

492
00:26:58,666 --> 00:26:59,750
Mm.

493
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:02,416
-To us.
-The semifinal waits before us.

494
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:03,958
Mm.

495
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,500
-We did well. We did well.
-Mm!

496
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,291
We did even better!

497
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:11,625
Those two guys at The Spanish Flavor
had won multiple times.

498
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:14,000
They didn't have the same motivation.

499
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:17,583
-Here it is, Cesare, a proposal for you.
-What?

500
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:20,916
How about we rendezvous
at the bar and pool area

501
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,125
and in the meantime,
we go back to Selina and Naomi, huh?

502
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,875
Oh no, no, no. That's bad. That's bad.

503
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:30,541
Ah, well, how do I look?

504
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,000
-Fine.
-Fine?

505
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,291
Better look out, I'm gone.

506
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,291
Huh?

507
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,958
Oh! Hey!

508
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,708
I'll take this. See you, buddy!

509
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,875
-Are you serious right now?
-I am serious.

510
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,125
Take care!

511
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:44,875
Oh shit.

512
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:53,708
Hello, Papa.

513
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,541
Hey there, Quique. How are you?

514
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:58,375
Fine. Watching TV. I'm bored.

515
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,166
Calling to talk to Mom?

516
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,333
No, no, just wanted to speak with you.

517
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:04,000
So, how's the contest?

518
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,375
Good. Very good. We've passed two rounds.

519
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,041
<i>That's great!</i>

520
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,041
Hey, Papa?

521
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,416
Are you angry with me?

522
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,875
No, no, of course not.

523
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,875
No. What happened was,
I've just been in a bad mood.

524
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:20,750
But it has nothing to do with you.
I promise.

525
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,041
It's just complicated. Very complicated.

526
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,875
Mm. Okay.

527
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,000
But, um, if it stays complicated,

528
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,666
are we canceling the party
for my First Communion?

529
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,083
We don't know, honestly.
We haven't properly discussed it.

530
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:39,291
Mom is coming. Gotta go. I gotta go.

531
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:45,583
What are you doing up?
At this hour? It's already ten.

532
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:48,333
No, it's too late.
It's not time for TV. Time to go to bed.

533
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,208
Consider how you were in your time.

534
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,416
Remember you were impossible to control.

535
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,625
-Me?
-Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

536
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,208
Wait a second. In what sense?

537
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:05,083
Every one. Don't make me
discuss this in front of her.

538
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:09,208
Hey, Ame, maybe I could do
a Russian salad for dinner tomorrow,

539
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:12,583
but can't remember
if Horacio likes mayonnaise or not.

540
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:15,083
Sure, I think he likes it.
He did ten years ago.

541
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:16,583
-Yeah? Oh.
-Sure.

542
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,208
Oh, what a horrible mess
I've made for myself.

543
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,833
Amelia, oh, Amelia.

544
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:25,958
Pour your heart out, Amelia.

545
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,166
You're not on trial.

546
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,416
You don't need to bring me in.

547
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:37,041
I can't believe this happened, Ame,

548
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,458
and that you chose to date two men
at the same time.

549
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:42,125
Because you were
with Horacio and César at the same time.

550
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:43,083
It is not right.

551
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,958
Well, what exactly do you wanna hear, Mom?

552
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,250
It was confusing.
I didn't know what to do.

553
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,750
I was just a kid, you know?

554
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:51,750
No, no, no, no, no, no.

555
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,791
No, not a kid. No.

556
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,500
You can't claim you're a kid

557
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,166
when you'd already made it
to 25 years old.

558
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:00,708
Well…

559
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,083
César was incredible.

560
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,458
Very handsome and always so attentive,
you know?

561
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:06,458
And gentlemanly.

562
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,458
That's what really made me fall for him.

563
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:09,958
Very sexy.

564
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:14,500
But Horacio was an idealist
and my heart fell for him too.

565
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,958
He'd tell me
he could make the world better

566
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,583
and, and, well, nothing.

567
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,500
He got ten years.

568
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,583
Perhaps besides changing the world,

569
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,375
he'd benefit from changing
to a better lawyer too.

570
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:29,708
You knew he'd be out of prison
at some point, yes or no?

571
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:34,333
And tell me, at what point
were you planning on telling César?

572
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:36,916
Hm?

573
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:40,041
I didn't think it through. It was stupid.

574
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:43,708
No, Amelia. No, it wasn't stupid.

575
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,750
It was moronic!

576
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,750
-Mm-hm.
-You were a moron!

577
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:54,000
And with that terrible plan
you came up with,

578
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,625
you've ruined your own life too.

579
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:57,583
-Yep.
-Yeah?

580
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,500
And look. Now you don't know what to do.

581
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,375
Of course you're not getting back together
with César.

582
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:07,625
And that poor man,
that poor man, that hacker Horacio!

583
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:09,541
You ripped his life apart as well.

584
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,083
Ten years behind bars!

585
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,708
And now that he's out,

586
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,875
because of you,
he has no relationship with his son!

587
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,583
Eh?

588
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,541
Oh, I almost forgot

589
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,333
about poor César.

590
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,416
-Uh-huh.
-Your poor César.

591
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,625
Who carries the weight
of the world on his back.

592
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,791
Three ships sunk with one single blow!

593
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:34,208
No. No. Enough!

594
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,375
Thank you, Ma.

595
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,166
You're welcome. It was four.

596
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,208
Ah, ah.

597
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:41,750
Don't forget about
my sweet grandson Enrique.

598
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,041
Breaks my heart, Ame.

599
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:43,958
-Well.
-That poor boy.

600
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:45,708
I don't have any idea what I should do.

601
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,416
For you, Amelia, I have no idea.

602
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,958
No idea! Oh!

603
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,333
I'm gonna say it again.

604
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:53,083
It's your life.

605
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,791
Your life!

606
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,166
Don't bring me into it.

607
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,083
-Ah, Mama…
-No!

608
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,583
-Yeah, Grandma.
-Come here, honey.

609
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,333
-But how would you? In the nude?
-So what?

610
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:09,958
Yes naked. And outside.

611
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,083
Can I come in?

612
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,791
-Under the sheets.
-What?

613
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:14,708
Paolo?

614
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,041
Please, buddy! Come in.

615
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,541
Sorry, did I disturb you?

616
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,125
No, no, no, no. No.

617
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,833
Well…

618
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,333
-Paolo.
-Hm?

619
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,958
-I don't know what will happen.
-Uh-huh.

620
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,000
I don't know how things will work out.

621
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,083
I just want to tell you
that I'm going to make an effort,

622
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:40,041
and I'm going to do my best
to be a more positive person here.

623
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:41,708
Fine. Fine.

624
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,583
-I know how important this contest is.
-Mm-hm.

625
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,458
And it'd be great to win that $20,000.

626
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:52,875
My only concern is that we're both good
and L'Allegria is doing well.

627
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,625
Well, I love seeing you like this.

628
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,916
'Kay. Peace. Good night.

629
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,708
-Get some rest.
-You as well.

630
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:01,916
Sleep well.

631
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:05,791
Why'd you hide me?

632
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,875
Oh no, I wasn't hiding you.

633
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,083
You weren't?

634
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:12,000
Uh, he's in pain. And what else?
He's depressed and…

635
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,250
Like a martini. That's him.

636
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:16,125
You mean stirred?

637
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,458
On the rocks.

638
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,041
And how's that involve me here?

639
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:22,458
Nothing. Not at all.
Well, it does, very much.

640
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,291
Imagine seeing me with you in here,

641
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:27,125
all rock and roll partying,
meanwhile he's…

642
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:29,791
-In a mood? A requiem for Bach?
-Mm-hm.

643
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,041
-And alone.
-Yeah.

644
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:34,125
Hm. I feel like
he's gonna get more depressed.

645
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,208
-Huh? More?
-Yes. More.

646
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,625
Coming here when you're 40,
it's complicated.

647
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:42,500
-This is true.
-Hm.

648
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:46,250
1 a.m.? Today is his birthday!

649
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,791
-Yes!
-Oh! Time to party!

650
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,750
Eh-eh. I am. You're not. Under the sheet.

651
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,208
-What?
-Under the sheets. Do it.

652
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:54,041
And go where? Under the covers?
In the closet? In the bathroom?

653
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,583
In the bathroom, wherever, just hide.

654
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,083
-Wait a minute!
-Go!

655
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,541
Oh. Eh!

656
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:02,416
-Don't make a sound. Sh!
-No, it's fine.

657
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,375
-I won't say anything.
-Here comes Paolo! Sh!

658
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,875
Happy birthday?

659
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,250
Not here. Where'd he go?

660
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,958
-My savior. Hello.
-Hey.

661
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,416
-What's up?
-Hello.

662
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:30,833
-How are you?
-Well, I'm perfectly safe here.

663
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,833
So now we can get to know each other.

664
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:38,291
Hopefully no more paranoia and hysterics
like this morning, okay?

665
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:41,666
It's funny 'cause I'm coming out
of a bad streak.

666
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,333
'Cause I've never been a fan of insects,

667
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,666
or reptiles, or rats
or anything like that,

668
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,083
but a couple of years ago,
it actually got even worse,

669
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:54,250
and now I even panic when I see chickens.

670
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,916
-At chickens? For real?
-Mm-hm.

671
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,083
What makes you panic, huh?

672
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:05,416
I mean,
I've never been afraid of anything.

673
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,541
And now, well, my biggest fear
is I'll lose control of my life.

674
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:14,750
Okay, so I'm not so bad with the chickens.

675
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,041
No.

676
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,708
But you know why that happens?

677
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,208
Sometimes we go through things
that we're able to control,

678
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:25,458
and that gives us a certain tranquility.

679
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,291
But there are other things that don't.

680
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,916
We can't control them. They just happen.

681
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,625
They're sent to us by life,
the universe, or God.

682
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:35,333
The aliens. Who knows?

683
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,458
And it's important to accept them.

684
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:39,791
I see.

685
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,416
Huh. After hearing you speak like this,

686
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,125
it sounds like you have a doctorate
in the surprises of being alive.

687
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:52,708
What percentage of living is all decisions

688
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:54,875
and what percentage is surprises?

689
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,333
Mm…

690
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,250
Forty-sixty?

691
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,125
Forty is decisions and 60 is surprises?

692
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:03,125
-Yeah.
-No, no. Please, please. It's more.

693
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,958
No, I don't agree. No. I disagree.

694
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:09,708
How is it that a human
can create their own destiny?

695
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:12,625
Oh, as the writer Appius Claudius Caecus.

696
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:13,708
And he was blind,

697
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:16,083
by the way,
and I don't think he was blind by choice.

698
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,125
A bit contradictory, no?

699
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,250
Sure.

700
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,458
Oh, time for bed.

701
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:24,958
-Yeah?
-Yeah, it's time.

702
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,875
-Well, take care.
-You as well.

703
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,125
-Good night.
-Bye.

704
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,208
Hello?

705
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,083
Hey, I was hoping to talk.

706
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,208
<i>Hello, Amelia.</i>

707
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:46,083
I'm well. Concentrating on the contest
and we're advancing too.

708
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:49,708
And, um, how is César?

709
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,625
I've been wanting to go
and visit him in Cancún.

710
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:56,875
Amelia, he's focusing
on the contest right now.

711
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,625
I don't think it'd be the best idea.

712
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:01,458
For you it's not the best idea,
but for me I don't have a better one.

713
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:03,208
Okay? You know he wants to see me.

714
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,541
If you're that optimistic,
what are you calling me for?

715
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,958
Because he's your best friend, Paolo.

716
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:10,583
No, I've decided.
I'm coming to Cancún. Pronto.

717
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:13,125
I'm gonna tell you something.
You better listen well, Amelia.

718
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,416
You--

719
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:17,708
Ended the call?

720
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:20,291
<i>Cazzo.</i>

721
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,625
<i>Tanti auguri!</i>

722
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:33,291
Happy birthday to my friend,
my partner, and my associate.

723
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,250
-Thanks.
-Hm?

724
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,208
I'm forty.

725
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,208
I'm forty. How about that?

726
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,166
You look good to me. What's it feel like?

727
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,458
Ah, it's better than when I made it to 15,
but worse than when I turned 30.

728
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,875
Well, you're doing better
than you were last night, yeah?

729
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,875
Today, yeah, I'm better.

730
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:51,125
Mm.

731
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:54,000
And Naomi,
does she have anything to do with that?

732
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,541
No, no. Of course not.

733
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,208
No. I bumped into her yesterday
and we chatted. That's it.

734
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,416
Buddy, take it easy, okay?

735
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,041
'Cause what you are
is a slow cooker, yeah?

736
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,833
And it's got a beefy stew in it.

737
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,416
And you are a… You're an insta-pot.

738
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,708
You're a… You're a microwave.

739
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,916
Bing!

740
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,958
Precisely.

741
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,208
You know what I did? Rented a boat.

742
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:19,208
You're coming with us
snorkeling at Isla Mujeres.

743
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:20,541
I just casually happened

744
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:23,333
to invite Selina and Naomi.

745
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:26,458
Just so? That's it? Hm?

746
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:30,458
I don't have the energy,
but I won't say no.

747
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,458
But you won't say no
because I paid for the boat.

748
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,083
Yeah, don't worry.

749
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:38,583
Eh? There's no way I'd spoil
my 40th party.

750
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:39,791
Hell yes.

751
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,291
<i>Prego, prego.</i>

752
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,416
But don't pressure me
or anything.

753
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,958
We should be concentrating
on what we came for.

754
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,791
When have I put pressure on you?

755
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,708
I'm running to my room for some things.
See you.

756
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:53,791
Don't take too long.

757
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,625
What?

758
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,541
Chef Marini.

759
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,375
<i>Signor direttore.</i>

760
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,333
-You well?
-Very well.

761
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,208
I'd like to inform you
that the organizing committee

762
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:13,166
has decided to spice up our contest
just a little bit.

763
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,833
For tonight's session, therefore,

764
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:17,416
I have to warn you,
we are changing the rules.

765
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:21,916
You'll have some ingredients
that are surprising.

766
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:24,750
Your breakfast is getting cold.

767
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:46,416
Hi there, Papa!

768
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:49,958
Hi there. I'm glad you always pick up.

769
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:51,166
Happy birthday, Papa!

770
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,250
Ah, thank you, son.

771
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:54,583
Partying?

772
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:57,166
Well, I don't really want to,
but Paolo's making me.

773
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,541
Hey, um, do you remember once telling me

774
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,750
if you can't get chocolate from Belgium,

775
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,625
try to make the best of a bar
that's from Switzerland?

776
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:09,083
Sure, sure, I remember. Why?

777
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,541
I understand the metaphor.

778
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,166
What? No, no. That wasn't a metaphor.

779
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,833
I was really speaking about chocolates,

780
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:16,666
but why would you say that?

781
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,375
I think I enjoyed Belgian chocolate
before now,

782
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,083
but I know things changed
with you and Mom.

783
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,583
I guess I'll have to make the most
out of Swiss chocolate.

784
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,250
But, staying with your metaphor,

785
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:29,083
it's not…
The Swiss is absolutely not Horacio.

786
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:33,416
Your mom decided to leave two chocolates
decomposing on their own for ten years

787
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,958
languishing in a cupboard
of her own damn nastiness and lies.

788
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:38,416
Is it hot in Cancún?

789
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,541
Yeah. It's boiling.

790
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:44,166
Pardon me. Pardon me.
I got carried away with the metaphors.

791
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,541
Honey!

792
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,166
All right. Bye. I've gotta go.

793
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,083
Look who's here, Enrique.

794
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,625
I'm gonna leave you two
to chat for a bit.

795
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,583
Yeah, it's okay.

796
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:02,791
Perfect, I'll leave you guys.

797
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:03,791
Okay?

798
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,375
Well, we need…
I think we need to make up for lost time.

799
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:18,125
Hm?

800
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:19,791
Where should we begin?

801
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,500
You about motorcycles?

802
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,500
No.

803
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:26,000
Hm…

804
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,708
Um…

805
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:31,958
Do you like soccer at all?

806
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,208
No. No, not much of it.

807
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:38,208
Corporations, these multinationals've,

808
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:40,458
they've ruined the romanticism
of the sport.

809
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,500
And they've taken
out all the good parts. Yeah?

810
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,791
No.

811
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,125
Um…

812
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,791
Do you… You like my mom?

813
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:53,458
Yes.

814
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,416
I like her a lot to be honest with you.

815
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,625
And chocolate from Switzerland?

816
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:02,666
Hm?

817
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,958
Snorkeling was a great idea.

818
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:06,666
But with my foot, it's impossible.

819
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,833
What I want is for you to enjoy the day.

820
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,291
Sure.

821
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,416
And those pills are for?

822
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,375
I get wobbly.

823
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:16,875
César.

824
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:20,916
When you were back in Acapulco,
not once did I see you lose your balance.

825
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,833
Well, a year ago,

826
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:24,166
I didn't know that my son
wasn't really mine.

827
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:29,291
These issues are getting
a bit more serious with stress.

828
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,666
I'm just trying to tell you
that those pills you're taking

829
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,708
could perhaps be killing your libido
and your erection.

830
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:35,625
What?

831
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:38,000
I wasn't planning on having sex
any minute now.

832
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,333
Well, who knows?

833
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:41,291
Hi! Happy birthday!

834
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,500
Oh, thanks.

835
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:44,166
-Hello.
-Happy birthday.

836
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,416
-Thank you.
-Feeling better?

837
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,583
-Not so bad.
-I'm doing well.

838
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:47,916
How about you, rock and roller?

839
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,958
-Hello.
-Good, thanks. Happy birthday.

840
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,166
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

841
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:52,666
And here's the yacht.

842
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,750
No, this isn't mine, but I did rent it.

843
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,375
That's splendid of you.

844
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:58,708
Ah. Go in.

845
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,500
Hey, you want something else?

846
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,458
-I'm good with this.
-Ah, well.

847
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,041
Ah so pretty!

848
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:18,500
You see that beautiful blue over there?
The color of the water?

849
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,666
Trying to get closer to enlightenment?

850
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:34,500
No, no, I'm trying to hold food down.

851
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,875
Ah, so then it's gotta be
that really odd food

852
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:38,708
you guys prepared yesterday.

853
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:40,750
No, definitely not that.

854
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,875
Wait, odd? Why odd?

855
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:45,166
It's odd.

856
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,541
Overboard!

857
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:58,791
Naomi! Come!

858
00:43:58,875 --> 00:43:59,875
Come!

859
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:10,625
Oh.

860
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:17,458
I've been thinkin'
about our talk yesterday.

861
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:21,625
Did you go study to become
a master of existentialism?

862
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,750
Yeah, experiences, personal struggles.

863
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,416
Ah, experiences.

864
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,333
Are you going to say or…

865
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,000
Well, Paolo told me what happened to you.

866
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,708
So, I guess, yes,
it's my turn to tell you that.

867
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:37,166
Ah, well. What to begin with? Um…

868
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:40,416
Nothing. My life started out great.

869
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,416
Like, I was born into a family
that was educated and upper-middle class.

870
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,625
I married the best man in the world.

871
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,583
I was in the bathroom of a restaurant

872
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:50,041
because a server
accidentally spilled on my blouse,

873
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,625
and, well, he helped me clean it.
That's how we met.

874
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,916
And he… He was the love of my life.

875
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,458
Not bad. It sounds like you were happy.

876
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:00,583
But he died when I was 28 years old.

877
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:01,500
Yeah?

878
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,541
-Mm-hm.
-Well, how?

879
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:05,958
James was out on his way to go shopping

880
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:09,500
and an old… a part of a ledge fell on him.

881
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,291
-Are you serious? Oh my God.
-Yes.

882
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,666
Widowed trying to raise two girls
in Chicago.

883
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,791
So alone. No family.

884
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,375
-That sounds difficult.
-Yeah, it was.

885
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:22,291
Then the banking crisis hit,
and my job disappeared.

886
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,291
-I was losing my mind.
-I bet.

887
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:27,625
More or less where you are right now.
But I didn't have a Paolo to help me.

888
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,833
Yeah. How'd you deal with it?

889
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,541
I decided to go to therapy.

890
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:34,625
And, in passing, going to the therapist,

891
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:37,750
I bumped into a former roommate
from my old university,

892
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,416
and she told me she was doing great

893
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,416
at a software company
where she was working.

894
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:43,083
My friend told the chief,

895
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:45,875
and they were looking
for someone who wanted to work in finance…

896
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:47,250
-Yes!
-What a coincidence!

897
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,916
And now I'm working and being paid
an amazing salary,

898
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,416
and I'm absolutely obsessed with it.

899
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,333
That's great.

900
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,916
You've really gone
through everything, huh?

901
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:57,791
Yes, it's true. At 35 years old.

902
00:45:57,875 --> 00:46:00,916
Confident, flourishing, optimistic,
and full of life.

903
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,625
My mom passed away a week back.

904
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:06,333
Come again?

905
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:11,958
Yep. It's more depressing
to accept that you're depressed.

906
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:14,833
Okay, yeah.

907
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:17,625
But, uh, no, right?

908
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:18,916
What?

909
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,750
When destiny smacks you
in the face out of nowhere,

910
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:25,250
you take a moment,
a bit of time to yourself,

911
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:26,958
you adjust to it, when you can,

912
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,125
and start making the most
of your new situation.

913
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,250
Well, I agree.

914
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:34,958
Mm. I gotta pee.

915
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:03,750
César!

916
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,208
Help! I can't open the door!

917
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:07,708
Hold on.

918
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:10,375
Hold on!

919
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,375
-Hurry!
-Coming, coming, coming.

920
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,458
Take it easy. What happened?

921
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:20,041
I'm trapped. The door won't open.

922
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,333
Won't open?

923
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:24,166
Just gotta…

924
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,458
-Oh, thank you!
-Like that.

925
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:26,875
No way!

926
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:29,666
Shit, mother…

927
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,416
But now you closed the door
on both of us. Try it. Come on!

928
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,666
But it won't open?

929
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,875
-No.
-Gonna get claustrophobic stuck in here.

930
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,750
Oh! The window! The window up here! Yeah!

931
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:40,583
-We can open this and get out.
-Open the window and go through? No!

932
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:42,625
I won't fit through there.
My leg like this…

933
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,416
-Okay.
-It has to open somehow.

934
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,833
Hold me. Hold me. Hold me.

935
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:47,541
-You're gonna climb through?
-Yes.

936
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,000
-One of us will have to.
-All right.

937
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,458
Hold on. Just put…

938
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:53,458
-Up, up, up. Let's…
-Careful with my foot! My foot!

939
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,625
Watch my face. Easy, easy.

940
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:03,125
Sorry. It's… Oh shit!

941
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:05,666
This is… Come on, come on.
I don't know what I'm supposed to…

942
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,291
Your butt is right in my eye.

943
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:09,458
Are you turned on?

944
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,333
Depressed people usually
don't have much libido.

945
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:15,375
No? Well, then,
maybe I don't actually have depression.

946
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:16,416
Ah! Make it quick.

947
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:24,250
What?

948
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:33,333
Rock and roll, baby! Let's go!

949
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:36,791
Captain! We're gonna be snorkeling
for 20 minutes more.

950
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,625
Yes! Way to go! Woo!

951
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,375
-Let me down!
-Okay, come down.

952
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:45,041
-I'm stuck. Let me down.
-Sit on my shoulders. Stretch.

953
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:47,458
-Let's go. Let's go.
-I… I…

954
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,708
What the hell?

955
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,333
What now?

956
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,666
That was good how you caught me.

957
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:00,000
Uh-huh.

958
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:02,208
Really?

959
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,000
-No?
-Is this?

960
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,000
Wait a sec. That's my phone ringing.

961
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,083
Pick it up.

962
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:38,625
Oh. It's my wife. Oh no.

963
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,666
Okay, well, I'm not going anywhere.

964
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,625
-Hold on.
-Uh-huh.

965
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:46,333
Pardon me. Give me a moment.
I need a second to…

966
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,125
-I don't know. I don't know.
-Okay.

967
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:51,500
Oh, I'll give you space. Give you space.

968
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:53,583
I don't know.

969
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:57,750
I…

970
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,916
-What's up?
-Hi.

971
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,416
You ready for the contest?

972
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:10,458
Sure, yeah, yeah.

973
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,625
What happened?

974
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:14,333
Stressed? You look preoccupied.

975
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:16,208
No, no, no. Preoccupied? No, no.

976
00:50:16,916 --> 00:50:19,875
Oh, well, there are some slight changes
I haven't told you about.

977
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:22,750
What?

978
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:26,166
What? Yes! You're not saying anything.
What's up with you?

979
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,833
No more cooking what we planned.
Something happened.

980
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:31,958
-What?
-I ran into Casas.

981
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:34,375
He explained that to spice up the contest

982
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:37,791
they came up with
this "secret ingredient" surprise thing.

983
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:42,083
Surprise? Why? Why'd you wait till now
to tell me about this?

984
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:43,833
Huh? Tell you about it sooner?

985
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:48,041
Today we were partying,
Isla Mujeres, Naomi, Selina.

986
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:50,000
Why would I wanna ruin your day?

987
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,958
Yeah, but you have ruined it.

988
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:54,291
Hey, I didn't ruin your day.

989
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,000
Actually, maybe half a day.

990
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,666
It's only six o'clock.

991
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,333
Oo…

992
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:01,541
How'd it go with Naomi?

993
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:05,875
-Eh…
-Eh? That's about it? Eh?

994
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,541
Ass.

995
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:12,458
Ladies and gentlemen, contestants,

996
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:14,416
welcome back this evening!

997
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:19,041
It is time to start your courses.

998
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:23,000
Are all of you ready to compete?

999
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:28,583
The ingredient that's secret is this…

1000
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:34,750
Pomodoro, pomodoro, pomodoro.

1001
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,875
And it's Serrano ham.

1002
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:40,708
I hate ham.

1003
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:42,416
Take it easy now.

1004
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,875
We're better than the rest of them.

1005
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:47,500
Come on!

1006
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:57,041
Hey, how about I start the ravioli
and you get the filling done?

1007
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,833
I don't know.
I'm not sure about the ravioli.

1008
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,416
Well, I don't know.

1009
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:05,666
What's up? You okay?

1010
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,708
Amelia called today.

1011
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:12,583
I didn't even wanna answer.

1012
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:13,708
I don't know what she wants

1013
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:16,291
and I'm not prepared
to have that conversation now.

1014
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:20,250
Amelia wants to visit Cancún
and she wants to see you.

1015
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:24,583
Wait. You spoke with her?
And you kept it a secret?

1016
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:26,916
I didn't want to overwhelm you.

1017
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:30,916
I think you've been getting better here
thanks to this contest,

1018
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,625
and thanks to Naomi…

1019
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:35,083
You haven't had time to go crazy
over your wife's stupidity

1020
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:36,500
'cause you've been doing your job.

1021
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:39,541
How about you let me decide
my own problems for once?

1022
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:42,041
You know, I don't need a nanny
'cause I'm 40 years old.

1023
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,041
Oh man, César,
your my partner and friend--

1024
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:47,083
Yeah, and as my friend,
thanks for all you do for me.

1025
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:48,958
Truly. But don't meddle in this.

1026
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,750
-All right.
-Come on, seriously?

1027
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,458
Don't forget we're here for a competition.

1028
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:54,458
Competing in a contest that's <i>this</i> big.

1029
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:55,875
I get it, now be quiet.

1030
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:58,166
We're not competing
to get a star from Michelin.

1031
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,416
We're a couple of contestants
from the second division.

1032
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,166
-Listen--
-See this? You have one too.

1033
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,125
The "best <i>small</i> restaurants,"
you know what that signifies?

1034
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,250
The best of those who can't hack it.

1035
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,416
Well, the contest in the second division

1036
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,291
is worth $20,000.

1037
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:15,291
-Ah, jeez.
-Which I really need at the moment.

1038
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,958
-I'm talking to you!
-What?

1039
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:20,416
You think I deserve some acknowledgment

1040
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,458
for ten years of working
my ass off with you?

1041
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:27,041
<i>Cazzo!</i>

1042
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:55,541
What's up?

1043
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:57,500
All good?

1044
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,541
Exhausted.

1045
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:02,250
But it was worth it.

1046
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:06,041
Seli…

1047
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:10,916
meeting César ten years ago,

1048
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,166
when we both enrolled
in a course in Milan.

1049
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:18,291
You have no idea how much he helped me
from, like, freakin' out.

1050
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:19,208
Hm.

1051
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:22,416
Two divorces.

1052
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:25,000
And barely any money in my account.

1053
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,708
And I put on 45 pounds.

1054
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:29,041
Hm.

1055
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,291
One divorce was enough for me.

1056
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,833
Hm.

1057
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:38,041
It was rough.

1058
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,166
Thirty pounds.

1059
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:42,166
Heavier?

1060
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,125
No, I was thinner.

1061
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:45,625
Hm.

1062
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:49,291
If we'd met each other
all the way back then…

1063
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,166
I wouldn't have noticed you.

1064
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:57,625
And now the final presentation
from the restaurant Wok and Jane,

1065
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:58,916
of Los Cabos.

1066
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,750
And they are presenting…

1067
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:05,083
It is a caramelized duck stuffed
with ham, cream, and soy.

1068
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:06,125
Huh?

1069
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:07,250
Excellent.

1070
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:11,000
And now, for the final dish,

1071
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:13,833
the restaurant L'Allegria of Mexico City

1072
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:17,708
and they have prepared for us this…

1073
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:19,416
A Serrano ham sandwich.

1074
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:22,416
-Hm?
-With?

1075
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:24,291
With bread…

1076
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,833
and Serrano ham, served in all its purity.

1077
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,208
Oh man, Jesus.

1078
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:41,750
So, we now have the results.

1079
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:42,666
Thank you.

1080
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:46,166
And moving on to the final,

1081
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,708
the restaurant L'Allegria of Mexico City

1082
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:53,541
with its original Serrano ham sandwich.

1083
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:01,541
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Casas' face…

1084
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:05,333
…when he looked at the envelope
and he sees…

1085
00:56:05,416 --> 00:56:07,791
Okay, a risk I'll admit,

1086
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:11,541
but we got lucky with that ham, no?

1087
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:14,583
That sandwich. I couldn't think
of anything else that would work.

1088
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:18,458
We made it.

1089
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,208
I apologize for everything I said.

1090
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,375
Oh, buddy, don't worry about it.

1091
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:26,083
You and I have
always been straightforward.

1092
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:27,375
-Yeah, well.
-I'm getting tired.

1093
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:29,833
Wait. Let's finish the lollipop together.

1094
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:32,333
-Good evening, <i>principessa.</i>
-Hey, now, come on.

1095
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:33,583
Good evening.

1096
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,208
-Hey there.
-Hi.

1097
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:39,708
Wanna go walking on the beach for a bit?

1098
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,625
Ah, you have no idea how hard it is
to walk on the sand with this boot.

1099
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,250
Would you just enjoy the night?

1100
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,416
-Come on.
-Okay.

1101
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,500
You think the DNA test thing is for real?

1102
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,791
I don't know, maybe…

1103
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:04,083
just saying do you think she told you that
to try to provoke you?

1104
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:07,625
I don't think so.
Why would she lie to me like that?

1105
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:11,291
Maybe she's not even sure about it.

1106
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,125
Just saying.

1107
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:18,375
If I were you,
I'd ask for another sample of DNA.

1108
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:19,541
See how it goes.

1109
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:24,583
Once you have the test, you'll be sure.

1110
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,416
But it's been nice so far, you know?

1111
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:31,708
-That's true.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1112
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:34,375
And you can't just suddenly
back out of ten years of your life

1113
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:36,416
because of a bad ending. Don't do it.

1114
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:43,458
So I'm thinking that conclusions
are entirely overrated for what they are.

1115
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,375
That sounds about right.

1116
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,416
Well, now where were we?

1117
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:50,750
What?

1118
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,333
It was something on the boat?

1119
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:56,083
Ah, I remember.

1120
00:57:57,291 --> 00:57:59,875
Mm… Was it? Okay…

1121
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:01,750
Maybe something like this.

1122
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:16,166
Wake up already!

1123
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:18,125
It's ten in the morning!

1124
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:24,041
Your coffee service is on the terrace.

1125
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,375
-Coming, coming.
-Let's move it.

1126
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:29,375
Mm.

1127
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:32,041
Mm, mm, mm. Oh, it's a great day!

1128
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:34,166
Hm? Get some rest?

1129
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:37,000
Meh.

1130
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,500
That smile leads me to think, uh,

1131
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,458
you had a fun night with Naomi.

1132
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:44,125
I turned 40, not 15.

1133
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:45,750
So no commentary.

1134
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,291
That's fine if you don't wanna say,

1135
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:50,458
but I'm pleased to see you in a good mood.

1136
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:54,333
Say, do you think
that someday Naomi

1137
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:56,791
will leave Chicago
and wanna come live with me?

1138
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:58,500
All right, all right.

1139
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:03,333
I love seeing that my beloved César
has come back to life,

1140
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:06,041
but you gotta take your foot
off the pedal.

1141
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:08,041
Okay, accelerate.

1142
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:09,250
Hm. We gotta go to the market

1143
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,208
for the ingredients we'll need
for the contest.

1144
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:12,250
Meet me in the lobby.

1145
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,250
Oh, okay. Gimme ten minutes. All right?

1146
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,500
<i>Dieci minuti.</i>

1147
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:18,500
Yeah.

1148
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:29,125
-All right?
-Not really.

1149
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,166
Oh, hey, did you get Selina's number yet?

1150
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:34,500
It's not something I've asked for yet.

1151
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:36,125
It's just I wanna talk to Naomi.

1152
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:37,666
Maybe call their room, no?

1153
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,750
I called, but no one answered.

1154
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:42,250
Well, they could be going
to the beach, César.

1155
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:44,916
I'm acting like a teenager, right?

1156
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,041
I'd say so.

1157
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:49,333
I don't know what's goin' on with me.
I'm feeling a lot of emotions.

1158
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:52,833
I suddenly feel good, then bad.
Good then bad.

1159
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:54,375
No kidding, buddy.

1160
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:57,666
Hey, why don't we hurry up outta here
and get back to the hotel?

1161
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,583
Oh boy. Listen to me.

1162
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:00,583
We're winning this thing tonight,
so I need you.

1163
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:02,208
-Yeah.
-We'll win the $20,000.

1164
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:03,791
-Yeah.
-You'll be married to Naomi.

1165
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:06,708
Yes, you will,
and then you'll settle down.

1166
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:08,791
Uh, would she? Accept that?

1167
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:11,125
I was makin' a joke, César.

1168
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:13,083
Yeah, yeah.

1169
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:15,916
Wait, wait, wait.
Say that really happened.

1170
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,416
Could I count on you?

1171
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,000
Yes, César.

1172
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:22,541
You know I'd be the witness for you.

1173
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:24,000
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

1174
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:28,250
Eight, nine, ten, 11, 12…

1175
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,666
Hold on. Are all these eggs
for the <i>babà meringata?</i>

1176
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,833
Yes, yes.

1177
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:33,083
You wanna risk it all?

1178
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:35,666
It's the final. The place to outdo them.

1179
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,500
Is this you?

1180
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,875
Yes, yes, yes.
Listen to me, I'm doin' fine.

1181
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:42,208
I'm doing much better thanks to this,

1182
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:43,583
thanks to you and to the contest,

1183
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:45,333
and, of course, to Naomi.

1184
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:47,000
Of course Naomi.

1185
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:49,458
-Mr. Marini?
-Yes, my dear?

1186
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:53,833
Mr. Marini, those two ladies,
Selina and Naomi, have left you a message.

1187
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,083
Oh, thanks.

1188
01:00:56,583 --> 01:00:58,791
"Dear Paolo and César,
It was a pleasure to meet you."

1189
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,583
"We hope you do well in the contest.
Selina and Naomi."

1190
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,125
Paolo.

1191
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,375
Mm. Mm.

1192
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:13,375
What's that?

1193
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,583
Mm. Mm.

1194
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:21,041
Chocolate.

1195
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,041
That bitter?

1196
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:24,458
More than you know.

1197
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:27,208
I left everything in the kitchen,
and it looks perfect.

1198
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,250
Is there any news
on our friends' whereabouts?

1199
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:35,375
Uh, they went on a tour of Chichén Itzá,
and they'll get here later.

1200
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,000
Why wouldn't they tell us anything?

1201
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:40,916
Hm. Oh, well, they may have seen
us talking about the contest.

1202
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,958
So they went off first.

1203
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:44,166
Yes, but will they get here very late?

1204
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,291
-What time?
-Later, later.

1205
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:47,500
-How much later?
-Coming back does take a while.

1206
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:48,416
Well, yeah, but…

1207
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,750
-Please. Take it down.
-When? When? Take it down?

1208
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,916
Just wanted to know
when they're coming tonight--

1209
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,041
César!

1210
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:56,458
What the hell?

1211
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:57,916
Amelia.

1212
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,958
Amelia.

1213
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,416
Some chocolate ice cream?

1214
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,500
A little chocolate might…

1215
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:09,791
might put us in a better mood.

1216
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:13,250
All right, let's have
three chocolate ice creams.

1217
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:14,166
Yes, sir.

1218
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,208
Ah.

1219
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:25,541
Eh.

1220
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:31,291
Okay, then.

1221
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:35,583
I obviously wanna apologize
for all the harm I've caused you.

1222
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,500
I screwed up. Forgive me, won't you?

1223
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:41,958
I need to focus right now.

1224
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:43,000
We're at the final.

1225
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:52,208
Hm. You had that paternity thing done
on Enrique, no?

1226
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:54,458
Never showed me. I'd like to do another.

1227
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:56,291
Okay.

1228
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:58,750
But there's still a lot
we have to talk about.

1229
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:02,833
First, paternity.
Then we can talk about other things.

1230
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:12,416
Six o'clock! It's late!

1231
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,416
Huh?

1232
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,833
You're pushing it.

1233
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,000
Sorry, sorry, I fell asleep.

1234
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:19,833
I'm sure it's the stress
of speaking to Amelia.

1235
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:23,375
-César, this is the final.
-Huh? Yeah.

1236
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:26,958
-Think about it. We'll finally win. Win!
-Yeah. Yeah.

1237
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:28,333
Do you see what's before us?

1238
01:03:28,416 --> 01:03:32,291
A world of projects,
of dreams, anything you can do, yeah?

1239
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:35,625
You mean puttin' together
a new life with Naomi.

1240
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,500
Um…

1241
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:43,666
-Oh, just one tiny detail with Naomi.
-What?

1242
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:48,916
Please. Are you gonna keep sighing
or do you have something to say to me?

1243
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:51,833
Please. One more and then I'll speak.

1244
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:58,000
AIRPORT

1245
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:13,375
Oh, please. Would you stop sighing?
Enough of that.

1246
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:19,625
CANCÚN AIRPORT

1247
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:21,625
Here we are. Watch your step.

1248
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:24,333
Hey, do you need my help?

1249
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,375
No?

1250
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:27,875
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

1251
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:30,916
Why did you buy us two tickets
for Louisville, Kentucky?

1252
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,750
Only way to get to the gates.

1253
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,500
But why would you buy a ticket for me?

1254
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:35,791
I want you to come with me.

1255
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:38,125
-To Kentucky?
-No. Let's go meet the girls.

1256
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,333
There they are.

1257
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:41,875
Naomi.

1258
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:44,166
-Oh, hey!
-Oh, hi!

1259
01:04:44,958 --> 01:04:46,958
What's up? Where are you going?

1260
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:49,500
Chicago. It's the end of our vacation.

1261
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:53,166
But you were just gonna leave like that?
Just like that? No goodbye?

1262
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:56,541
My one rule's always been
not to say goodbye.

1263
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,291
It makes me anxious.

1264
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:01,125
And I knew it wouldn't be easy
for you to say goodbye.

1265
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,958
Well, yeah, but…

1266
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:04,958
César, the past few days have been great.

1267
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,750
You're doing the best you can.

1268
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:10,791
And besides your issues,
you made me like you.

1269
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,375
Made you like or you liked?

1270
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:16,541
No, come on. Come on.

1271
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,375
I like you and I'm glad we met.

1272
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:24,250
And I didn't think this would last for us
because of who we are.

1273
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:27,416
-Okay.
-And, if I'm being honest…

1274
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,708
With all my problems, I just…

1275
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,000
A part of me thinks it's probably best
if I don't get attached.

1276
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,916
I know how that sounds.

1277
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:40,875
And we were good.

1278
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:44,666
Really, I liked spending time with you.

1279
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,875
No regrets meeting you.

1280
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:49,625
Uh, Naomi…

1281
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:52,416
You… you too.

1282
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,166
Hope you get home safe and sound,
<i>principessa.</i>

1283
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,166
-Thank you.
-And you too, my little rock star.

1284
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,416
Thank you.

1285
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:00,708
And best of luck to both of you.

1286
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,750
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1287
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,208
I know you'll win. You're the best.

1288
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:07,500
-Yeah.
-Well, bye.

1289
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,041
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

1290
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:33,291
Come on.

1291
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:40,083
Cesare, how do you make tiramisu?

1292
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:41,708
Huh?

1293
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,208
How do you make tiramisu?

1294
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,916
I don't know.

1295
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,583
Mascarpone, sugar, eggs,
cocoa, and ladyfinger biscuits. Why?

1296
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:49,500
Ah. There.

1297
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:53,833
You and I are in agreement that tiramisu
tastes best with ladyfingers,

1298
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:56,666
but there are other people
who are out there that

1299
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:58,666
put different cookies in it.

1300
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:00,791
Where? Like Chicago? Like…

1301
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,250
Hm. Or in Louisville, Kentucky.

1302
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:09,708
There are other ways to live just as
there are other ways to make tiramisu.

1303
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,750
But here's what I know.

1304
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:16,291
I love how you make your tiramisu.

1305
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:37,958
I'm gonna head to my room.

1306
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:39,833
I'll see you in a bit.

1307
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:41,958
Okay.

1308
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:42,916
Chef Marini.

1309
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:45,625
I hope you're well.

1310
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,583
Thank you, Director Casas.

1311
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:00,250
-You're here?
-I escaped.

1312
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:02,625
Mom's asleep. She took something
and then passed out.

1313
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:03,875
I think she's really stressed.

1314
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:04,958
Really stressed out.

1315
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,375
You okay?

1316
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,125
What are you doing?

1317
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:16,833
For the DNA test.

1318
01:09:16,916 --> 01:09:18,833
Best if you would send it in.

1319
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,208
But, um, can you wait till
after my First Communion?

1320
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:26,125
Right.

1321
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:27,041
I got…

1322
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,375
something for you.

1323
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:30,375
Look.

1324
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,916
Hm. What's this?

1325
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:34,458
Hm. American.

1326
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:37,250
I brought this because I couldn't get
a Swiss one.

1327
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:38,958
Let's try it now.

1328
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,333
It's not half bad.

1329
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,000
Yeah, not half bad.

1330
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,291
This is actually quite good.

1331
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,708
Hey. I'm ready.

1332
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,750
<i>Benvenuto.</i>

1333
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,416
So, how we doin'?

1334
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,083
We're fine. Oh the salad, it was perfect.

1335
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:18,375
Yeah, but when I got
to the rabbit cacciatore,

1336
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:20,750
eh, it wasn't my best.

1337
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:22,708
Dessert's up next.

1338
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,583
Well, let's do this.

1339
01:10:24,666 --> 01:10:27,291
-The <i>babà merengata?</i>
-The <i>babà merengata!</i>

1340
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,083
<i>Forza!</i>

1341
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:31,083
Eh, that's the base.
Let's go.

1342
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:33,166
Perfect. Perfect.

1343
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:38,041
-Okay. Count it out.
-Yeah.

1344
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,208
One, two… Stop.

1345
01:10:40,291 --> 01:10:41,500
Perfect.

1346
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:44,333
All right.

1347
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:45,250
Go ahead.

1348
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:52,875
Yeah, that's perfect.

1349
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:00,375
All right.

1350
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:03,125
-Hurry.
-Here goes.

1351
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:07,458
<i>-Forza!</i>
<i>-Forza!</i>

1352
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,166
Mm-hm.

1353
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:15,333
Esteemed Chef Robles.

1354
01:11:16,416 --> 01:11:18,208
Chef Galindo.

1355
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:22,375
For you. Enjoy.

1356
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:32,541
-For a job well done.
-For a job well done.

1357
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:40,666
For this, congratulations. Very well done.

1358
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:41,708
Much thanks.

1359
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:43,125
-Thanks. A pleasure.
-Bravo.

1360
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:44,625
-Director Casas.
-Excellent job.

1361
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,500
Oh, it's great to hear that. Thanks.

1362
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:47,708
Huh.

1363
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,416
If you hadn't been watchin' over me,
we wouldn't be here.

1364
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,833
If it not for your problems,
we probably would've won.

1365
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:56,750
Hm?

1366
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:00,166
Look at the size of their cup,
and then look at ours.

1367
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:03,458
Thank you. Thank you.

1368
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:05,833
-Thanks so much! Thank you all.
-Thank you.

1369
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:09,000
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

1370
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:10,458
DELICACIES - GRAND PRIX

1371
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:11,708
Of course!

1372
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:13,375
-Let's take a photo.
-Let's take a photo.

1373
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:15,291
Let's take a photo, everyone! Thank you!

1374
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:16,541
Thanks to everyone!

1375
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:18,083
Thank you! Thank you so much!

1376
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,000
It's not so bad.

1377
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:30,125
Hm? Why'd you wanna complicate things
by making rabbit cacciatore?

1378
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:31,208
You were on your own.

1379
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:33,875
Because you wouldn't do your job.

1380
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:34,791
Huh?

1381
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:39,125
Mm.

1382
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:41,833
We missed out on $20,000.

1383
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,375
What do I tell Sabrina?

1384
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:47,125
<i>Cazzo!</i>

1385
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:50,375
This is what we got.

1386
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:54,083
Ooh, second place.

1387
01:12:55,666 --> 01:13:00,041
It's all right.
What we experienced was worth it. Hm?

1388
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:03,000
-That's true.
-Endings are overrated.

1389
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:04,625
Mm. Yeah.

1390
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:07,416
Hey, come.

1391
01:13:07,958 --> 01:13:10,666
-Oh, please don't start, César.
-Come here. Just for a second.

1392
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:11,916
-Mm.
-Stand. Let's go.

1393
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:14,916
Here we are.

1394
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,583
Mm.

1395
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,375
We got it pretty nice. Cancún?

1396
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,875
Hotel. Total package.

1397
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:24,250
-You're right about that.
-The cool night air.

1398
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:26,208
That moon there.

1399
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:28,666
-Hm. Hm.
-You and I.

1400
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,583
What?

1401
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:31,541
Come again?

1402
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,416
Good morning.

1403
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,291
-Hi, Papa.
-Hey, buddy.

1404
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:56,250
Mwah! Look.

1405
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:58,916
I made some cookies to lighten the mood.

1406
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,458
-Thanks.
-Not you.

1407
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,916
Want one?

1408
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,083
Thanks.

1409
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:18,541
I… I was thinking that…

1410
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:23,000
we could make an arrangement
no matter what happens.

1411
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,583
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1412
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,583
Well, if you want.

1413
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:42,666
Good morning.

1414
01:14:43,916 --> 01:14:44,958
We have the results.

1415
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:51,083
Thank you.

1416
01:14:57,166 --> 01:15:01,291
Mom, there's been so many changes,
but I'm adapting,

1417
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:04,208
and doing the best I can
with the new situations.

1418
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,750
Uh, the truth is, we're doing fine.

1419
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:09,791
I'm doing fine.

1420
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,458
I love you.

1421
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:30,833
So, what do you think about this?

1422
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:32,666
-I want weekdays, obviously.
-Mm-hm.

1423
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:36,458
One weekend with Horacio,
his biological father.

1424
01:15:36,541 --> 01:15:38,583
-And one weekend with--
-With me.

1425
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:40,541
-You.
-Yeah, don't worry about it.

1426
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:43,000
Everything's gonna be fine. Okay?

1427
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:43,916
Okay.

1428
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,583
Amelia.

1429
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:49,541
Here it comes.

1430
01:15:58,375 --> 01:15:59,208
Thanks a lot!

1431
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,083
Hi!

1432
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:03,791
-How are you feelin'?
-Good.

1433
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:06,708
You'll behave, right?

1434
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,916
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

1435
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,916
-You're visiting your friend Lupe--
-Yeah, Lupita.

1436
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,458
-Lupe, right? You like her?
-Hm. Yeah.

1437
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:16,291
-No. No.
-Hey! We'll tell you later.

1438
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:17,458
Bye, we'll see you!

1439
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:19,500
-Will you bring him back Sunday?
-Yeah.

1440
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,541
-Yeah.
-How's it goin'?

1441
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:23,416
-Fine. Well, fine.
-How was the math test?

1442
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,500
Ah!

1443
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:27,416
-So…
-Oh, hey.

1444
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,416
-Tell you a secret?
-Yeah?

1445
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,458
I kissed Lupita.

1446
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:33,958
Ha! You serious? Yeah!

1447
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:36,166
Wow!

1448
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,166
Ah…

1449
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:40,833
-But Lupita told me something yesterday.
-Uh-huh?

1450
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:44,125
Her father's been sent to Guadalajara,

1451
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:46,708
but in a month,
her whole family's leaving.

1452
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:48,875
Just my luck. Shit.

1453
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:50,583
Hey.

1454
01:16:50,666 --> 01:16:52,958
Huh? Shit. Shit.

1455
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,166
No, no, you don't get depressed, uh?

1456
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:58,416
I mean, sometimes things don't go
according to plan,

1457
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,291
but how you react is your choice.

1458
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:02,125
And when you face it,
it gives you strength.

1459
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:04,458
Let me tell you. You can never predict.

1460
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,750
Once in a while,
these things turn out well.

1461
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,708
Similar to me and you?

1462
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,083
Yep. Me and you.

1463
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:14,875
Just like you and your friends.

1464
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:20,000
I think I'm gonna talk to Sofía.
She's another friend.

1465
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:21,625
Who's that?

1466
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:23,750
-She has green eyes…
-Another?

1467
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:26,291
-She's funnier--
-Who is Sofía? Who is Sofía?

1468
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,000
You gotta tell me about Sofía.

1469
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:31,708
Let's get pizza, you can tell me
about Sofía and Lupita and all of them.
