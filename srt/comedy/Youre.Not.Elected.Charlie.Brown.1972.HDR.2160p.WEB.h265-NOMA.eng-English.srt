1
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:33,116
You're elected, Charlie Brown
You're the biggest head in town

2
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,994
Tell me, how do you like it now?

3
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,796
I'm never going to school again.

4
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,173
I've had it.

5
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,842
What's the matter, Sally?

6
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,260
Why are you upset?

7
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,555
Is your teacher giving you trouble again?

8
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,057
No, nothing's wrong with my teacher.

9
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,643
She's a very nice person.

10
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,562
Is it one of the classes?

11
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,897
No. The classes are okay.

12
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,359
Are you having trouble with math?

13
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,028
Don't you understand fractions
and decimals?

14
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,406
No, I don't find it hard.

15
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,868
In fact, I even got a hundred
in my test yesterday.

16
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,829
Are you having any trouble
with the kids on the playground?

17
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,873
No, no, no. That's all right.

18
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,084
Well, then, what's the trouble?

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,671
I can't get my stupid locker open.

20
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,890
Sally, it's time to get up
and go to school.

21
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:43,270
I told you
I wasn't going to go to school again.

22
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,731
Come on, I'll help you with the locker.

23
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,817
Well, okay.

24
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,404
But there's something else
you can help me with today.

25
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,408
If I go to school,
will you promise to help me?

26
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,494
Of course, of course. Now get up.

27
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,753
What are you going to have for breakfast?

28
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,715
Maybe I'll have a piece of toast.
I'm never very hungry in the morning.

29
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,052
You can't go to school
without a rousing breakfast.

30
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,304
It's a known fact that--

31
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:22,893
that all of our country's presidents
started each day with a rousing breakfast.

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,940
I don't know how they managed
to get together every morning,

33
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:33,445
but I guess that's one of those things
about government I don't understand.

34
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:02,015
Come on, Sally. Let's go to school.

35
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:30,252
Okay, Sally. About your locker,
do you know the combination?

36
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,754
Of course I know the combination.

37
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,091
It's 20-13-48.

38
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:42,806
You go to 20, then past zero to 13,
then back past zero again to 48.

39
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:50,522
I've been looking at that sign every day,
and I finally figured out what it means.

40
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:53,483
It means that the bus holds 50 kids.

41
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,403
Each kid has two feet, right?

42
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,365
100 feet means the bus holds 50 kids.

43
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,452
You gotta remember

44
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:07,789
that sometimes you have to tap the lock
on the bottom to make it open.

45
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,626
Some of these locks are kind of touchy.

46
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,129
You have to make sure
that you dial the numbers just right.

47
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,966
I had one once that I had to hit
on the bottom before it would open.

48
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:23,055
Mine won't open because I can't reach it.
That's why.

49
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,851
Forget that stupid locker.

50
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:32,356
I've got something more important
that I need your help with right now.

51
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:44,368
Miss Othmar, I volunteer to be first.

52
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,795
For show-and-tell today,
I have a treat for you.

53
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,548
I'm presenting my big brother.

54
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,092
Now, actually, he's my big brother

55
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,470
only because he was lucky enough
to be born first.

56
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:08,308
Stand up straight.
I'm trying to get an A in show-and-tell.

57
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,893
Don't goof it for me.

58
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:15,858
Actually, big brothers come
in a variety of sizes and quality.

59
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,820
Anyway, this is my big brother,

60
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:24,283
and I just thought I would present him
to you today for show-and-tell.

61
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,951
Thank you.

62
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,046
That's the most embarrassing thing
that's ever happened to me

63
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,882
in my whole life.

64
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,470
Student body president?

65
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,640
That would be a good job for you,
Charlie Brown.

66
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,059
You'd make a great student body president.

67
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:54,146
Me? Nobody would ever vote for me.

68
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,814
I would.

69
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,401
What's going on here?
What are you guys talking about?

70
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,237
I think Charlie Brown
would make a great candidate

71
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,323
for student body president.

72
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,659
That sounds great,
but I don't think I could win.

73
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:12,122
I'd hate to run and find
that nobody wanted me to be president.

74
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,458
I don't think I could stand that.

75
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,667
I'll tell you what,

76
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:19,630
I'll be your campaign manager,
and the first thing to do is take a poll.

77
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,216
We'll find out if you can be elected.

78
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,135
Just think, Charlie Brown,

79
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,222
how exciting it would be for you
if you did win.

80
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,015
I can see it now.

81
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,810
All the votes are counted, and everyone
comes running up to you and says,

82
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,814
"You're elected, Charlie Brown!"
Wouldn't that make you feel great?

83
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,567
I have the results of my poll.

84
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,153
You'll never be elected, Charlie Brown.

85
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,657
You have no way of winning. No way.

86
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,293
Joe Cool, back in school

87
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:02,798
Hanging round the water fountain
Playing the fool

88
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:07,344
Joe Cool, take it light

89
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,890
If the principal catches you
You're out of sight

90
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,980
Take those shades off

91
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,858
Walking round the hall

92
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:25,404
Joe Cool, making the rounds

93
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:29,616
Checking all the kiddies
Up and down

94
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,954
Joe Cool, play it straight

95
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:39,418
If the principal catches you
It's gonna be too late

96
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:45,549
Yeah

97
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,177
Better learn to add now

98
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:08,322
According to my poll, Charlie Brown,
your chances for being elected are zero.

99
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,575
No way.
We'll have to put up another candidate.

100
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,745
How about you, Linus?

101
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,082
He'll do something about those lockers
that nobody can reach.

102
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,378
Well, I don't know.
I'll take another poll.

103
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:30,135
If my brother Linus
were running for student body president,

104
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,678
would you vote for him?

105
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,602
If my brother were running
for student body president,

106
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,938
would you vote for him?

107
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,400
Yeah, I remember one time he gave me
half of his peanut butter sandwich.

108
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,612
I'd vote for anybody
who took me out to lunch.

109
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:53,242
If my brother Linus
were running for student body president,

110
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,743
would you vote for him?

111
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,496
You bet!

112
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,290
How could I help it?

113
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,543
Linus all the way!

114
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:06,338
If you knew that Linus van Pelt
were running for president,

115
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,632
-would you vote for him?
-No.

116
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,760
If you knew
that he was going to straighten out

117
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,554
the whole educational system,

118
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,222
would you vote for him?

119
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,306
No.

120
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,978
If you knew that he was going to solve
all the problems of the whole world,

121
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,521
would you vote for him?

122
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,857
-No.
-Well, why not?

123
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,901
'Cause I'm the one
who'd be running against him.

124
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,156
Okay, the results are in.

125
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,579
I've conducted my poll on Linus's chances
to be elected student body president.

126
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:44,293
The results are 99% for Linus, 1% against.

127
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:50,174
Boy, this auditorium is packed
with teachers and kids.

128
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,343
Schroeder's starting
his nomination speech for you.

129
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:58,056
I'm here this morning to nominate
for the office of school president

130
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,058
a great young man.

131
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:03,520
But first, I'd like to say
a few words about Beethoven.

132
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,939
Oh, good grief.

133
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:10,277
The candidate whose name I would like
to place before the electorate

134
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,822
possesses the same
unique combination of qualities

135
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,200
as those possessed by Beethoven,

136
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,619
the greatest of all composers.

137
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:22,331
That wonderful pianist
and that tower of strength.

138
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,374
Linus is sort of like that too.

139
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:33,133
I accept the nomination for the office
of student body president.

140
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:39,389
All right. To get organized,
I'm the campaign manager.

141
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,642
And, of course,
I have to have an assistant.

142
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,727
That will be you, Charlie Brown.

143
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,147
And if you need any assistance,
you line up your own staff.

144
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,774
You gotta have somebody

145
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,652
who will handle things
like signs and posters.

146
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,907
Snoopy, you're going to be my assistant
in this campaign.

147
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,286
And the first thing I want you to do
is to have some signs painted.

148
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,832
You can line up your own staff.

149
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,518
What about a platform, Linus?

150
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,020
What are you going to do
about drinking fountains?

151
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,856
I'm for them!

152
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,441
Good. What will you do about recesses?

153
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,861
Longer recesses, I say!

154
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:37,406
Good, good. What about homework?
Are you against homework?

155
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,532
Hear! Hear!

156
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,618
What about sick pay? Are you for sick pay?

157
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:42,953
I'm for it!

158
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,344
The studio's right through here.

159
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,137
I've lined you up with a talk show

160
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,473
so you can have a chance
to answer questions

161
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,558
that some of the voters may have.

162
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,770
It'll give us the kind
of exposure we need.

163
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:13,794
Stand by.

164
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,714
Okay. You're on, Linus.

165
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,885
Hello? Yes? Are you there?

166
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,805
Hello? Hello? Am I on the air?

167
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,640
Hello? Hello?

168
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,142
-Are we talking now?
-Good grief.

169
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,978
Yes, you're on the air.

170
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,147
What do you have to say?
Do you have a question?

171
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,693
Yes. I'm a first-time caller
but a longtime listener.

172
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,238
I wanna know what the candidate's gonna do
about the rivers.

173
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,449
Rivers?
Our school doesn't have any rivers.

174
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,828
-Hello? Hello? Am I on the air?
-Yes, you're on the air.

175
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,454
What is your question?

176
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,291
Well, you know,
I just called to, you know--

177
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,625
I have questions, you know?

178
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,669
And you know how it is
when you're a voter.

179
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,421
And, you know, I just wanted to ask--

180
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,298
I just wanted to talk to the candidate.

181
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,301
'Cause you know how it is
when you're going to vote for somebody.

182
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,679
You sort of like to talk to them
and feel how they talk--

183
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,016
Hello?

184
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,851
Hello? Who is this?

185
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,104
What do you mean, "Who is this?"
Do you wanna talk to the candidate?

186
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:17,274
What? No.
I'm calling Harold in Saint Paul.

187
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,027
Is Harold home? I wanna talk to Harold.

188
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,820
You have the wrong number.

189
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:23,614
Hello?

190
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,407
Hello. I have a question.

191
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,744
I want to ask this question,
and I want to talk to the candidate.

192
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,746
Can I ask the candidate a question?

193
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,539
Yes, the candidate is here.

194
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,499
-Hello?
-Yes.

195
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,001
Well, I have this question

196
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,796
that I thought maybe if I called,
I could ask you the question.

197
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,509
Because I know that if you're going
to vote for a candidate,

198
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:47,554
I'm kind of glad that it's good
that you're having a talk show like this.

199
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:51,517
Because it's kind of nice
that we can call in and ask our questions,

200
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,394
because you really can't ask questions
of candidates.

201
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:58,524
I don't know how you can vote
for somebody, and I'm glad that I have

202
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,734
a chance to ask this question.

203
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,196
And I hope you don't mind,
because I thought about this question.

204
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:08,116
And I think it's good to be able
to ask questions of a candidate.

205
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,910
I have a question for you.

206
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,037
Yes. What?

207
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,747
What is your question?

208
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,707
What?

209
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,543
What did you say?

210
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,211
What is your question?

211
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,672
Question? Oh, my gosh.

212
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,549
I forgot what the question is.

213
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,888
I see by the clock
that our time is just about up.

214
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,891
I'm glad we have had
this opportunity to talk,

215
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,228
because I think it has cleared up
a lot of the issues

216
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,855
on the minds of you voters.

217
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:42,359
And if we don't have talk shows like this
that can help us clear up these issues,

218
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,736
we cannot really have good government.

219
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,947
Thank you all for your cooperation.

220
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:10,053
We're in.
The polls show Linus ahead 99.8% to 0.2%.

221
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,557
Great. I'll go out now
and introduce the opposition.

222
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:23,901
My friends, it gives me great pleasure

223
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,696
to present to you our two candidates
for office.

224
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,241
I'm happy to present Russell Anderson.

225
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,874
And Linus van Pelt.

226
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:47,591
I know you are all anxious to hear
what the candidates have to say.

227
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:53,263
So, without further ado,
I present to you Russell Anderson.

228
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:03,106
I'm very honored to be running
for student body president.

229
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,027
If I'm elected,
I promise to do the best I can.

230
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,111
Thank you.

231
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,155
Boy, now we're really in.

232
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:13,617
That's the worst speech I ever heard
in my whole life.

233
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,619
Well, you've heard the thoughts
of one candidate.

234
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:20,540
Now I'd like to introduce Linus van Pelt.

235
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,673
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

236
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:32,845
Friends, schoolmates,
teachers, countrymen.

237
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:38,016
I'm elected student body president,
I will purge the kingdom.

238
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,563
My administration will release us
from our spiritual Babylon.

239
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,902
My administration will bring down
the false idols in high places.

240
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,572
I wonder why the principal looks so pale.

241
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:59,329
I'm elected school president,
I will demand immediate improvements.

242
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:04,209
I will demand across-the-board
wage increases for custodians,

243
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:08,380
teachers and all administrative personnel.

244
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:13,635
And any little dog who happens to wander
onto the playground

245
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:19,391
will not be chased away
but will be welcomed with open arms.

246
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:29,067
I'm elected, I will do away
with cap-and-gown kindergarten graduations

247
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,153
and sixth grade dance parties.

248
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,531
Hooray! Tell it like it is, Linus.

249
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,368
With my administration,

250
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:42,456
children will be children,
and adults will be adults.

251
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,960
If I'm elected school president,

252
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:51,298
my first act will be to appear
before the school board.

253
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,056
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,643
I will not be able to appear
before the school board.

255
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,311
They meet at eight o'clock,

256
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,230
and I go to bed at 7:30.

257
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm a reporter
from our school paper, Linus.

258
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,695
Would you care to tell us
what you intend to do if you're elected?

259
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:18,450
I intend to straighten things out.
We are in the midst of a moral decline.

260
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,370
If I'm elected, my first act will be

261
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:25,874
to meet with the parents' club,
the principal and all the teachers.

262
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,709
-We are starting--
-I'll just put down

263
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:31,171
that you're very honored
and will do your best if elected.

264
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,550
The press is against me.

265
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,720
I'm a photographer
for our school paper, Linus.

266
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,306
As long as you're running
for school president,

267
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,016
we'd like a picture of you.

268
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,479
In order to make it look sort of homey,
I thought we'd pose you with a dog.

269
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,527
I've changed my mind.

270
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,114
Linus, this is your last speech
of the campaign.

271
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,658
So go out there
and give it all you've got.

272
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,002
Mr. Chairman,
teachers and fellow students.

273
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,755
This will be my last speech
before our election.

274
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,008
We've got it cold, Charlie Brown.

275
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,511
I want you to know
that I have enjoyed this campaign.

276
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,513
You tell 'em!

277
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:25,267
And it has been a pleasure
to meet so many of you.

278
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,519
Yay! Tell it like it is!

279
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:29,897
And I have appreciated your support.

280
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,774
Therefore,
I have a little surprise for you.

281
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,359
Tell it like it is!

282
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,198
And as a change of pace,
rather than campaign talk,

283
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:43,744
I've decided to say a few words
about the Great Pumpkin.

284
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,748
Halloween will soon be with us.

285
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:53,045
And on Halloween night, the Great Pumpkin
rises out of the pumpkin patch

286
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:56,840
and brings toys
to all the good little children.

287
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,554
I've blown the election.

288
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:07,434
All right, say it. Say it.
Go ahead and say it.

289
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:09,269
I know you wanna say it.

290
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,980
I talked too much,
and I blew the election.

291
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:15,776
-So go ahead and say it.
-You blockhead!

292
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,445
She said it.

293
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,615
The way I see it, we still have a chance.

294
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:26,286
My personal poll now shows
you and Russell tied at 50-50.

295
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,291
If you don't do some other stupid thing,
we might still pull it out of the bag.

296
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,087
It's depressing to think

297
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,341
that there are students
who don't believe in the Great Pumpkin.

298
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,346
It's hard being a campaign worker.

299
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,558
We're completely at the mercy
of our candidate.

300
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:51,061
We do all the work,
and the candidate gets all the credit.

301
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:56,692
We ring doorbells and make the posters
and build up the candidate's image,

302
00:21:56,775 --> 00:22:00,779
and then he says something stupid
and ruins everything we've done.

303
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:06,869
The next time I do any campaigning,
it's gonna be for myself.

304
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,498
Two for Russell. One, Linus.

305
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,086
Three, Linus. Two, Russell.

306
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:20,591
Eighty-two, Russell. Eighty-one, Linus.

307
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,096
One for Linus.

308
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:30,100
Eighty-two, Russell. Eighty-two, Linus.

309
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,354
One for Russell.

310
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:37,608
Eighty-three, Russell. Eighty-two, Linus.

311
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,115
Vote for Linus.

312
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,369
Eighty-three, Russell.
Eighty-three, Linus.

313
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:06,136
I think that he would make
a better president than I would.

314
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,723
Vote for Linus.

315
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:15,395
That makes it 84, Linus and 83, Russell.

316
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,981
Linus is the winner!

317
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,069
Boy, oh boy. We finally made it.

318
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,278
Here we are.

319
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:26,657
Now you go in and tell him
exactly what you're gonna do

320
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,575
to straighten out this school.

321
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:34,623
You go right in and tell him.
You've got the authority. We voted you in.

322
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,963
Linus will lower the boom.

323
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:44,174
He should make today a school holiday.

324
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,350
Yes, sir. You're absolutely right, sir.

325
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,603
I won't do anything
without consulting you, sir.

326
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,273
What an ordeal.

327
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,275
Well, I hope you told him.

328
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,402
Well, not really.

329
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,072
As a matter of fact, he told me.

330
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:13,203
He sold out!
We elected him, and he sold out!

331
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:20,836
They're all the same! Promises, promises.

332
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,715
You elect them,
and they weasel out of their promises.
