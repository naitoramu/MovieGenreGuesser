1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,635
Not again.

2
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,334
Bow down
before Recyclops.

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,104
Five years ago corporate
said we had to start

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,701
a recycling program
for Earth Day,

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,246
so Dwight took
the lead on that,

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:18,307
and introduced us to a very close
friend of his named Recyclops.

7
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,480
Happy Earth Day, everyone.
I'm Recyclops.

8
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:22,953
Did you know that
an old milk carton

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,287
can be sawed in half
and used as a planter?

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,486
<i>JIM: The next year, he
really stepped things up.</i>

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:33,599
Who has put a number seven
plastic in a number four bin?

12
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:37,193
<i>A year after that, Recyclops
really began to take shape.</i>

13
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:43,740
Recyclops will drown you
in your over-watered lawns!

14
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,469
Then tragedy struck Recyclops
when his fictional planet

15
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,778
was attacked by some other
fictitious thing, I can't remember.

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,377
Recyclops will have
his revenge!

17
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,881
I think this was also the year
that he renounced Earth Day

18
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:00,084
and vowed to destroy
the planet he once loved.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,526
Oh, my God, you guys,
look! It's Recyclops!

20
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,359
Recyclops destroy!

21
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,229
(BELLOWING)

22
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,963
Oh, is today Recyclops Day? Yes.

23
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,029
I thought you were killed
by Polluticon or something.

24
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,836
Polluticon wishes.

25
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,608
That's aerosol spray. It's
terrible for the environment.

26
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,647
DWIGHT: Humans are terrible
for the environment.

27
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,409
(BELLOWING)

28
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,715
The thing I like most
about Recyclops

29
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,448
is that he's creating a
different world for our child.

30
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:30,546
Hmm.

31
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,649
<i>A world where you truly
can be anything you want.</i>

32
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,091
<i>JIM: God bless you,
Recyclops,</i>

33
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,924
<i>and your cold
robot heart.</i>

34
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,524
Okay. Okay.
How about this?

35
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,758
That's great.

36
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,564
I want it to be better
than great, Pam.

37
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,095
How about I remain seated and
I just do a little bit of a nod,

38
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,165
sort of a humble thing?
Sure.

39
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,507
No. Then my face is down.
They can't see my face.

40
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:26,840
And it looks like
you're taking a dump.

41
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,713
Alan Brand who's
the CEO of the company,

42
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,580
if title is important
to you,

43
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,986
<i>has personally invited
moi to go to New York</i>

44
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,648
to the shareholders'
meeting

45
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,193
and sit up on the stage
with the board of directors.

46
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,855
And at some point, they're
going to introduce me

47
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,663
as the most successful
branch manager that they have.

48
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,831
And then Michael Scott turns
and waves to the crowd.

49
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,299
And the crowd goes wild.

50
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,874
Ladies and gentlemen,
from Scranton, Pennsylvania,

51
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:03,473
please welcome
Michael "The Machine" Scott!

52
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,310
Oh.

53
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,979
Don't do the twirl.
Lose the twirl.

54
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,989
DWIGHT: Twirl sucks.
Michael, I hated the twirl.

55
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,217
Hate the twirl.

56
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,522
Okay, obviously I'm not
going to do the twirl.

57
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,391
I only did it because
I nailed the wave.

58
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,952
Yeah, good.
Don't do it.

59
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:22,297
(ENUNCIATING) I'm not going
to do the twirl, all right?

60
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,131
It's not even a twirl.
It's a spin.

61
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,003
I might do the spin.

62
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:31,837
The long-term problem is bad
investments that they need to dump.

63
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,572
And the short-term problem
is the company

64
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,307
has no cash and there's
nowhere to get it.

65
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,316
Okay, Oscar. I don't need the
whole enchilada, just bullet points.

66
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,442
Those are
the bullet points.

67
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,009
Well, could you
condense it, please?

68
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,554
That's as simple
as I can make it.

69
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,884
Michael, the limo's
here for you.

70
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,549
It's not a limo,
it's a town car.

71
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,956
Town cars are
actually better, though,

72
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,755
better torque,
better handling.

73
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,125
He said limousine, so...

74
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:53,222
Check it out, guys,
there's a limo down here.

75
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,329
Michael, look.

76
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,810
Oh, man!
It's a limo.

77
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:06,936
They sent a limo.

78
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,380
Town cars suck.
A town car

79
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,474
is something that a company
sends when they're in trouble.

80
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,884
A limousine is something
that a company sends

81
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,980
when they have cause
for celebration.

82
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,585
And in this case, I think
we are celebrating me.

83
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,300
KEVIN: Move it! Quick!

84
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,598
MICHAEL: (LAUGHS)
Wow! Wow!

85
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,638
ANDY: Oh, no way!
Yeah!

86
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,206
What kind of mileage
does this baby get?

87
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,144
It's like what high school
kids take to prom on TV shows.

88
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,875
So typical of management
to spend money on this.

89
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,883
(EXCLAIMING)
Bunch of boobs!

90
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,419
Hate to break it to you, Oscar,
but some of us like boobs.

91
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,284
Calves.
Calves all the way.

92
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,652
I'm so jealous
right now.

93
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,487
Hey, you know who you
should be jealous of?

94
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,924
Yourself.

95
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,861
Because you're invited,
and you're invited,

96
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,955
and you're invited,
and you, and you,

97
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,523
and you and you and you
and you... Car seats eight.

98
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,898
What?
The car seats eight.

99
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,266
The limo seats eight.

100
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,101
Okay, then Jim and Pam
and Ryan plus a guest.

101
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,162
No.
No, thanks.

102
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,868
I'll use it
when you're done.

103
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,977
MICHAEL: Mmm.

104
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,144
Whoa.

105
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,345
The Dunder Mifflin
stock symbol is DMI.

106
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,942
Do you know what
that stands for?

107
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,816
Dummies,
Morons and Idiots,

108
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,516
because that's what
you'd have to be to own it.

109
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:28,420
And as one of those idiots, I
believe the board owes me answers.

110
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,254
MICHAEL: I wish the
windows weren't tinted

111
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,321
so people could
see us in here.

112
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,231
Hey, guys, do you think anyone
might have had sex in here?

113
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,132
Definitely. Definitely. Smells like it.

114
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,727
Look, they got pillows.

115
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,000
That, that's bigger
than my bed.

116
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,304
Word.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,806
MICHAEL: Who's playing
with the button?

118
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,510
Hey, Ryan, could you start consolidating

119
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,277
all our Rolodex
information into Outlook?

120
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,080
Doesn't seem like
there's much of a point

121
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,312
if the company's
going under.

122
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,513
But if the company
doesn't go under,

123
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,249
then we'll finally have all
our contacts in one program.

124
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,291
Company's probably going under,
though. It could go either way.

125
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,485
Seems like it's
leaning one way.

126
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,891
Maybe we should just
wait and find out.

127
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:02,985
Definitely.
Okay.

128
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,895
So should we wait to find out
before we start doing all this stuff?

129
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,160
Nah. Might as well
do it now.

130
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,772
Michael, what if somebody asks
you a question at this meeting?

131
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,967
Are you just
going to wave or what?

132
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,407
I will have to answer.

133
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,501
I'll ask you
a question.

134
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,704
Make it a softball.

135
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,270
Something he can, like,
crank out of the park.

136
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,442
Michael Scott, you run the most
profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin.

137
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,712
Yeah.
How do you do it?

138
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,483
No, no, that's too hard.
Say, your name is Zamboni,

139
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,690
and then I will say, "Well,
we're sort of on thin ice."

140
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,818
(LAUGHS)
Uh-oh!

141
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,327
I won't say that. I'll
say something like that.

142
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,991
ANDY: This is your big day. Come on.

143
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,465
Whoo. Oh, my God. This is it.

144
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,662
LAURIE: Mr. Scott?
Yes.

145
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,998
I'm Laurie.
Oh, hi.

146
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,504
Thank you for joining us. Come with me.

147
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,733
Well, thank you.
And please call...

148
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,776
Continue to call me
Mr. Scott.

149
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:51,867
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

150
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,775
If you just want to follow me
I'll take you up to the lounge.

151
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,713
Well, I guess this is as far
as I can take you guys, so...

152
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,512
DWIGHT: Good luck,
Michael. See you later.

153
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,918
Officers. Thank you.

154
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,013
After you, Mr. Scott.

155
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,387
Thank you.

156

Michael.
Hello.

157
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,387
So glad you could make it. Thank you.

158
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,485
How was the ride?

159
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,554
Oh. It was awesome.
Very, very sublime.

160
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,691
I'm glad. I want to
introduce you to everyone.

161
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,701
Okay. First we'll start with Alan Brand.

Alan, CEO.

163
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,432
Michael Scott,
Branch Manager, Scranton.

164
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,469
It's nice to meet you,
Michael. Nice to meet you, too.

165
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,874
It's an honor
and a privilege.

166

Seated, we have the former
congressman, Chris O'Keefe.

Your eminence.

questions, please line up

I was hoping to lob Michael
a softball question early.

176
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,954
I wanted to swing by
the Garment District,

177
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,319
pick up a few crates
of my shirts.

178
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,914
I got a shirt guy.

179

OSCAR: Would you
believe this?

180

on this convention hall!

Excuse me, miss.

182
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,865
Just want to take this stupid
board of directors by their necks.

183
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,562
This is so simple.

184
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,797
Yeah.
Idiots!

185
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,772
Well, you should do that.
Get in line.

Oh, what a great idea, and
lose my job. No, thank you.

able to tell your grandkids

No.

193

Obama twins? Anybody famous?

Hey, Ryan,
how's it going?

331

Here's the thing.

332
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,441
I've tried it, like, five
different ways in my head and...

333
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:13,137
Oh. Got one.
I'm such a perfectionist

334
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,878
that I'd kind of rather not do it
at all than do a crappy version.

335
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,440
Simple data entry, though. So
there's really only one way to do it.

336
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,452
Sounds like you have a
really specific vision for it.

just take a whack at it?

What?

339

I think I know the problem. Great.

340

I think
you seem distracted.

341
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,190
Yep, that is
the problem.

342
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,557
And you know what, I
came up with something

343
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,959
that I think is
really gonna help.

344
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,622
Well, I'm glad you're
finally being proactive, Jim.

345
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,858
I am, too.
Let me show you.

346
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,570
Wow, things are
really picking up.

What was that about?

348
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,064
What?

349
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,733
You were supposed to wave.

350
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,674
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.

351
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,109
What are we supposed
to tell them now?

352
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,510
Okay, you've dug us
quite a hole.

353
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,980
We tell them the plan.
Right?

354
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,449
There is no plan.

355
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,417
Here's what
we're going to do.

356
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,356
The 45-day thing that I
outlined, we go with that.

357
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,925
Day 45, company saved.

358
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,087
Day 44, go,
what have we got?

359
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,187
We have 15 minutes.

to mind, shout it out.

is this guy?

who roused that crowd.

DAVID: Yes.
Got them on their feet.

365
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,564
They were so happy down there. Yes. Yes.

Okay. All right.

Well, I know a guy, this
Mexican guy, he's a math wiz.

369
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,019
He knows economics as well
as he knows bullfighting.

370
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,320
And I am going to
call in a little favor.

371
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,916
No, no, no.
Don't call anybody, Michael.

372
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,291
Well, I'm texting him, so.

373
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,388
Please do not text
anybody now, Michael.

374

00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,406
Gentlemen, I would
like you to meet Oscar.

379
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,878
Come on in,
don't be shy.

380
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,972
This is Oscar Martinez.

381
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,810
Oscar, why don't you come
over here? Let me present you.

Step up,
step up there.

383
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,786
Oscar is an accountant
extraordinaire at the Scranton branch,

384
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,086
and he has
a wonderful idea

385
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,026
as to how to get us out of
this murky, murky situation.

386
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,187
Take it away.

387
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,962
I think this is
really going to help.

388
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,005
If you could just
hold up here one second.

389
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,505
Hey, guys, just
a quick announcement.

390
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,063
If I could have
everyone's attention.

391
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,940
Just figured you needed a place
where you could concentrate.

392
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,172
And not be bothered
by bothering people.

393
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,271
Okay.

394
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,940

what I mean.

395

How great is that, right?

396
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,479
For a job well done.
Well, not done.

397

Tell them what you
told me. This is genius.

405
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,242
Tell them about
the cash flow

406
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,754
and the dumping of
properties and...

407
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,687
This is all good.
It's all good stuff.

408

Lay it on them.

409
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,098
I feel,
as does Mr. Scott,

410
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,963
that we are in
the best of hands,

That wasn't what
you were saying to me.

He was much more
articulate

414

much better.

<i>I believe that there
are options out there.</i>

466
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,821

<i>What about ropes along the
