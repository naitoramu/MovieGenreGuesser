1
00:00:00,816 --> 00:00:02,615
Kevin Malone, you're next.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,648
Spit that out.

3
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:07,859
Spit...
Okay, come on. Let's go.

4
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:13,448
You look cute today, Dwight.

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:15,677
Thanks, girl.

6
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:22,199
So, yesterday, Dwight found
half a joint in the parking lot.

7
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,541
<i>Which is unfortunate,
because, as it turns out,</i>

8
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:26,605
<i>Dwight finding a drugs
is more dangerous</i>

9
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,448
<i>than most people using drugs.</i>

10
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:31,700
Let's go over some of the symptoms
of marijuana use.

11
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:32,846
Shall we ?

12
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,800
You tell me who this sounds like.

13
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:37,876
Slow moving.

14
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,042
Inattentive.

15
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:41,490
Dull.

16
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,473
Constantly snacking.

17
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:48,073
Shows a lack of motivation.

18
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:54,723
I like the people
I work with, generally.

19
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:56,522
With four exceptions.

20
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:59,191
But someone committed a crime.

21
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:01,013
And I did not become
a Lackawanna County

22
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:03,140
Volunteer Sheriff's
Deputy to make friends.

23
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:06,313
And by the way, I haven't.

24
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,650
Episode 20 - Season 2
DRUG TESTING

27
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,780
I enjoy the tangy zip,

28
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:43,471
of Miracle Whip.

29
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:46,701
Jim does the best impressions.

30
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:48,741
Sometimes he'll look up
at me from his desk

31
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:50,181
and he'll just be someone else.

32
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:52,263
Like, he'll go...

33
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,480
That's supposed to be Phyllis.

34
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,671
I can't do it as good as he can.

35
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,262
And the guys are saying,
"Chug chug chug."

36
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:07,201
But I'm so small
and all I'd eaten that day

37
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,852
was one of those Auntie Annes's
pretzels from the food court.

38
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:12,042
So I said,
"Is it okay if I sip it ?"

39
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:14,500
And they said no.
But Ryan seemed cool either way.

40
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,631
Stop!

41
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:18,190
This is no Kelly Kapour story hour.

42
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:22,700
Illegal drugs were consumed
on company property, okay ?

43
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:25,122
Your ass is on the line, Mister!

44
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:26,962
My ass is on the line!

45
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,511
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

46
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:31,901
What time did you go home
last night ?

47
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:33,732
6:00.

48
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:43,151
I didn't know you were
at a party on Saturday night.

49
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,842
I go to a lot of parties.

50
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,421
Okay, I'm gonna need to search
your car. Give me your keys.

51
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:50,130
I am not giving you my keys.

52
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:51,842
Don't make me do this the hard way.

53
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:53,103
What's the hard way ?

54
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:56,150
I go down to the police station
on my lunch break.

55
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:57,582
I tell a police officer...

56
00:02:57,907 --> 00:02:58,960
I know several.

57
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:00,913
What I may suspect
you may have in your car.

58
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:03,730
He requests a hearing from a judge
and obtains a search warrant.

59
00:03:03,856 --> 00:03:06,530
Once he has said warrant,
he will drive over here

60
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:09,113
and make you give him
the keys to your car.

61
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,291
And you will have to obey him.

62
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:13,223
Yeah, let's do it that way.

63
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:14,940
Ryan, is he bugging you ?

64
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:17,671
Dwight, dude, you gotta take
a chill pill, man.

65
00:03:17,726 --> 00:03:20,660
It was one joint in
the parking lot,  you know ?

66
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:24,062
You're...you're totally
harshing the office mellow.

67
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:26,221
I can't stop this investigation.
It is my job.

68
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:29,271
- You are a volunteer.
- I volunteered for this job.

69
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:30,302
And that's not the same.

70
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:31,862
- It is my duty...
- Volunteer duty.

71
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:34,871
To investigate the crime scene.
I have six more interviews to go,

72
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,482
and then I will reveal what I know.

73
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:38,873
Narc!

74
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:42,073
If  you are attempting
to compliment me,

75
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,542
then you have done a very good job.

76
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:45,201
I wasn't attempting
to compliment you.

77
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:46,802
Well, you have.
Because being a narc

78
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,771
is one of the hardest jobs
that you can have.

79
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:51,681
- And I am very proud of being a narc.
- Why don't you just cool it ?

80
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:54,132
Cool it, Dwight, please ? God.
Dude, where's my office ?

81
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,643
I totally lost it.

82
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:57,791
'Cause I was half...baked!

83
00:03:57,918 --> 00:03:59,453
Smoking doobies!

84
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:03,300
Doobie Brothers. I was smoking
doobies with my brothers.

85
00:04:03,747 --> 00:04:05,753
Peace out Seacrest!

86
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:09,233
Well, your office is behind you.

87
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:10,361
Thanks.

88
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,013
Munchies.

89
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,591
Who wants some munchies ?

90
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,830
I don't think Michael's
ever done drugs.

91
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,740
I don't know if anyone's
ever offered him any.

92
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,490
<i>Oscar visited Mexico
when he was five</i>

93
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,383
<i>to attend his great
grandmother's funeral.</i>

94
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:26,123
<i>What does that mean</i>

95
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:28,211
<i>to the United States
law enforcement officer ?</i>

96
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:30,820
He'a a potential drug mule.

97
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:33,471
Have you ever taken
any illegal drugs ?

98
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,573
No, I have not.

99
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:36,231
Do you think it's possible that

100
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:38,772
maybe you could have had
some drugs in your system

101
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,653
without you knowing about it ?

102
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:43,190
What are you implying ?

103
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:45,293
Have you ever...

104
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,573
pooped...

105
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:49,701
a balloon ?

106
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:54,412
Okay, I'm done with this.

107
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,513
He sure left in a hurry.

108
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:04,641
I don't want to blow this.

109
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,531
<i>This is what all good law
enforcement officers dream of.</i>

110
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:10,152
<i>The  chance to solve
an actual crime.</i>

111
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:13,941
Do you know what this is ?

112
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,613
Yes, it's marijuana.

113
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,320
How do you know that ?

114
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:18,893
It's labeled.

115
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:22,052
Dammit.

116
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:27,041
That, is Northern Lights
Cannabis Indica.

117
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,142
It's marijuana.

118
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,672
I'm just saying that you can't
be sure that it wasn't you.

119
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,652
That's ridiculous,
of course it wasn't me.

120
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:38,690
Marijuana is a memory loss drug.

121
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:40,103
So maybe you just don't remember.

122
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:41,230
I would remember.

123
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:43,442
Well, how could you if it just
erased your memory ?

124
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:46,261
- That's not how it works.
- Now, how do you know how it works ?

125
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:48,370
Knock it off, okay.
Now I'm interviewing you.

126
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,510
No, you said that I'd be 
conducting the interview

127
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:51,453
when I walked in here.

128
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,513
Now, exactly how much
pot did you smoke ?!

129
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:58,070
So, Pam told me you do
a great Stanley impression.

130
00:05:58,118 --> 00:05:59,220
I'd love to hear it.

131
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:06,872
Why do you keep CC'ing me on things
that have nothing to do with me ?

132
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,942
Is that supposed to be me ?

133
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,010
Oh, hey, Stanley.

134
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,880
I was just doing an impression.

135
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:16,012
I do not think that is funny.

136
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,752
He  does everyone in the office.

137
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:28,792
"I do not think that is funny."

138
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:30,191
Jinx, buy me a coke.

139
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:31,871
No no no. No talking.

140
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:38,832
Jim is not allowed to talk
until after he buys me a coke.

141
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:42,033
Those are the rules of Jinx.
And they are unflinchingly rigid.

142
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:54,302
Sold out! That has never
happened in the history of Jinx!

143
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:55,690
"Come on."

144
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:57,546
Sorry, that's not my problem.

145
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:07,920
I know you're innocent.

146
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:10,416
But I can't look like I'm treating
you any differently.

147
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,213
I understand.

148
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:15,401
Where were you yesterday
after work ?

149
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,893
Who's he calling ?
Rattin' somebody out.

150
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,190
Narc.

151
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:23,422
Narc!

152
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,901
- Kevin.
- That is so good, Michael.

153
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:26,950
Remember the narc bit ?

154
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,103
Okay, I will let them know.

155
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:32,021
- Attention everyone.
- Who's in trouble ?

156
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:36,063
Drug testers are coming in a couple
hours to test everyone's urine.

157
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,610
What ? What are you talking about ?

158
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:41,953
Company policy.
If drugs are found on the premises,

159
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:45,762
there is automatic drug testing
conducted within 24 hours.

160
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:47,433
Is that true, Toby ?

161
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:49,731
When you sign your job application

162
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:52,100
you agree to comply
with random drug testing.

163
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,262
<i>Two nights ago, I went to
an Alicia Keys concert...</i>

164
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:59,362
at the Montage Mountain
Performing Arts Center.

165
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,023
I had scored these great
aisle seats.

166
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:02,780
Anyway, after the opening act,

167
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:04,620
this beautiful girl
sits down next to me.

168
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:06,763
And I never get to meet
girls with lip rings.

169
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:07,851
And she had one.

170
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,131
I don't know exatcly
how this happened,

171
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:13,523
but one of her friends started
passing around some stuff.

172
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:15,363
And they said that
it was clove cigarettes.

173
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:17,391
And I'm sure that
it was clove cigarettes.

174
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:19,171
Everybody in the aisle
was doing it.

175
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,553
Okay, attention, everyone.

176
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,833
The drug testing
has been cancelled.

177
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,371
Instead I will be going
around to each of you

178
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:28,472
and doing a visual inspection.

179
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:31,041
- No, you can't do that.
- I can do that.  It is my office.

180
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:33,822
No, you cannot.
It has to be official.

181
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:36,060
And it has to be urine.

182
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,392
All right.

183
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:54,170
Kevin, what prescription drugs
are you taking besides Rogaine ?

184
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,870
I'm not taking Rogaine.

185
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:58,842
Angela, what about you ?

186
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,902
I don't take any
prescription drugs.

187
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,901
You're not... on... anything ?

188
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:07,962
Good.

189
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:13,032
So, the first time
we went out to dinner,

190
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,411
it was like, whatever, fine.

191
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,000
But I was so nervous.

192
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,513
So this time I want it
to be special.

193
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:19,900
So, I bought a new dress!

194
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,110
One of those kinds that's kind
of low cut at the top

195
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:23,903
to show some things,
but not everything.

196
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,123
I mean, not everything, Jim.
I promise,

197
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:28,350
- I'm not a...
- Hey guys, what's going on ?

198
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,620
Oh, we're just having
the best conversation.

199
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:34,071
Okay, well, Michael wants to see
everyone in the conference room.

200
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,943
But you know what ?
We have a few minutes.

201
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,633
So you guys should definitely
finish up your conversation.

202
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:40,950
Cool, thanks.

203
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:46,070
So, I was looking so hot...

204
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,321
It has come to my attention,

205
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:53,211
that some people here
think the use of drugs

206
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:55,573
is something to laugh about.

207
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,810
- We don't feel that way.
- No, not at all.

208
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,172
You were the one joking around
calling Dwight a narc.

209
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,442
That was a test. I was testing you.

210
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,302
And you all failed.

211
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:08,580
Miserably.

212
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:12,523
When I said that Dwight was a narc,
how many of you defended him ?

213
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:15,120
How many of you said,
"Hey, you know what ? He's right."

214
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:19,512
"What he's doing is protecting
this office from the evils of drugs" ?

215
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:20,811
Thank you, Michael.

216
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:22,481
I am ridiculously anti-drug.

217
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:25,973
I am so anti-drug that
I am above suspicion

218
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:28,082
in any way that involves
suspicion...

219
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:30,620
or testing of any kind.

220
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:33,390
Drugs ruin lives, people.

221
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:36,382
Drugs destroy careers.

222
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:37,961
Take Cheech and Chong.

223
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,773
Everybody knows that
Cheech and Chong are funny.

224
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:43,893
But just imagine how funny they
would be if they didn't smoke pot.

225
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,281
I want everybody to take
a look to their left.

226
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:51,123
Now I want everybody to take
a look to their right.

227
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:55,482
One of those people will be dead

228
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:59,012
from drug use at some point
in their lives.

229
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:03,083
This year, more people
will use cocaine

230
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:05,352
than will read a book
to their children.

231
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,071
Where did you get these facts ?

232
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:09,523
Are these facts scaring you ?
Or are they not ?

233
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:10,611
They are not.

234
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:13,831
Do  you think that smoking
drugs is cool ?

235
00:11:13,988 --> 00:11:16,430
Do you think that doing
alcohol is cool ?

236
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:19,013
No, I don't.
I have about a glass of red wine

237
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,500
with dinner about once a week.

238
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:22,301
For the antioxidants.

239
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:24,483
Okay, enough. Enough. Enough!

240
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:29,670
I have written down
a list of illegal drugs.

241
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:33,223
Take a gander. How many of these
are you familiar with ?

242
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,863
Hookah is not an illegal drug,
Michael.

243
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,843
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

244
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:39,523
It's a type of pipe.

245
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:43,460
You can fill it with tobacco,
often mixed with fruit, or flavored...

246
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:45,223
Okay, you know what, Toby ?

247
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:46,850
Pam, could you take this down ?

248
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,591
In addition to Toby's
urine being tested,

249
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,542
I would like to test his blood
and his hair.

250
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:54,793
- You can't do that.
- I can test anyone randomly.

251
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:56,801
And I have chosen you, randomly.

252
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,192
- That's not random.
- Okay. Eenie, meanie, miney...

253
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:00,750
moe. Is random.

254
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:02,872
Okay, you know what ?

255
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:05,603
I'm gonna need a volunteer
to select one of these words.

256
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:09,292
And tell us of something... tragic

257
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:12,953
that happened in either their lives
or the lives of a loved one.

258
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:15,700
Yeah, Pam.

259
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:20,432
I know that Jim has an amazing
story about a relative of his

260
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:22,732
who got caught up
in the world of drugs.

261
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:24,011
Really ?

262
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:26,393
Jim, it's okay. You can...

263
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:30,642
This would be a good
place to let it out, Jim.

264
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:34,123
These are people you can trust.
These are people who care about you.

265
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:37,113
It's okay. Just...
we will not judge you.

266
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:39,100
We are here to not judge you.

267
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,453
Oh, he's doing it, okay.

268
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:47,861
It's okay.

269
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:57,612
"I can't."

270
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:03,920
Okay, you sure ?

271
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,220
That looked like
it was going to be good.

272
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,412
All right.

273
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:09,643
Okay, well...

274
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:13,773
He really pulled out the big guns.

275
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:15,251
Fake crying.

276
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,643
Did not expect that.

277
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:23,502
The point I'm trying to make
with all of this, people,

278
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:27,143
is that I hate drugs.
I hate them.

279
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:30,351
And based upon what I have seen,

280
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:33,262
you all don't quite hate 'em
as much as I do.

281
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:37,412
So you are going to have 
a drug test. And I am not.

282
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:40,173
- No, you will be tested.
- Yes, I... no, will not be.

283
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:43,102
You will be. That is the law
according to the rules.

284
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:46,971
Okay. Well, Dwight, just know...
that I've been very busy today.

285
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:49,352
And I've got a lot of work to do.

286
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:51,393
And I wasn't planning
on going to the bathroom.

287
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,970
And I don't even know if
anything's gonna come out, okay ?

288
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,461
So, good. Thank you.

289
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:01,110
Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute.
Assistant Regional Manager.

290
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:04,470
You  might remember testing
my urine a few years back

291
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,901
when I was applying to be a
Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.

292
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:09,163
We test a lot of urine.

293
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:10,731
Mine was green.

294
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:13,250
Oh, right.

295
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:15,973
- How are you ?
- I'm all better.

296
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,511
So, I need you to do some work
on the St. Andrew's account.

297
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,832
I need your urine.

298
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,592
I need some filing done...

299
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:23,251
- What kind of filing ?
- That just...

300
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,061
forget it. Just the urine.

301
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:27,591
That goes directly to the tester.

302
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,030
Just...

303
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:36,530
I need your urine.

304
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,881
- Like in a cup ?
- Yes, in a cup.

305
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:44,190
- We're not animals, Dwight.
- For what purpose ?

306
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:46,143
It's none of your business.

307
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:48,511
- Then I refuse.
- Okay, all right. Just...

308
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,191
I went to an Alicia Keys concert.

309
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:53,361
Over the weekend.

310
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:57,190
And I think that
I may have gotten high

311
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:00,843
accidentally by
a girl with a lip ring.

312
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,352
Are you serious ?

313
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:10,913
I need clean urine for the lady.

314
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:16,463
But that's illegal.

315
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,761
Don't think of it that way.
It's like...

316
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:21,872
urine goes all over
the place, you know ?

317
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:23,720
There's no controlling it.
It just...

318
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:24,941
Not my urine.

319
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:26,930
A cup could find its way
under the urine.

320
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,051
It might be an accident.

321
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,812
Were you forced to do
drugs at this concert ?

322
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:32,222
- Just...
- Is something wrong ?

323
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,341
Just... look, just...

324
00:15:36,347 --> 00:15:38,631
just fill up the cup.

325
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:46,351
Do you want to give
Michael your urine ?

326
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:51,151
I want him to have
all the urine he needs.

327
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:53,792
You're not gonna get
my permission on this.

328
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:55,910
I know that.
Don't you think I know that ?

329
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,621
Yeah, we do testing
all over the country.

330
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:02,983
Cool.

331
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,843
Hey, are you guys hiring ?

332
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,903
You wanna work
at the urinalysis lab ?

333
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:10,652
Yeah, maybe.

334
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,851
My father's name was
Dwight Schrute.

335
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:24,110
<i>My grandfather's name
was Dwight Schrute.</i>

336
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:27,570
<i>His father's name ?</i>

337
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:30,021
<i>Dwiged Schrued.</i>

338
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:32,400
<i>Amish.</i>

339
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,052
<i>I loved my father very much.</i>

340
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:44,663
<i>Every morning he'd wake up at dawn
and make us biscuits with gravy.</i>

341
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:48,290
When I was little, my dad and I
played a lot of games together.

342
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,081
<i>My dad cheated a lot,
but I never busted him on it.</i>

343
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:54,062
<i>I would have,
except I didn't know about it.</i>

344
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:57,213
<i>He didn't tell me 'til years later.
I was shocked when I found out.</i>

345
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:01,390
What ?

346
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:03,850
Did you wanna tell me something ?

347
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:06,020
You look like you wanna
tell me something.

348
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:09,000
You look like you have something
really important to say

349
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:10,863
and you just can't for some reason.

350
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:14,701
Come on, you can tell me.

351
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:17,680
Jim, you can tell me anything.

352
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:56,222
I'd like a magazine.

353
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:58,091
We just need urine, sir.

354
00:17:58,155 --> 00:17:59,271
I'd still like one.

355
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,133
Dwight.

356
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:05,322
Well, I passed the test,

357
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:08,001
thanks to you and
your untainted pee.

358
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:09,673
Thank you very much. 

359
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,600
- That's great.
- What's wrong ?

360
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:14,893
- Where's your costume ?
- It's a uniform.

361
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,951
And I turned it in today
when I tendered my resignation.

362
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:19,223
Why ? What...

363
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,840
I took an oath when I was sworn in.

364
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,410
And I broke that oath today.

365
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,412
Here.

366
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:46,931
Just  buy it from me.

367
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:51,111
I haven't talked to you in hours,
and it's been weird.

368
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:54,041
And I really wanna know what
the hell's going on with Dwight.

369
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,513
- Hi.
- Hey.

370
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:11,810
How much time do you have left
on your break ?

371
00:19:11,908 --> 00:19:13,022
10 minutes.

372
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:19,171
Since you did such a good job
with the investigation

373
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,183
I decided to pull a few strings,
call in a few favors.

374
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:25,101
And I've decided to make you

375
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:27,640
Official Security
Supervisor of the branch.

376
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:30,841
- Really ?
- Yes, sir.

377
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:32,732
That's fantastic.
'Cause I've always felt

378
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:34,061
that the security here sucked.

379
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:37,090
So, you wanna...

380
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:41,543
"Dwight K. Schrute,

381
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,623
I hereby declare you
an honorary volunteer corporal

382
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:47,433
in charge of assisting
all activity security."

383
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:51,243
- Good, okay.
- Here's your badge.

384
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:54,030
Thank you, Michael.

385
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,092
Very nice. Great.
Can I have a gun ?

386
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:00,272
No. I don't have a gun.

387
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:03,970
Okay.
I'll have to bring my bo staff.

388
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:05,953
I don't think so.

389
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:07,350
Don't.

390
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,653
- Good.
- Thank you, Michael.

391
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:15,930
I need to go over
some details with you.

392
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:17,330
- All right...
- First of all...

393
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:18,413
Thank you.

394
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:21,290
How many orange traffic cones
do you have ?

395
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:24,680
- Two.
- Oh... God.

396
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:28,611
What a terrible day
to not be able to talk.

397
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,841
Dwight was literally
carrying around his own urine

398
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,752
and dressed like
one of the Village People.

399
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:35,073
Why does he do the things
that he does for Michael ?

400
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,363
I just don't get it.

401
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:39,280
What is he getting out
of that relationship ?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
