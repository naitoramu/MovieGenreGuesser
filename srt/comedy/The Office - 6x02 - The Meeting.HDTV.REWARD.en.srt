1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:02,827
Yeah?
You wanted to see me?

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:06,394
Yes, Oscar, come on in.
Close the door if you would.

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,904
Thank you. Thanks so
much for talking to me.

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:09,999
Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,442
(SIGHS) I'm going in
for a procedure today.

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,446
Is everything okay?
Yeah.

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,709
It's routine. I'm just
a little bit scared.

8
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,479
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

9
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,043
What's the procedure,
if you don't mind my asking?

10
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,714
It is a colonoscopy.

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,316
Okay.

12
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,386
In your experience,
what should I be expecting

13
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:33,728
in terms of sensation
or emotions?

14
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:46,075
Is there anything I can do to
make it more pleasurable for me,

15
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,909
or for Dr. Chaudry?

16
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,008
(SIGHS) Oh, my God!

17
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,279
My main concern, should
I have a safe word?

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,614
Yeah.

19
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,661
(INAUDIBLE)

20
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:17,737
So, Michael, you think
you can give me a rundown

21
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,438
on the Buffalo
clients by Monday?

22
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,480
Absolutely. You know what?
I'll do you one better.

23
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,072
Sunday. Sunday night.

24
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,639
Okay. I will
get it Monday.

25
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,412
(CHUCKLES)
Hold on, big guy.

26
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,977
I'm going to put it in the mail
Sunday night, you'll get it Wednesday.

27
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,955
Okay. Jim, you want to
hit the conference room?

28
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,013
Sure.

29
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,116
Hey, good luck.

30
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,521
Oh, right, this thing.
I remember now.

31
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,687
(WHISPERING)
What's this about?

32
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,390
This is just me and
David, if that's okay.

33
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,989
It's okay with me. He's
going to want me in there.

34
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,466
No. It's okay,
Michael. We got it.

35
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,034
Really?
Yeah.

36
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,299
All right. Do you mind
if I sit this out?

37
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,206
I have so much work to do, I feel
like I'm going to blow my brains out.

38
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,038
Okay. You got it.

39
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,883
(DOOR SHUTS)

40
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,820
Am I worried that Jim and David
are having a meeting without me?

41
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,586
<i>No. Because we are
the three amigos.</i>

42
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
And once in a while,

43
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:12,031
<i>one of the amigos will
go off to the bathroom,</i>

44
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,931
while the other two
have a secret meeting.

45
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,965
Hey, let me escort you to your desk.

46
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,500
Okay. It's just three or
four steps, but thank you.

47
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,740
Thank you. You and Jim are close, huh?

48
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,012
Yeah. I think the pregnancy
really brought us together.

49
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,020
Hey, what do you think he
and David are talking about?

50
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,214
What do you...

51
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,620
Um, I don't know.

52
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,954
MICHAEL: Well, you said good
luck to Jim as he walked in.

53
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,655
Did I? Doesn't sound like
me. Not very superstitious.

54
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,427
(EXHALING)

55
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,536
If you're lying to me right now, Pam,

56
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,629
your baby is gonna
come out a liar.

57
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,968
That's how it works. They inherit
things through the breast milk.

58
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,910
Please don't talk
about my breast milk.

59
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,347
I just don't want
you to lie to me.

60
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,619
I don't want you to ever lie
to me. Have I ever lied to you?

61
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,676
Yeah.

62
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,347
I just don't
want you to.

63
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,186
DARRYL: I was rushing
to fill an order.

64
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,659
I put the ladder up to grab a box
of three hole from the top shelf,

65
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,322
next thing I know, I'm on the
ground, ladder's on top of me.

66
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,659
And that's how you
broke your ankle?

67
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,892
Yes.

68
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,935
Hmm. Interesting.

69
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:27,063
How did the ladder end up on
top of you if you fell off of it?

70
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,438
This doesn't concern you, man.
You need to walk away.

71
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,773
Oh, really? I'm sorry. I
thought this was a free country.

72
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,937
I didn't know we were
in Communist Sweden.

73
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,071
If we were
living in Sweden,

74
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,137
I wouldn't have
to worry about this

75
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,150
because we'd have
universal healthcare.

76
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,909
That's not... Okay.

77
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,283
Be quiet.
I'm talking about...

78
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,616
(SIGHS) Hmm...

79
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,156
I will send this
off to corporate.

80
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,021
Make sure you hold on
to your medical bills.

81
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,286
Feel better.

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,624
Thanks, T-man. Later.

83
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,226
So long, Darryl.
Feel better.

84
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,858
He's lying.

85
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,197
He has a doctor's note.

86
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:01,398
From who? Dr. J? You really
need to investigate this.

87
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,408
People don't just
fall off of ladders.

88
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,841
Guy on my street
fell off a ladder

89
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,503
painting his house.
It was on the news.

90
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,377
Since when have you known
Darryl to rush to do anything

91
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,883
other than to come up here
for birthday cake?

92
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,181
"Y'all having birthday cake?" (SCOFFS)

93
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,585
That's not a very good Darryl. Please!

94
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,523
And how many foremen do
you know that pull boxes?

95
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,587
It just doesn't add up.

96
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:28,291
<i>TOBY: Well, we did a little
investigation, and Dwight had a good point.</i>

97
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:32,134
<i>The ladder didn't reach the top
shelf. I don't know if I believe it,</i>

98
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,174
<i>but I am a fan of the
hardboiled detective novel.</i>

"I'll punch you
into mush, see?"

100
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,480
Uh-huh. Well, if he doesn't like it, you
can tell that s.o. B that he is fired.

101
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:46,848
Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right
now. I will. I love you, too. Bye.

102
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:47,908
Who was that?

103
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,750
Sorry about that.
What'd I miss?

104
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,256
Michael, we would like to continue
the rest of this meeting in private,

105
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,314
please,
if you don't mind.

106
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,690
I do not mind.

107
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,628
Yes, I do. No, I don't.
Yes, I do. No, I don't mind.

108
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,063
Catch you guys on the
flippity-flop. Oh, this...

109
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,896
Call waiting. Yeah?

110
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,061
Uh-huh. Well, you tell the
mayor he just lost six votes.

(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

112
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,139
They've been
in there a while.

113
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,004
Yeah.
Can't be good.

114
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,735
No.

115
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,176
Think they're
talking about me?

116
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,281
No, I think they're
talking about me.

117
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,648
Yeah. That makes way more
sense. Okay. Thanks, boss.

118
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,454
<i>MICHAEL: What is Jim telling
him? That I can't handle this job?</i>

119
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,649
<i>That's bull crap.
That is bull crap.</i>

120
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,491
<i>Although it has been
chaotic lately.</i>

121
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,620
Corporate shut down
the Buffalo branch,

122
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,962
which left us to absorb
all of their clients.

123
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,992
<i>I will tell you, there
has been work every day.</i>

124
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,164
Had to come in
on a Saturday

125
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,339
to retrieve... I left
my cell phone here.

126
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,470
Hey, Kelly.

127
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,879
(SIGHS) So jealous
of your boobs.

128
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,944
Thank you.

129
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,384
Um, listen, I just wanted to confirm

130
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,547
that you're not
coming to the wedding,

131
00:05:56,622 --> 00:06:00,058
which is totally understandable,
and more than fine.

132
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,286
Is Ryan going?

133
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,295
I don't know,
he hasn't RSVPed yet.

134
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,797
We invited everyone in
the office to our wedding,

135
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,423
even though we realized most people

136
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,765
wouldn't be able to make
the drive to Niagara Falls.

137
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,300
(WHISPERING) Which is why we're
having it in Niagara Falls.

138
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,909
Then Michael
told everyone

139
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,434
they could have Friday and
Monday off if they came.

140
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:24,381
So now, people have to decide if
they want to come to our wedding

141
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,441
or have to work.

142
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,612
Here's the deal.
I really want to go.

143
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,485
But I'm not gonna go
if Ryan doesn't go,

144
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,649
because it's kind of
a waste of time.

145
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,851
That came out wrong.

146
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,587
It would be awesome if you
could try to get him to go

147
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,926
because I'd really like
to be there to support Jim.

148
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,690
(KEYS CACKLING)

149
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,430
What can I do
for you, hoss?

150
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,200
How are your
sales doing?

151
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,173

You know, my numbers
are down a little bit.

154
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,841
And it's 'cause
of the economy.

You're not buying it.
You're good.

00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,844
Okay, the truth is

157
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,823
I have been having trouble
focusing lately. I'm in this weird,

158
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:10,727
flirty, nebulous thing
with this cousin of mine.

159
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,294
And it's a total mind f'er.

160
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,061
Again with the cousin.

161
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,795
Oh, I'm sorry, Phyllis.

162
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,700
You explain
this email. Okay?

163
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:23,174
"Hey, Andy, let's go visit Grandma
and then get drunk together. Ha, ha."

164
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,700
Shh. I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on in that room, okay?

165
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,610
<i>MICHAEL: Wallace
had to show up</i>

166
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,515
on the one four-month period
that I'm completely overwhelmed.

167
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,621
You know when they say, "It's
so crazy it just might work?"

168
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,887
Well, I don't believe that. I
say go for the airtight plan.

169
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,792
And that is why
I am having Andy

170
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,387
wheel me into
the conference room

171
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,399
inside a makeshift
cheese cart.

172
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,867
It is just elegant.

173
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,606
MICHAEL: Be my eyes.
You got it.

174
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,541
What have we here?
Oh!

175
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,635
STANLEY: Hello.

176
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:00,974
Just backing up
and turning around.

177
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,036
Hey, we're
gonna do this...

178
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,173
(EXCLAIMING)
It's not for you.

179
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,112
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

180
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,312
I took the liberty of preparing
for you a cheese platter,

181
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,486
which I will place here on the
eastern wall of the conference room.

182
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,619
Cheese platter?

183
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,856
(ANDY SPEAKING FRENCH)

184
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,229
From the Wisconsin region,
a nice, firm cheddar.

185
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,868
Also from the great state of
Wisconsin, an aged Parmesan.

186
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,135
Here you will find
a cheddar-style spread,

187
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,304
which has reacted nicely with
the air to form a light rind,

188
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,007
which I think you'll find both
challenging and delicious.

189
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,016
At that point, I would
recommend you take

190
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,110
a quick trip south of the border
to the great state of Illinois,

191
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,179
where you will find this
fine blue cheese dressing.

192
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,918
If I may be so bold,

193
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,790
it's a lot of fun
to let the goldfish

194
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,625
take a little swim
in the blue cheese.

195
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,096
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

196
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,998
All right, well, I should
go. Thanks for this.

197
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,798
You've given me
a lot to think about.

198
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,897
Please promise me you won't
do anything until we speak.

199
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,441
No, I won't.

200
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,044
(SIGHING) All right. Hey,
thanks for taking the time.

201
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,706
Yeah. Appreciate it.
Thank you, Jim.

202
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,178
Erin,
is Michael around?

203
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,348
I think
he's around here.

204
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,987
Is that...

205
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,220
Hey, hey, hey.

206
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,229
You must have walked right
past me. How you doing?

207
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,730
Yeah. Could we talk in
your office for a sec?

208
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,732
Yes, definitely.

209
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,994
Okay.

210
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:41,279
TOBY: It sounds
like a EMD P40.

211
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,781
Nah. That's a GE.

212
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,941
The P40 is much
higher-pitched.

213
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,451
You're into trains?

214
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,112
Have been my whole life. Wow!

215
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,748
I'm rebuilding a
turn-of-the-century steam engine

216
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,348
in my slaughterhouse.

217
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,360
That's so cool.
Yeah.

218
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,055
Wow! I'd love to take a look at that.

219
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,721
Yeah. It's just a
run-of-the-mill slaughterhouse,

220
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,787
but sure, anytime.

221
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,197
Well, you know,
because of the trains.

222
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,133
Wait, someone's coming.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

223
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,603
It's Darryl! Get down!
He's not using crutches!

224
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,264
Get the camera.
Start taping.

225
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,365
Drive!

226
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,307
Worker's comp, my ass!

227
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,004
I can't believe this.

228
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,239
Hey, you ass (BLEEP)!

229
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,337
Toby!

230
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,144
TOBY: You gonna eat all
that dog food yourself?

231
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,378
No, no!

232
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,885
Oh, man!
You okay?

233
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,980
Just drive.

234
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,623
Hey, Ryan.
Hey.

235
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,632
So, I just wanted to confirm that
you're not coming to my wedding.

236
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,759
Yeah, I might stop by.

237
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,861
It costs about
$75 per person.

238
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:42,465
Okay. I once had a glass of
Cognac that cost $77, so...

239
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,533
Can you just tell me now
if you're coming or not?

240
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,809
Yes. I'm coming
to your wedding.

241
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,815
Okay. Ryan Howard, yes.

242
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,441
Probably yes.

243
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,213
Kelly Kapoor, yes.

244
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,712
Are you sure you're okay with
these new responsibilities?

245
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,018
Look who you're talking to.

246
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,788
Just trying to figure out the best
way to utilize everyone's talents.

247
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,989
Well, I would say
that my greatest talent

248
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,431
is being the best
man, woman or child

249
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,128
to have ever run
this branch. Ever.

250
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,226
And what about Jim?

251
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,793
You think Jim is
someone who is ready

252
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,602
to move into
a management position?

253
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,342
Permission to speak
on the record.

254
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,712
Please do.

255
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,775
Jim is like Big Bird.

256
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:31,221
He is tall and yellow
and very nice.

257
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,690
But would I put him
in charge? No.

258
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:38,663
I don't think so. He... Big Bird
doesn't make the tough decisions.

259
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,593
If I was going to put someone in
charge, I would put Bert in charge.

260
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,569
Or I would put one of the
real grownups in charge,

261
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,662
like Maria.

262
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,070
Or Gordon, maybe.

263
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,300
I thought you liked Jim.

264
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,639
Very much.
Jim is my best friend.

265
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,475
But here's his
performance report.

266
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,914
Right here.

267
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,781
Now, this was
written by Toby,

268
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,220
who we all know is
extremely reliable.

269
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,553
"Constant office distraction. Spends
way too much time at reception.

270
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,892
"Antagonizes other salesmen.
Not at all what he thinks he is."

271
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,092
It's not very well written.
But you get the gist.

272
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,534
Is there anybody else you think could
run the day-to-day of the branch?

273
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,765
I could just continue
to run it myself, that's...

274
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,640
Jim had an interesting idea to
help you with this extra workload.

275
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,701
And it involved
you being promoted

276
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,179
to oversee all
northeast sales.

277
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,342
And then Jim would be
promoted to your position.

278
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,114
This was Jim's idea?

279
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,177
Mmm-hmm.

280
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,619
Wow!

281
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:48,133
Well, I'd have to talk to my
mother and my guy at H&R Block.

282
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,900
Okay. But, well, see,
here's the thing, though.

283
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,530
The plan doesn't work

284
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,269
unless we have someone to
replace you. I was hoping...

285
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,641
Plus, we have to worry about
Jim. He has another job offer.

286
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,944
We may have to replace him.

287
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:07,782
I didn't tell Michael because
I thought he'd try to help.

288
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,952
Example, he handed out Jell-O shots at
the 23rd mile of the Steamtown Marathon.

289
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,291
Jim, can you walk me down
to my car for a second?

290
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,524
Sure.

291
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,142
(INAUDIBLE)

292
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,544
I can't help but feel
partially responsible.

293
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:57,764
Little pick-me-up. Those
are the best. Sugar rush.

294
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,305
When you were in the office
earlier talking to Wallace,

295
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,499
did I come up at all?

296
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,676
Well, we did talk about
how handsome you are.

297
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,076
Why don't we head into
your office and talk?

298
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:11,776
MICHAEL: Okay. What did
we... God! We said...

299
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,486
I know there were
certain things we said.

300
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,650
Michael, look.
I'll just be honest with you.

301
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,590
Earlier today, I spoke with
Wallace about a promotion.

302
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,217
And I actually think
that talk went really well.

303
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,318
Mmm-hmm.

304
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,726
And then,
after he spoke with you,

305
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,357
for some reason, it felt
like things had changed.

306
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,799
Hmm. That's weird.
That's weird.

307
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,531
Kind of weirding me out.

308
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,335
Did you know that Lincoln's
secretary was named Kennedy?

309
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,739
Michael,
did you say anything?

310
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,772
(SIGHS) Tell you what,
when you leave this office,

311
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,973
I'm going to call Wallace
and I'm going to tell him

312
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,811
that you should
get that promotion.

313
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,976
Really?
Yes.

314
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,450
You will?
Yes.

315
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,009
Wanna do it right now?

316
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,077
Yes.

317
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,953
I tried to keep
Michael in the dark.

318
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,689
I should have known that he can
do just as much damage in the dark.

319
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,194
I need to see
your pupils.

320
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,700
I have to see if
they're dilating...

321
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,497
STANLEY: Toby! Dwight!

322
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,699
Is that them?

323
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:07,966
Definitely.

324
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,043
You come to my house,
bust up my trash cans,

325
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,012
call my baby sister an ass (BLEEP)
and told her to eat dog food?

326
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,775
We thought that
she was you.

327
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,044
Why would you think
a lady is me?

328
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:27,283
Are you serious? Because
you look exactly alike.

329
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,553
Am I the only one?
TOBY: That's too far...

330
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,492
Are you getting this?
I mean...

331
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,551
I don't see it.

332
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,427
Here's what
I'm gonna do.

333
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,957
I'm calling corporate and I'm filing
a complaint against both of you.

334
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,264
Oh, Darryl.

335
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,497
Come on, Gwyneth.

336
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:41,864
Sad.

337
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,899
<i>This is David.</i>

338
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,735
Hey, David,
this is Michael...

339
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,581
<i>Michael Scott here.
Yeah.</i>

340
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,913
Just wanted to talk to
you about Jim Halpert.

341
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:57,046
I understand that he did
not receive that promotion,

342
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,090
and I wanted to see
what I could do

343
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,558
to nudge you in the right direction.

344
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,755
<i>So, what, you're changing
your mind about Jim?</i>

345
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,460
Absolutely not!
Like I said before,

346
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,027
Jim is fantastic
and he deserves this job.

347
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,270
<i>Michael, it seems like
you're cutting in and out.</i>

348
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,334
<i>This is not what
you said earlier.</i>

349
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,038
What... Here's the thing.

350
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,648
Jim is the best
man for this job.

351
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,013
I think you should
give it to him.

352
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,348
<i>Well, it doesn't change what
you showed me in Jim's file.</i>

353
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,784
What?
Well...

354
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,288
That was an anomaly.

355
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,624
That file had been falsified.
Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.

356
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,631
<i>Michael, I really don't know
what's going on down there, but...</i>

(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

358
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,325

359
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,929
<i>I am getting pulled over for
talking on my cell. Damn it!</i>

360
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:55,180
Hey, Darryl, look,
we're here to apologize.

361
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,441
We're cool.
DWIGHT: Wait.

362
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,745
They're using the lift as
their own personal elevator.

363
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,409
STANLEY: What?
He broke his ankle

364
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,579
climbing over the railing,
then he lied about it

365
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,418
because it was a misuse
of company equipment.

366
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,981
Case closed.

367
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,492
Stupidest thing
I ever heard.

368
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,428
Really? Then why is there
new wood only on one railing?

369
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,328
Let's just check
the security tapes, Toby.

370
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,229
Well, you know, I don't think
there's any reason to check them,

371
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,502
but I suppose if we wanted
to be really certain.

372
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,839
All right. Yeah.
Fine, so whatever.

373
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:26,900
Yes!

374
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,207
TOBY: You really did it.

375
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,977
Now, I would like to file an
official complaint to corporate

376
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,452
because Darryl lied
on an official form.

377
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,081
And I'm telling them you guys
sexually harassed my sister.

378
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,388
(SCOFFS) No judge
is gonna believe that.

379
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,159
Okay.

380
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,165
Look, we could all file
complaints against each other

381
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,997
and just drown in a sea
of paperwork, but,

382
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,267
you know, we'll just
move on with our lives.

383
00:17:55,541 --> 00:18:00,444
So, Dwight and Darryl came to an
agreement that they would both file

384
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,036
complaints
with corporate,

385
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,742
and now I get to do
all this paperwork.

386
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,745
We worked it out.

387
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,785
Hey, hey, Jim. It would make
me feel really good right now

388
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,226
if you would just punch me in
the face, all right? Just do it.

389
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,786
How many times
have I asked you

390
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,331
to put me up for
a branch manager job?

391
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,368
I never recommended you because
I didn't want to lose you.

392
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,096
And I didn't
want to lose Pam.

393
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,728
Now I don't want
to lose the baby.

394
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,705
So, instead,
you screwed me?

395
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,833
That's what she said.
No.

396
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:32,999
David Wallace
is calling.

397
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,204
We're kind of in the
middle of something here.

398
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,268
Should I tell him
you'll call back?

399
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,544
Yeah. No.
I'll tell him myself.

400
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,507
Let's both.

401
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:45,712
Hello?

402
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,019
<i>DAVID: Hey, Michael.
Yes.</i>

403
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,252
<i>You got Jim
there with you?</i>

404
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,794
No, it's just us.

405
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,729
<i>Actually, can you call Jim in?
I want him on this. Please.</i>

406
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,392
Oh! Well, here
he is right now.

407
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:57,896
Come in.

408

410
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,443
Hi, David.

411
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,378
<i>Hey, guys.
So, I spoke to Alan.</i>

412
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,905
<i>We had kind of an unconventional
idea, which I think is pretty cool.</i>

413
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,544
<i>But it only works if
everyone's onboard.</i>

414
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,282
Well, just as long as it
means Jim becomes a manager.

415
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,655
<i>We were thinking of having two
branch managers in Scranton.</i>

416
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,160
<i>Both of you guys
working as co-managers.</i>

417
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,593
<i>Jim would handle
the day-to-day,</i>

418
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,030
<i>and Michael, you would focus on
clients and big picture stuff.</i>

419
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,328
Wow!
That sounds pretty cool.

420
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,629
I like that!

421
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,499
So, manager
and co-manager.

422
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,664
<i>Co-manager and co-manager.</i>

<i>See, there are a lot
of moving pieces</i>

424
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,674
<i>and this is the only way
I can sell it upstairs.</i>

425
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,507
Well, that might be a
little confusing for people

426
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,740
because they
know me as manager.

427
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,714
<i>All right, hey, Michael, can
you pick up for one second?</i>

428
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,183
<i>Okay, look, I'm not going
to force you into anything.</i>

429
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,416
<i>If you're willing
to lose Jim, fine.</i>

<i>You just say so. We'll
find another solution. Okay?</i>

00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,588
<i>Is that what
you want to do?</i>

432

Okay, people, listen up!

Everybody, David Wallace
and I have talked,

438
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,640
and we have decided to promote
Jim to the position of co-manager.

439

Co-manager of what?

butt. All of Scranton branch butts.

to you, Michael?

What's happening to me?

I am also being
promoted to co-manager.

Hells yeah!

Do you think that you could
send in your RSVP card?

451
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,854
No. I'll just
tell you now. Easier.

452
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,255
Well, you have to
choose a food option,

453
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,816
and there's information in there
about directions and lodging.

454
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,761
I'll just have whatever's
fanciest, unless there's ribs,

455
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,425
and I'll just get all the other
information the day of. I'll text you.

456
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,526
You are going to text me
the morning of my wedding

457
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,070
to ask for directions...
Mmm-hmm. Right.

458
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,436
...and you will eat
whatever is fanciest?

So rude, right?
Mmm-hmm.

462

Oh, my gosh. I have been
chasing people down all day.

463
