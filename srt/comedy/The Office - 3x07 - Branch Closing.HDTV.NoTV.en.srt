1
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:03,975
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:07,176
Who are you faxing
so early in the morning?

3
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:11,713
Kinda hard to explain.

4
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,316
<i>I don't have a ton of contact
with the Scranton branch,</i>

5
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:18,630
but before I left, I took a box
of Dwight's stationery.

6
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:22,200
So from time to time,
I send Dwight faxes.

7
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:24,382
From himself.

8
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:26,638
From the future.

9
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:30,535
<i>"Dwight, "At 8:00 A.M. today,
someone poisons the coffee. <i/i></i>

10
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:34,270
<i>"Do not drink the coffee.
"More instructions will follow.</i>

11
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:37,224
<i>"Cordially, Future Dwight"</i>

12
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:43,993
Nooo!

13
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,727
You'll thank me later.

14
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:10,871
Episode 7
"Branch Closing"

15
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:14,642
The catch 22 team
Raceman

16
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:18,381
http://www.theofficeus.fr/
http://www.1000fr.com/

17
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:21,390
There she is.

18
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,672
- Jan Levinson. First thing in the morning.
- Michael.

19
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:27,542
I love to start my day
with a hearty bowl of Jan.

20
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:30,391
- Michael.
-"Just call me Levinson"

21
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:34,601
- "In the morning Baby"
- Michael.

22
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:35,842
Yes.

23
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:42,261
I'm here to tell you that we are
closing the Scranton branch.

24
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:45,802
I don't understand.

25
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:48,873
The board voted last
night to close your branch.

26
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:53,190
- On whom's authority?
- The board's.

27
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,790
- W-what?
- I'm very sorry. I-I...

28
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:02,463
I don't relish telling you this.

29
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:07,053
You've been a big part of this company.
And the board asked me to thank you

30
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:10,611
- for your years of service.
- You're welcome.

31
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:13,022
A small number of people will be
transferred to the Stamford branch,

32
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:15,880
and the rest will be
getting severance packages.

33
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:20,720
Am I a small number person
or a severance package person?

34
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,543
Well, we haven't made final
decisions about personnel yet.

35
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:29,672
- But you're a severance package person.
- Oh, no.

36
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:33,512
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

37
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:38,061
<i>- I don't really get it.
Because we're not doing that bad,</i>

38
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,412
and our numbers are gonna come up.

39
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,943
Yeah, but it's not all
about numbers, Michael.

40
00:02:41,046 --> 00:02:42,253
- Well
- It's, it's about talent.

41
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:44,612
Oh, you gotta-- Josh?

42
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,890
- Yes, really.
- King of the stupid universe?

43
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:55,352
It is an outrage.

44
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,310
That's all.
It's...

45
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:01,322
They're making a huge, huge mistake.

46
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,233
Let's see Josh replace these people.

47
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:07,751
Let's see Josh find another Stanley.

48
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:11,223
You think Stanleys grow on trees?
Well, they don't.

49
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:13,532
<i>There is no Stanley tree.</i>

50
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:17,271
<i>Do you think the world is
crawling with Phyllises?</i>

51
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,351
Show me that farm.

52
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:23,122
With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up

53
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:25,680
all over the place,
ripe for the plucking.

54
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,541
Show me that farm.

55
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:35,833
Pictures.
Memories.

56
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:39,792
Look at that.
They grow up so fast.

57
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:44,742
- Hey, stranger.
- Don't say that.

58
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:46,263
That just sounds weird. Please.

59
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:48,751
Sorry, I just feel like we
haven't talked in a while.

60
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:51,433
Well, we have nothing
to talk about, Dwight.

61
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:53,513
Just do your work.

62
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:55,223
While you still can.

63
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:59,391
<i>When you become close with someone,
you develop a kind of sixth sense.</i>

64
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:01,693
<i>You can read their
moods like a book.<:I></i>

65
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:04,423
Right now, the title
of Michael's book is

66
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,400
Something Weird Is Going On.

67
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:11,562
Colon: What Did Jan Say?

68
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:15,922
The Michael Scott Story.

69
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,873
By Michael Scott.
With Dwight Schrute.

70
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:23,863
Hey, did you hear about
your friends in Pennsylvania?

71
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:27,602
Really

72
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:29,530
Wow, that's too bad.

73
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:33,740
Sorry. Scranton branch is closing?

74
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:36,870
In your face.

75
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:39,322
Well, I work here now.

76
00:04:39,507 --> 00:04:40,933
Sucka!

77
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,682
- Are you okay?
-Yeah. Great, amazing.

78
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:53,131
Best physical condition of my life.

79
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:56,310
- What did Jan want?
- Nothing. Just checking in.

80
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,822
I can't tell you, so.

81
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:04,193
- What can't you tell me?
- Nothing. Pam.

82
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:06,962
What difference does it make?
We'll all be gone in a few weeks anyway.

83
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:08,500
- What?
-What?

84
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:10,662
-  You just said that we're gonna be gone
- Do I have any messages?

85
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:13,162
- Michael, what's going on?
- Okay.

86
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:17,303
Listen up, everybody.
I have some news.

87
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,941
We are screwed.

88
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:24,392
Dunder-Mifflin Scranton
is being shut down.

89
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:27,540
Michael, We shouldn't
be talking about this

90
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:30,781
until all the decisions have been made.

91
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,942
You knew about this
all along, didn't you?

92
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,942
Jan told me just a few
minutes before she told you.

93
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:39,143
Traitor.
You are a traitor.

94
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:41,371
What about us, Michael?
Do we still have jobs?

95
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:44,122
I don't know.
Probably not.

96
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,471
This is the worst.

97
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:54,220
It makes perfect sense
that it would happen today

98
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:57,130
because I just received
this in the mail.

99
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:00,473
1,000 business cards with this
address and phone number.

100
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:03,873
I don't want to blame
anyone in particular.

101
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,973
I think everyone's to blame.

102
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,803
If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off,

103
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,060
I will kill myself.

104
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:14,901
Like Romeo and Juliet.
The Claire Danes one.

105
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:17,972
<i>Stamford Connecticut</i>

106
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:19,883
<i>Stamford Connecticut</i>

107
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:23,030
I worked in Scranton
for a really long time. And...

108
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:25,720
It's gonna be weird
that it's all disappearing.

109
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:29,512
I mean, I always knew that the branch
would shut down someday.

110
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,413
I just figured it would
be because Michael...

111
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,173
sold the building for some magic beans.

112
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:40,001
<i>I couldn't be happier.</i>

113
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,832
I'm gonna take the
severance and retire.

114
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:43,941
My wife and I are gonna travel.

115
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,490
I really couldn't be happier.

116
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:48,673
It's a blessing in disguise.

117
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,251
Actually, not even in disguise.

118
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:55,190
Sometimes at home, I answer the phone,
"Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam."

119
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:58,342
So...maybe that'll stop now.

120
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:00,801
What does that mean?

121
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:02,610
Well, some of us are fired,

122
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,643
and  a few are going to Connecticut.

123
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,170
I don't know if I really
wanna work here without Pam.

124
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:10,543
You know that Cinderella song?

125
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:13,990
You Don't Know What
You Got Till It's Gone?

126
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,112
That pretty much says
it better than how I know

127
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:19,293
how to say it in words.

128
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:26,882
Hey, Mike.
Darrel. Noble Darrel.

129
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:31,053
Look, I heard about the office.

130
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,882
- tuff break???
- I know. I know

131
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,393
Well, I'll land on my feet.

132
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:37,473
- Yeah. Don't worry about me.
- I wasn't.

133
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,573
So you'll be okay too.
You're warrior, you're smart.

134
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:43,350
Capable. You'll find
something else, and...

135
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:45,823
Actually, Bob Vance
bought out the warehouse.

136
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:49,223
- So he's keeping on the whole crew.
- So we're good.

137
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,121
Awesome.

138
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:54,031
This is my house.

139
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:56,860
The CFO's taking away
my house and giving it to Josh.

140
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,082
And Josh is giving the
garage to Bob Vance.

141
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:06,950
All right, listen up.

142
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:10,794
Some of you may have heard some
rumors about the branch closing.

143
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:14,763
But I am not going
to take this lying down.

144
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:17,087
I have a plan,
and I am going to save our jobs.

145
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,903
So  just hang in there. Let's go.

146
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:21,213
- Yes!
- Oh, good. You're bringing Dwight.

147
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:24,750
Yes. This might get ugly.
I'm gonna need backup.

148
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:27,752
-What's the plan?
- Go to New York.

149
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:31,402
Confront the CFO. Show him he's
making a mistake. Save the branch.

150
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:33,161
Can I drive? No way.

151
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:35,392
- Shotgun!
- No, there's no one else.

152
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:37,301
Still.

153
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,603
Thank you very much.
Okay.

154
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,790
Secretary says Wallace
is away for the day.

155
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:47,790
and won't be coming
back into the office.

156
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:48,981
Okay.

157
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,710
But... Do not worry.

158
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:55,110
I have his home address...
Right here.

159
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:58,363
- Why?
- Christmas card list.

160
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:01,032
You send him cards?
You've never met him.

161
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:03,563
Well, when I do,
we'll have something to talk about.

162
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:08,933
Hey, do you have a second?
Sure, what's up?

163
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:11,572
I know it's not definite,
or whatever, but

164
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,842
but, uh, do you know who's
coming over here from Scranton?

165
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:16,611
I honestly don't. I don't know.

166
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:19,503
So is it, like, sales or
accountants?

167
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:21,733
You know what, Jim?
I wouldn't worry about it.

168
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,621
What does that mean?

169
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:25,003
- Hi.
- Come in, hey.

170
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,853
Oh, good, you're both here.

171
00:09:27,038 --> 00:09:28,993
Ready to talk logistics?

172
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:32,560
I just feel like it could
have been something special

173
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:35,083
if we could have kept working together.
But...

174
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:39,281
I'm gonna go someplace else,
and you're gonna go someplace else.

175
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:42,090
It just doesn't make sense.

176
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,353
This kind of worked
out perfectly for me.

177
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:46,280
I got some good experience.

178
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,402
Michael's gonna write me
a great recommendation.

179
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:52,230
And as far as me and Kelly goes...

180
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:55,590
I think it's for the best.

181
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:56,773
Okay.

182
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:58,532
This is it.

183
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:01,691
This is exactly what Michael Moore does.

184
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,620
Famous documentarian.

185
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:06,160
He goes up to people with a camera,

186
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:08,651
and he's like,
"Why did you do this?

187
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:11,601
"Why did you pollute?
"You are bad. You're a bad person."

188
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:14,783
Very dramatic.
Although I can't say I was a big fan

189
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:17,720
of Bowling For Columbine.
Because I thought it was gonna be

190
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:20,290
a bowling movie.
Like Kingpin.

191
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:27,432
And it wasn't. It was something else.

192
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:31,030
So.

193
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:35,001
Josh will be running what is now called
Dunder-Mifflin Northeast,

194
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:37,003
which is all the
offices north of Stamford.

195
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:39,551
And Jim, if you want the job,
you'll be his number two.

196
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:42,302
Wow. sure. Absolutely.

197
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:44,450
Awesome. 'Scuse me, Jan. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to stop you there.

198
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:46,093
I...

199
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:48,770
will not be taking the job.

200
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:51,312
Excu--why not?

201
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:55,261
As of today, I have accepted a
senior management position at Staples.

202
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:57,930
Today.

203
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:02,161
You leveraged your new
position with us into another offer?

204
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:03,891
Damn it, Josh.

205
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:07,341
This whole restructuring thing
was based around keeping you.

206
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,422
I'm sorry, all right? It's done.

207
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:12,680
It's time.
I gotta make some calls.

208
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:14,883
Excuse me. I'm sorry, Jim.

209
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:19,470
Say what you will
about Michael Scott.

210
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:21,631
But he would never do that.

211
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,462
So.

212
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,441
Do you know what you're gonna say
when he shows up?

213
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:28,812
I will improvise.

214
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:31,062
- I will speak from the heart.
- No. Bad idea.

215
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:33,110
You need an attack plan.

216
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:35,103
Here, I'll be him. You be you.

217
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,153
- Let's practice.
- All right.

218
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:40,960
- Coming home from work.
- 'Scuse me.

219
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,642
- Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
- Yes.

220
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:44,033
What is the meaning of this?

221
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,600
Can  you tell us why you
are shutting down Scranton

222
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:49,972
and putting 15 people out of work?

223
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:52,671
Well, the branch is
no longer financially viable.

224
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:53,881
It's simple dollars and cents.

225
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:56,393
Yes, but these are employees, sir.

226
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,491
- These are human beings.
- Listen, Scott.

227
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:00,371
We're losing money, okay?

228
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:01,791
It's not a charity.
It's a business.

229
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:04,330
- And it's a dying business.
- Stop--stop it. Just...

230
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:06,571
- Okay, he's not gonna say any of that.
- It-- Wh--hey, why not?

231
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:09,212
Because he'd be
intimidated. And I just--

232
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,960
- Let's start again.
- Just be more scared of me, okay? Okay.

233
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:13,602
Don't touch me this time.

234
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,350
<i> Dum dee do dee do dee doe</i>

235
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:17,201
- Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
- Coming home from w-- Agh!

236
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:28,260
So we are still
scrambling here, but,

237
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:31,363
It looks like Scranton is
going to absorb Stamford.

238
00:12:32,137 --> 00:12:32,832
Wow.

239
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:35,772
And I know that you just left there
couple of months ago,

240
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,132
but we would like to offer
you the number two position

241
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,811
- at that branch.
- Thank you.

242
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:43,161
No, it's just, I'm not sure if I...

243
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:45,632
Well, to be quite honest with you, Jan,

244
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,302
I have a few unpleasant
memories of Scranton.

245
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,641
- Michael.
- No, no, no.

246
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:55,330
Just,some personal stuff.

247
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:57,730
And I'm not really
ready to revisit that,

248
00:12:57,836 --> 00:12:59,010
I don't think.

249
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:03,032
Well. Please think about it.

250
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,312
And call me.

251
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:06,560
We  will do whatever we
can to get you to stay.

252
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:07,601
Okay.

253
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:11,851
Hey, guys.

254
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:15,622
I'm trying to organize a little group
lunch for everybody, since, you know,

255
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:18,011
we're never gonna see each other again.

256
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:20,343
Where are we going?
I thought maybe DJ's?

257
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:23,700
How 'bout Cugino's?

258
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:25,210
I don't wanna go all
the way to Dunmore.

259
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:27,421
How 'bout Cooper's, then?

260
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:28,932
No seafood.

261
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:31,613
Well, I don't want to go to DJ's.

262
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:33,342
Oh, now, all of a sudden, you get picky?

263
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,193
Okay. Forget it.

264
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:38,653
Hooters.

265
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:39,960
No.

266
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:43,491
Ah! Here.

267
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:44,782
Replenish your fluids.

268
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:55,513
Where's Michael?

269
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,002
He's not here.

270
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,010
I don't know where he is.

271
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:00,683
What...

272
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,231
What's going on here?

273
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,623
We know the branch is closing.
Michael told us.

274
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:09,973
Oh, God.

275
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:12,131
Okay. You know what, everybody?

276
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:13,573
I'm sure there is
a better way to do this,

277
00:14:13,628 --> 00:14:16,180
but I've driven something like 400 miles
today, and I'm completely exhausted.

278
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:19,203
So I'm just gonna tell you.
Your branch is not closing.

279
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:22,742
Stamford is closing
for the time being, it seems

280
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:24,362
that all of your jobs are safe.

281
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,171
Yes.

282
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:28,522
Stanley.

283
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,960
Is it because of Michael?

284
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,831
Did he actually do something?

285
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:34,311
Well, reasons are not important.

286
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:36,140
Would you just call him,
please, wherever he is,

287
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:38,313
- And tell him?
- Sure. Jan.

288
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:40,573
Do you know--is anyone
coming back to Scranton?

289
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,673
Back?

290
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:42,820
Coming to Scranton.

291
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:43,871
Is anyone coming to Scranton?

292
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:47,062
- We don't know.
- Probably a few.

293
00:14:53,347 --> 00:14:55,570
- Who is it?
- The office.

294
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:57,932
Are you gonna get it? No.

295
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:01,272
Not until I have some
good news for them.

296
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:05,192
Not until I have some good news.

297
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:08,822
I guess new people might
be coming from Stamford.

298
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:11,441
Should be fun. New blood.

299
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,522
Is Jim coming back?
That's,

300
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,381
I hadn't thought about it.
I don't know.

301
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:19,691
I just don't want it to be weird.

302
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:21,931
You know?

303
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:24,130
I mean, I took his old job

304
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:27,463
- And his old desk.
- Yeah, yeah, that might be weird.

305
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,061
Overall, though,

306
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,670
we still all have our jobs,
so good news, right?

307
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:36,310
- Oh, yeah. Totally.
- I'm so happy!

308
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:38,812
We don't have to break up now, Ryan!

309
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,842
It is the best day of my whole life.

310
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:49,890
- What are you gonna do?
- I really don't know.

311
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,530
- How you doing with all this?
- You know, I'm fine.

312
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:55,721
I'll be better when
I know if I have a job.

313
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:59,091
You'd actually move to Scranton?

314
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:01,700
Yeah, if they let me.
I think I-- I think I would.

315
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:04,880
New York City is 45 minutes
down the road from here.

316
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:07,470
And you wanna move to Scranton.

317
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:10,602
If I were you, I'd move to New York.

318
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:14,263
Yeah, you know, I-- I might do that.

319
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,343
I'm who knows?
I might do that.

320
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:30,691
- Hey Andy!
- What's up Josh ?

321
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:32,911
Hey, man, just wanted to say thanks.
Good luck.

322
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,513
- Thanks, man. You, too.
- Totally.

323
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,952
- Anything?
- Nothing.

324
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,132
What if this doesn't work?

325
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:46,932
What if the office actually goes under?

326
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:51,653
Then it was an honor
to have worked with you.

327
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:03,442
All right.

328
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:07,803
Favorite moments
in Dunder-Mifflin history.

329
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:09,463
Go.

330
00:17:09,617 --> 00:17:12,630
My first day, when you hazed me

331
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:16,233
by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.

332
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:20,481
That was hilarious.
The foam.

333
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:26,502
My first sale.My promotion to
assistant regional manager.

334
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:29,350
Our basketball game.

335
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:35,972
And when you took me to the hospital...
and told me that you cared about me.

336
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:39,640
- Oh, right. Okay.
- That's enough. That's good.

337
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:44,733
What were your favorite moments?

338
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:50,831
All of 'em. I loved 'em all.
Every single one.

339
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:55,123
What about when Jan
said the branch was closing?

340
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:58,032
- God, Dwight.
- Well, I just...

341
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:02,122
Hey, Pam.
We're going to Poor Richard's.

342
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:04,652
- Creed's buying shots.
- No, thanks, guys.

343
00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:06,260
- All right.
- Have fun, though.

344
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:08,960
- Cool.
- Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.

345
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:10,722
Really? Where did you hear that?

346
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:12,110
- Ryan, are you coming ?
- Well, I was.

347
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:14,191
Yeah, we'll meet you there.
Awesome.

348
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:16,362
- Let's go.
- I'll tell you later.

349
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:19,090
- Okay.
- Hi.

350
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,141
- Crazy day, huh?
- Yeah.

351
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:26,261
- Yeah.
- Man.

352
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:28,680
I'm...

353
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:32,411
I'm really glad you're
still gonna be working here.

354
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:35,960
Yeah, me, too.
Maybe this is good.

355
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:38,612
Finding another job is a pain.

356
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,281
There's another annoying boss,
another desk.

357
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:44,983
<i>I'd have to learn
everything all over again.</i>

358
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,731
<i>So...</i>

359
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:50,262
there are reasons to stay.

360
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:54,550
Hey...
I think I am gonna take that job.

361
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:57,252
And Scranton?

362
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:00,252
It's not that bad.
So...

363
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:02,882
If they offer you a job there...

364
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,600
I think you should take it.

365
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:09,032
- Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
- Okay.

366
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,810
Yeah, I'm happy he said that.

367
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:14,911
I mean, I don't think he's
into me or anything. But...

368
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,912
I'm kind of into him.

369
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,603
So...there you go.

370
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:29,821
What are we still doing here?

371
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,832
It's over.

372
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:35,952
Let's go home.
Get the car.

373
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:44,313
This was such a stupid idea.
This was so stupid.

374
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,961
I'm such a stupid idiot.

375
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:50,310
I  let everybody down.

376
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:52,640
Everybody hates me.

377
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,422
I lost everybody's jobs.

378
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,323
- Nobody likes me anymore!
- Oh, my God!

379
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,963
- What?
- Stamford is closed!

380
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:04,842
Michael, we're not closed.
Stamford is closed!

381
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:07,741
- Stamford is closed! We did it.
- We did it?

382
00:20:07,897 --> 00:20:09,872
- We did it!
- We did it!

383
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:15,651
- We did it!
- Yeah!

384
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:18,773
Yeah! Right here, right here.

385
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:24,882
- Yeah, baby!
- In your face!

386
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,732
- We did it.
- Oh, man.

387
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:32,121
- How did we do it?
- I don't know. I have no idea.

388
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,153
I don't understand.
