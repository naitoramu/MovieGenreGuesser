00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,171
"Previously on" Friends:

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,465
I've been at this for 17 hours.

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,842
- How many centimeters am I dilated?
- Three.

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,512
Just three? I'm dilated three!

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,934
- We talk about having babies someday.
- We're gonna try?

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:20,479
- Right here?
- No, not here.

7
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,857
Maybe here.

8
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,735
Your grandma's engagement ring,
I want you to give it to Rachel.

9
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,113
- Mom, no.
- This isn't some girl...

10
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:33,534
...you picked up in a bar
and humped.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,121
I take it you're just visiting someone?

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,540
- Wanna visit someone else?
- I would like that.

13
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,709
- That's him.
- Great. Go get him!

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,670
Maybe you could go in first.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,674
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray.
I have a few routine questions.

16
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:52,428
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

17
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:58,016
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:12,031
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty
room right next to hers?

19
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:16,368
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

20
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:21,624
Well, let me think about that.
While I remove my pants!

21
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:27,046
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!

22
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,017
Does that sound like Janice?

23
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:43,104
If it's not, then there's two of them.

24
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:47,023
And that would mean
it's the end of the world!

25
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,818

28
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,190
Hey.

29
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,399
- Hey.
- Hi.

30
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,778
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How are you?

31
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:39,075
Not bad. You know that feeling, trying
to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?

32
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,289
Weirdest thing. Did I hear...?

33
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,959
Mother of God, it's true!

34
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,463
Chandler Bing!

35
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,631
Janice.

36
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:58,553
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.

37
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,307
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.

38
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,977
You remember, Chandler.

39
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,565
I didn't know you were pregnant.

40
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,527
Who's the unwitting human
whose essence you've stolen?

41
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,031
It's you.

42
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,492
This is yours.

43
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,328
What?

44
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:27,583
Look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!

45
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,672
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?

46
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:39,219
Okay, I have one.
If you had to, which would you eat?

47
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:43,807
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

48
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,563
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

49
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,526
'Cause at least I could explain to him
that you're making me eat him.

50
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,655
- Oh. Somebody went to college.
- Yeah.

51
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,033
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,244
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.

53
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,164
Oh. I'll get it.

54
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,253
I usually get to know a girl better
before I let her spoon me.

55
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,715
Relax. It's not like we're forking.

56
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:28,768
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies...

57
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,397
...and I have had no babies.

58
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,399
Why doesn't she want to come out?

59
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,569
I think you made such a nice
home for her...

60
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:42,032
...the last nine months,
that she just doesn't want to leave.

61
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:48,164
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.

62
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,501
- Oh, God.
- Okay. Okay.

63
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,253
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

64
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,798
Do something! Get me drugs...

65
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:02,011
...or you light a fire up in there
and just smoke it out!

66
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,932
I think you're ready to go
to the delivery room.

67
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,141
What?

68
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,729
Ten centimeters.
You're about to become a mom.

69
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,400
Oh, my God. Okay.

70
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,987
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.

71
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:32,041
Oh, my God! That's the doctor
who was in my room before.

72
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:37,421
Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.

73
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,217
I'm telling you, the guy
from that show was here...

74
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,429
...asking me all these weird questions.

75
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:49,766
Do you really believe that a character
from a TV show was here?

76
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,436
Rachel's having her baby!

77
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,940
That's him! You know him?

78
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,236
Okay. Okay. L... Okay.

79
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,449
I sent my friend, Joey,
in here to find out stuff about you.

80
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:09,537
If it, you know, if it helps,
you came off great.

81
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:13,415
A lot better than I'm coming off
right now.

82
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,753
I don't believe this. You had him
pretend he was a fake doctor?

83
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,548
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

84
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:28,514
- You tried making me think I was crazy?
- That was wrong. I'm so sorry.

85
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,976
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?

86
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,311
I don't think so.

87
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:39,525
If I may? You told me a lot
of personal stuff about you, right?

88
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:44,738
Now, maybe it would help if you knew
some personal stuff about her.

89
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,325
She was married to a gay ice dancer.

90
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:52,913
She gave birth to her
brother's triplets.

91
00:06:54,831 --> 00:07:00,128
Her twin sister used to do porn.

92
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:04,424
- We're trying to dial down the crazy.
- Right.

93
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:11,140
We don't know each other,
so it'd be easy to forget this...

94
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,477
...but there's something between us.
I don't know about you...

95
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,314
...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

96
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:24,236
- It doesn't happen to me, either.
- Me, neither!

97
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,910
Push. Push. We're gonna push
for five more seconds.

98
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,828
Five, four...

99
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,330
Three, two, one! Oh!

100
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,376
The next contraction will be
in 20 seconds.

101
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,463
- I can't push anymore!
- You're doing great.

102
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,841
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!

103
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,386
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

104
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,387
- Come on.
- Push. Wait.

105
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,224
- I see something.
- What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!

106
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,560
- Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!
- What is that?

107
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,272
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.

108
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,693
- I thought she had two heads.
- Oh, God!

109
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,070
Will she be okay?

110
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,738
- She'll be fine.
- Yeah.

111
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,116
She's in a difficult position,
so push hard.

112
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,619
- Okay.
- Go. Come on. Go! Go!

113
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,746
You'll have to push harder.

114
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:20,500
- I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!
- Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

115
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:25,046
I can't do it.
Please, you do it for me!

116
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:31,762
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

117
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,223
Good.

118
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,059
Keep pushing!

119
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,771
Are you okay?

120
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,525
You have no idea how much this hurts.

121
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,864
Keep going! Keep going!

122
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,407
Here we go!

123
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,577
She's upside down, but she's coming!

124
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,413
- Oh, God!
- Oh! Oh, my God!

125
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,542
Oh, my God, she's here.

126
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,630
Oh, she's perfect.

127
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,843
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.

128
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:20,143
- Where'd she go?
- They're just wrapping her up.

129
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:24,607
Okay. Well, be careful with her,
she's really tiny.

130
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,486
Here she is.

131
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,875
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

132
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,963
I know. Oh.

133
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:57,765
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.

134
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,476
- Do we have a name yet?
- No, not yet.

135
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:05,272
Fine. For now we'll just
call her Baby Girl Greene.

136
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,067
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.

137
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,046
Hello, Baby Girl.

138
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,012
- Can we come in?
- Oh, come on in.

139
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,933
- Oh, there she is.
- Oh, she's so beautiful.

140
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,642
Here.

141
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:47,940
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

142
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:53,069
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk
and had sex.

143
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,866
It's incredible. I mean,
one minute she's inside you...

144
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:01,203
...and then 47 hours later,
here she is.

145
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,586
She looks so real.

146
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,922
You know what I mean.

147
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,550
- Okay, my turn. My turn.
- Aunt Phoebe.

148
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,805
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!

149
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:24,018
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

150
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,687
I won't.

151
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:32,818
- Honey, what's the matter?
- Nothing. I just can't stop crying.

152
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,863
The doctor said it's normal,
plus you're sleep-deprived.

153
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,199
You guys are all sleep-deprived.

154
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,496
I don't see you weeping because you
put your slippers on the wrong feet.

155
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,582
Oh, God.

156
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,336
- What's the matter now?
- I was reliving it.

157
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,340
Do you know what you're gonna
call her yet?

158
00:11:55,549 --> 00:12:00,846
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?
I thought that was so original.

159
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,475
Actually, we've narrowed it
down to two.

160
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:10,648
And you know what? I love them both.
So just pick one, and that'll be it.

161
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:16,570
Wow, okay. Everyone?

162
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:20,783
This is Isabella.

163
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:24,870
- Hi, Isabella!
- Hi.

164
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,665
What?

165
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,669
That's not her name.

166
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,381
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel
like an Isabella.

167
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,966
- What was the other one?
- Delilah.

168
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:43,013
Oh, great! At least she
sounds like a biblical whore.

169
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:49,603
So, I guess we're back to Baby Girl.

170
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,481
What will we do?

171
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,442
- You'll find a name.
- Easy for you to say.

172
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,445
You know what your
kids' names will be.

173
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:02,991
- You do?
- I had them picked out since I was 14.

174
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:08,205
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after
some snack or baked good, isn't it?

175
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:16,547
- Well, tell us, what are they?
- Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

176
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,092
- And if it's a girl?
- I don't want to say.

177
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:24,388
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.

178
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,016
Okay. It's Emma.

179
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,269
Emma.

180
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,067
See, I don't want it.

181
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:44,491
- Take it.
- What?

182
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,743
She's clearly an Emma.

183
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:50,289
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

184
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:54,042
Yeah. But I love you more.

185
00:13:55,752 --> 00:14:00,382
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.

186
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:11,727
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like
to say hello to his future bride.

187
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,062
Oh.

188
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,739
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,
doesn't he?

189
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,659
He's a keeper.

190
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:31,788
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, I'm fine.

191
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:38,837
I really admire what you're doing.
Just raising her all alone.

192
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,590
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

193
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,262
Sure. Now. But what happens when he
meets somebody else and gets married?

194
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,766
Well, then he gets a divorce.
It's Ross.

195
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,855
I'm telling you. Listen to Janice.

196
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:03,237
They all say they're gonna be there,
until they start their real family.

197
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,866
- That's never gonna happen with Ross.
- That's what I thought.

198
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:12,246
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend
a weekend with her father...

199
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,831
...and little Miss New Boobs.

200
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,793
Really?

201
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,546
I hate to be the one to say it...

202
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:25,801
...but, honey, you two are on your own.

203
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,805
Well, that's, you know, that's...

204
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:34,309
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.

205
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,187
Maybe we won't be alone.

206
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:42,359
Because lately things have been
happening between me and Ross.

207
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:47,239
And right before I went into labor,
we had this kiss. You know?

208
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:53,370
So it might be the beginning
of something.

209
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,665
- Hey, Janice.
- Oh, hi.

210
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,294
Who's this little guy?

211
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:05,924
- Aaron, your future son-in-law.
- Oh, no, no.

212
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,679
- I'm gonna leave you three alone.
- Okay.

213
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,433
Man, you see the kid on that nose?

214
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:20,606
You know what I was thinking about?

215
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:28,906
That kiss before we left the apartment.
That was something, huh?

216
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,035
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

217
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,955
But we, we gotta be careful.

218
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:40,500
We... You know, we can't let
that happen again, you know?

219
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,088
Right.

220
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:50,803
- We don't want to go down that road.
- No. That's why I brought it up.

221
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,143
- They didn't have any sodas?
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

222
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:02,398
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.

223
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:07,027
And so it begins.

224
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,743
She in there?

225
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:18,455
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.

226
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:23,418
- Look at Emma.
- I can't decide who she looks like.

227
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,964
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.

228
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:37,182
I'm sorry. For the last time,
why aren't you two together again?

229
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:41,353
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.

230
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,690
Which would be fine,
except you totally are.

231
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:48,568
It's complicated, okay?

232
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:53,741
You love her, you always have,
you have a child together.

233
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,326
There's no right answer.

234
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:02,833
Look, we've been together.
Then apart. Then together, then apart.

235
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,003
And now we have a baby.

236
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:13,093
It's just, if we got together again
and it didn't work out?

237
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,888
I could never do that to Emma.

238
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:24,355
I mean, she came into this world
thinking everything... Now me.

239
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:28,317
What, do they put something
in the water here?

240
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:32,446
It's just, Rachel and I,
we're doing really well now.

241
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:36,450
I know. If you try to make it more,
you might wreck it.

242
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,537
- Yeah, exactly.
- Right.

243
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:45,376
Or you might get everything
you've wanted since you were 15.

244
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,052
Hey.

245
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,807
I saw a woman breastfeeding
twins at the same time.

246
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,726
It is like a freak show up here.

247
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,312
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

248
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,106
What is it? Hey?

249
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:11,610
- Really, it's nothing. I'm...
- Rach, come on. What?

250
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:17,491
I've just been thinking about how
my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

251
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,744
What are you talking about?
What about Ross?

252
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:27,126
Please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New Boobs.

253
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,504
Okay, how long
was I watching that woman?

254
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,715
I'm just saying that, you know...

255
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:37,052
...someday Ross is gonna
meet somebody...

256
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,097
...and he's gonna have his own life.

257
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,640
Right?

258
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,643
Yeah, I guess so.

259
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:51,984
I just never thought I'd be raising
this baby all by myself.

260
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,902
That's pretty dumb, huh?

261
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,238
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

262
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:01,576
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

263
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:06,498
Okay? I promise I
won't let that happen.

264
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:13,422
Joey. Oh, sweetie,
what would I do without you?

265
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,176
You don't have to worry about that,
okay?

266
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:23,890
Could you grab me my other box
of tissues?

267
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,644
- They're under Ross' coat.
- Sure.

268
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:39,115
Oh, my God!

269
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,659
Joey?

270
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:46,288
Oh, my God.

271
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,629
Okay.

272
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,375
- That was amazing.
- I know.

273
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:39,174
Hey, do you realize that we may have
just changed our lives forever?

274
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:43,637
We may have started our family.
In nine months we could be here...

275
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:46,057
...having our own baby.

276
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:49,769
And if not, we got to do it
on a bucket.

277
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:55,649
