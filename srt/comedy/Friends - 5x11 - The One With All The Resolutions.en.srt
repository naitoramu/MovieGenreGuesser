1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,046
<i>Any entertainment there?</i>

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:08,801
All right. Here we go!
1999, the year of Joey.

3
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,553
We're very happy for you.

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,928
What's the matter?

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,766
We wanted to kiss at midnight,
but nobody else will so...

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,229
All right, I'll take care of it.

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,814
Thirty-three... thirty-two...
thirty-one...

8
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,569
Who are you kissing at midnight?
Rachel or Phoebe?

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,486
You can't kiss your sister.

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,739
- Who will kiss my sister?
- Chandler.

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:31,990
Oh, man! Really?

12
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,160
Would you rather
have me or him kiss her?

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,619
That's a good point.

14
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:40,207
Since I have that whole history
with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.

15
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,127
Pheebs! Listen.
Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.

16
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,590
So obvious.
Why doesn't he just ask?

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,259
I'm going to kiss you at midnight.

18
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,845
You can't kiss Ross.
You got the history.

19
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,221
So?

20
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,016
- Would you prefer me or Chandler?
- Good point.

21
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,770
Three... two... one!

22
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,939
Happy New Year!

23
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,698
- Happy New Year.
- You too.

24
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,408
Happy New Year, Joey.

25
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:18,036
So, that do anything for you?

26
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,998
The One with
All the Resolutions

27
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,418
You know what?

28
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:12,382
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say, "No divorces in '99"!

29
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,719
But your divorce isn't final yet.

30
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,639
Just the one divorce in '99!

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,477
I'm going to be happy this year.
I'm going to make myself happy.

32
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,481
Do you want us to leave the room?

33
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,985
Every day, I am going to do one thing
I have never done before.

34
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,197
That is my New Year's resolution.

35
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,698
That's a good one!

36
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:40,327
Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.

37
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,622
Now you only have to find
a planeload of people...

38
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,125
...whose resolution is
to plummet to their deaths.

39
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,338
Maybe your resolution should be
not to make fun of your friends.

40
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,383
Especially the ones who might
fly you to Europe for free.

41
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,554
She has a better chance
of flying up your nose...

42
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,682
...than you do of
not making fun of us.

43
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,811
I'll bet $50 you can't go the year
without making fun of us.

44
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,479
Better yet, a week.

45
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,439
I'll take that bet, my friend.

46
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,692
Paying me the $50 can be...

47
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,988
...the "new thing you do" that day.

48
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,533
And it starts right now!

49
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,537
My New Year's resolution is
to learn how to play guitar.

50
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,163
Really? How come?

51
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,671
I would love it
if one of those was true.

52
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,965
Want me to teach you?
I'm great.

53
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,842
Really?
Who have you taught?

54
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,137
I taught me and I loved me.

55
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,806
That'd be great!
Yeah, thanks, Pheebs.

56
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,100
Look. Blaire forgot her glasses.

57
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,144
She'll need these to keep an eye
on that boyfriend.

58
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,773
Who, from what I hear,
needs to keep his stapler...

59
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:55,861
...in his desk drawer,
if you know what I mean!

60
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,197
Maybe your resolution
should be to gossip less.

61
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,868
What? I don't gossip.

62
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,288
Maybe sometimes I find out things.

63
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:10,042
Or I hear something
and I pass that information on.

64
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,045
You know, kind of
like a public service.

65
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,548
It doesn't mean I'm a gossip.
Is Ted Koppel a gossip?

66
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,303
If Ted Koppel talked about his
coworkers' botched boob jobs, I would.

67
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:25,724
They were like this!

68
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,689
I'll see you tomorrow.

69
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,526
I just asked that girl out.

70
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,445
Nice!

71
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,239
Is that part of
your "new thing" for today?

72
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,450
Yes, it is. See?

73
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,577
"Elizabeth...

74
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,997
...Hornswoggle?"

75
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,665
That's right.

76
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:55,421
Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

77
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,593
You okay, Chandler?

78
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,263
Something funny about that name?

79
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:09,226
No, I just think
I've heard it somewhere before.

80
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,897
Oh, really? Where?

81
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,151
Somewhere funny I'll bet.

82
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,486
Guess what?

83
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:24,908
I have a date
with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

84
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,330
Oh, this must be killing you!

85
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,582
All right, see you later.

86
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,919
All right, Pheebs,
I am ready for my first lesson.

87
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,922
No, you don't touch the guitar.

88
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:42,510
First you learn here, then here.

89
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,848
Lesson One: Chords.

90
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,603
Now, I don't know
the actual names of the chords.

91
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:58,734
But I made up names for the way
my hand looks while I'm doing them.

92
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,196
So then, this is "Bear Claw".

93
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,241
"Turkey Leg"...

94
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,328
...and "Old Lady".

95
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:15,542
What an interesting approach
to guitar instruction!

96
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:21,757
You know, some might find it amusing.
I myself find it regular.

97
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,551
Hey, everybody!

98
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,679
Rachel was so good today.
She didn't gossip at all.

99
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,474
I didn't.
Even when I found out...

100
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,727
Let's say I found out
something about someone...

101
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,395
...and let's just say...

102
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,858
...she's going to keep it.

103
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,278
Check this out.

104
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,327
You nailed the Old Lady!

105
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:59,128
I thought I was getting better,
so I stopped by this guitar store...

106
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:03,132
Did you touch
any of the guitars there?

107
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,010
Did you?

108
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,721
No.

109
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,182
Give me your hands.

110
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,393
Strings.

111
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,063
Pick.

112
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,317
Do you want to learn to play guitar?

113
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,404
Then don't touch one!

114
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:32,244
- Hi, Ben.
- Auntie Monica!

115
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,748
Ross is wearing leather pants!

116
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,421
Does nobody else see
Ross is wearing leather pants?

117
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:46,842
Someone comment on the pants!

118
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:51,847
- I think they're very nice.
- I really like them a lot.

119
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,891
Not what I had in mind.

120
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,728
People like Ross don't wear
these types of pants.

121
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,647
You see, they're very tight.

122
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,692
Maybe there's something in that area?

123
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,612
I think they look really good.

124
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,406
Where'd you get them?

125
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,783
I needed a "new thing" for today.

126
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:15,496
There's this leather store
that always smells so good.

127
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:19,083
And I thought to myself, "Wow!
I've never owned...

128
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:25,214
...a really good-smelling
pair of pants before."

129
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,801
Oh, come on!

130
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,764
What do you think?

131
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,140
You look like a freak.

132
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,851
Awful!

133
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,647
What are you doing?

134
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,859
- It's my New Year's resolution.
- To blind my child?

135
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,111
To take pictures of us together.

136
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,073
It's the best resolution.
Everyone can enjoy them.

137
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:55,244
Everyone will enjoy my music as well.

138
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:11,343
<i>My God, these pants!</i>
<i>I'm burning up.</i>

139
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:16,181
<i>Oh God! She wants to snuggle now?</i>
<i>Is she trying to kill me?</i>

140
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:20,101
<i>It's like a volcano in here!</i>

141
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,229
Are you hot?

142
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,567
It must just be me then.

143
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:43,626
That was just the pants
and the couch.

144
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,004
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?

145
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,924
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

146
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,676
My favorite part's coming up!

147
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,278
Oh, my God!

148
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,365
"Tiger."

149
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,033
"Dragon."

150
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,701
"Iceberg!"

151
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:03,247
Joseph, did you even study
at all last night?

152
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,832
Yes, I did!

153
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,418
Then do Iceberg.

154
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:08,669
G-sharp.

155
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,839
G-sharp?

156
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:16,218
Have you been studying
the real names of the chords?

157
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,345
Have you?

158
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,055
Oh, my God!

159
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,307
What? I didn't touch a guitar!

160
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,185
But you're questioning my method!

161
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:28,188
No, I'm not questioning it.
I'm saying it's stupid!

162
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,857
What?

163
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,652
Thank you.

164
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,947
You know, none of my other student...

165
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,199
...thought I was stupid.

166
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,453
Your other student was you!

167
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:47,666
Well, maybe you just need
to try a little harder!

168
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,127
Maybe I need to try a real teacher!

169
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,671
Here! Andy Cooper.
He teaches guitar.

170
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,132
There's a picture of him with a kid.

171
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:59,386
And the kid's got a guitar!

172
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,762
Fine!

173
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,724
You learn from
your "qualified instructor".

174
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,518
But don't come crying
when everyone is sick...

175
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:11,273
...of hearing you play
"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"!

176
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,529
Oh, fine. Take his side!

177
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,703
<i>I can't wait to be with you.</i>

178
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,038
<i>I'll sneak over as soon as I can.</i>

179
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,792
<i>I'll tell Rachel</i>
<i>I'll be doing laundry.</i>

180
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:34,630
<i>Laundry.</i>
<i>Is that my new nickname?</i>

181
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:41,845
<i>You know what your nickname is,</i>
<i>Mr. Big...</i>

182
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,567
Joey, it's Ross.
I need some help.

183
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,402
Chandler's not here.

184
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,698
You can help me.

185
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,410
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.

186
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,912
Nice!

187
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,624
No, I got really hot in my pants
so I took them off.

188
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,752
But they must have shrunk
from the sweat.

189
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,297
Or my legs expanded from the heat.

190
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:23,637
I can't get them back on, Joey.
I can't!

191
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,099
That is quite a situation.

192
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,686
Do you see any powder?

193
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,147
Powder! Yeah, I have powder.

194
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,773
<i>Good, good.</i>

195
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,317
Sprinkle some on.
It'll absorb moisture.

196
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,195
Then you can get your pants on.

197
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,656
Yeah, hold on.

198
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,639
They're not coming on, man.

199
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,393
You see any...
Oh, Vaseline?

200
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,481
I see lotion. I have lotion.
Will that work?

201
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,025
Sure, throw some of that on there.

202
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,694
<i>Hold on.</i>

203
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,292
Ross, you okay?

204
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,003
They're still not coming on, man.

205
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:42,507
And the lotion and the powder
have made a paste.

206
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,386
Really?

207
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,930
What color is it?

208
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,766
What difference does that make?

209
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:54,520
If the paste matches the pants,
you can make paste pants...

210
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,898
...and she won't know!

211
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,692
Do you have a minute?

212
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,318
Dude, what am I...

213
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:06,114
Rachel's here, so good luck.
Let me know how it goes.

214
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,618
Joey, I have such a problem.

215
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,745
Your timing couldn't be better.

216
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:16,249
I'm putting out fires
all over the place.

217
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,378
I have got to tell you something.

218
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:20,712
What is it?

219
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:24,300
It's so huge! But promise me
you cannot tell anyone.

220
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,428
No, no, no!
I don't want to know.

221
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,264
You do want to know.
This is unbelievable!

222
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,851
I'm tired of being the guy
who knows all the secrets...

223
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,561
...and can't tell anyone.

224
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,229
You know secrets?

225
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,064
You're not supposed to gossip!

226
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:43,527
I can't keep this in.
So I pick up the phone...

227
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,701
I'm not listening to you!

228
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,761
You've been in there for a long time.

229
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,598
I'm starting to get
kind of freaked out.

230
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:16,268
All right, I'm coming out.

231
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:20,731
Hey, can you turn the lights off?

232
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:26,570
Let's just leave the lights on.

233
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,831
Oh, my God!

234
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,543
I had a problem.

235
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:53,013
I can't talk to you. I don't have
a fancy ad in the yellow pages.

236
00:16:56,642 --> 00:17:02,231
I want to apologize for saying
your method was stupid.

237
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,985
And maybe, ask you
to be my teacher again?

238
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:11,490
I promise, I won't touch a guitar
until you say I'm ready.

239
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,626
You really think I'm ready?

240
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:26,255
Wow, cool!

241
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:49,319
Was the chord at least right...

242
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,870
Oh, my God!

243
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,999
We heard about your pants.
I'm so sorry.

244
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,627
This year was supposed to be great.

245
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,672
It's only the second day,
and I'm a loser...

246
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:12,843
...with stupid leather pants
that don't even fit!

247
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,762
You're not a loser.

248
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:19,350
Look at me!

249
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,815
Hey, look!

250
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,984
Ben drew a picture of you.

251
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:32,904
You're a cowboy!

252
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,662
Because of the leather pants?

253
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:44,166
He thinks you're a cowboy,
not a loser. That's something!

254
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:48,962
- It really is something.
- Howdy, partner!

255
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,049
Maybe I should get another pair.

256
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,343
You know, they had some...

257
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:59,264
...with fringe all down the sides.

258
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:03,978
I'm going to go kiss Ben good night.

259
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:09,525
I can't believe he thinks
I'm a cowboy!

260
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:13,570
I would make a good cowboy.

261
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:21,120
Now that everything's wrapped up,
I'll do my laundry.

262
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,666
Yeah, me too.
If this shirt is dirty.

263
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,715
I'm going to the airport.

264
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:35,384
If I hang around there
long enough...

265
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:39,972
...someone's bound to leave
a plane unattended.

266
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,183
- Good luck, honey.
- Bye.

267
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:50,982
Remember that thing
I was going to tell you about?

268
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,697
I won't tell you.
But if you found out on your own...

269
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,783
That would be okay,
and we could talk about it.

270
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:05,330
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.
So that would be okay.

271
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,419
Would you mind going
into Chandler's bedroom...

272
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:15,299
...and getting that book
he borrowed from me?

273
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:20,846
Now? You want me
to go over there now?

274
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:25,184
- Do you know something?
- Do you?

275
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:28,479
- I might know something.
- I might too.

276
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:31,065
- What do you know?
- You tell me first.

277
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,733
- I can't.
- Then I can't.

278
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,777
Okay, fine.

279
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,037
You don't know.

280
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,123
I'll walk into his bedroom
and see the thing...

281
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:52,502
...I think I know is actually
the thing I think I know!

282
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,338
- You know!
- And you know!

283
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:55,589
Yeah, I know!

284
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,717
Chandler and Monica?
Oh, this is unbelievable!

285
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,219
- How long have you known?
- Too long!

286
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,515
I've been dying to talk
to someone about this!

287
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:10,271
You can't say anything to anybody.
They're so weird about that.

288
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:13,524
It's raining.

289
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:17,653
I don't like to fly in the rain.

290
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,616
I am going to go for a walk
in the rain.

291
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,243
Me too.

292
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,124
That's weird.

293
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,711
I bet they're doing it.

294
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:42,136
Okay, look.
I can't take it anymore.

295
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:45,556
So you win. Okay?
Here.

296
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,516
Fly a jet?
Make it a spaceship...

297
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:51,603
...so you can get back
to your home planet!

298
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:56,400
Phone call for you. Tom Jones.
He wants his pants back!

299
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:02,281
And Hornswoggle? Are you dating
a character from "Fraggle Rock"?
