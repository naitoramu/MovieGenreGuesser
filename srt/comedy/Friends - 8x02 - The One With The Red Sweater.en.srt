1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:05,047
Listen, I don't care
what the computer says.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:08,592
We didn't take a bag
of Meshugga Nuts.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:13,805
And we did not watch
<i>Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.</i>

4
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:19,853
- Were you in our room last night?
- No.

5
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:30,864
I was told the movie's name
wouldn't appear on the bill.

6
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:36,745
- Checking out of the bridal suite.
- Right, I'm no longer a bride.

7
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:41,959
I'll never be a bride again.
Now I'm just someone's wife.

8
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,505
And I'm the happiest guy
in the world.

9
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:51,676
- We have so much to look forward to.
- Yeah, right.

10
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,888
- The honeymoon.
- That's not till Thursday.

11
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,558
- Wedding pictures.
- It takes weeks.

12
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:03,563
- Not the disposable cameras.
- I knew I married you for a reason!

13
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:07,818
I'll go get them developed,
and you can go home.

14
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:16,368
- What did you take a picture of?
- Nothing. It was something.

15
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,122
Ross has the cameras.
Is he checked out yet?

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,458
Are you joking?
Checkout is not till noon.

17
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,963
- And he has a good 11 minutes left.
- So?

18
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:31,509
He never checks out a minute
before he has to.

19
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:38,098
Once we got a late checkout, he got
so excited, it was our best sex ever.

20
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:42,018
Until he screamed out "Radisson"
at the end.

21
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,066
Okay, I'll get Ross, get the cameras
and get them developed.

22
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,279
Thirty-two, Joe. You're 32!

23
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,075
- Here's your bill.
- Thanks.

24
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:01,038
Champagne, strawberries...

25
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:07,461
Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandler
ordered porn on our wedding night.

26
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,674
Yeah, that's sad.
Meshugga Nut?

27
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,594
The One With the Red Sweater

30
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,930
Soaps, shampoos.
Are you really taking all this?

31
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:05,644
- Why not? It's included in the price.
- Yeah, but you don't need...

32
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,564
- What is this?
- Thread.

33
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,277
Score!
Where are the disposable cameras?

34
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:18,490
- What cameras?
- Last night I asked you to take them.

35
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,828
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, before we cut the cake, I said...

36
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:28,792
Yeah, you asked me for a favor. Then
my Uncle Murray gave you a check.

37
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,797
Then you said, "Why is it called
a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"

38
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:41,180
- Yeah, then you did that.
- So you don't have the cameras?

39
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,683
- No, sorry.
- They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!

40
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:48,229
They're here somewhere.
I'll help you look.

41
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,732
- Great.
- In three minutes.

42
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,795
You're gonna open the presents
without Chandler?

43
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:21,428
They're calling out to me.
This guy even crawled into my lap.

44
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:26,183
He wouldn't mind if I opened one.
What do you think it is?

45
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:33,231
A mirror that when you look into it,
you see yourself as an old woman.

46
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,153
A tiny salt shaker!

47
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:41,198
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!

48
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,743
Oh, wow! Okay, that was fun.

49
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:49,498
Okay, I'll wait for Chandler
to open up the rest.

50
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:56,380
Although, you know, this is
part of a salt-and-pepper set.

51
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,800
It's only half a present.
What do you think?

52
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:04,387
It's okay to open one more if
it's a set. It's probably this one.

53
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,598
Or this one!

54
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:14,148
- Got any morning sickness?
- The guys don't know, do they?

55
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,234
No. Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

56
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,155
Right. Chandler still thinks
I'm pregnant.

57
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:25,325
He hasn't asked me how I feel,
or offered to carry my bags.

58
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:29,329
I feel bad for the woman
who ends up with him.

59
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,083
After you, of course.

60
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:38,839
You'll only be pregnant a few more
hours. I'll tell the father today.

61
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,050
Is it that tall guy
from the first floor?

62
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:45,971
- No!
- What? I think he's cute.

63
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,475
- Then you have his baby.
- I'm trying.

64
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:56,899
It's so weird. You're gonna tell
this guy today, and he has no idea.

65
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:01,903
You'll just knock on his door
and change his life forever.

66
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,907
You're like Ed McMahon,
except without the big check.

67
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,744
Or the raw sexual magnetism.

68
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:15,250
- Yeah, I guess it's pretty big news.
- Pretty big? It's huge!

69
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,796
God, this guy is walking
around thinking:

70
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,383
"I had sex with Rachel Green.
I rock!"

71
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,803
Then, bam! He's a father,
everything's different.

72
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:30,140
Only if he wants it to be.
I won't ask for anything.

73
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,394
Okay, now he's walking
around thinking:

74
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,564
"Do I want to be a dad?"
Then, bam!

75
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:41,402
- What was that "bam"?
- I don't know. He's hit by a bus.

76
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:50,243
Joey, what would you do if someone you
slept with told you she was pregnant?

77
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,794
Who called here?

78
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:04,216
Did she sound blond? Any accent?
I gotta make a call.

79
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,261
Should have never walked
into that Sunglass Hut!

80
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,723
It's not you!
You didn't get anyone pregnant.

81
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:16,728
Why would you scare me like that?
What the hell's going on?

82
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,317
Is somebody pregnant?

83
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,777
Oh, yeah! That's me.

84
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:29,158
Oh, my God, Pheebs!
You're gonna have a baby?

85
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:34,788
Yes, I am.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!

86
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,834
- Wait, who's the father?
- You don't know him.

87
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:43,005
He wants nothing to do
with me or the baby.

88
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:51,263
Who is this guy? Because I'll track
him down and kick his ass!

89
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,892
- David Linn.
- David Linn!

90
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:02,399
- Who's David Linn?
- Some annoying guy from my gym.

91
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:11,033
- Chandler?
- Did you find the cameras?

92
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:16,079
- No. Did you?
- Yes, that's why I'm under the table.

93
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,335
I checked in the lost and found.
No one's turned them in.

94
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:26,423
Great. Those cameras were the only
thing that will cheer Monica up.

95
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,385
You just got married.
Why is she depressed?

96
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:35,641
I'm not going to ask that question.
I can't believe I screwed this up!

97
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,310
I'm sorry, man.

98
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:44,358
Here's a thought.
This is the same ballroom.

99
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:48,070
There's a band.
There'll be dressed-up people.

100
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,406
Are you suggesting
we dance our troubles away?

101
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:57,663
No, we buy more of these, throw our
tuxes on and take a few pictures.

102
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,540
We make sure not
to get people's faces.

103
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,417
Are you serious?

104
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:08,549
I'm thinking about your new bride.
Do you really want to let her down?

105
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:12,219
Marriage advice? Really?

106
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,473
This looks just like your wedding.

107
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,102
- Same flowers?
- I don't know. Monica picked them.

108
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,604
- The chairs?
- Those too.

109
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,565
- The place settings?
- Her.

110
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,818
- What did you do?
- I took care of the cameras.

111
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,986
Gift shop?

112
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,912
- Did you do it yet?
- Not yet.

113
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,833
Then what are you doing here?
Are you about to do it?

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,419
Is it Gunther?

115
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:51,175
- It's not Gunther!
- Thank God. That hair on a baby?

116
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:58,390
The father is not here. I haven't
told him, and I don't think I can now.

117
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,683
Why not?

118
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:05,815
I was walking and thinking, "I'm gonna
tell the father. " And then, bam!

119
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,567
Bus?

120
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:14,656
No, you! You freaked me out.
You kept saying how huge this is.

121
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:16,909
- But it is huge.
- I know.

122
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,995
But I was thinking
how huge it is for me.

123
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,831
I didn't think about the father.

124
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,795
You're thinking about it too much.
Tell him and get it over with.

125
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,048
It's like ripping off this Band-Aid,
quick and painless.

126
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,927
Oh, mother of...!

127
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,388
See?

128
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,774
- Are we opening presents?
- No. I shouldn't be opening these.

129
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:53,987
Joey, I am out of control!
You have to do me a favor.

130
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:59,660
No matter what I say,
do not let me open another present.

131
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,207
Give me one more.

132
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:12,214
Good, you're here. Pheebs?
Listen...

133
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:15,926
Sit down,
I got something I want to say.

134
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:28,439
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

135
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:34,695
I always felt that you
and I have a special bond.

136
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:39,908
So, Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

137
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,539
Oh, my God!

138
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,543
Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.

139
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:55,633
- You can't marry him!
- Your day's over, it's my turn.

140
00:11:56,884 --> 00:12:01,389
- Why can't she marry me?
- I can and I will.

141
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,435
She's not pregnant.
Rachel's the one who's pregnant.

142
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,104
Oh, my God!

143
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,023
He'd notice
when you didn't have a baby!

144
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,735
It's Joey!

145
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,661
I can't believe it! Rachel's pregnant?
Who's the father?

146
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,996
We don't know.

147
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:31,252
- I wonder if it's that dude.
- There's a dude?

148
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,836
Who is it?

149
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:39,551
A month ago this guy spent the night.
I didn't see who it was, but...

150
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,433
Was that story over?

151
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,565
The guy left this.

152
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:57,486
Oh, my God!
I know who the father is.

153
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,784
People have got
to finish their stories.

154
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:14,086
- Could you take a picture of us?
- Of course.

155
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:23,554
- Would you take one of us?
- Yeah, sure.

156
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,597
Click.

157
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,226
- It didn't click.
- I heard it.

158
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,896
- There was no flash.
- You won't take our picture?

159
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,066
Yeah, I'll take your picture.

160
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:43,365
- Your finger was covering the lens.
- Who are you, Ansel Adams? Scram!

161
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:51,540
I feel really bad about how
I freaked you out before...

162
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,292
...so I asked the father
to come here.

163
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:58,505
What? Wait a minute.
How do you know who it is?

164
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:02,092
I may play the fool at times...

165
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:07,765
...but I'm more than a pretty blond
with an ass that won't quit.

166
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,894
I believe this belongs to the father.

167
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:17,149
Oh, God. He's in there right now?

168
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,113
You can turn around,
or go in and rip the Band-Aid off.

169
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,909
- Let's rip.
- Are you sure?

170
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,494
- Phoebe!
- Sorry.

171
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,958
Hey, Rach.

172
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:45,302
Go on-stage. I'll get a picture
of you doing the speech.

173
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:07,073
Will the owner of a 1995 LeSabre
see the front desk?

174
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:10,411
Your car is about to be towed.

175
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,915
That's my car!

176
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,585
- A '95 LeSabre?
- Yes.

177
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,547
- A green LeSabre?
- Yes!

178
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:28,136
- I'm sorry, I meant blue.
- Yes, green-blue.

179
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,893
Well, go. Go move it!

180
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:39,439
Ready for the last picture?
Get ready to run.

181
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:48,490
Congratulations on your wedding.

182
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,122
What's this about?

183
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,959
Rachel has something to tell you.

184
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:03,255
And I believe that
this is your red sweater.

185
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:07,551
No, this is my red sweater.

186
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,847
Oh, no.

187
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:17,895
Could I get anyone a coffee?

188
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,649
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.

189
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,526
What's going on?

190
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:28,989
Nothing.
Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

191
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:33,827
But you wear that sweater a lot.
Is it some kind of dare?

192
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,957
I'm actually glad Phoebe called.

193
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,802
I was immature, but I've grown up.
I think we should get back together.

194
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,137
It's not the right time.

195
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:57,142
It is the right time.
I'm ready for more.

196
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,645
Let's give it another try.

197
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,357
I'm having a baby.

198
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,201
- You can go.
- Thank you.

199
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,125
I don't know how
any of these got opened!

200
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,881
- You opened them all?
- I know, I am a terrible person.

201
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,008
Chandler won't trust me ever again.

202
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,555
- You got my parents' gift.
- What is that?

203
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,808
I think it does something
to salami.

204
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,563
- How'd it go?
- What did Tag say?

205
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,984
Tag is not the father.
And Joey knows now?

206
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:51,530
I do, and I'm so happy for you.

207
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:57,452
Wow, you didn't even try
to unhook my bra.

208
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:05,419
- Will you ever tell whoever it is?
- I will, just not tonight.

209
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:09,465
No matter what he says,
you're not gonna be alone.

210
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,050
I'm not?

211
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,052
No. Listen...

212
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:21,268
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

213
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:26,774
I've always felt like
you and I have a special bond.

214
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,443
- Rachel, will you marry me?
- What?

215
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,824
- Pheebs, give me the ring back.
- No!

216
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:42,122
Joey, you're so sweet, honey,
but I'm not looking for a husband.

217
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,253
I understand.

218
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:53,050
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go and lie down.

219
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,808
I can't say that didn't hurt.

220
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:07,272
- But I'll take you back, Joey.
- About that, l...

221
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,985
- Oh, a Salami Buddy!
- There you go!

222
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,696
- We're back!
- Great.

223
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:18,075
We're hanging in the kitchen.
Let's stay in the kitchen.

224
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,871
- It's picture time.
- You're gonna love these.

225
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:27,084
Here's a picture of Ross.
And that's me.

226
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:31,004
And that's me and Ross.

227
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:35,842
And here's our first kiss
as a married couple.

228
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,887
That is a great picture.

229
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:44,560
And interesting, because I found
the cameras in one of our bags.

230
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,606
Didn't see that coming.

231
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:52,902
Okay, this isn't our first kiss...

232
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,156
...but it is my first kiss
with this lady.

233
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:04,163
Which I'm sure you'll remember,
so there's no need...

234
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:10,211
- I'll take these to get developed now.
- Good idea.

235
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,926
You opened the presents?
We were gonna do that together.

236
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:21,722
You kissed another woman?

237
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,016
- Call it even?
- Okay.

238
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:34,652
- I'll put these in water.
- You stole those from that wedding?

239
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,778
No, the hotel lobby.

240
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:43,368
They think they can charge me for
some dirty movie and a bag of nuts!

241
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,582
Hey, my sweater!

242
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:54,839
I've been looking for this
for a month.

243
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,179
Oh, my God!

244
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,728
Oh, my God!

245
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:21,364
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good. Long time no see.

246
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:25,161
- Like your sweater.
- Right back at you.

247
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:32,751
- It's crazy about Rachel.
- Well, she's one crazy lady.

248
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,840
- So whose is it?
- I don't know, some Italian guy.

249
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:43,637
Come on, read your own label.
See you later.

250
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,264
He is so weird.

251
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:51,437
