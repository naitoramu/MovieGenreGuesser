1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,798
- Hey.
- Hey. So, what do you think?

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,386
New haircut? Necklace? Dress?

3
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,973
Boots? Boots!

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,103
They're a little more than I usually
spend on boots or rent.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,981
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

6
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:28,696
- I'll miss being able to buy food.
- They just looked so good.

7
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,614
The saleswoman was like:

8
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,617
- "These are too pricey for you."
- She had a point.

9
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,372
- Hey.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,127
- Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing.
- They're mine!

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:50,676
- Too bad we'll have to return them.
- Return them? They're gonna hear you.

12
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:54,847
I'm not returning them.
I'll wear them all the time.

13
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,057
I love the compliments.

14
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:02,187
Have you ever had something
so beautiful, everyone wants it?

15
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:07,192
- I have you.
- Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.

16
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,486
The One With Monica's Boots

19
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,068
That's right. I love you.

20
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:53,447
And I'm gonna play with you
all the time.

21
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,617
How can you let him talk
to your crotch like that?

22
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,874
- He's talking to the baby.
- Oh! Okay.

23
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:09,088
When he said, "I can't wait
for your first words"...

24
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,590
...I thought, "There's a trick."

25
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,595
I gotta go, you guys.
I'll see you later.

26
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,889
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

27
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:25,521
Can you do me a favor? My sister
knows you work at Ralph Lauren...

28
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:29,149
I am not sending
more clothes to prison.

29
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,527
- It is a waste.
- Not her.

30
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:35,322
My youngest sister Dina
is interested in fashion.

31
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,826
She wants to talk
to someone successful.

32
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,913
- I'll talk to my supervisor.
- She wants to talk to you.

33
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:48,126
Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.

34
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,797
- Would you meet with her?
- Have her come by.

35
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:56,969
You'll love her. She's the smartest
of all the Tribbiani children.

36
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:01,014
Yeah, you know the SATs?
She took them.

37
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:06,311
- Doesn't Ben go to Smithfield School?
- Yeah. Why?

38
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,815
- Sting's son goes there.
- He's in Ben's class.

39
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:16,363
You knew and said nothing? With all
the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?

40
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:22,286
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.
Can I talk about fossils?

41
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,252
"Sting's son, 7." There's a picture.

42
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:35,424
What are you reading, "The Kidnapper's
Guide to Manhattan Schools"?

43
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:39,011
It's an article about
the city's best schools.

44
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:43,307
- So how well do you know Sting?
- I haven't met him.

45
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:48,812
That's too bad. I wanna go to his
concert Friday, but it's sold out.

46
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,650
I know! Why don't you
meet him and get tickets.

47
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,402
If you get two, I'll take you.

48
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,114
Maybe he'll be there tomorrow.

49
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:03,034
There you go. You're so lucky.
You might meet Sting tomorrow.

50
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,788
That's why you have kids.

51
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,962
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

52
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:17,633
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.

53
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,971
See? I'm getting a lot of use
out of them already.

54
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,058
You can wear them
with dresses, skirts...

55
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:30,938
Wear them with shorts on the corner
and earn money to pay for them.

56
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:36,068
- Wow, they're beautiful.
- They hurt so much.

57
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,486
- What?
- The guy who made these...

58
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,823
...hates feet
and wants to see them die.

59
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:46,203
Give them to me.
I haven't felt my feet in years.

60
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,999
I can't. I told Chandler
I'd wear them all the time.

61
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,503
- Then return them.
- I can't do that either.

62
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:59,841
The soles are scuffed up, and the
insides are filled with my blood.

63
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:05,931
Hey, I just picked up Ben
from school.

64
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,643
I don't think you did
a very thorough job.

65
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,063
I dropped him off at Carol's.

66
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:15,107
Anyway, I'm not gonna
get those tickets.

67
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,608
Oh, no. Why not?

68
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:20,654
It turns out Ben and Sting's son
do not get along.

69
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,866
- How come?
- Sting's son made fun...

70
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,411
...of Ben's moms being "lesbenims."

71
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:33,125
If they don't get along, smooth
things over. Make them be friends.

72
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,879
- You can't force kids to be friends.
- Sure you can.

73
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,507
Give them some blocks.
Put them in a playpen.

74
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:44,720
- Playpen? Ben's 7.
- Your kid is 7?

75
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,181
He's really small.

76
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,603
- Please get the tickets.
- I just can't do it.

77
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,606
- Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
- What?

78
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,152
<i>Ross can</i>

79
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,405
Look, I'm sorry...

80
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,825
<i>Ross can</i>

81
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,331
- Phoebe?
<i>- Ross can get me the tickets</i>

82
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:16,627
<i>Ross can get me the tickets</i>

83
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,176
Here she is: Future fashion superstar.

84
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:28,347
- Oh, Joey, I'm hardly...
- My little sister Dina.

85
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,641
Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.

86
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:35,937
- Thanks so much for meeting with me.
- This is so exciting for her.

87
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:41,652
Well, I'll let you two "fashists"
get down to business.

88
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,738
Okay. All right, Dina.

89
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:48,784
Let's talk about the different
areas of fashion...

90
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,119
...you could get involved in.

91
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,666
There's design. But you may
need another degree for that.

92
00:06:55,874 --> 00:07:01,004
- Sales is great. You get to travel.
- I don't care about fashion.

93
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,591
I'm pregnant. You are too.
You gotta help me.

94
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,554
Then there's marketing.

95
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:35,456
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I just was yawning.

96
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,460
Don't forget
my office party's tonight.

97
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,962
We don't have to go, do we?

98
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:48,219
I know that you don't like my parties,
but you can wear your new boots.

99
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:52,097
See? Every cloud has
a supple leather lining.

100
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,977
- I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.
- Why not?

101
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:01,482
Your bosses will think
they pay you too much money.

102
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,277
Or your assistant will see them
and want a raise.

103
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:09,531
Do you think I work
at a boot-pricing company?

104
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,326
I picked out this outfit
the boots don't go with.

105
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:18,331
You said those boots go
with skirts, dresses and pants.

106
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,126
Fine, I'll wear the boots.

107
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:26,756
In fact, I'll go into my room
right now and try the outfit on.

108
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,222
Christmas party in my boots!

109
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,188
I can't go in there. I can't tell him.

110
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,734
It's gonna be okay.
He's been incredibly supportive of me.

111
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:50,238
And if he gets upset,
that's what the meatball sub is for.

112
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,658
- Thank you.
- Okay.

113
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,496
Hey! It's my fashion girls.

114
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,667
- What's wrong?
- Why don't you sit down?

115
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,213
Dina has something
she wants to tell you.

116
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:10,800
What's going on?
Is it Mom? Is she sick?

117
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,928
Is it Dad's heart?

118
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,555
Is that a sandwich?

119
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:21,187
- Mom and Dad are fine.
- Is that a sandwich?!

120
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:28,485
Joey, there's something
that you should know. Dina?

121
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:33,115
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

122
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,534
Now. Give him the sandwich!

123
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:40,622
Obviously, this is a mistake.
You can't be pregnant.

124
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,584
You have to have sex to get pregnant.

125
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:48,505
Joe, I tried to wait until
I was 25, like you did.

126
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,215
What? Dina...

127
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:58,557
I can't believe this. You're
the good one who went to college!

128
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:04,771
- Both years! Who did this to you?
- Bobby Corso. He's a real nice guy.

129
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:11,069
- I like him a lot. He's real funny.
- You got pregnant for "funny"?

130
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,366
Dina, if he's funny, laugh!

131
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,121
- I'll be back in a while. Stay here!
- Why?

132
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,708
I can't look at you right now.

133
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,130
- Wow.
- I know.

134
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:48,732
- Oh, there you are, Ben.
- Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?

135
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,528
I heard you have a problem
with one of the boys.

136
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:57,199
I thought I'd sit you both down
and make it all okay.

137
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,495
Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.

138
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,957
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.

139
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:09,253
Sometimes people may seem
like jerks on the outside...

140
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,089
...but they have famous fathers.

141
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:18,178
- My friend Doug is waiting for me.
- Him, you're friends with.

142
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:29,606
- Can I help you with something?
- Yes. I'm looking for Jack's parents.

143
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,568
- Are you with a student?
- I'm with Ben.

144
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:37,948
- Are you one of Ben's mothers?
- I am one of Ben's mothers.

145
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,492
I'm a lesbian.

146
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:44,537
It was difficult coming out
to my parents.

147
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,750
Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.
I'm a new teacher here.

148
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:53,797
- I've only met your partner, Carol.
- That would make me Susan.

149
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:59,970
Are you looking for Jack's parents
to discuss his problems with Ben?

150
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,891
I think the parents
should sit down together.

151
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,977
Yeah, let's do that!

152
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,145
That sounds good.

153
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:14,025
We should sit down and talk.
Me, Carol and the Stings.

154
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:19,615
- How will I get in touch with them?
- Their number's on the contact sheet.

155
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:24,703
Could I get a copy of that?
Carol threw it out. She lost ours.

156
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:30,041
She's such a scatterbrain.
But, man, what a hot piece of ass.

157
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:40,427
- That party wasn't bad.
- I didn't know there'd be dancing.

158
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,680
That was a fun surprise.

159
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:47,059
- I don't see a cab. We should walk.
- No, we can't walk.

160
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,229
It's 15 blocks to the subway.
Let's go.

161
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:55,693
Do you think we can get to the subway
if we climb through that manhole?

162
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,946
- What's going on?
- I can't walk, okay?

163
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,199
- These boots were a huge mistake.
- What?

164
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:07,495
You were right. I never should've
bought them. They're killing me.

165
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:11,833
So I was right. This is what
it feels like to be right.

166
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,795
It's oddly unsettling.

167
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,965
How will we get home?
A piggyback ride?

168
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,968
- Hop on.
- Okay, wait.

169
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,137
Let me just get my boots off first.

170
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,645
Oh, God.

171
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:40,821
I know you're in pain right now,
but I'm a little turned on.

172
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:49,789
Do you worry that you'll be walking
and your baby will slip out?

173
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:55,044
What college was that, Dina?

174
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,714
Oh, my God. Bobby?

175
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,759
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.

176
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:07,097
- Joey, what are you doing?
- Just what needs to be done.

177
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:12,061
- Dearly beloved, we're gathered here...
- This is crazy.

178
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:15,523
Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking to God!

179
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:19,318
- Where were we? Do you take this man...
- No!

180
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,528
- You'll take him.
- I won't!

181
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,614
- You don't get a say.
- I do.

182
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:29,202
- I heard "I do." We're halfway there.
- All right, Joey, that is enough!

183
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,831
As moving as this is,
this is not legal.

184
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:39,462
They don't have a marriage license or
witnesses, and the groom has one shoe.

185
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,717
Yeah, he took the other one off
and hit me with it.

186
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,177
What am I to do?

187
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:49,389
They are adults and can make
their own decisions.

188
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:54,019
No, they can't. They were
stupid enough to get knocked up!

189
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,983
Contraceptives are not
always effective. Right?

190
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:05,906
- Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
- Come on, kids, a little help here!

191
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:13,664
Wow! This place is incredible!

192
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,210
Sting's pen...

193
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,546
...that he gave to Phoebe.

194
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:29,888
Come on, secret passageway.

195
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,851
- Hi.
- Hi.

196
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,936
I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.

197
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:41,441
- Why else would I be here?
- Why don't you sit down?

198
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,447
They haven't been getting along.
I'm sure there are two sides to this.

199
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:51,326
But all I've heard
is that Ben's a "poo-poo-head."

200
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:54,580
Won't Jack's father be joining us?

201
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,250
I'm sorry.
Jack's father's not available.

202
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,088
Then, could we reschedule
for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?

203
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,924
Oh, no, my husband's in concert.

204
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:12,014
Concert. Yeah.
That just put us in quite a pickle.

205
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:17,060
I'm busy before and after
the concert, and he's busy during.

206
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:21,273
So you and I should talk about
Jack and Ben right now.

207
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,984
Unless... Unless...

208
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:28,155
Okay, I would be willing
to go to the concert...

209
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,449
...all the while thinking
about the children.

210
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,246
- Are you here for tickets?
- Thank you. Four would be great.

211
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:41,794
I'm not giving tickets to someone
who'd use their son like this.

212
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,297
Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.

213
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:48,592
I've pressed a button
triggering an alarm.

214
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,221
- Any minute the police will be here.
- The Police? Here?

215
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,599
A reunion?

216
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:06,902
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.

217
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:12,282
- Oh, wait! Stop, stop, stop!
- Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?

218
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:16,370
My boots in tan!
Can I see the price?

219
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:21,083
I can see it from right here.
It'll cost you one husband.

220
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:26,255
I can walk the rest of the way now.
Just give me my boots.

221
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,467
- I don't have your boots.
- Where are they?

222
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:35,848
Why don't you check in one
of my saddlebags while I chew on hay?

223
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:40,435
Okay. My God, we gotta go back
and get them!

224
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:43,814
Are you ever gonna
wear the boots again?

225
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:50,153
I'll never wear them again. I just
didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

226
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,156
You can say goodbye to the tan ones.

227
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:58,078
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.

228
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,582
Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!

229
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:09,423
Just because they're not getting
married doesn't mean it's a disaster.

230
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:14,302
- Maybe they have a plan.
- Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.

231
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:18,390
What's the future look like
for Dina and Bobby?

232
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,853
I really have high hopes for my band.

233
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,482
- You were right. He is funny.
- Now wait a minute.

234
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:32,446
I bet when you told people you wanted
to be an actor they laughed.

235
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,198
Tell us a bit about your band.

236
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:41,121
It's just me and my pal Rooster.
The band's name is Numbnuts.

237
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,250
Really?

238
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,172
If you're having a baby,
you should be married.

239
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:55,510
Even if it is to Bobby.
Dude, that's not a compliment.

240
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:59,974
- I knew you wouldn't be supportive.
- What are you gonna do?

241
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,519
Have the baby and raise it
without a husband?

242
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,481
You can't be a single mother!
You'll ruin your life!

243
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:11,860
- Am I ruining my life?
- No, it's different for you.

244
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,615
You're not some kid
who doesn't know what she's doing.

245
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:21,578
- Excuse me?
- One pregnant woman at a time, please!

246
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:28,085
- I just want you to be okay.
- By forcing her to marry?

247
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,378
Maybe.

248
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:36,301
Yeah. So, what kind of music
does Numbnuts...

249
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,929
Ah, forget it! I can't!

250
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:44,934
I am scared to death about this. But I
can do it. I just need some help.

251
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,980
- Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
- You bet.

252
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:54,194
To answer your earlier question,
we're straight up gangster rap.

253
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,702
Rachel's told me how easy
you've made this on her.

254
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:07,791
- Why can't you do that for me?
- Because you're my baby sister!

255
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,963
And you're my big brother,
my favorite guy in the whole world.

256
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:18,719
I'm not even scared to tell Mom
and Dad. I was scared of telling you.

257
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,348
I'd be scared of them, but all right.

258
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:27,269
I can't stand having this baby
with you mad at me.

259
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,188
I want him to have his uncle.

260
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,942
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?

261
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,947
Of course he's gonna have
his Uncle Joey.

262
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:45,704
We'll be all right. Even if we're not
married, this baby will be so loved.

263
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:49,249
- And not just by us.
- That's right.

264
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,085
By his uncle too.

265
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,005
And by you.

266
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:03,180
Bobby, come over here and let them
have a little moment, okay?

267
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,395
Come here.

268
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,357
No, seriously, what's wrong with you?

269
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,282
You're gonna love me so much.
I got Sting tickets!

270
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:26,203
Oh, my God, I do love you!
How did you do it?

271
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,204
Well, let's just say:

272
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:31,709
<i>Ross can</i>

273
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,629
- Where are the seats?
- Balcony.

274
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,215
Is that more than 50 yards away...

275
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:42,093
...from Sting, his wife
or a member of his family?

276
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,681
- Yeah.
- Then that's not breaking the law!

277
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,271
