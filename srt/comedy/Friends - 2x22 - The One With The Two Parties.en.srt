00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,635
I'll get candles and
my mom's lace tablecloth.

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,013
And since it's Rachel's birthday...

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,057
...I thought I'd poach a salmon.

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,142
What?

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:21,479
Question. Why do we always
have parties where you poach things?

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,232
You want to be on the food committee?

9
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,777
Question 2. Why do we always
have parties with committees?

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,822
Why can't we just get pizza
and beer and have fun?

11
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:35,119
I agree. Fancy parties are only fun
if you're fancy on the inside.

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,247
And I'm not sure we are.

13
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,749
You don't want it to be special?

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,585
Fine. You can throw
any kind of party you want.

15
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:47,256
Joey, they're not real!

16
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,968
I start miles beneath the surface
of these things. They're fake.

17
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,971
See?
Honk, honk!

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,934
Wow, it's like porno for clowns!

19
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,103
The One With Two Parties

21
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,194
Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.

22
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,783
I still have to invite Dylan
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

23
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,243
No Shannon Cooper.

24
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,743
Why not her?

25
00:01:58,994 --> 00:01:59,912
Because she...

26
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,415
She steals stuff.

27
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:10,881
Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept
with her and never called her back.

28
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,841
Joey, that is horrible.

29
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,301
Hey, I liked her.

30
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,844
Maybe too much.

31
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,637
I don't know.

32
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,974
I guess I just got scared.

33
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,853
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

34
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:28,064
I didn't think anyone
would buy that. Okay!

35
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,733
Hi, honey.
How did it go?

36
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,902
It was the graduation from hell.

37
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,114
My cousin went to hell
on a football scholarship.

38
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,659
It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.

39
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,204
Nobody thought my sister
would graduate from college.

40
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:47,292
It's a testament to what a girl
from Long Island will do for a Celica.

41
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:48,377
What happened?

42
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,753
My parents happened.

43
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,964
All they had to do was sit
in the same stadium, smile...

44
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,301
...and not talk about the divorce.
But no!

45
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,180
They got into a fight
during the commencement address.

46
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:04,976
Bishop Tutu actually
had to stop and shush them.

47
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,103
You know the good news?

48
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:11,567
I get to serve coffee
for the next eight hours.

49
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,361
I guess we don't invite her parents.

50
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,239
- How about just her mom?
- Why her mom?

51
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,741
Because I already invited her.

52
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,952
Did you ask Stacy Roth?

53
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,996
Can't invite her.

54
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,209
She also steals.

55
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,384
Here are the candles.
Where's the birthday cake?

56
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,553
We're not having birthday cake.

57
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,098
We're having birthday flan.

58
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,809
Excuse me?

59
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,977
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

60
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,562
That's nice.

61
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:53,066
Happy birthday, Rachel.
Here's some goo!

62
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,906
Dr. Greene!

63
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,535
Oh, my God!
It's Rachel's dad.

64
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,954
Why are you here?

65
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,874
The father can't see
the daughter on her birthday?

66
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,917
No, no, the father can.

67
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,922
But since I am the roommate,
I can tell you she's not here.

68
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,342
And I'll pass along the message.
Okay? So bye-bye.

69
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,053
You're having a party.

70
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,263
No, no, not a party.

71
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:26,600
Just a surprise gathering
of some people Rachel knows.

72
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,854
- This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey.
- I'll never remember all that.

73
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,148
So what's the deal?

74
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:37,027
Rachel comes home, people pop out
and yell stuff? Is that it?

75
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:42,282
This isn't your first
surprise party, is it, sir?

76
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,662
Hi, Monica.

77
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,125
The Chinese menu guy.
Forgot the menus.

78
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,629
So basically, just a Chinese guy.

79
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:01,510
Dr. Greene, come with me.
We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

80
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:07,141
All right.
That sounds like a two-person job.

81
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,437
Well, my goodness!
What was that?

82
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,274
Sandra, I thought you were Rachel.
We weren't ready for you yet.

83
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:19,236
- You thought I was Rachel?
- Yes, because you look so young.

84
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,615
And because you're both,
you know, white women.

85
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:30,580
Oh, I missed you kids.
Should I put my coat in the bedroom?

86
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,584
- No, I'll take that for you.
- Oh, well, thank you.

87
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,630
Such a gentleman.
Thank you.

88
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:44,804
It all looks so nice.
So festive. All the balloons.

89
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,515
Oh, the funniest thing happened
to me on the way here.

90
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,811
- I was driving...
- That's great!

91
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,816
I can't wait to hear the rest,
but I have to go to the bathroom.

92
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,985
Hey, come with me.

93
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,529
- What?
- It will be like we're gal pals.

94
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,075
You know, like at a restaurant.
It'll be fun! Come on.

95
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,331
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

96
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,042
Think. Think.

97
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,046
What would Jack and Chrissy do?

98
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,841
Okay, now that your coat
is safely in the bed...

99
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,427
We can come back out
in the living room.

100
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,931
Joey and Chandler, it's time
you take Dr. Greene over to your place.

101
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,185
Yes, absolutely.

102
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,479
Why, again?

103
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,733
Because that's where
the party is, you goon!

104
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,737
- See, this is just the staging area.
- Right, it's the staging area.

105
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:48,533
This is clearly
in the wrong apartment.

106
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:56,917
All right, you guys are off
to party number one.

107
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,835
And you...

108
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,880
You are off to party number two.

109
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,801
All right, let's keep it moving,
let's keep it moving.

110
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:11,557
At least send some women to my party.

111
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,018
Okay, that's Ross. All right.

112
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,314
Okay, they're coming.

113
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,572
Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.

114
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,657
Thanks for being born.

115
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,952
Thank you for my beautiful earrings.
They're perfect.

116
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,954
I love you.

117
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:37,749
Now, you can exchange them
if you want, okay?

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,629
Now I love you even more.

119
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,093
Surprise!

120
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,885
Oh, my gosh!

121
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,971
Wow!

122
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,848
Oh, my God. Mom!

123
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,516
This is so great!

124
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,311
Happy birthday, sweetie.

125
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,023
You! I had no idea!

126
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,441
- Really?
- No, I knew.

127
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,693
All right.

128
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,237
There's food and drinks on the table.

129
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,115
Go across the hall.
Right now, Joey and Chandler's.

130
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,118
- Why?
- Just go.

131
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,245
Weird.

132
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,039
Surprise!

133
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,252
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

134
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,131
Daddy!

135
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,679
Both of them are here? Both of them?
Both of them are here?

136
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,766
Well, we could count again?

137
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,267
I can't believe this!

138
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,061
You know, this is ridiculous.

139
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,563
This is your birthday, your party.

140
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,983
Let's put them together.
If they can't deal with it, who cares?

141
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:48,821
- I do.
- That's who.

142
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,489
Are you gonna be okay?

143
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,534
I don't really have a choice.
I can look at the bright side.

144
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,663
I get two birthday parties
and two birthday cakes.

145
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,456
Well, actually...

146
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,376
...just one birthday flan.

147
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,715
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

148
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:12,094
Talk to Monica.
She's on the food committee.

149
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,894
Some girl just walked up to me
and said, "I want you, Dennis"...

150
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,730
...and stuck her tongue
down my throat.

151
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,192
I love this party!

152
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,485
- Quick volleyball question.
- Volleyball.

153
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,654
We set up a court in your room.

154
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,282
You didn't like
that gray lamp, did you?

155
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,785
A woman stuck her
tongue down my throat.

156
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,954
I'm not even listening to you.

157
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:43,083
- Dennis!
- Okay, that's me.

158
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,254
Can you keep Dad occupied?
I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.

159
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,632
Do you have any ideas
for any openers?

160
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,969
Stay clear of "I'm the guy
that's doing your daughter"...

161
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,764
...and you should be okay.

162
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,392
I want you to take a piece of paper...

163
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,855
Here you go. And write down
your most embarrassing memory.

164
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:09,568
When you're not using the markers,
put the caps back on them...

165
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,571
...because they will dry out.

166
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,741
Hi, Dr. Greene.

167
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,743
So how's everything in the...

168
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,205
...vascular surgery...

169
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,374
...game?

170
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:27,419
It's not a game, Ross.
A woman died on my table today.

171
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,463
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,133
That's the good thing about my job.

173
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:38,221
All the dinosaurs on my table
are already dead.

174
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,892
Listen, I don't mean
to be a pain about this...

175
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,228
...but I've noticed some of you
are just placing them on.

176
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,899
You want to push the caps...

177
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,903
...until you hear them click.

178
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,029
Gunther!

179
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,071
Where you going?

180
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,950
I was sort of thinking about maybe...

181
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,245
No! No, you can't go!
No, this is fun.

182
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:05,541
We're just starting.
Here's your marker.

183
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,004
If you want to go, just go.

184
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:13,716
She'll yell at me again.

185
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,344
All right, I can get you out.

186
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,222
What?

187
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,850
In a minute, I'll create a diversion.

188
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,563
When I do, walk quickly to the door
and don't look back.

189
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,774
- I think I need a drink.
- I'll get it for you.

190
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,984
- What do you want?
- Scotch.

191
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:37,614
I'll be back in 10 seconds with
your scotch on the rocks in a glass.

192
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,116
Neat!

193
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,201
Cool.

194
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,913
Neat, as in no rocks.

195
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,624
I know.

196
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:53,922
Hello, Ross!
Where have you been?

197
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,843
I have been in the bathroom.

198
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:02,139
Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

199
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,852
Scotch neat.

200
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,814
That's Rachel's father's drink.

201
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:14,234
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

202
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,737
Scotch neat.

203
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,535
Would you excuse me?

204
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,501
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?

205
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,336
I'm getting my cigarettes.

206
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,462
No.

207
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,505
What do you mean "no"?

208
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,008
See, because that's the staging area.

209
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,721
You go in there, it'll ruin
the whole illusion of the party.

210
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,973
Take your scotch back in there...

211
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:48,644
...and I will get
your cigarettes for you, sir.

212
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:53,565
- Get my glasses too.
- All righty-roo.

213
00:12:55,609 --> 00:13:00,280
What a great moment to say that
for the first time.

214
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:06,370
Okay, the first person's
most embarrassing memory is...

215
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,540
..."Monica, your party sucks."

216
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,500
Very funny.

217
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,045
Oh, no! Did someone forget
to use a coaster?

218
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,006
What?

219
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,681
I don't see anything.

220
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:30,060
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

221
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,648
Ross, whose glasses are those?

222
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,484
Mine.

223
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,821
You wear bifocals?

224
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,366
I have a condition apparently...

225
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,702
...that I require...

226
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,039
...two different sets of focals.

227
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,668
Do you know my husband
has glasses just like that?

228
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,587
Well, those are very popular frames.

229
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,508
Neil Sedaka wears them.

230
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:06,972
I hear you can get people out of here.

231
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,686
You didn't tell me
your boyfriend smokes.

232
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,856
Yeah, like a chimney.

233
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,817
Big smoker.

234
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,694
Big, big smoker.

235
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:26,408
In fact, I'm gonna go into the hallway
and fire up this bad boy.

236
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,506
Are you wearing my glasses?

237
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,260
Yes.

238
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,931
I was just warming up
the earpieces for you.

239
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:52,685
Thank you.

240
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:57,272
Is that one of my cigarettes?

241
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:07,699
Yes, it is. I was just
moistening the tip.

242
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,494
She's taking the trash out,
so I can get you out of here.

243
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,122
But it has to be now.
She'll be back any minute.

244
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:15,249
What about my friend?

245
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:19,003
Only the three of you.
Any more and she'll get suspicious.

246
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:23,382
- Let me just get my coat.
- There isn't time!

247
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,967
Just leave everything.

248
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,846
They'll take care of you next door.

249
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,932
Is it true they have beer?

250
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,143
Everything you've heard is true.

251
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,730
Could you guys please keep it down?

252
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,318
We're trying to start
a Boggle tournament.

253
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:46,738
You!

254
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,073
And you.

255
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,200
You're supposed to be at my party.

256
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,870
And Gunther!

257
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,043
What are you doing here?

258
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,715
Welcome to the fo...

259
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,180
All right, I'm sorry.
But these people needed me.

260
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,682
They work hard all week.
It's Saturday night.

261
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,102
They deserve to have a little fun.
Go!

262
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,187
You know, my party is fun.

263
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:22,024
It's a little quieter,
less obvious sort of fun.

264
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:26,945
But if people would just
give it a chance, it's...

265
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,203
- You want me to see a therapist?
- Sweetheart, you have a problem.

266
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:38,749
You've chosen a boyfriend
exactly like your father.

267
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,293
Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.

268
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,755
But right now, I gotta go.
I gotta go do a thing.

269
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:50,010
Did you know your mother
spent $ 1200 on bonsai trees?

270
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,846
I felt like Gulliver.

271
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,849
Daddy, I really want
to hear more about this...

272
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,269
...but I just have to do some stuff.

273
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,481
You work and you work
and you work at a marriage...

274
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,108
...but all he cares about
is his stupid boat.

275
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,153
You work and you work
and you work on a boat.

276
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,281
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

277
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,451
And you sand it and varnish it.

278
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,287
But when all is said and done,
he still drinks out of the mugs.

279
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:20,541
One night of her yoga
<i>and Bridges of Madison County...</i>

280
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,544
<i>- The scotch, the cigarettes...</i>
<i>- The bonsais and the Chihuahua...</i>

281
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:26,088
<i>I may have only been in therapy</i>
<i>for three weeks now but...</i>

282
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,342
<i>What the hell does she want</i>
<i>with half a boat?</i>

283
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:36,932
Okay, okay, you can be shirts
and I'll be skins.

284
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,560
I'll be skins!

285
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:49,528
How you holding up there, tiger?

286
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:54,199
Sorry. When my parents were getting
divorced, I got a lot of "tigers".

287
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,953
I got a lot of "champs",
"chiefs", "sports".

288
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,956
I even got a "governor".

289
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:05,461
This is it, isn't it?
This is what my life will be like.

290
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,796
My mom there, my dad there.

291
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,549
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

292
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,929
She gets the house, he's in a condo
my sister will decorate with wicker.

293
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,975
How did you get through this?

294
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,479
I relied on a carefully
regimented program...

295
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,981
...of denial...

296
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:29,651
...and wetting the bed.

297
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,280
You know, I just...
It's so weird.

298
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:38,160
I mean, I was in there just listening
to them bitch about each other.

299
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,748
All I kept thinking about
was the Fourth of July.

300
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,708
Because it reminded you of the way...

301
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,295
...our forefathers used
to bitch at each other?

302
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,214
It's just this thing.
Every year we would...

303
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:54,468
...go out on my dad's boat
and watch the fireworks.

304
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:58,764
Mom always hated it because
the ocean air made her hair all big.

305
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:02,267
My sister Jill would be
throwing up over the side...

306
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,146
...and Dad would be upset
because nobody helped.

307
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:10,150
And when we did help, he'd scream
at us for doing it wrong.

308
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:16,282
But then when the fireworks started,
everybody just shut up.

309
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,743
You know, and it'd get really cold.

310
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,662
And we'd all just sort of
smoosh under this one blanket.

311
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:27,543
It never occurred to anybody
to bring another one.

312
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,754
And now it's...

313
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,884
Yeah, I know.

314
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,825
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>
<i>I hope you had fun.</i>

315
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,035
All right, I'm hitting the road.

316
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:05,164
Now, I've left my 10 verbs
on the table.

317
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,708
Be sure and send me
that finished poem.

318
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,835
Okay, will do. Glad you came.

319
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:14,756
- I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
- Let me go check.

320
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,843
Your mom wants to say goodbye.

321
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,597
Happy birthday, sweetie.

322
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,893
You drive safe.

323
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,604
What are you doing?

324
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:32,232
I'm getting ready
for the water skiing.

325
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:36,277
Okay, big hug. One more.
Come on!

326
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,448
How are you?

327
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,285
- Where are you going?
- To get my coat.

328
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,953
We'll get that for you.

329
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:49,709
All right, all right.
I can get my own coat.

330
00:20:55,964 --> 00:21:00,093
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

331
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,972
Oh, no. No, you're not
supposed to be here.

332
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:08,018
This is the staging area.
It's all wrong. You should leave.

333
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:12,189
You know, just get out.

334
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,494
I have to be heading
toward my chateau.

335
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,538
I guess we're going back
into the hallway again.

336
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,293
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.

337
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:46,598
You take care.

338
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,728
Oh, you kids.

339
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,524
Well.

340
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:59,528
This is the best party
I've been to in years.

341
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,489
Thank you!

342
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,663
Okay, everybody,
it's time for flan!

343
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:14,000
Yep! Get ready
for the gelatinous fun.

344
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,629
Looks like that stuff you get
