1
00:00:02,332 --> 00:00:04,653
Can you confirm that 
the straps are tight?

2
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:06,755
Yes.

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,484
- But this one's a little...
- And now the chains!

4
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:15,436
A lot of people think that 
magic camp is just for kids.

5
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:18,354
And that's why so many other people 
in my class were kids.

6
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,134
Self-fulfilling prophecy

7
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:23,714
It's, um, really for anybody

8
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:27,424
With a dream, 
and a belief in magic.

9
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:30,590
And a little extra time 
after school.

10
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:34,627
Magic, magic, magic, magic...

11
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:37,296
And now, 
Michael the Magic

12
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:41,036
will attempt to escape 
from extreme bondage.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,830
Can he do it?

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,234
I don't see how he can.

15
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:44,903
<i>I know how

16
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:47,611
He'd dislocate his shoulder 
and slip his arm out.

17
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,648
No, no.

18
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:52,427
Everyone now count down with me.

19
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,832
Three! Sorry

20
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:54,689
Sorry, quickly

21
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,671
So, is it true that 
if you can't get out,

22
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,206
You don't want 
anyone to help you?

23
00:00:58,215 --> 00:00:59,441
I will get out.

24
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:01,199
Oh, yes, I will.

25
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:02,934
So we shoulnd't help you

26
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:05,067
no matter how much 
you might beg and plead.

27
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,635
No, all right, 
just- this is getting hot.

28
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,429
So let's just do this, 
okay, ready?

29
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:09,387
Three!

30
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:10,465
Two!

31
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:11,516
One!

32
00:01:11,516 --> 00:01:12,328
Go!

33
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,359
Is everything okay, Michael?

34
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:45,411
Yes.

35
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:50,451
<i>I cannot tell you 
how I plan to escape.

36
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:53,218
<i>Other than by using magic.

37
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:55,380
<i>That's the magician's code

38
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:58,814
Help

39
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:00,731
<i>Separately, on an unrelated note,

All right, ready?

44
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:29,722
Come on, guys,

45
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:31,823
Early worm gets the worm.

46
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:34,479
Another worm?
Like, are they friends?

47
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,235
It's early bird gets the worm.

48
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,826
Pam, would you smell my breath?

49
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:41,592
<i>Let me smell

50
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:47,646
Good, not great.

51
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:49,193
Michael, you go to parties all the time.

52
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:50,294
Why is tonight so special?

53
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:51,901
Well, tonight is so special

54
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:54,299
because my boss's boss's boss,

55
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,101
the CFO,

56
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:57,324
not his initials, common mistake,

57
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:00,353
is having a little shindig 
for all the managers in the company,

58
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:02,615
and Jan and I are going as a couple.

59
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:04,513
For the first time.

60
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:06,791
So, it's kind of 
our coming out party.

61
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,310
Really.

62
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:10,213
And, that is why 
tonight is so special.

63
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:12,280
Jimbo, last chance carpool.

64
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,778
Oh, no thanks, I think 
Karen and I'll take my car.

65
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,157
Sure? Might be a good idea.

66
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:16,915
If we all went together 
we could save some gas.

67
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:18,368
- Have fun. Long trip! 
- Thanks

68
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:19,334
Play some games?

69
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:21,445
Um- no, we're good.

70
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:22,723
I spy. Yeah

71
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:25,302
Why don't I wanna go?

72
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:26,729
Didn't expect to need a reason,

73
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:27,835
So, let me think here.

74
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:31,306
I don't know any of these people.

75
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:32,506
It's an obligation.

76
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:35,606
I don't like talking paper 
in my free time.

77
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:36,696
Or in my work time.

78
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,512
And... did I use the word "pointless"?

79
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,933
Thanks for inviting me along.

80
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,059
Oh, sure.

81
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:45,668
Really didn't give it any thought.

82
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:47,145
Wait, should you be going?

83
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,552
Hey-wo, you!

84
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:52,856
<font color= lightblue>- Michael?</font> 
- Hey, buttercup

85
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:55,411
I am on my way, 
should be there in about 15-

86
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:56,898
<font color= lightblue>Let's just blow this party off.

87
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,081
- That's what she said. <font color= lightblue>
- Yeah

88
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:00,072
<font color= lightblue>Am I on speaker phone?

89
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,207
Ah, yes you are.

90
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:04,225
<font color= lightblue>- Is anybody else... </font>
- Hello, Jan!

91
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,066
<font color= lightblue>Hi, Dwight.

92
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,908
<font color= lightblue>Okay, Michael, 
take me off speakerphone.

93
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:09,001
No le problem.

94
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,296
<font color= lightblue>Okay, let's just go to a motel...

95
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:12,906
Okay!

96
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:14,694
<font color= lightblue>And, like, rip into each other

97
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:16,608
<font color= lightblue>like we did on 
that black sand beach in Jamaica

98
00:04:17,328 --> 00:04:18,245
Hey, Jan?

99
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:21,248
Jan, this party is 
actually a very big step for us.

100
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:22,449
So, I...

101
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:23,549
<font color= lightblue>Still on speaker?

102
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:26,651
I don't know

103
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:27,936
<font color= lightblue>Are cameras there?

104
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:28,703
Maybe

105
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:31,357
- <font color= lightblue>All right, see you soon.</font>
- Okay.

106
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:33,228
- Talk to you later, Jan!
- All right, bye.

107
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:35,528
<i>Hey, Michael left early,

108
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:37,995
<i>So, a bunch of us are gonna go to 
Poor Richard's for happy hour.

109
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:38,822
You should come.

110
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:40,671
I can't.

111
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,228
My brother just unloaded the Jet Skis

112
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:44,657
And he kinda took a bath, so...

113
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,842
We're gonna go get hammered.

114
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:49,089
Okay, well, we're going to a bar.

115
00:04:52,718 --> 00:04:53,304
Hey,

116
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,502
You have to come to stuff with me.

117
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:58,045
I'm serious.

118
00:04:58,363 --> 00:04:59,215
If you're gonna be my boyfriend,

119
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,736
You have to do boyfriend things.

120
00:05:04,697 --> 00:05:05,308
Okay

121
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,213
I have decided that 
I'm going to be more honest.

122
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,059
I'm just start telling people 
what I want directly.

123
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:14,520
So, look out world,

124
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,386
'cause old Pamie is 
gtting what she wants.

125
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,006
And, don't call me Pamie.

126
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:23,151
Beauty.

127
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:24,165
Thank you, sir.

128
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:25,652
Ensalada. Thank you

129
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,826
You're dressed 
exactly like the servants.

130
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:31,521
Shut up.

131
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:34,293
Okay, change shirts with me.

132
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:35,070
Wait!

133
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,416
I don't think your's will fit me.

134
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,312
I don't care.

135
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:49,366
Here.

136
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,891
Don't let my jacket...

137
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:51,666
Don't give me that.

138
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,651
That would have been 
really embarrassing.

139
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:55,706
Yes.

140
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,328
Crisis averted.

141
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:06,592
Oh, that duck is so cute.

142
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:11,135
<i>Hey, Pam

143
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:11,993
Hey guys

144
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:14,629
<i>Oscar, Angela

145
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,070
Uh, hi!

146
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:21,934
Actually, it's polite to arrive early.

147
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,129
And, smart.

148
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,916
Only really good friends 
show up early.

149
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,682
Ergo de facto,

150
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:30,375
go to a party early 
become a really good friend.

151
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,129
Oh, uh- potato salad.

152
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:33,564
That's from both of us.

153
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:34,639
No, it's not.

154
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,946
- It's my bowl 
- Wonderful

155
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:39,053
Let's- uh, see 
where we can put this.

156
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:40,409
Okay.

157
00:06:40,677 --> 00:06:43,013
Oh, you know what, 
you probably wanna leave the cover on

158
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:44,277
Until the guests get here.

159
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:47,112
It's been sitting in my car all day.

160
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:50,317
Sun beating down on the mayonnaise...

161
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:51,478
Just...

162
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,527
you never know.

163
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,716
Kevin, you and Stacey set a date yet?

164
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:58,690
Yeah.

165
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:00,462
Oh my God, when is it?

166
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,667
It's complicated.

167
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,845
I would appreciate some space on this.

168
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:07,011
<i>Hey

169
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,074
Hey

170
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:10,544
You made it.

171
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:12,078
Yeah, you said 
it was important, so...

172
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:12,636
It is.

173
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:14,914
How's going?

174
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:17,088
- What's up Pam? 
- Hey, Kenny

175
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,457
Sorry about the Jet Skis.

176
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,771
You guys all want around? On me?

177
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:23,818
Yeah!

178
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:24,517
Let's get you a drink.

179
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:25,744
<i>Thanks, man. I'm thirsty.

180
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,901
<i>No, thank you, Roy, I...

181
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:29,547
<i>You should get around, Ryan.

182
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,059
Oh, you know that line 
on the top of the shrimp?

183
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:37,159
That's feces.

184
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:40,421
Whatcha looking for?

185
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:41,419
Did you bring dip?

186
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,549
I'm sure that it's catered.

187
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:45,638
I need you to sign these, Michael.

188
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:48,488
That's a waiver of some of your rights.

189
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:50,418
You should read it carefully.

190
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:51,785
It releases the company in the event

191
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:53,372
that our relationship in your opinion,

192
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,083
or, in reality, interferes with work.

193
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:57,293
You get a copy, I get a copy,

194
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:58,819
And a third copy goes to HR.

195
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:00,285
Awesome.

196
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,404
I'm gonna frame mine.

197
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:03,601
I could frame yours too.

198
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:06,011
You realize this is- 
this is a legal document

199
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:08,058
That says 
you can't sue the company?

200
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:10,519
Over our love.

201
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:14,579
I've... never told you 
that I love you.

202
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,621
You don't have to, Jan.

203
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:18,094
This contract says it all.

204

<i>I am taking a calculated risk.

205

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,342
I overcome my nausea,

207
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:24,412
fall deeply in love,

208
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:26,617
babies, normalcy,
no more self-loathing.

209
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:28,156
Downside,

210
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,518
I, uh- date Michael Scott publicly.

211
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:33,585
And collapse into myself 
like a dying star.

212
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:37,917
What's this over the I?

213
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:39,499
It's a heart.

214
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:44,512
Why is this so hard?

215
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:47,450
That's what she said.

216
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:50,008
Oh, my God. What am I saying?

217
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:52,517
I love this woman!

218
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:53,487
Oh, no,

219
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,054
Michael, Please

220
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:57,481
Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?

221
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,609
No. No?

222
00:08:58,609 --> 00:08:59,930
Then, you're an idiot.

223
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:01,499
<i>Hello, Michael.

224
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,714

226

227
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:09,985
Weird. So...

228
00:09:11,237 --> 00:09:13,688
Jan, glad you could make it.

229
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:15,325
Oh, of course, of course, David.

230
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:16,696
Do you remember, uh- Michael Scott

231
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:17,816
- Of course I do.
- From Scranton branch?

232
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:18,625
How are you Michael?

233
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,846
Jan and I are lovers.

234
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:22,729
That feels so good 
to finally say that out loud.

235
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:26,143
David, can I, um- 
speak to you privately?

236
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:27,580
For just a moment, please?

Excuse me Okay

Oh.

00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:42,645
No, actually one of these is 
supposed to be a light.

240
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:43,812
Oh, sorry.

241
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,523
So, the merger goes smoothly, or...

242
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:49,210

You should ask Karen, 
she was one of them.

246
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,179
I'm the only one left.

247
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,761
Everybody else 
was either fired or quit.

And, there's one 
in anger management.

Yeah, but you're great now, right?

Uh, about 5,000

261

Does that include the garage?

Dwight, wow- 
that's not appropriate.

263

- I don't know. 
- It's a common question.

264

David, how much 
did this house cost?

265
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,286
These old colonials are great...

266

when they're sound.

267
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:37,218
I'd love to, uh- 
take a look around.

I'll show you around, sure.

269

Cool, let's start with the banisters.

Hey.

271
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:45,803
Do you see that guy behind you 
in the blue blazer against the wall?

272

Yup

273

That's Drake.

274
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,860
And, just so you know,

275
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,569
I don't wanna be weird or anything

276
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,592
But, um- we used to date.

277
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:56,071
Oh.

278
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:58,841
Okay, cool. 
Thanks for telling me that.

279
00:10:58,841 --> 00:10:59,971
And, it didn't end well.

280
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,260
Gotcha.

When they were separated.

333
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:16,879
Didn't notice.

334
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,757
Really? I thought 
it was so obvious.

335
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:20,889
I'm glad it didn't 
make you uncomfortable.

336
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:22,691
No, it was before I knew you,

337
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:24,101
So, it's fine.

338
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:27,228
This one really smells like vanilla.

339
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:28,059
Check that out.

340
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,294
That's nice.

341
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:34,114
You and the Mrs. Should join us 
at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.

342
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:38,665
I... Michael, I think David provably wants
to spend Christmas here with his family.

343
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:39,607
Oh, yeah.

344
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:41,844
They don't allow kids at Sandals.

345
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:44,879
- They are- are persona non grata.
- Please stop.

346
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:45,909
They're...uh

347
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:47,412
But it's fun.

348
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:48,467
It is an awesome place.

349
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:50,676
You would not believe 
how low this girl can limbo.

350
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:52,508
- It's crazy
- David, I'm sorry

351
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:53,495
You're just gonna 
have to excuse us

352
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:55,292
for just a couple 
minutes sorry.

353
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,125
Okay, Okay.

354
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:57,535
Excuse me.

355
00:13:58,012 --> 00:13:58,850
What's going on?

356
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:00,345
What is it?

357
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:01,592
Sorry.

358
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:03,205
What- what's the matter?

359
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:07,068
- What's... 
- Come here.

360
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:09,645
Just- just- just- just-

361
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,847
What are you doing?

362
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,458
Don't you know what I'm doing?

363
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:19,617
Yes, but you could tell me.

364
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,812
What are- what is that?

365
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:24,093
Why are you- 
why are we going in the bathroom?

366
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:25,955
I thought this is 
where you liked your privacy.

367
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:27,103
Shut up.

368
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:30,350
<i>What has gotten into you?

369
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:32,345
<i>No no no no! what?

370
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:33,521
<i>Come on, 
let's go back to the party.

371
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,106
<i>Come on, wait, 
let me just do my dress.

372
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:36,374
<i>Don't take that- no!

373
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:37,266
<i>Stop it! Stop it!

374
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:39,514
<i>Jan, no, no, no! Michael!

375
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:41,260
<i>No means please don't.

376
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,902
<i>Slam me up against the wall, 
right here.

377
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:44,676
<i>I'm not gonna slam you 
up against anything.

378
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,085
<i>Oh, please,

379
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,910
<i>- You're acting inappropriate.
- I want you so-

380
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,479
<i>- I'm acting inappropriate?
- Jan- yeah.

381
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,604
<i>Forget it, get out my way

382
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,642
- Here 
- Hey

383
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:59,117
Where have you been all night?

384
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:00,569
I was looking forward 
to hanging out with you.

385
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,699
I was...

386
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,205
Hey, don't you have a daughter?

387
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,045
Yes

388
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,669
Oh, good, you're up.

389
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,154
Hey, who makes this chair?

390
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:20,436
I don't know. 
It was here when I was born.

391
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:23,428
I want one.

392
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:25,451
Really good, 
solid construction.

393
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:26,367
It's comfortable.

394
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:28,823
What is this? Oak?

395
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:30,970
I don't know.

396
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:33,300
What do you know?

397
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:44,411
God, I hate these parties.

398
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,962
You wanna sneak out back 
and shoot some hoops?

399
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,101
Meet me outside in two minutes.

400
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:55,557
You stay here and have fun,

401
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,544
'cause I'm gonna go out back,
And shoot hoops with David Wallace.

402
00:15:58,544 --> 00:16:00,148
Okay.

403
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:03,714
Oh, um- don't mention that 
you and I are dating.

404
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,908
'cause I think he might 
still have feelings for me.

405
00:16:05,908 --> 00:16:06,969
Wallace?

406
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:08,903
What the hell!

407
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,768
Have you dated 
like every guy here?

408
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:17,898
Wow.

409
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:19,401
Okay.

410
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:20,674
You got me.

411
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:22,231
I so got you.

412
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,344
So, none of them.

413
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:24,713
Of course not.

414
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,708
I mean, you're kind of 
like, my first.

415
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,430
Really?

416
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:32,076
- Oh, my God, it's so easy
- Okay.

417
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:33,501
It's not even fun.

418
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:38,203
Hey, Jan.

419
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:39,459
Not too good.

420
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:45,619
Did you get a chance to try 
Michael's homemade potato salad?

421
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,203
<i>Rachel thinks that 
I brought homemade potato salad.

422
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:50,617
And I just picked it up 
at the supermarket.

423
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:51,628
It's funny,

424
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:53,804
I wish I could make 
potato salad that good.

425
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,565
It's just potatoes 
and mayonnaise.

426
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:57,449
There's something wrong with Jan.

427
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,584
What's, uh- 
what's with Jan and Michael?

428
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:05,212
I don't know.

429
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,155
Where to begin?

430
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:21,521
My ball.

431
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:23,592
<i>The chimney is in decent shape.

432
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:24,715
Not great,

433
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:26,864
I found some termite damage 
in a crawlspace

434
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:29,492
and some structural flaws 
in the foundation

435
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:31,762
so all in all...

436
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,239
it was a pretty fun 
cocktail party.

437
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:39,263
What?

438
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:41,902
I want us to make it.

439
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:43,891
I want a fresh start.

440
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,603
That's awesome.

441
00:17:45,603 --> 00:17:46,794
That's what I want.

442
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,140
Okay, but

443
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:50,279
In order for us to make it,

444
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,368
There can't be 
any secrets between us.

445
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,726
There- I didn't do anything.

446
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,615
Ask anybody,

447
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:57,514
I totally could've,
and I didn't at all.

448
00:17:57,514 --> 00:17:58,246
Just listen.

449
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,278
Remember that casino night

450
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:03,571
about a month before 
we were supposed to get married?

451
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:05,400
I kissed Jim.

452
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:07,387
What?

453
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,673
He told me how he felt,

454
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:10,584
and I guess I had feelings too,

455
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:11,789
and we kissed.

456
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:12,902
Jim came on to you?

457
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:13,699
Just listen.

458
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:14,915
No, I'm listening!

459
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,352
That's the problem I'm listening!

460
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:17,448
Don't yell.

461
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:18,891
Don't yell?

462
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,525
This is over.

463
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:26,784
Yeah, you're right, 
this is so over.

464
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:28,670
You kidding me, Pam!

465
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,790
Come on!

466
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,396
God!

467
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:36,234
Damn Jet Skis!

468
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:42,635
Our first fight.

469
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:48,490
If this is about 
what happened in the bathroom,

470
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:50,234
There was no place to cuddle.

471
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:51,385
I feel sick.

472
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:54,781
You didn't have 
any of the potato salad, did you?

473
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:57,517
You know, we were good 
when we were just running around.

474
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:58,803
You know, in secret.

475
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:00,271
It was wrong,
And it was exciting.

476
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:04,717
And maybe it was 
a mistake to take it public.

477
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:11,217
Well, if that's the way you feel,

478
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,783
My lady, then you have hurt me greatly.

479
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:15,464
- Michael 
- Greatly

480
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:16,858
Please don't cry.

481
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:18,231
I'm not going to cry.

482
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:20,892
I feel like it,
But I am not going to.

483
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:23,665
Why don't you just take 
your stupid love contract

484
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:26,944
- And tear it up into a million pieces?
- It was never a love contract, Michael.

485
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:28,567
And, besides, I've already 
given a copy to David.

486
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,525
And it would be just as embarrassing

487
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:32,435
- To get it back from him as it was handing it to him.
- I want the house, Jan!

488
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:33,807
I want the picket fence.

489
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,630
I want the ketchup fights,

490
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,028
And the tickling,

491
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:38,116
And the giggling.

492
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,068
I didn't mean it, okay?

493
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:44,763
- I was...
- Whatever.

494
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:46,328
I was tired, I am tired

495
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:47,582
And I didn't eat enough.

496
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:48,818
- You didn't mean it.

00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:50,441
