1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,214
Good morning, tiger.

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:10,761
I'm making you a big breakfast, so you
can keep up your strength for tonight.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,388
You're gonna get me
good and pregnant.

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,643
I've got nowhere to go this morning.
I'm unemployed.

5
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,728
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with my life.

6
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:23,023
Well, I just lost my erection.

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,901
No, I mean, what am I supposed
to do with myself?

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,403
You're supposed to find
your passion in life.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,364
You can be whatever you want
to be now. It's exciting.

10
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,659
Yeah, but it's all so overwhelming.
I don't know where to start.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,788
Wait a second.
I can help you with this.

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:42,250
You just need to be organized. We can
make a list of your qualifications...

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:48,214
...and categorize jobs by industry.
There could be folders and files...

14
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:52,886
Hey, this is where your hyper-organized
pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off.

15
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,180
I know!

16
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,724
My erection is back!

17
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,395

20
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,182
Thank you.

21
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,643
Joey, could I have a sip of your coffee
and a bite of your muffin?

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,313
- Okay.
- Thank you.

23
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,696
Thank you.

24
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,910
Pheebs, have you ever been bitten
by a hungry Italian?

25
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,830
I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm a little short on cash.

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,207
If you want,
I could loan you some money.

27
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,461
Oh, no. I learned never to
borrow money from friends.

28
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,882
That's why Richard Dreyfuss
and I don't speak anymore.

29
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:15,886
Hey, how about this?
Wanna be an extra on my show?

30
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,470
You could do that?

31
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,016
The pay's pretty good, and you
could do it for as long as you need.

32
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,645
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna be on TV!
- Okay, now...

33
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,607
I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't
as glamorous and exciting as you think.

34
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:32,528
- Really?
- No, it is awesome.

35
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,446
Hey, guys.

36
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,575
Why are you all dressed up?

37
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:43,122
We're bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren
today to introduce her to everyone.

38
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,499
- Doesn't she look cute?
- She sure does.

39
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,210
Why does she have a pink bow
taped to her head?

40
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,338
Because if one more person says,
"What a cute little boy"...

41
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,133
...I'm gonna whip them
with a car antenna.

42
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,927
I think she's gonna be
the hit of the office.

43
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:01,389
Yeah, she's gonna be hotter
than peasant blouses and A-line skirts.

44
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,976
Can I get a blue bow?

45
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,941
Okay. I have looked through
a bunch of career guides...

46
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,568
...photocopied and highlighted
key passages...

47
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:18,907
...and put them into alphabetical folders,
so you can make an informed decision.

48
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,243
How long was I in there?

49
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,038
Okay, let's start with the A's.
Advertising.

50
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:29,126
Wait. Advertising, that's a great idea.

51
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,796
Don't you wanna look through the rest?

52
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,676
I don't think I have to hear the rest.
Advertising makes perfect sense.

53
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,845
Sorry you had to waste all this time.

54
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:44,225
You call eight hours alone
with my label maker wasted time?

55
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,435
Now I'll get to use my shredder!

56
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:51,106
I mean, I could write slogans.
How hard could it be, right?

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,278
"Cheese. It's milk that you chew."

58
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:04,244
"Crackers. Because your cheese
needs a buddy."

59
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:09,208
"A grape. Because who can get
a watermelon in your mouth?"

60
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,376
I got one.

61
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:15,589
"Socks. Because your family's feet
deserve the best."

62
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,299
Honey, leave it to the pros.

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,760
I actually know someone in advertising.

64
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,889
I grew up with a guy who is
a vice president at a big agency.

65
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,809
Maybe I can get him to meet you.
Give me the phone.

66
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:32,105
"The phone. Bringing you closer
to people who have phones."

67
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,901
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."

68
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,784
That went well. Almost everybody
knew that she was a girl.

69
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,496
Yeah, after you punched that one guy
who got it wrong, word spread.

70
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,499
I'm just gonna go in my office
and pick up some stuff.

71
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,631
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

72
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,177
I'm the hell person
whose office this is.

73
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,554
Good one, Rach.

74
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,265
I'm Gavin Mitchell,
the person who's taking over your job.

75
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,642
Excuse me?

76
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,646
Your baby's so cute.

77
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,858
But why would you put
a pink bow on a boy?

78
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,157
Hey, Joey. Look at me.

79
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,825
I'm a nurse.

80
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,117
Yes, you are.

81
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,329
I think it might be time
for my sponge bath.

82
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,666
Sorry, I'm just so used
to hitting on the extras.

83
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:36,337
- So are you excited about your scene?
- Yeah, but I'm a little nervous.

84
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:40,215
Relax. Don't be. They'll probably
just make you stand in the background.

85
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,635
- Good.
- You. Here, come here. Here.

86
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,264
Take this tray, stand on this yellow mark.
You're gonna move on "action."

87
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,226
Walk over to the operating table, stop on
the blue mark and put the tray down.

88
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,020
Don't walk too fast.

89
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,189
But don't dawdle.

90
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,525
Okay. Now, what?

91
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,821
And, action!

92
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,411
Cut! Cut.

93
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:13,082
- I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
- Well, don't be.

94
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,085
Okay, that helps.

95
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,505
And, action!

96
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,676
Cut!

97
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:28,681
Don't worry about it, Pheebs.
It usually takes me three takes too.

98
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,098
All right, eight.

99
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:36,939
And, action!

100
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,918
So do you have any other
questions about advertising?

101
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,837
No. But let me show you what I can do.

102
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,882
"Bagels and doughnuts.

103
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:08,053
Round food for every mood."

104
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,765
Monica warned me you might do that.

105
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,519
I think we might have something
for you at the agency.

106
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,732
- Really? That's great.
- It's an unpaid internship.

107
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:26,363
That's funny. When you said "unpaid,"
it sounded like you said "unpaid."

108
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:30,993
Come on, now. Monica has a good job.
It's not like you have a family to support.

109
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,954
Actually, we're trying. I don't think
Monica is gonna want to postpone it.

110
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,124
We're supposed to have sex tonight.

111
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:42,004
Actually, she's probably at home,
naked right now.

112
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,842
I tend to keep talking
till somebody stops me.

113
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,514
- I can just picture her on the bed.
- Stop!

114
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,560
Wait. What do you mean
you're taking over my job?

115
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:00,105
While you were on your baby vacation,
I was doing your job.

116
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,442
A vacation? My idea
of a vacation does not involve...

117
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:07,905
...something sucking on my nipples
until they are raw.

118
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,451
Clearly, you've never been
to Sandals Paradise Island.

119
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:19,082
All right. Don't get too comfortable
there, because I'm back in two weeks.

120
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,918
I want everything back
the way it was.

121
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,504
I can't say I care too much for the way
you've rearranged my office.

122
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,549
I can't say I care too much
for that smell you've brought in.

123
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:33,097
- Excuse me?
- Rach, we have a code brown situation.

124
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,767
Honey, could you please
take care of it for me?

125
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:41,855
All right, but you're gonna
have to do one sometime.

126
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,775
Let me just get this straight.

127
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,320
So I go have a baby, and they send
some guy in to do my job?

128
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:52,574
Well, there was talk of shutting down
Ralph Lauren altogether.

129
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,952
Okay. Right.
You're very cheeky for a temp.

130
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,664
I'm not a temp. I was transferred here
from another department.

131
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,708
And what department was that?
The jerk department?

132
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,794
They didn't tell me
about your quick wit.

133
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,506
Well, did they mention that
I'm rubber and you're glue?

134
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:12,178
- Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
- Hi, Mr. Zelner.

135
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,221
Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.

136
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,432
When you left us, we weren't sure
what we were gonna do.

137
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,478
But then, Gavin to the rescue.
Super Gavin.

138
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,231
Well, that's great.

139
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,484
So now, Super Gavin,
when I come back...

140
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,821
...where do you plan on flying off to?

141
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,824
That's up to Mr. Zelner.
I'm sure he'll make the right decision.

142
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:38,078
Super ass-kissing power.

143
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,040
Incidentally, when are you coming back?

144
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,625
Today.

145
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,922
- You said two weeks.
- No, I said today.

146
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,051
See, for a superhero,
not so much with the listening.

147
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,473
So, what'd he say?

148
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,393
He can be a little rough
around the edges...

149
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,315
...so I'm gonna replace a word
he used a lot with the word "puppy."

150
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:12,947
So he said, "If your puppy friend
doesn't get her puppy act together...

151
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,158
...I am gonna fire
her mother-puppy ass."

152
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,036
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I'm just not an actor.

153
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,622
That's right. You're not.
You're a nurse.

154
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,292
- You're Nurse With Tray.
- No, Joey...

155
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,587
Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
She has no time for friends.

156
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:32,424
She gets in that operating room
and she carries that tray to the doctor...

157
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,551
...because if she doesn't, people die.

158
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,512
Who dies?

159
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,471
Man With Eye Patch!

160
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,057
Now, you get in there,
and you do your job.

161
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,310
Yes, doctor.

162
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,147
Okay, let's try this one more time.

163
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:51,694
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch.
Your tray is coming.

164
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,365
And, action.

165
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,622
Yes, I did it! I nailed it!

166
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,083
What's next?

167
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,711
The rest of the scene.

168
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,339
Okay, from the top, people.

169
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,558
Listen, sudden change of plans.
My maternity leave just ended.

170
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,435
They said if I didn't
come back today, they'd fire me.

171
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,479
What? No, that's illegal.

172
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,357
I'll have the Labor Department
here so fast, they won't...

173
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:36,238
All right, calm down, Norma Rae.
They didn't actually say that.

174
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:40,826
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,
this guy will try and squeeze me out.

175
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:44,038
But what about Emma?
I mean, we don't have a nanny.

176
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,291
I know. We're just gonna have
to figure out a plan tonight.

177
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,876
Can you please just take care
of her for today?

178
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,880
Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,
and we'll be on our way.

179
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,760
Come on.
I don't know what else to do.

180
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,597
Fine. Fine.

181
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,475
We'll have fun, won't we?
Yes, we will. Yes, we...

182
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,149
Ross.

183
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,902
You're pretty.

184
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:25,913
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be
starting a new career from scratch.

185
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,041
It's gonna be a while
before I make a living at it.

186
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,712
Maybe now's not the right time
to be starting a family.

187
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,509
So you have to tell Monica you don't
want to have a baby right now?

188
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,718
Yeah.

189
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,388
Goodbye.

190
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,521
Okay, it's baby time.
Pants off, Bing.

191
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,358
Didn't see you there, Geller.

192
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,320
Ross is here, so...

193
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,618
And I was really hoping
that maybe I could hang out.

194
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,872
You know, what do you feel like doing?

195
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,375
Well, we're gonna have sex.

196
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,713
I don't feel like having sex.

197
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,428
Maybe... I don't know. Maybe we
can watch a movie or something.

198
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,096
Let me put it this way:

199
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,807
We're having sex
whether you're here or not.

200
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,351
Pants off, Bing.

201
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:38,235
Now that I'm back, why don't you just
fill me in on what you've been up to.

202
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:42,406
Well, I've changed your screen saver
from that picture of *NS YNC.

203
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,366
Hey, they were popular when I left.

204
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,161
I'm working on this
big presentation for tomorrow.

205
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,914
I should be involved in that,
so get me up to speed.

206
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,959
That'll take weeks.
Let me take care of the presentation.

207
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,378
No. I see what you're
doing here, all right?

208
00:13:56,545 --> 00:14:00,966
This is my job, buddy. I've had it for
five years, and I know how it works.

209
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:05,262
- So why don't you just catch me up.
- Fine.

210
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,848
Oh, God. You've totally messed
with the back support on my chair.

211
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,351
- How do you fix this?
- You've been here five years.

212
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,314
- You figure it out.
- Fine, I will.

213
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,280
All right, fill me in.

214
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:34,124
Do you have a blue tie that would go
with this? Emma spit up on mine.

215
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,044
Yeah, but you have to give it back
if I get a job.

216
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,921
Of course, by that time,
ties will be obsolete...

217
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,258
...and we'll all be wearing
silver jumpsuits.

218
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,345
Hey, good morning, lover.

219
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:50,141
I gotta say, after last night,
I'm a little weak in the knees.

220
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:57,981
Here's an idea. You walk into a room,
take a quick scan.

221
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,652
Sorry.

222
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,615
But I kind of have this feeling that
we may have made a baby last night.

223
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:10,828
Oh, God, I have to tell you something.

224
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,788
You're not pregnant.

225
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,498
What are you talking about?

226
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,251
Well, that thing that I have to do
to make a baby?

227
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,586
I faked it.

228
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,715
What? You faked it?

229
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,967
You know what?

230
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,764
I don't need a tie.

231
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:35,769
I mean, it's better open collar,
you know?

232
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,773
It's more casual.

233
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:48,073
Joey. Listen, I can't do this.
It doesn't make any sense.

234
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,035
Yesterday I was a nurse,
and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?

235
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:55,706
Sometimes we use the same extras
for different parts. It's okay.

236
00:15:55,914 --> 00:16:00,585
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very
memorable performance as the nurse.

237
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:05,215
And now, suddenly, I'm the waitress?
That's gonna confuse my fans.

238
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:11,221
Well, maybe you are a nurse...

239
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,808
...but you moonlight as a waitress.

240
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,732
Because I'm a single mother
supporting my two children.

241
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,735
Nice.

242
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,696
Wait a minute.

243
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:32,409
Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the
same hospital. Wouldn't I come say hi?

244
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:36,705
No. No, see, you and Drake
are having a fight.

245
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,498
About what?

246
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,668
He slept with you
and then never called you.

247
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:47,048
And I just wanted a new daddy
for Davey and Becky.

248
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,678
Okay. Okay, from the top.

249
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,056
And, action.

250
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:57,476
So I'm surprised you agreed
to have lunch with me.

251
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:00,145
I'm surprised too. But yet, here I am.

252
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,066
Cut! Cut!

253
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,693
What are you doing?

254
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:10,072
I'm very angry at him because he slept
with me and never called me back.

255
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,282
- Me too.
- Me too!

256
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,827
Calm down. She means on the show.

257
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,622
We need some new extras
around here.

258
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,878
Wow. You're here already.

259
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:28,465
Yes. Emma and I came in a little early
to do research on the presentation.

260
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:32,219
Actually, I made a few changes.
I think I'm caught up on everything.

261
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,220
So ask me anything.

262
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:37,474
- How do you fix the chair?
- Except that!

263
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:43,022
Hello, Mr. Zelner. We are all ready
for our presentation this afternoon.

264
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:48,068
- Good, because it's in 10 minutes.
- What? I can't do that. I have the baby.

265
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,404
Ross is not gonna pick her up
for an hour.

266
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,406
Then Gavin can give the presentation.
We have to do it now.

267
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:57,202
Ralph needs to leave early today.
He's going helicopter shopping.

268
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,666
Well, there you go, you win.
You win.

269
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,795
You get to do the presentation.
You'll knock them dead.

270
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:09,756
No one will remember that I worked here,
and then Ralph will buy his helicopter...

271
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,469
...and Super Gavin will just fly
right alongside of him.

272
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,560
- You can do the presentation.
- No, I can't. I have a baby.

273
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,812
I'll watch her.

274
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,191
Why would you do that?

275
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:32,237
Because you worked really hard, and
it's your job. And you're a little crazy.

276
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,115
That's really nice.

277
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:39,245
I should tell you that crying women
make me very uncomfortable.

278
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,998
Well, you're not gonna like
what's coming.

279
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:48,087
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

280
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,130
God.

281
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,465
Thank you. Thank you.

282
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,851
I'm really fine. Don't worry.
I'm great with children.

283
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:15,823
Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.

284
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,535
Please don't fire my friend.
Just let me talk to her.

285
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,538
- Okay, but this is her last chance.
- Thank you.

286
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,957
How about I do something for you?

287
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:29,210
Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat,
cover up the bald.

288
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,218
Listen, Pheebs. I was just talking
to the director...

289
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:39,429
...and he was thinking maybe
this time you don't hit Drake.

290
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,014
You just wait on the tables.

291
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,226
I can't do that. I'm an actor.
I have a process.

292
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,854
You're a masseuse.
You have a table with a hole in it.

293
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,942
Wait, I see what's happening here.
You're threatened.

294
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,234
What?

295
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:56,864
I'm so good in the scene
that I'm stealing focus from you.

296
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:00,284
Rise to the challenge, Tribbiani,
because I just raised the bar.

297
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:01,702
Come join me up here.

298
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:10,127
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would
call security. She won't go easy.

299
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,966
You faked it?
You couldn't have faked it.

300
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:20,179
Yes, you can. You just make
the faces and the noises.

301
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,849
Guys can fake it?

302
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,936
Unbelievable.
The one thing that's ours.

303
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:32,482
Why would you fake it
when we're trying to have a baby?

304
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,360
Well, that's actually why.

305
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,447
Look, I'm starting
a whole new career now.

306
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,658
I'm not saying I don't want a baby.

307
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:44,286
I'm just saying maybe
we could wait a little while.

308
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:45,871
Like a month?

309
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:50,041
- Or a year?
- Really? You wanna wait a year?

310
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:53,337
It could be less than a year.
I mean, you've heard my stuff.

311
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:58,633
"Pants. Like shorts but longer."

312
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,806
Lt'll probably be more than a year.

313
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:11,313
- I really wanna have a baby.
- Well, yeah, me too.

314
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,361
Look, I'll just get my old job back.

315
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,988
No, I want you to have
a job that you love...

316
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,742
...not statistical analysis
and data reconfiguration.

317
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,661
I quit, and you learn what I do?

318
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:33,502
I think there's never gonna be
a right time to have a baby.

319
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,796
Now you're unemployed,
and in a little while...

320
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:39,049
...you'll find a new job
that'll keep you really busy.

321
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:41,844
There's always gonna be
a reason not to do this...

322
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,264
...but I think once the baby comes,
we'll forget about all those reasons.

323
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,476
I guess.

324
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,605
I mean, it's always gonna be scary
when we have a baby.

325
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,190
It's gonna be really scary.

326
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,318
I mean, God, when we have a baby...

327
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:02,031
...there's gonna be so much
that we're not able to control.

328
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:06,577
I mean, the apartment's
gonna be a mess.

329
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,538
I won't have time to clean it.

330
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,874
What if the baby gets
into the ribbon drawer...

331
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,710
...and messes up all the ribbons?

332
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:18,047
What if there's no room
for a ribbon drawer...

333
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,632
...because the baby's stuff
takes up all the space?

334
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,968
Where will all the ribbons go?

335
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:26,680
Should we go make a baby
before you change your mind?

336
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,682
- Yes, please!
- Okay.

337
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:31,727
And I promise I will not
fake it this time.

338
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:35,189
Well, I wish I could say the same.
I'm a little shook up.

339
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,446
I know you botched
that operation on purpose.

340
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:46,825
I can't prove it yet, but when I do,
you'll be going to jail for murder.

341
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,702
I don't care if you are my brother.

342
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,705
I'm not your brother.

343
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,999
What about my children, Drake?

344
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,126
No! No! No!

345
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,301
