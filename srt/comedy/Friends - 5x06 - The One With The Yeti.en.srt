1
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:11,679
None of that.
Not while you're under my roof!

2
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,766
Just because I know about you
doesn't mean I like looking at it.

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,311
Aren't you supposed to be
at an audition?

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,982
I'm sorry I'm not
a middle-aged black woman.

5
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:29,863
I'm also sorry if sometimes
I go to the wrong audition.

6
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,367
If I pretend to not know about you...

7
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:37,746
...then you pretend
there's nothing to know.

8
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,206
Sorry.

9
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,173
I can hear that!

10
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,510
Rachel's at work.

11
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:59,226
I can still hear you!

12
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,479
The One with the Yeti

13
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,026
What's that?

14
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:53,071
My mom sent me an heirloom
that belonged to my grandmother.

15
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,240
Can you believe it?

16
00:01:54,489 --> 00:02:00,120
A year ago I had no family,
and now I have heirlooms!

17
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,214
Oh, God!

18
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,218
Soft.

19
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,012
Is this mink?

20
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:22,601
Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?

21
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:27,147
I have a fine coat that no innocent
animals suffered to make.

22
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,483
Just Filipino kids who worked
their fingers bloody...

23
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,654
...for 12 cents an hour.

24
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,158
I made that up.

25
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,415
You can't put up flyers in here.

26
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,168
How come?
Everybody else does.

27
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,420
You can't.

28
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,549
What is that?

29
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,594
I'm getting rid of some things.

30
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,556
This is all of your things.

31
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,683
Yes, it is.

32
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,437
It's good. Emily thinks
we should get all new stuff.

33
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,648
Stuff that's just ours.
Together. Brand new.

34
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,943
So it's a get-rid-of-anything-
Rachel-ever-touched sale.

35
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,987
Touched, used, sat on, slept on...

36
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,366
I'll take it all.

37
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,034
You're okay with that?

38
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,120
If I can just do what Emily wants...

39
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,123
...and get her to New York,
it will be fine.

40
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,375
Isn't that a little extreme?

41
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,586
After what I did, can you blame her?

42
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,713
You got off easy.

43
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,757
When my friend's husband said
another name in bed...

44
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,887
...she cursed him
and turned his thingy green.

45
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,186
What is he doing?

46
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:52,232
Emily thinks Ross' furniture
has got Rachel cooties?

47
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,733
Calm down, Joey.

48
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,028
Everything's getting all messed up!

49
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,030
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

50
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,907
We won't stop seeing Rachel.

51
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,202
Hence, Ross stops seeing us.

52
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,621
I hate this.
Everything's changing.

53
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:10,042
We're losing Ross.
Joey said "hence".

54
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,174
I'm not happy about this either,
but if Ross says he's happy...

55
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,344
...then we have to keep
our feelings to ourselves.

56
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,472
Are you cool with that?

57
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,476
But, you know, I'm an actor.

58
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,104
I'll act cool.

59
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,988
Storage rooms give me the creeps.

60
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,950
Please hurry up, honey.

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,204
If you want little round waffles,
wait till I find the iron.

62
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,207
I want the little round waffles.

63
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,250
Here it is!

64
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,254
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

65
00:04:55,504 --> 00:05:01,218
Is the best place to put something
that cooks food underneath poison?

66
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,514
You know what?
I'll have toast.

67
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,645
Fog him! Fog him!

68
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,736
I don't know what to do
about this coat.

69
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,863
I'll take it.

70
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:24,074
That might work.

71
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,498
What do you think?

72
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,501
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.

73
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,213
No, it's just a bit sudden.

74
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,549
It's great, okay?
I am totally on board.

75
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,262
I love you too.
All right, bye.

76
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,474
What's the matter?

77
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,143
Nothing. No, actually...

78
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,020
...great news!

79
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,272
I just spoke with Emily...

80
00:05:55,522 --> 00:06:00,152
...and looks like I'm moving
to a new apartment.

81
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,153
Why?

82
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,990
Her thought is, and I agree...

83
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,453
...fresh new furniture,
why not a fresh new apartment?

84
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,580
Her cousin has a place to sublet.

85
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,583
It's got a view
of the river and Columbia.

86
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,127
That's way uptown!
That's three trains away...

87
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,879
...which is great!

88
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,841
I love to ride that rail.

89
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,677
You're okay with this?

90
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,555
It's kind of far from work...

91
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,808
...but I'll get so much done
on the commute.

92
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,271
I've been given the gift of time.

93
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:39,734
That's so funny. Last Christmas
I got the gift of space.

94
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:44,696
We should get them together
and make a continuum.

95
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,659
Now he's moving?

96
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,996
Man, what is Emily doing to him?

97
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,542
He's not even here!

98
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,043
You guys!

99
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,963
We were in the storage area,
and we saw this creepy man.

100
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,384
It was this crazy-eyed,
hairy beast-man.

101
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:10,055
It was like a Big Foot
or a yeti or something.

102
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,808
He came at us,
so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.

103
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:17,980
I pulled the tab
and I just fogged his yeti ass.

104
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,734
Like, dark hair, bushy beard?

105
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,737
Yeah, you fogged Danny.

106
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,073
Please! We did not fog Danny.

107
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,283
Who's Danny?

108
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:31,785
Danny just moved in.

109
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:36,831
He just got back from a four-month
trek in the Andes. Nice fella.

110
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,168
He's nice.
You know, you always...

111
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,632
...stick up for the people we fog.

112
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:59,312
You might not remember us,
but we're the girls that fogged you.

113
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:03,192
We're really sorry we fogged you.

114
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,160
Just so you know,
we didn't mean to fog you.

115
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,123
We thought you were
like a yeti or something.

116
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:29,969
Sorry to bother you, but we can't
accept your acceptance of our apology.

117
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:34,557
It doesn't really seem
like you mean it.

118
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,105
That guy is so rude!

119
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,732
Really!
What is with that guy?

120
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,693
You'd forgive me if I fogged you?

121
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,321
You did, a little bit.

122
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,240
Oh, my God, honey.
I'm so sorry.

123
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:56,078
- I totally forgive you.
- Really?

124
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,712
You know my friend Chris
who owns the crematorium?

125
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,798
Crematorium Chris? Sure.

126
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,718
He said he would cremate
my fur coat for free...

127
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:17,016
...if I bring in the next person
I know who dies.

128
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,189
Oh, my God.
Look at these pelts!

129
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,902
Don't get too attached.
She's having it cremated.

130
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:34,783
You're quirky, and I get a big kick
out of it. We all do.

131
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,327
But if you destroy
a coat like this...

132
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,956
...that is like a crime
against nature.

133
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,625
Not nature. Fashion!

134
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,252
This is fashion?

135
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,838
So to you, death is fashion?

136
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,172
That's funny.

137
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,759
Here's Phoebe...

138
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,304
...sporting cutting edge
hairy carcass...

139
00:09:55,554 --> 00:10:00,726
...from, you know, the steel traps
of wintry Russia.

140
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,479
You really think this looks good?

141
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:07,066
Because I do!

142
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,490
I miss you too.
I can't wait to see you.

143
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,533
I love you. Bye.

144
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,827
What is in here, rocks?

145
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,122
No, it's my collection
of fossil samples.

146
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,584
So, rocks.

147
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,719
I'll miss this apartment.

148
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:40,599
You know, Ben took his first steps
right over there.

149
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:46,021
Remember when I ran into this
and it knocked me out?

150
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,898
I love this place.

151
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,652
To tell the truth,
I wish I didn't have to move.

152
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:56,365
Are you saying that you're not
entirely happy about this?

153
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,076
If Emily gave me a choice...

154
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,703
You do have a choice!

155
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:06,625
Why are you listening to her?
Are you crazy?

156
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,838
It's not right what Emily wants
you to do. She's totally...

157
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,132
Stop pinching me!

158
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:18,345
You guys said to keep my mouth shut
if Ross was happy, right?

159
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:23,600
He just told me
that he's not entirely happy.

160
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,727
What's going on?

161
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,647
We all hate Emily!

162
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,901
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.

163
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,029
We just think that
you're having to sacrifice...

164
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,742
...a whole lot to make her happy.

165
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:44,496
We just think that maybe
she's being a little unreasonable.

166
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,873
Yes, unreasonable.

167
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,293
Unreasonable?

168
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:53,297
How about we have this conversation
when one of you marries?

169
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,884
You have no idea what it takes
to make a marriage work.

170
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,720
It's compromise.
Do you always like it? No.

171
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,013
Do you do it? Yes.

172
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:04,558
Because it's not all laughing,
happy, candy in the sky...

173
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,393
...coffee at Central Perk.

174
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,061
It's real life, okay?

175
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:13,025
It's what grownups do.

176
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,657
I think he's right.

177
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:24,495
You guys hang out at
the coffeehouse way too much.

178
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,295
- I feel so guilty about Ross.
- I know.

179
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:37,424
I kind of feel like it's my fault.

180
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,219
Kind of?

181
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,222
You should have kept this to yourself.

182
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:49,561
I'm keeping so many things to myself,
something was bound to slip out!

183
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,898
I think it's very brave
what you said.

184
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:58,237
I can't sit here any more.
I have to walk places.

185
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:02,741
What's with the coat?
How about the animal rights thing?

186
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,452
I've been reading up,
and for your information...

187
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,080
...minks aren't very nice.

188
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,168
Okay, I admit it.
I love this coat, okay?

189
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:17,839
It's the best thing I ever had wrapped
around me, including Phil Huntley.

190
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,261
Remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine.

191
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,029
So you like the short hair better?

192
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,992
Yeti? Danny?

193
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,162
I had to cut my hair to get rid of...

194
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,706
...the fogger smell.

195
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,543
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I would have never fogged you...

196
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:58,422
...if you hadn't looked so...

197
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,426
Absolutely. Some people
are just into appearances.

198
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,510
What?

199
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,595
It's cool.

200
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,598
No, that is not cool.

201
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,308
You don't even know me.

202
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:13,270
You got the shopping bags
and the Saks catalogue.

203
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,857
From that, you've got me
all figured out?

204
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,275
Well, you don't.

205
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:23,530
You know, I could have toys
for underprivileged kids in here.

206
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,073
Do you?

207
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:30,454
You know, if kids like to play
with capri pants.

208
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,168
Stop saying that.
I hate that!

209
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,849
I judged you.
I made a snap judgment.

210
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:54,352
But you did it too, and you're worse.
You're sticking to your judgement.

211
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,940
You can't even open your mind to see
you might be wrong.

212
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,526
What does that say about you?

213
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:04,280
That pizza place
across the street any good?

214
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,449
I'm hungry.
You want some pizza?

215
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,701
You can keep yelling.

216
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:16,333
Stop saying that.
I hate that.

217
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,840
Are you still mad?

218
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,593
Good! We have an "I'm Sorry" song.

219
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,596
You know what?
I'm not in the mood.

220
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,015
Look, Ross.

221
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:35,394
I feel really bad.
You're going through all this stuff...

222
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,771
...and I just acted like a jerk.

223
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:42,776
- We are so sorry.
- You're stepping on the song.

224
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,696
We were way out of line, all right?
We totally support you.

225
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,158
Whatever you decide,
whatever you do.

226
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:52,494
Now you're just taking lines
out of the song.

227
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:57,374
This is hard enough, okay?
I really need you guys right now.

228
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,753
Yes, exactly! And that's why...

229
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:08,052
Why don't you come over tonight,
and I'll make your favorite dinner.

230
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,180
Thanks, you guys.

231
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,849
Are you wearing fur?

232
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,101
Let's get some perspective, people.

233
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:21,189
It's not like I'm wearing
a seeing-eye dog coat!

234
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:28,238
You know, I think I kind of
understand why I lost it today.

235
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,990
You do, huh?

236
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,158
You see...

237
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,452
...I'm an actor, right?

238
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,748
So I got to keep my emotions
right at the surface.

239
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:42,544
I got a lot of balls in the air,
you know?

240
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:48,842
It's tough. Guys like me,
you wander around, you're alone.

241
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,387
What are you talking about?

242
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:55,808
I'm not sure.

243
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,352
Look at you!
Where have you been?

244
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,229
I went to have pizza.

245
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,439
With Danny.

246
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,648
What happened?

247
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,027
That yeti is one smooth talker.

248
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,071
I hope you're not full.
Dinner's almost ready.

249
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:13,408
I think I'll probably
just hang out in my room.

250
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,702
Why?

251
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,203
Come on, you guys!

252
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:21,917
If Emily knew I was having dinner
with you, she'd flip out.

253
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,379
It's okay.
I really don't mind.

254
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,423
Wait, wait. You know what?
Just stay.

255
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,593
Please.

256
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:34,764
It would mean a lot for me
if you stay.

257
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,806
Ross, I just...

258
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:41,061
Please, just have dinner with us!

259
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,646
Settle down.

260
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,357
All right. I'm sorry.

261
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:49,194
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.

262
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:56,743
Hey, look!
Ugly naked guy's back.

263
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,371
We haven't seen him in so long.

264
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:04,626
Oh, God! I really missed
that fat bastard.

265
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,463
This is so weird.

266
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:13,219
I realized this may be
the last time we hang out together.

267
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:16,930
It's almost as if he knew.

268
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,102
I'll get it.

269
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,566
Hi, Emily.

270
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,653
You tracked him down.
Hold on.

271
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:38,410
Yeah, we're just having dinner.

272
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,162
Sure, hold on.

273
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:43,540
She wants to say hi.

274
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,460
Hi, Emily!

275
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,128
Hello, everyone.

276
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,422
So who am I saying hello to?

277
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,466
Well, I don't know
about who's here...

278
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:58,972
...but I can tell you who's not here,
and that's Rachel!

279
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:05,104
<i>I should hope not.</i>
<i>Ross knows better than that by now.</i>

280
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,775
You know what?
Rachel is here.

281
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,527
<i>She's there?</i>

282
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:15,322
Oh, yeah, there she is!

283
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,450
She's here.

284
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,994
Take me off speakerphone.

285
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,997
How could you do this to me?

286
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:27,126
I made my feelings about Rachel
perfectly clear.

287
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:31,463
I'm just having dinner
with my friends, okay?

288
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,925
- You can't keep away from her.
<i>- That's ridiculous.</i>

289
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:39,346
I'm moving for you. I'm cutting
friends out of my life for you.

290
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,892
Please, get on the plane
and come to New York, okay?

291
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,478
<i>You're the only one</i>
<i>I want to be with.</i>

292
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:52,525
I'll feel better when I'm there.
I can know where you are all the time.

293
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:58,573
You can't know where I am
all the time.

294
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:04,037
This marriage will never work
if you don't trust me.

295
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,249
You're right.

296
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,254
Can you trust me?

297
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,640
I think it's going okay.

298
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,141
Looks like he's smiling.

299
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,853
How can you tell?
You can only see his back.

300
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,813
You can totally tell!

301
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,399
Here, look, watch me.

302
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:33,608
Smile.

303
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,652
Frown. Smile.

304
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:36,987
Frown.

305
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,865
Smile.

306
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,004
I guess that's it.

307
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,798
Why? What happened?

308
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,427
My marriage is over.

309
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:04,849
Look at you, you're shivering.

310
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,934
Here.

311
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,399
Honey, is there anything we can do?

312
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:22,115
You can help me
get my furniture back from Gunther.

313
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:44,972
Stop tormenting me!

314
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:49,185
This is mink, okay? They're mean,
and they hate squirrels.

315
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:53,980
Most of these probably
wanted to be coats.

316
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,483
Fine. No, I get it.

317
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,276
Here.

318
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,195
You take it.

319
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,324
Are you happy now?
I'm cold!
