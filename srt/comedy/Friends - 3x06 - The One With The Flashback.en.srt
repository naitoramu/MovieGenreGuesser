00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,690
Janice has a question.
Who of the six of you. . .

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,530
. . .has slept with
who of the six of you?

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,880
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,210
I'm sorry, the answer there
would be none of us.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,890
Over the years, none of you
ever got drunk and stupid?

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,600
Well, that's really
a different question.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,840
I can't believe a group of people
who spends this much time together. . .

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,000
. . .has never bumped uglies.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,450
There was that one time
Monica and Rachel got together.

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,280
What?

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,010
Excuse me, there was no "time. "

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,600
Okay, but let's say there was.

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,490
How might that go?

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,720
Well then answer me this:

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,810
Have any of you ever almost. . .?

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,210
-Anybody need more coffee?
-Hey, there's a dog out there!

17
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,040
The One With the Flashback

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,280
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

19
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,410
-That is so unfortunate.
-What?

20
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,170
Cute Naked Guy's
starting to put on weight.

21
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,600
I'll be back in just a minute.

22
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks
on the phone.

23
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,600
You didn't leave lipstick marks
on the phone.

24
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,490
Then it must have been you. Bye.

25
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,560
Bye-bye.

26
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,690
-That's why I moved out.
-Hey, while we're on that. . .

27
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,370
. . .when are you gonna tell my sister
you don't live here anymore?

28
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,720
On some level, she already knows.

29
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,330
She doesn't know you sneak out
every night. . .

30
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,210
. . .and back every morning. . .

31
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,530
. . .and that you've been
at your grandmother's for a week.

32
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.

33
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,810
I'm never gonna find a roommate.
Ever.

34
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,920
Nobody good?

35
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,640
There was the guy with the ferrets.

36
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,680
That's plural.

37
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,450
The spitter. And the guy
who enjoyed my name so much. . .

38
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,210
. . .he made a noise
every time he said it.

39
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,010
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.
Bing! "

40
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,440
"Great apartment, Chandler Bing.
Bing! "

41
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,520
-How many more tomorrow?
-Two.

42
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,920
This photographer
who seemed really dull. . .

43
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,840
. . .and this actor guy
who I'm not sure about.

44
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,450
When I answered
the phone "Chandler Bing" . . .

45
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,960
. . .he said, "Whoa! Short message! "

46
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,200
Foot on the floor
or come over no more:

47
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,120
Your dresser is missing,
but this she notices.

48
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,440
-What?
-I have to go.

49
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,450
Carol should be home by now, so. . . .

50
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,210
-How's it going with you guys?
-Better, actually.

51
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,400
I finally figured out why we're
having so much trouble.

52
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,050
-Oh, really?
-Yeah. You know how I have you guys?

53
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,200
She doesn't have any close
friends that are just hers.

54
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,400
But last week, she met this woman
at the gym, "Susan" something.

55
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,130
And they really hit it off, and
I think it's gonna make a difference.

56
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,210
So, Eric. . .

57
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,450
. . .what kind of photography do you do?

58
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,080
Oh, mostly fashion.

59
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,050
There may be models here sometimes.
I hope that's cool.

60
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,650
Yes, that is cool.

61
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,650
Because I have models here,
you know. . .

62
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,690
: : :never:

63
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,730
During the summer I spend most
weekends at my sister's beach house. . .

64
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,680
. . .which you're welcome to use.

65
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,000
Although I should tell you,
she's a porn star.

66
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,400
Well, I still have
one more person to meet.

67
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,400
But unless it turns out
to be your sister. . .

68
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,160
. . .I think your chances
are pretty good.

69
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,010
All right.

70
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,010
Bedroom, bathroom, living room.

71
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,890
This here is the kitchen,
and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.

72
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,970
Don't you wanna ask me
any questions?

73
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,410
Sure.

74
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,520
What's up?

75
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,800
Well, I'm an actor.

76
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,490
I'm fairly neat.

77
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,240
I got my own Tv.

78
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally
okay with the gay thing.

79
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,840
What gay thing?

80
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,650
Just, you know, in general.
The whole "people-being-gay" thing.

81
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,370
Totally cool with that.

82
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,410
Okay, Jerry.
Thanks for stopping by.

83
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,280
Oh, my God!

84
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,730
Hey, Mon.

85
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,810
-Wanna hear something that sucks?
-Do I ever!

86
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,650
-Chris says they're closing the bar.
-No way!

87
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,010
They're turning it into
a coffee place.

88
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,610
Just coffee?

89
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,810
-Where are we gonna hang out?
-You got me.

90
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,480
-Can I get a beer?
-Did you pick a roommate?

91
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,570
-You bet.
-Is it the ltalian guy?

92
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,890
Yeah, right.

93
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,450
He's so cute.

94
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,330
That's what I want.
A roommate I can walk around with. . .

95
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,800
. . .and be referred to
as "the funny one. "

96
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,600
Table's free. Rack them up.
Back in a minute.

97
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,010
Get ready for me to whip your butt.

98
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,010
Okay, but after that,
we're shooting some pool.

99
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,080
Excuse me? Hello? Hi.

100
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,450
My friend ordered an onion. . .

101
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,410
. . .not an olive.

102
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,410
And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke. . .

103
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,730
. . .which I don't think this is.

104
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,080
-I am so sorry.
-That's all right.

105
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,360
How hard is it to get a couple
drinks right, huh?

106
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,000
I would like to propose a toast. . .

107
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,650
. . .to the woman who, in one year
from today, will become. . .

108
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,880
. . .Mrs. Dr. Barry Barber, D.D.S.

109
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,410
I think it's time
to see the ring again.

110
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,050
Isn't it exciting? I mean,
it's like having a boyfriend for life!

111
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,930
Yeah. I know.

112
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,800
What?

113
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,960
Oh, I don't know.

114
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,570
Well, maybe it's just the idea. . .

115
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,250
. . .of Barry for the rest of my life.

116
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,800
I don't know, I think l. . . .

117
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,930
I feel like having
one last fling. . .

118
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,000
. . .just to sort of get it
out of my system.

119
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,640
-Rachel, stop!
-You're so bad!

120
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,520
I'm serious. I really think
I need to just have. . .

121
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,810
. . .some meaningless sex,
you know?

122
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,650
With the next guy I see.

123
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,010
Excuse me, I seem to have
dropped my ball.

124
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,960
Yeah, so?

125
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,800
And now I've picked it up again.

126
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,650
My God!
I went to high school with her.

127
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,200
Look! Hi! What do you think?

128
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,650
Oh, my God!

129
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,410
You can't even see
where the Titanic hit it.

130
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,370
Yes, his name is Barry.
He's a doctor, thank you very much.

131
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,040
Just like you always wanted.
Congratulations.

132
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,920
Thank you. So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

133
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,490
Not right now.

134
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,370
Oh, well, that's okay.

135
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,530
I know.

136
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,210
So I think I'll get back
to my friend.

137
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,690
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

138
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,280
Can we have lunch
the next time I'm in the city?

139
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,600
That'd be great.

140
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,210
-Okay.
-Thanks.

141
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,480
Ten bucks says I never see
that woman again in my life.

142
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,530
No, honey, really. It's fine.

143
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,570
Just. . .

144
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,240
. . .go with Susan.

145
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,530
Really, I think--

146
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,690
I think girls' night out
is a great idea.

147
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,250
Okay. Okay. Bye.

148
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,000
-What are they doing?
-I don't know. Something girly.

149
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,920
Hey, you're early.

150
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,000
What are you doing with the lamp?

151
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,320
Just taking it to get rewired.

152
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,610
Don't take it where you took the
stereo. They've had that over a week.

153
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,130
Mr. Heckles, no one is making
any noise up here.

154
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,930
You're disturbing my oboe practice.

155
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,280
-You don't play the oboe.
-I could play the oboe.

156
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,000
Then I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep it down.

157
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,040
Who are you?

158
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,880
-I'm Eric, Chandler's new roommate.
-I'm Chandler's new roommate.

159
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,570
-I don't think so.
-I could be Chandler's new roommate.

160
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,040
-But he told me over the phone--
-He told me in person.

161
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,250
That's weird.

162
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,560
I'm going to go into
my new apartment now.

163
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,010
Hi again.

164
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,050
Thank you so much.

165
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,490
Don't thank me.
Thank the jerk that never showed up.

166
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,840
Okay, I gotta get to work.

167
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,250
-You want some help?
-No, thanks. I got it.

168
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,330
No, I don't!

169
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,000
You okay?

170
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,610
I stood up too fast.
Got a little head rush.

171
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,840
It's the heat.

172
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,640
And the humidity.

173
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,240
That's. . .

174
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,210
. . .a tough combination.

175
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,640
Do you want to come in
for some lemonade?

176
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,520
Like you wouldn't believe.

177
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,280
This is a great place.

178
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,560
Thank you.

179
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,610
Just make yourself comfortable.

180
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,690
Gotcha.

181
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,200
So this place is really
my grandmother's.

182
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,000
I got it when she moved to Florida.
Otherwise I could never afford it.

183
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,810
So if the landlord ever asks. . .

184
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,610
. . .I'm an 87-year-old woman who's
afraid of her vCR. You thirsty?

185
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,810
You bet I am!

186
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,090
Okay. . .

187
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,810
. . .here's your penis!

188
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,730
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

189
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,610
You said, "You wanna come in
for some lemonade?"

190
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,040
So?

191
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,000
Were you just gonna give me lemonade?

192
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,440
Cover yourself up!

193
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,090
Oh, right. Sorry.

194
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,800
God, I don't believe this!

195
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,610
Someone asks you in for lemonade
and that means they want to have sex?

196
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,610
Usually, yeah.
Well, not just lemonade.

197
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,880
Iced tea, sometimes juice.

198
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,760
Look, sorry. I just--

199
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,640
I thought you liked me.

200
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,640
I'm such a jerk.

201
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,760
It's okay.

202
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,320
I suppose it could happen to anyone.

203
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,160
Not anyone I know, but. . . .

204
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,290
By the way, I can still see it.

205
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,930
Where's your bed?

206
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,130
It's not in the apartment?

207
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,970
I can't believe this
is happening again.

208
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,400
-What?
-Okay, enough with the third degree!

209
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,490
I don't live here anymore.

210
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,050
-What are you talking about?
-I'm sorry.

211
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,010
I don't live here anymore.

212
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,800
I didn't know how to tell you.
But, you know, everybody else knows.

213
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,120
Everybody knows?

214
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,570
That was supposed to be a good thing.
I forget why.

215
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,330
Do you know I couldn't sleep
for a month. . .

216
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,800
. . .because I got a dot of ink
on one of the sofa cushions?

217
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,520
You could've just turned
the cushion over.

218
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,650
I would have, but I had
a spaghetti stain on the other side.

219
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,890
What?

220
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,930
This is what I'm talking about.

221
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,400
I need to live in a land
where people can spill!

222
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,210
Well, you can spill.

223
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,090
In the sink.

224
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,960
Oh, honey. It's not your fault,
you know. This is who you are.

225
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,000
And I love you.
And I want us to be friends.

226
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,810
And if I stay here,
I don't see that happening.

227
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,160
-I love you too.
-Good.

228
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,370
What?

229
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,520
What? I'm just sad.

230
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,810
No, you're not.
You're wondering which cushion it is.

231
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,360
So what are you watching?

232
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,570
Baywatch.

233
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,040
What's it about?

234
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,040
Lifeguards.

235
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,250
Well, it sounds kind of stup--

236
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,770
Who's she?

237
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,360
Nicole Eggert.

238
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,410
We like her.

239
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,810
Wow! Look at them run!

240
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,410
They do that a lot.

241
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,840
Hey, you want a beer?

242
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,920
-I'll get one.
-Don't get up. I got a cooler here.

243
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,400
Do you have any beers?
We're out of beers.

244
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,410
Help yourself.

245
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,290
You okay?

246
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,170
Phoebe moved out.

247
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,520
Right.

248
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,240
I don't understand.

249
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,800
Am I so hard to live with?
ls this why I don't have a boyfriend?

250
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,930
You don't have a boyfriend because. . . .

251
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,600
I don't know why
you don't have a boyfriend.

252
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,090
You should have a boyfriend.

253
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,570
I think so.

254
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,760
Come here.

255
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,960
Come here.

256
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,610
Listen, you are one
of my favorite people. . .

257
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,800
. . .and the most beautiful woman
I've ever known in real life.

258
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,130
Where is everybody?

259
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:46,290
It's already closed. Chris gave me
the keys to lock up. What is wrong?

260
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,280
I think my marriage. . .

261
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,800
. . .is kind of over.

262
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,010
Oh, no! Why?

263
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,250
Because Carol's a lesbian.

264
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,130
And I'm not one.

265
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,720
And apparently it's not
a mix-and-match situation.

266
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,920
Oh, my God!

267
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,730
I don't believe it!

268
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,600
Oh, you poor bunny.

269
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,450
I'm an idiot.

270
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,000
I mean, I should have seen it.

271
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:26,050
I mean, Carol and I would be out,
and she'd see some beautiful woman. . .

272
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,330
. . .and she'd be "Ross! Look at her! "

273
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,970
And I'd think. . .

274
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,760
. . . "God, my wife is cool. "

275
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,600
Hey, do you think that Susan person
is her lover?

276
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,170
Well, now I do!

277
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,010
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,130
Seven years!

279
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,800
I mean, we've been together
seven years:

280
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,010
She's the only woman
who's ever loved me.

281
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,720
She's the only woman I've ever. . . .

282
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,120
This is nice.

283
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,930
I know. It is, isn't it?

284
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,570
No, I mean it.
This feels really good.

285
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,000
Is it 1 00%%% cotton?

286
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,280
And I got it on sale too.

287
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,450
I should go.

288
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,730
One of the lifeguards was just about
to dismantle a nuclear device.

289
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,800
If you want to get
a drink later, we can.

290
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,410
That sounds great.

291
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,970
Oh, and listen, it's gonna be--

292
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,330
I know.

293
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,280
Thanks.

294
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,370
Maybe this wouldn't have happened
if I'd been more nurturing. . .

295
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,160
. . .or I'd paid more attention. . .

296
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,240
. . .or I had a uterus.

297
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,810
-I can't believe it.
-I know.

298
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,250
You know, you don't deserve this.
You don't, Ross.

299
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,130
-You're so good.
-Thanks.

300
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,010
And you're so sweet.

301
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,600
-Thanks.
-And you're kind.

302
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,010
Thanks.

303
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,850
Come here.

304
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,080
Wait, wait, wait.

305
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,010
It's okay.

306
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,320
Wait, wait, wait!
My foot is stuck in the pocket.

307
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,480
-What?
-I can't get it out.

308
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,370
That's not something
a girl wants to hear.

309
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,330
Come on, don't start.

310
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,810
What?

311
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,410
Stupid balls are in the way.

312
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,330
Oh, well.

313
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,520
That probably wouldn't have been
the most constructive solution.

314
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,210
You have chalk on your face.

315
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,530
You're right. I don't know why
I always thought this was real grass.

316
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,810
Honey, you okay?

317
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,010
My wife's a lesbian.

318
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,210
Cool!

319
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,720
Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.

320
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,730
I can't believe you came back.

321
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,480
Don't say anything.

322
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,040
I don't wanna speak.
I don't wanna think.

323
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,850
I just want you to take me and kiss me
and make love to me right here. . .

324
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,320
. . .right now.

325
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,160
You missed the exit.

326
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:31,810
Sorry.

327
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,800
My God, what were you thinking about?

328
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,320
Barry.
