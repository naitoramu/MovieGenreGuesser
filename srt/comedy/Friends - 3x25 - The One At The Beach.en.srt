1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,520
So your first sexual experience
was with a woman?

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,840
I was 1 5.
It was my best friend, Ruth.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,360
And we got drunk on that hard cider.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,250
And then suddenly,
we were making out.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,240
Tell it again.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,600
Seriously.

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,070
Can that woman talk
about anything else but sex?

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,240
Yeah, sure. Earlier she was
talking about geography.

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,440
She was listing the countries
she's done it in.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,080
I think we all
learned something.

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,760
Hey, you guys! Look what I found!

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,880
That's my mom's writing. Look.

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,840
"Me and Frank and Phoebe,
graduation, 1 965. "

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,320
-Do you know what that means?
-That you're actually 50?

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,690
That's not "me" Phoebe.
That's her pal, Phoebe.

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,200
According to her yearbook,
they were BFF.

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,000
Best Friends Forever.

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,960
That's great!

19
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,200
I know! She probably has all kinds
of stories about my parents.

20
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,080
She might know where my dad is.

21
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,280
I looked her up.
She lives by the beach.

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,560
Maybe this weekend we can
go there.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,760
-Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.
-That's too bad.

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,000
Big fat bummer.

25
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,840
So tomorrow we'll drive out
to Montauk.

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,920
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,400
The One At the Beach

28
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,600
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

29
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,040
Would you look at them?

30
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,160
I'm never gonna find
a boyfriend again.

31
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,640
I'm gonna die an old maid.

32
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,040
You're not gonna die an old maid.

33
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,710
Maybe an old spinster cook.

34
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,280
-Thanks.
-Besides, worse comes to worse. . .

35
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,240
. . .I'll be your boyfriend.

36
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,440
Yeah, right.

37
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,320
Why is that so funny?

38
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,480
You made a joke, right?

39
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,210
So I laughed.

40
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,160
A little too hard.

41
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,280
Am I not boyfriend material?

42
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,000
You're Chandler.

43
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,240
You know. Chandler!

44
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,600
Okay, so we've established
my name, and hit me.

45
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,080
But say we weren't friends.
Say it's a blind date.

46
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,680
I show up at your door and I'm,
like, "Hey, nice to meet you. "

47
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,040
I'd probably be scared of a guy
using a fake voice.

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,920
Oh, good. You bought food.

49
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,040
No, just my luggage.

50
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,360
I am having the best karma this week.

51
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,480
I find this woman
who knew my parents. . .

52
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,640
. . .and then my client
gives me his beach house.

53
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,490
What about that bike
messenger you hit?

54
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

55
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,840
Hey, check out the hat!

56
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,920
Wait a minute, I know that hat.

57
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,090
I was taken aboard that hat.

58
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,520
They did experiments on me.

59
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,050
I can't have children!

60
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,440
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

61
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,840
Ross gave it to me.

62
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,160
I think she looks good.

63
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,760
Did he buy it for you. . .

64
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,520
. . .or win it for you?

65
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,280
Excuse me,
my fashion-impaired friends. . .

66
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,440
. . .I'm here to tell you
hats are back.

67
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,240
And this time, they've ganged up
and formed one giant super-hat.

68
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,160
Go, go, go!

69
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,480
Now everybody wants to be
under the hat!

70
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,480
What's with all this sand?

71
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,160
Bob said there might be flood damage.

72
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,520
Either that or he has
a really big cat.

73
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,160
It's kind of an unusual house.

74
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,040
It has three beautiful bedrooms
and no baths.

75
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,240
But, you know, the ocean
is right there.

76
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,040
Knock, knock, knock.

77
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,360
Hang on.
Come in, come in.

78
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,520
Think about it and call me back.

79
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,480
Are you Phoebe Abbott?

80
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,800
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott!
I'm your best friend's daughter!

81
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,350
You're lrwin's daughter?

82
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,280
I mean your old best friend.
Here.

83
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,840
-Lily? From high school? Remember?
-Oh, God, Lily. Yes.

84
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,000
Of course I remember Lily.

85
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,720
Then you must be--

86
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,290
Phoebe, Phoebe.

87
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,120
She named me after you, I guess.

88
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,090
Wow. Well.
Look, there's Frank!

89
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,880
Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!

90
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,240
That's my dad. That's Frank!

91
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,840
I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.

92
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,680
Take it easy.
If you want, there's cookies.

93
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,650
Or sangria! I could make sangria!

94
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,800
Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

95
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,000
Anyway, I've been
looking for my father.

96
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,440
-Have you heard from him or seen him?
-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

97
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,840
I lost track of everybody
after high school.

98
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,040
Well, so tell me everything
about my parents. Everything.

99
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,280
Oh, well, you know,
we were always together.

100
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,840
-The other kids had a nickname for us.
-What was it?

101
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,480
The Three Losers.

102
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,650
Oh, poor Lily.

103
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,640
I heard what happened. That must
have been just terrible for you. . .

104
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,680
. . .Iosing your mother that way.

105
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,480
Yeah, no, it was great.

106
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,120
You know what a really good
rainy-day game is?

107
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,040
I mean, naked game.

108
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,840
We should play strip poker.

109
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,240
Are you crazy?

110
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,200
Come on. When you go away,
you have to play. It's, like, a law.

111
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,160
-All done.
-Thank you.

112
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,120
Okay. Who's next?

113
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,950
No way!

114
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,160
Come on, please. I'm bored.
You let me do it once before.

115
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,440
Well, if that's the rule
this weekend. . . .

116
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,120
-Get away.
-Take it like a man. Come on!

117
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,000
Big bullies!

118
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,640
How are we doing?

119
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,440
Bored and bored.

120
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,880
You know what naked card game's
never boring?

121
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,840
So what's Phoebe like?

122
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,240
I'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like?

123
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,080
No, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?

124
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,890
I think she knows where my dad is!

125
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:06,960
Cool!

126
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,000
Where is he?

127
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,040
She was pretending she hasn't
heard from him. . .

128
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,280
. . .but I found this picture.

129
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,840
Isn't this what he would
look like now?

130
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,440
Totally familiar.

131
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,080
Why would she lie to you?

132
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,440
We're having dinner tomorrow.
Maybe she'll tell me then.

133
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,880
Maybe she just wanted
to give him time. . .

134
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,040
. . .to buy me presents.
I don't know.

135
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,040
So you're all bored?

136
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,360
I'll close my eyes and point
to someone. Whoever it is. . .

137
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,840
. . .has to think of something
fun to do. And we have to do it.

138
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,800
Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

139
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,520
You know, we could just do this!

140
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,720
We all have to play strip poker?

141
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,440
Strip Happy Days Game?

142
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,360
I couldn't find cards, so it was this
or Strip Bag-Of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.

143
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,360
Done.

144
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,040
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points. "

145
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,720
Get five points, you get to make
someone take off one item of clothing.

146
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,430
It hasn't happened yet,
but we're very excited.

147
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,720
Okay, come on.

148
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,160
Daddy needs a new electromagnetic
microscope for Prehistoric Forensics.

149
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,520
"Take Pinky Tuscadero up
to lnspiration Point.

150
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,840
Collect three cool points. " Yeah!

151
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,680
Which gives me five.

152
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,570
And let's see, who is gonna lose
their clothes?

153
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,000
I think I pick our strip poker
sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

154
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,680
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

155
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,440
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points. "

156
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,440
Which means I have five and
that means I get Joey's boxers.

157
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,040
Fine. Gang up on me.

158
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,930
I got you all,
right where I want you.

159
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,080
Come on! Take them off!

160
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,840
Actually, it's kind of cold.

161
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,400
What if I keep them on and
give you a peek at the good stuff?

162
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,880
I'm gonna make more margaritas.

163
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,960
What are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?

164
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm just making margaritas.

165
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,200
Think I'll help her out.

166
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,110
What is going on here?

167
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,240
What?

168
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,840
You're painting his toenails.
Chasing him around the room.

169
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,040
Monica, please.

170
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,240
He's totally flirting with you too.

171
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,550
He is, isn't he?

172
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,090
I don't know. Maybe it's just
being here at the beach together. . .

173
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,730
. . .but it's like something--

174
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,000
Hi, Bonnie.

175
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,850
My boss let me off early,
so I took the train.

176
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,320
What are you guys doing?

177
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,960
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

178
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,520
Cool! I'll catch up!

179
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,320
So you still don't think. . .

180
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,240
. . .I'm boyfriend material?

181
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,280
I saw you checking me out
during the game last night.

182
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,640
You didn't even take off your pants.

183
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:37,720
Lucky for you.

184
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,200
-What?
-I don't know.

185
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,720
Well, is everybody else having
just the best time?

186
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,160
Joey's asleep.

187
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,840
He passed out. We put sand
around him to keep him warm.

188
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,080
Well, I assume the happy couple
isn't up yet?

189
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,520
Did you guys hear them last night?

190
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,960
I don't know what they were doing,
but sea turtles came up to the house.

191
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,440
Good morning.

192
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,650
-How'd you sleep?
-Great.

193
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,680
Like a log.

194
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,200
Us too.

195
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,240
I'm going for a walk.

196
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,480
Good morning.
Nice breasts by the way.

197
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,440
Hey, what happened to you?

198
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,920
Oh, nothing. I just felt like
hanging out and reading.

199
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:54,570
The water was so great. We jumped
off this pier and my suit came off.

200
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,440
Sorry I missed that.

201
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,720
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

202
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,240
I brought back half the beach
in my hair.

203
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,480
It was easier when I shaved my head.

204
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,240
You know, I gotta tell you. . .

205
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,280
. . .I just loved your look
when you were bald.

206
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,120
Really?

207
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,490
I think about shaving it
again sometimes.

208
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,160
Really?

209
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,800
You definitely should do that.

210
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,840
You know what? I should do it!

211
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,680
You know what? Thank you.
You are so cool.

212
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,720
Oh, stop. Go on.

213
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,640
-Now go shave that head.
-All right.

214
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,050
What's the matter?

215
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,890
She canceled.
My namesake canceled on me.

216
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,440
She claims she had to go out of town.
She's avoiding me.

217
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,040
She doesn't want to tell me
where my father is. She knows!

218
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,320
Pheebs, that sucks.

219
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,240
Well, don't
"Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

220
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,640
-Where are you going?
-She's out of town.

221
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,480
Something in her house
will tell me where he is.

222
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,840
Some people call that
"breaking and entering. "

223
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,640
Well, are any of those people here?

224
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,200
Look, I'll do something nice, okay?

225
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,440
I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

226
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,320
Hey, everybody!

227
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,080
Look what you did!

228
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,960
You wanna touch it?

229
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,120
No, but it's great.

230
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,880
Come on, touch it.

231
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,920
You can feel all the bones
in your skull.

232
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,360
I was having a little chat
with Bonnie, and guess what?

233
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,720
She brought up who was
behind the head-shaving idea.

234
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,640
And now, who was it?
Oh, that's right. It was you!

235
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,280
That was her idea.

236
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,200
I just gave her a nudge.

237
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,640
She said you gave her the razor.

238
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,240
So anyone up for a midnight dip?

239
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,480
-No, I'm good.
-No, thanks.

240
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,640
-Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
-Okay, have fun.

241
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,040
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.

242
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,880
You can see the moonlight
bouncing off her head!

243
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,680
What were you thinking?

244
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,080
I don't know.

245
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,920
You balded my girlfriend!

246
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,120
All right.

247
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,320
Do you think it's easy for me
to see you with somebody else?

248
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,480
You're the one who ended it!

249
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,560
Because I was mad at you!
Not because I stopped loving you!

250
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,840
You still love me?

251
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,240
You still love me.

252
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,280
Yeah, so?

253
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,520
You love me.

254
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,040
What does this mean?

255
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,890
I mean, do you want
to get back together?

256
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,880
No! Maybe!

257
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,210
I don't know.

258
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,040
I still can't forgive you
for what you did.

259
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,360
But sometimes when I'm with you,
I just feel so. . . .

260
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,800
What?

261
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,440
I just feel. . . .

262
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,520
-I just--
-What?

263
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,800
I feel--

264
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,680
No! I don't care!

265
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,810
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker
with you for practice!

266
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,080
But I made cards!

267
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,080
Good night.

268
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,600
I'm going upstairs.

269
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,840
-Good night.
-Good night.

270
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,840
Wanna play strip poker
for practice?

271
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,760
My ass!

272
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,890
Oh, it's me! It's me!

273
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,000
-I didn't wanna make any noise!
-Then don't break in!

274
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,200
-I'm sorry!
-What are you doing here?

275
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,240
I came to fill your ice cube tray.

276
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,320
What?

277
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,280
Okay, look.

278
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,470
I took this picture from your fridge.
I know that this is my father.

279
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,920
This is Frank Buffay, and you were
standing next to him!

280
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,760
I deserve to know where I came from.

281
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,040
So if you can help me find my father,
then you should.

282
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,360
Otherwise, you're just mean.

283
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,760
So just tell me the truth.

284
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,280
All right.

285
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,970
The man in that picture
is Chuck Mangione.

286
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,440
My father is Chuck Mangione?

287
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,560
That's just Chuck Mangione.

288
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,040
I sold him a house last year.

289
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,130
And I'm very sorry, but I really don't
know where your father is.

290
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,040
And that's the truth.

291
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,880
But you're right.

292
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,840
I think a person should know
where they come from.

293
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,400
Which is why l. . . .

294
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,560
I'm your mother.

295
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,640
I wanted to tell you
yesterday, but I just. . .

296
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,600
. . .felt all floopy, and. . . .

297
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,760
You guys are getting back together.

298
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,160
She doesn't even know what she wants.

299
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,320
Rachel's still mad at me.

300
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,680
Then you gotta back away.
You don't need that kind of hurt.

301
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,520
Take it from a guy who's. . .

302
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,880
. . .never had a long-term relationship.

303
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,160
I know, but I really want to go
up there and finish that kiss.

304
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,680
The water is great.
You should go in.

305
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,240
No, thanks. I just had an M&M.

306
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,360
Well, good night.

307
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,560
Good night.

308
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,880
Don't be too long.

309
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,480
Okey-dokey.

310
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,240
There is not one hair on that head.

311
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,880
It'll grow back, right?
And she's really fun, and she's cool.

312
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,880
And I'm finally moving on.

313
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,640
Getting over Rachel was so--

314
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm finally feeling sane.
And if I go up there. . .

315
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,640
. . .and I kiss her. . . .

316
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,640
God, I want to kiss her!

317
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,160
And it doesn't work out. Do I wanna
put myself through that again?

318
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,680
Let me get this straight.

319
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,560
If you go with Bonnie, you do the
smart, healthy thing and move on.

320
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,120
Right? And if you go with Rachel,
Bonnie's free tonight?

321
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,960
Hi there.

322
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,960
That's that weird voice again.

323
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,430
Let me try it again.

324
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,240
You'll wanna date this next guy,
I swear!

325
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,920
Hi, I'm Dorf!

326
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,840
Your date for the evening.

327
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,400
Oh, come on. Dorf on dating?
That's good stuff!
