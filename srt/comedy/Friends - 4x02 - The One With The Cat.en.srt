1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,552
Wow! That ripped!

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,220
That ripped real nice!

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:16,642
How many times do I have to tell you?
You turn and slide.

4
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,268
Turn and slide.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,229
You don't turn and slide.

6
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,732
You throw it out!

7
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,694
I get tetanus shots
every time I get dressed!

8
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:32,116
We're not throwing it out.
I built it with my own hands!

9
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,744
How about we sell it?

10
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,414
All right.

11
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:42,209
But you'll have to tell them.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,633
Can we stick you in another cabinet?
They seem all right with it!

13
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,886
The One with the Cat

14
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,517
<i>Hey, Monica.</i>
<i>It's Chip.</i>

15
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,768
Who's Chip?

16
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,396
<i>It was good running</i>
<i>into you today.</i>

17
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,566
<i>My number is 555-9323.</i>
<i>Give me a call.</i>

18
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,569
"Chip" is Chip Matthews.

19
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,114
The guy who took Rachel to the prom?
Why's he calling you?

20
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,243
Because I ran into him at the bank.
He is still so cute.

21
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,956
You're so lucky! He's like
the most popular guy in school!

22
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,043
I know!

23
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,714
Chip? Hi, it's Monica.

24
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:24,269
Oh, my God!
We just had the best conversation!

25
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,984
I was just leaving.

26
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,444
Good.

27
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,486
I've got a report to read.

28
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:37,491
It's eight pages.
I hope I don't fall asleep.

29
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,702
Why? Did you write it?

30
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,666
Look at that!

31
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:50,421
Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants.

32
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,922
Well, actually...

33
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:58,220
I bet he sensed that I was ready
to have sex with another guy.

34
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:07,771
Why don't you give him a call?

35
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:23,412
- Are you sure you want to hear this?
- I'm sure.

36
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,082
Chip!
Hi, it's Rachel.

37
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,125
Rachel Greene.

38
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:33,422
You left me a message?

39
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:37,718
Yes, you did.
My roommate wrote it down.

40
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,346
Monica Geller?

41
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,730
Oh, that's right!

42
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:54,443
He called to ask out Monica.

43
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:59,281
That's got to be embarrassing.

44
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:07,038
<i>Dumb drunken bitch</i>

45
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,502
Thank you!

46
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,714
Here's a question.

47
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,342
Where'd you get the "finest oak
east of the Mississippi"?

48
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,847
First tell us where you got
the prettiest lace in the land.

49
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,140
It's your ad.

50
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,601
Looks good?

51
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:32,356
"Stunning entertainment center, fine...

52
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,527
Fine Italian craftsmanship."

53
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,446
You're selling
the entertainment center?

54
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,031
Why? I love it.

55
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,700
You want it?

56
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,746
Gepetto?

57
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,040
Five thousand dollars?

58
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you insane?

59
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,129
The ad alone cost $300.

60
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,467
I'm changing it
to $50 or your best offer.

61
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:06,348
What kind of profit is that?
And you call yourself an accountant?

62
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,650
What do you do?

63
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,819
I can't believe you don't know.

64
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,239
I actually don't know.

65
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:29,580
Oh, my God, no!
Shoo, kitty!

66
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,916
Come on, you!

67
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,292
Crazy!

68
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,837
Oh, my God!

69
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,797
Nothing.

70
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,967
What's wrong?

71
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:49,141
I just have this really strong feeling
that this cat is my mother.

72
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,226
The mom you met in Montauk?

73
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,603
She was a cat?

74
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,023
No. She was a human lady.

75
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,860
This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly.
The one that killed herself.

76
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,198
Have you been taking your grandmother's
glaucoma medicine again?

77
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,535
No, Dr. Skeptismo.

78
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:13,748
I'm sure.
First of all, there's the feeling.

79
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,711
And for another,
she went into my guitar case...

80
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,840
...which is lined with orange felt.

81
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:27,888
My mother's favorite fish
was orange roughy.

82
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:34,019
Cats like fish.

83
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,065
Hi, Mommy!

84
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,822
I haven't seen
this smile in 17 years.

85
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:50,661
- Pheebs' mom's got a huge pair of...
- Let it go!

86
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:58,502
When were you going to tell me
that you're dating Chip?

87
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,213
Now?

88
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,381
Can I go out with him?

89
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:08,387
No. I can't believe you'd want to
after what he did to me.

90
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,972
That thing at the prom?

91
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:16,061
I couldn't find him for hours!
He was having sex with Amy Welsh!

92
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,648
That was in high school.
How can it still bother you?

93
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,526
Why do you have
to go out with Chip?

94
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,444
We went to different schools.

95
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,531
We went to the same school.

96
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,825
You went to one where you were popular.

97
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:34,162
You rode on Chip's motorcycle
and wore his letterman jacket.

98
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:40,169
I went to one where I wore a band
uniform that was specially made.

99
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,006
They had that specially made?

100
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,552
It was a Home Ec project.

101
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:53,974
Oh, my God! They said
it was for the mascot.

102
00:07:55,309 --> 00:08:00,022
Back then I thought that I'd never
get to go out with a Chip Matthews.

103
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,025
Now he's called me up
and asked me out.

104
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:07,404
The fat girl inside me really
wants to go. I owe her this.

105
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,115
I never let her eat.

106
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,952
- You go out with him.
- Really?

107
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:18,541
If possible, could you leave him
and have sex with another guy?

108
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,418
I'll try.

109
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,798
Any luck getting rid of
the entertainment center?

110
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:31,178
There were a couple calls,
but they won't work out.

111
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,140
Joey has a very careful
screening process.

112
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,477
Not everyone is qualified
to own wood and nails.

113
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,355
Stop it!

114
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:47,945
She keeps trying to get away.
Just like when she was alive.

115
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,990
How long is your mom
going to be with us?

116
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,783
I'm not sure.

117
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,828
I guess until she gets used to
the fact that there's...

118
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,915
...a new mom.

119
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,419
Now she's worried
that she'll be replaced.

120
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,339
That's not going to happen, is it?

121
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,132
I have to go make a call.

122
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,051
Why not use this phone?

123
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,806
I'm returning a call from
a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.

124
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:20,310
I just spelled the wrong word.

125
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:27,692
So am I crazy, or does Pheebs' mom
remind anyone else of a cat?

126
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,987
Ross, don't start.

127
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:34,783
You actually believe
there's a woman inside that cat?

128
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,036
I believe it.

129
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,163
No, you don't.

130
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,372
Yes, I do.

131
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,125
No, you...

132
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,419
You know what?

133
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,546
You won't suck me into this.

134
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,883
Sure I will.
Because you always have to be right.

135
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:55,721
I do not always have...

136
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,393
"Jurassic Park" could happen.

137
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,115
That's pretty nice.

138
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,408
"Pretty nice"?

139
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,203
Pardon my roommate.
He wanted to marry this.

140
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,749
We don't have $50.
But would you trade for it?

141
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,627
We got a canoe.

142
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,469
I don't think we need a canoe.

143
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,513
You got to take it.

144
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,934
Just take the entertainment center.

145
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,105
Then when you get home,
throw the canoe away.

146
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:50,276
We're not throwing it away.
I built it.

147
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,237
Good for you!

148
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,328
You won't believe
what I found on a telephone pole.

149
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,788
Look familiar?

150
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:08,752
Apparently Pheebs' mother
also goes by the name "Julio".

151
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,215
A little girl's looking for this cat.
Know what that means?

152
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:17,844
Yeah! $200 reward split five ways!

153
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,139
Do we have to tell her?

154
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,185
- Yes, we do.
- But it's made her so happy.

155
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,604
Little girl misses her cat.

156
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,942
Crazy lady thinks
her mother is in a cat.

157
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,986
I have to go have
dinner with my son.

158
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:40,159
Can I trust that when you see Pheebs,
you will tell her?

159
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,579
Thank you.

160
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,165
I hate when Ross is right.

161
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,625
He is right, isn't he?

162
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,544
This might be one time
when he's wrong.

163
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,628
You think?

164
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,340
He's right.

165
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,809
About your mom.

166
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,980
How's that going?

167
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,150
So great.
We took a nap together today.

168
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,362
Mom fell asleep
on my tummy and purred.

169
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:21,325
That's so sweet.

170
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,620
I'll go get some coffee.

171
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:34,796
What'd you say, Joe?
I'll be right there.

172
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,219
I just feel so...

173
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:44,223
- All right!
- I'm coming already!

174
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,523
Not yet, not yet, not yet!

175
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,863
- Hello, Chip.
- How you doing?

176
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,406
I'm great!

177
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,660
Got a great job.
I have wonderful friends.

178
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:11,250
Though I'm not seeing anyone now,
I've never felt better about myself.

179
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,128
So, Monica ready yet?

180
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,840
She'll be out in a second.

181
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,303
So, Chip, how's Amy Welsh?

182
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:27,183
Amy Welsh?
I haven't seen her since...

183
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:31,061
So, Monica about ready?

184
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,397
This is the unit for you.

185
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,401
Sturdy construction,
tons of storage.

186
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:41,572
Some big enough to fit a grown man.

187
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,700
Yeah, I got in there myself once.

188
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,077
My roommate bet me $5 I couldn't.

189
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,498
Then he stuck a board
through the handles and locked me in.

190
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:56,336
It was funny till I felt
like it was a coffin.

191
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,801
No, you can't fit in there.
It's not deep enough.

192
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,595
If I can't...

193
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,390
...I'll knock $5 off the price.

194
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,310
You have yourself a deal.

195
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,067
See?
I told you.

196
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:25,324
Sometimes I come in here
just to get away from it.

197
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,953
Hey, a nickel!

198
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,415
Here we are.

199
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,709
You still have the Chipper!

200
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,377
The what?

201
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,298
That's what we called
your motorcycle in high school.

202
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,216
A motorcycle's a chopper.

203
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,511
And you're Chip.

204
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,013
Never mind.

205
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,391
I think it's cute.

206
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:59,066
A lipper from Chipper.

207
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,860
Are you still in touch with anyone?

208
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,863
There's Rachel...

209
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,240
...and that's it.
How about you?

210
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:12,538
I still hang with Simens and Zana.
I see Spindler, Levine, Kelly.

211
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,790
I run into Goldie...

212
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,417
...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...

213
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,254
...J.T., Beardsley.

214
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,463
Is that all?

215
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,967
After high school,
you kind of lose touch.

216
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,053
I ran into Richard Dorfman.

217
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:32,891
- How is he?
- Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.

218
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,018
Isn't he an architect?

219
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,522
They still wear underwear.

220
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,911
Oh, my God!

221
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,248
What?

222
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,044
Are you all right?

223
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,714
What happened?

224
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:08,093
Oh, man, he promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

225
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:13,181
How were you locked in?
Where the hell is all of our stuff?

226
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,726
This guy came by
to look at the unit...

227
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:19,104
...and he said
it won't fit a grown man.

228
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,731
So you got in voluntarily?

229
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,568
I was trying to make a sale!

230
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,113
If I ever run into him,
you know what I'll do?

231
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,491
Bend over?

232
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:40,084
And then Zana just let one rip!

233
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,340
Not that I don't enjoy
talking about high school...

234
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,634
...because I do.

235
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,053
Maybe we can talk
about something else.

236
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,639
I don't know where you work.

237
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,308
- You know where I work.
- I do?

238
00:16:56,558 --> 00:17:00,187
The movie theater.
You used to come in all the time.

239
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,897
Still at the Multiplex?

240
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,025
Like I'd give up that job!

241
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,861
Free popcorn and candy
anytime I want?

242
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,446
I can get you posters.

243
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,490
Thanks, I'm set.

244
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,576
You live with your parents?

245
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:19,456
Yeah, but I can stay out
as late as I want.

246
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:25,254
They really got you guys.
Your TV, the chairs.

247
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:28,340
Your microwave, the stereo.

248
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,927
Man, he took the five of spades!

249
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,180
No, here it is.

250
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,725
Oh, my God! What happened?

251
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:44,482
Joey was born, and then
28 years later, I was robbed!

252
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,819
So how was your date?

253
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,406
Well, I always wanted to go out
with Chip in high school.

254
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:57,369
Tonight, I actually went out
with Chip in high school.

255
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,204
Honey, I'm sorry.

256
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,290
Not only did I get
to go out with Chip...

257
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,376
...I got to dump Chip.

258
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,546
That's so great!

259
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,259
What did the insurance company say?

260
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:18,056
They said, "You don't have insurance.
Stop calling us."

261
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,395
You didn't tell her?

262
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,483
Okay, fine.

263
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,322
Listen...

264
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:36,700
...this cat belongs to a little girl.

265
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,078
There are flyers all over the place.

266
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,748
I'm sorry, sweetie.

267
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:47,252
We can take her
back with you if you want.

268
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:53,175
But, you know, she chose to find me.

269
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,304
I have to respect her decision, right?

270
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:01,141
- That's a good call.
- That's right.

271
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,642
Enough is enough.

272
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:07,147
I'm sorry you feel guilty about
spending time with your new mom.

273
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,107
But this isn't your old mom.

274
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,776
This is a cat.

275
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,487
Julio the cat.

276
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,157
Not Mom! Cat.

277
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:28,168
Ross, how many parents have you lost?

278
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,753
None.

279
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:35,217
Then you don't know how it feels
when one of them comes back.

280
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,263
I believe this is my mother.

281
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,850
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?

282
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,521
Just be a friend, okay?
Be supportive.

283
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:52,693
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:58,949
I don't know what to say.

285
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,576
You could say...

286
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:05,664
...you're sorry to her mom.

287
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:14,214
I think she would like that.

288
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:27,478
Come here. Here, come here.

289
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:32,233
Mrs. Buffay?

290
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:36,153
Sorry about what I said.

291
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,573
It was insensitive of me to say...

292
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:43,869
...that you were just a cat...

293
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,371
...when, clearly, you are also...

294
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:50,126
...the reincarnated spirit...

295
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,837
...of my friend's mother.

296
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,506
Thank you.

297
00:20:56,757 --> 00:21:00,302
We both forgive you.

298
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:04,098
What will you do about
the little girl?

299
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,517
Listen.

300
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,770
Mom, I hope you know
you still mean a lot to me.

301
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,149
You're welcome
to come back anytime.

302
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:19,780
If she'd come back as a couch,
we'd really appreciate it.

303
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,781
Come on.
I'll take you home.

304
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,619
- I'll go with you.
- Me too.

305
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:28,414
I got an extra futon.

306
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:33,711
Dude, you don't have to brag.
We got nothing here.
