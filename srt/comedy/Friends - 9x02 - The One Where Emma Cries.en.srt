1
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,090
You said you'd marry Joey?

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,677
Okay, you have to realize,
I was exhausted, I was emotional.

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,553
I would have said yes to anybody.

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:15,975
Like that time
when you and I got married.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,769
I'm not helping.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:23,523
So you said yes to him,
and you just had our baby?

7
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:27,736
That is right. And traditionally,
the daddy gives the mommy a present.

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,030
But I am prepared to let that go.

9
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,993
So when I came here to see if you
wanted to maybe start things up again...

10
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,539
...you were engaged to my best friend?

11
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,165
Well...

12
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,959
Really?

13
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,753
I thought Chandler
was your best friend.

14
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,424
Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.
Joey's my... No!

15
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,554
Hey, I'm gonna take off.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

16
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,639
Rachel said she'd marry you?

17
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,517
This isn't the right room. Sorry, folks.

18
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,521

21
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:57,033
I don't want to be negative. So I'll say
most of the signs you bought are good.

22
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:05,793
No, they ran out of "It's a Girl!"
But I can fix this one.

23
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,174
See? Huh?

24
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,178
So sexy.

25
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,931
- Honey?
- Yeah?

26
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,435
- Honey, why don't you lie down?
- It's okay.

27
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,606
Ross and Rachel will be back soon,
and then I gotta go to the office.

28
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,570
Am I producing them?

29
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,574
- Why are you so tired?
- I couldn't sleep last night.

30
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,744
I started worrying about this big
divisional meeting I have today.

31
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,288
The more I worried,
the more I couldn't sleep.

32
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,376
You know, and then I was, like, "If I fall
asleep now, I'll get six hours' sleep.

33
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,754
But if I fall asleep now,
I'll get five hours' sleep."

34
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,215
No matter what I did,
I couldn't fall asleep.

35
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:57,052
You know what you should've done?
Told yourself that little story.

36
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,806
- Hi.
- Hey.

37
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,432
- Welcome home.
- Hi.

38
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,976
Phoebe did the signs.

39
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,730
You guys, thanks for doing this.

40
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,484
Look at all that stuff people sent.

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,237
Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something
every mother needs.

42
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,824
A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up
the entire apartment.

43
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:25,288
What are people think...?
You guys, I love it.

44
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,458
Hey, so where's Ross?

45
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,961
He's downstairs getting the stuff
out of the cab.

46
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,797
- Is he still mad at us?
- Well, you more than me.

47
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,967
But he can't stay too mad at me.
I mean, I just had his baby.

48
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,761
That's not fair. I can't do that.

49
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,639
I'm not sure you should be here
when he comes up.

50
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,936
I didn't think I should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.

51
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,730
Hey, what do I know?
I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.

52
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,698
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,
New York and London are solid.

53
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:04,537
But many of our field offices
have reported disappointing yields.

54
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,878
Boston is down. Atlanta is down.
Houston is down.

55
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,798
I could go on and on.
But instead of boring you...

56
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,968
...I'll go straight to my 42-point plan.

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,522
Walter.

58
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,358
She's just so cute.

59
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:40,114
I just want to bite her ear off
and use it as a sucking candy.

60
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,741
Phoebe.

61
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:47,162
But I could take one of those little feet
and put it in a pita pocket.

62
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,541
- Okay. I put most of the stuff away.
- Oh, great. The pacifiers?

63
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,586
- It's in the cupboard.
- The burping cloths?

64
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,756
- Linen closet.
- The diapers?

65
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,382
In the hospital.

66
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:06,014
- Wow, you guys got a hospital? Fancy.
- No, I left the diapers at the hospital.

67
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,934
There's some in the bag,
but I'll run out and get some more.

68
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,310
All right, thanks.

69
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,772
Could you stop at the coffeehouse
and get me a muffin?

70
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,358
- Sure. What kind?
- Let me think.

71
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,278
What do I want?

72
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,030
What do I want?

73
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,159
Please, take your time.
It's an important decision, not like...

74
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:30,330
...say, I don't know, deciding to marry
someone. This is about a muffin.

75
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,752
- Blueberry.
- Blueberry it is.

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,296
Thank you.

77
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,049
Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?

78
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,551
God, how long do you think
that's gonna last?

79
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:47,389
I don't know. He got over the
"We were on a break" thing quickly.

80
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,392
You know what,
I can't worry about it right now.

81
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,938
Because I've got the cutie little baby.

82
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:59,151
I can't believe how much I love her.
I mean, I can't get enough of her.

83
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,820
Like, right now? I miss her.
I actually miss her.

84
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,031
You know, that's her?

85
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:12,164
God, look at her sleeping.
I love her so much.

86
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,374
- I think I'm gonna wake her up.
- Rach, no.

87
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,461
You know, you're never
supposed to wake a sleeping baby.

88
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,088
Well, I can do whatever I want.
I made her.

89
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:27,429
Come on, little girl.
Yes. Hello, Emma. Hello. Hi.

90
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,437
Well, I would say I told you so,
but she's kind of doing that for me.

91
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,357
I'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry.
Go back to sleep.

92
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,401
Go back to sleep.

93
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:46,198
- It breaks your heart, doesn't it?
- It really does.

94
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,576
How long do you think
we have to stay?

95
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,831
Okay, if everyone's on board,
it's settled.

96
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,542
Chandler?

97
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,507
- Chandler?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,134
Are you on board?

99
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,971
Yes.

100
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,683
Well, then problem solved.
Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.

101
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,394
You're gonna love Oklahoma.

102
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,859
All right. We already tried feeding her,
changing her, burping her...

103
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,156
Try this one. "Go back in time
and listen to Phoebe."

104
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,076
- All right, here's something.
- What?

105
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,662
It says to try holding the baby
close to your body...

106
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,749
...and then swing her rapidly
from side to side.

107
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,919
Okay.

108
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:48,927
It worked!

109
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,099
No. Just stopped to throw up
a little bit.

110
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,185
Mon, what am I gonna do?

111
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,939
It's been hours,
and it won't stop crying.

112
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:06,445
- She, Rach. Not it. She.
- Yeah. I'm not so sure.

113
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,657
- Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.
- Yeah, no kidding.

114
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,620
All right, this just proves no good
can come from having sex with Ross!

115
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,754
Hey, Gunther. Can I get a couple
of blueberry muffins to go?

116
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,006
- Diapers, huh?
- Yep.

117
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,092
So I guess Rachel had your baby?

118
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,512
- Yep. Can you believe it?
- Nope.

119
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,933
I can't even believe
she slept with you in the first place.

120
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,189
You mean, like...

121
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,156
Hey.

122
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,076
I know you're pissed at me,
but we have to talk about this.

123
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,163
Actually, we don't.

124
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,418
Fine. Okay. But I gotta say, technically,
I didn't even do anything wrong.

125
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,130
What? You didn't do anything wrong?

126
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,759
- I said I didn't technically.
- Okay.

127
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,470
Let's put aside the fact
that you "accidentally"...

128
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,225
...picked up my grandmother's ring and
you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.

129
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,310
Can I just stop you there
for a second?

130
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,937
When people do this:

131
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,564
I don't really know what that means.

132
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,489
You were saying?

133
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,408
And I could even understand
that you couldn't tell Rachel.

134
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,663
But why couldn't you tell me?
You had all day to, and you didn't.

135
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:43,876
I know. I should've.
"I'm sorry."

136
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,216
Not using it right, Joe.

137
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,678
"I'm sorry."

138
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,140
- I'm gonna go.
- No, come on.

139
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,435
- Ross, we have to get past this.
- Give me the bag.

140
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,813
No, I don't know what else to do.
I said I'm sorry, now...

141
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,983
Now you should scream at me
or curse me or hit me.

142
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:11,237
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- You'll feel better. I'll feel better.

143
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,031
You know you want to,
I can see it in your eyes.

144
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,534
- I don't.
- A little bit.

145
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,577
- No.
- Little bit.

146
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,871
- No.
- A little bit more.

147
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,708
- Give me the bag. Give me the bag.
- No, hit me. Hit me.

148
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,002
- Give me the bag. I'm not kidding.
- Hit me.

149
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,171
- No.
- Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!

150
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,895
- You ducked!
- I'm sorry! It was a reflex!

151
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,482
- Oh, my God! This really hurts!
- I couldn't help it.

152
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,569
When a fist comes at your face,
you duck. Look.

153
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,199
What is the matter with you?

154
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,451
You were supposed to duck!
Why didn't you?

155
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,620
Let's talk on the way to the hospital.

156
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,291
Good. Yeah, maybe while we're there,
they can check your reflexes.

157
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,311
- Try feeding her again.
- I already fed her.

158
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,230
I know. That's why I said, "Again!"

159
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,609
You guys,
we can't turn on each other, okay?

160
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,028
That's just what she wants.

161
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,572
- Hi.
- Hey.

162
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,699
- Can I talk to you outside?
- Just stay here.

163
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,326
I'm gonna check her diaper.
Pheebs, you want to come?

164
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,413
I'm kind of part of this.

165
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,001
Actually, it's a husband-and-wife
kind of thing.

166
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,670
I knew I should've married Chandler.

167
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,007
- Okay, what's up?
- Okay.

168
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,094
You know we said it would be fun
to move to Paris for a year?

169
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,972
And you could study French cooking,
and I could write...

170
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,393
...and we could picnic along the Seine,
and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.

171
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,687
- Yeah.
- Okay.

172
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,441
You know how people say
that Tulsa...

173
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,028
...is the Paris of Oklahoma?

174
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,116
What? Who says that?

175
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,869
People who have never been
to Paris?

176
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:28,707
- Well, what's going on?
- We're moving to Tulsa.

177
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,796
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

178
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,757
Ms. McKenna,
she kind of works above my boss.

179
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,927
She asked me to move to Tulsa and
be president of our office there.

180
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,639
And I was sleeping
and apparently said yes.

181
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:47,435
- Tulsa, Oklahoma?
- The Sooner State.

182
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,729
Whatever that is.

183
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,274
Chandler, I don't even want to see
the musical "Oklahoma."

184
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,319
"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,"
"Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?

185
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,990
Are you trying to tell me we're moving
to Oklahoma or that you're gay?

186
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:07,454
All right, not that this matters, but did
they at least offer you a huge raise?

187
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,917
No. But they are going to lease us
a Ford Focus.

188
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,714
- I'll get out of it.
- Thank you.

189
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,007
- What is wrong with Emma?
- She misunderstood.

190
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,343
She thought she was moving to Tulsa.

191
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,600
Ma'am, do you have a minute?

192
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:33,105
I kind of have some bad news.
I don't think I can move to Tulsa.

193
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:38,360
- What?
- It's a funny story, actually.

194
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:42,448
I kind of fell asleep
in the meeting this morning.

195
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:46,160
So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,
I didn't really know what I was saying.

196
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,536
You fell asleep?

197
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,455
But only because I was up all night
worried about this meeting.

198
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,998
Isn't that funny?

199
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,462
Irony. Not a fan? All right.

200
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,798
See, here's the thing.

201
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,468
I went home and told my wife
about Tulsa, and she won't go.

202
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,514
See me, I love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.
Tulsa is Italy.

203
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,725
Please don't make me go there.

204
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:14,188
- Chandler, l...
- No, look, Carol. Can I call you Carol?

205
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,525
Why would I
when your name is Elaine?

206
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,409
What a great picture of your son.
Strapping.

207
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,538
That's a picture of your daughter,
isn't it?

208
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,458
Well, she's lovely.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.

209
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,839
I'll call you from Tulsa.

210
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,388
Hey. So how is it?

211
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,475
- I broke my thumb.
- Your thumb?

212
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,772
That's weird.
Are you sure you're punching right?

213
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,525
Make a fist.

214
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,235
Maybe later.

215
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,154
Ross, I feel terrible.

216
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:08,951
You know what, you can go.
I just have to fill out some forms.

217
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,332
You want me to help you with that?

218
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,336
Why, does it look like I'm having
trouble with my misshapen claw?

219
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,884
Name?

220
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,137
No, I know Ross.
But what's it short for?

221
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,431
You know, like Rossell.

222
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,852
Or Rosstrophor.

223
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,647
Just Ross.

224
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,358
It's pretty.

225
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,320
- Okay, date of birth?
- You know my birthday.

226
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,656
Sure.

227
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:52,077
May... tember?

228
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:57,666
- October 18.
- Occupation? Dinosaurs.

229
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:04,798
Actually, I'm a paleon...
Dinosaurs is fine.

230
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,260
The drawing is not.

231
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,766
All right, who do you want
as your emergency contact?

232
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:19,104
- Rachel, I guess.
- Okay. Relationship?

233
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,149
Boy, this could take a while.

234
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,487
- Just put roommate.
- Come on.

235
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:31,158
You guys are more than that.
You're gonna get together, right?

236
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,327
I don't think that we are.

237
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,622
But you two are supposed
to be together.

238
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:41,043
Well, I thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.

239
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,712
Come on, Ross,
that didn't mean anything.

240
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,757
She'd just had the baby. She was
freaked out about doing it alone.

241
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:50,969
- She would have said yes to anybody.
- Yeah, that's what she said.

242
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,515
- So?
- So I don't want to be just anybody.

243
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,311
- Wow.
- You know what?

244
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,523
It's better this way anyway.

245
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,735
I don't know what I was thinking,
going down that road again with us.

246
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:12,575
It's just much easier if we're
just friends who have a kid.

247
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,826
- Really?
- Yeah.

248
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,747
- And you're okay with that?
- Yes. That's what we always planned.

249
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,459
And if you have a plan,
you should stick to it.

250
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:25,045
That's why they call them plans.
Hello?

251
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,341
I'm fine.

252
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,969
Hey, for what it's worth...

253
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:36,723
...with Rachel, I don't think
you'll ever be just "anybody."

254
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,227
Hey, there you go.

255
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,438
"Thanks."

256
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:52,072
Oh, my God.
How long has she been crying?

257
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,658
About a week and a half.

258
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,496
Well, it looks like you guys got it
under control, so I'm just gonna go.

259
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:04,001
No? Really?
Misery really does love company?

260
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,378
All right.

261
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,883
- Try holding her a different way.
- Look, I'm doing the best I can.

262
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,219
- Anyone else is welcome to try.
- All right, I'll try. Fine.

263
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,722
- Yes. Okay. Okay.
- Here you go.

264
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,599
Hey. Oh, gosh.

265
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,936
Nothing works with this child!

266
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:27,024
God, what am I gonna do, you guys?
I can't even comfort my own baby.

267
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,901
- I'm the worst mother ever.
- No, you're just new at this.

268
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,322
You'll get better. Think about
your first day at work.

269
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,991
That couldn't have been easy,
but you figured that out.

270
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:40,912
Yeah, I don't think dressing
provocatively is going to help me here!

271
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:44,750
- God, just please take her.
- Okay, I'll take her. Come on.

272
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,878
Oh, boy,
I have to go to the bathroom.

273
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,131
I have to go scream into a pillow.

274
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,847
Bouncy. Bouncy baby. Bouncy baby.

275
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:03,852
Oh, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby.

276
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:07,356
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

277
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,776
Have I gone deaf?

278
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:19,660
It worked. Oh, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

279
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,496
You must be a fireball in bed!

280
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:30,004
I can't believe it. She's asleep.
I got her to go to sleep.

281
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,589
I have actual magical powers.

282
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,052
I can hear traffic and birds.

283
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,847
I can hear the voices in my head
again.

284
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,017
I'm kidding.

285
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:50,690
Oh, my God!
You got her to stop crying!

286
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:55,070
Yes, I did. I'm Monica, super aunt.

287
00:19:55,571 --> 00:20:00,159
- You are the official baby-crier stopper.
- Yes, I am.

288
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,871
- You're never leaving the apartment.
- Say what?

289
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:08,416
That's your new job, day or night.
She starts crying, I need you here.

290
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:12,337
- No, no, no.
- Thankfully, you don't need me at all.

291
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:16,675
So okay. Hey, super aunt?
See you later.

292
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:20,387
Rachel?
Let's give it six to eight months.

293
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,023
Okay, so listen,
I'm gonna go lay down.

294
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:33,984
What?

295
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,112
The book says whenever
she's sleeping, I should be sleeping.

296
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,697
So...

297
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,951
<i>Thank you.</i>

298
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,205
Hey.

299
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:51,627
- We just got her to go to sleep.
- So there can't be any yelling?

300
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,756
No.

301
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,637
- We're moving to Tulsa.
- What?

302
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:08,060
I can't... I can't hear.

303
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:17,653
- Hey.
- Hey. Where have you been?

304
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:23,117
- What happened to you?
- I had a little thing with Joey.

305
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,578
If you think this is bad,
you should see him.

306
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,414
No, Ross, this is not good.

307
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:34,044
We have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit.

308
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:40,801
All right, you have got to get over
this Joey thing.

309
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:46,348
Okay? I never really wanted
to marry Joey, okay?

310
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,351
Okay.

311
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,855
You know what I really, really want?

312
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,402
What, Rach?

313
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,655
I wanna sleep.

314
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:08,078
I wanna eat.
I wanna take a shower.

315
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:12,457
I mean, before she wakes up,
and we gotta do this all over again.

316
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,919
- Right.
- I mean, because I got news for you.

317
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,256
Emma: Not easy.

318
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:23,886
Well, that's what I'm here for.

319
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:30,309
- You want me to get that?
- No, that's really okay.

320
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:35,063
- Monica?
- Got it, got it, got it, got it.

321
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:48,494
I've been thinking about this.
And I gotta tell you, it's not my fault.

322
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:51,288
- It's a natural instinct.
- What are you talking about?

323
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,374
Okay, what would you do if I did this?

324
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,264
