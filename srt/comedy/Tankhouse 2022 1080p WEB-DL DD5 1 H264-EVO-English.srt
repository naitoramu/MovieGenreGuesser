1
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,629
(grand trumpet music)

2
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,012
(cows mooing)

3
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,480
(upbeat mandolin music)

4
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,481
Tucker: Ah, look at us.

5
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,153
My beloved and me bound together
by art and love.

6
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,021
Ready to take on the world.

7
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:56,090
How could we have known that our
quest

8
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,726
for redemption would tear us
asunder?

9
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,563
(grand orchestral melody)

10
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,398
Oh, but I'm getting ahead of
myself.

11
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,903
Long before Fargo I was just
Tucker Charlemagne,

12
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:12,874
a newly minted bachelor of fine
arts in New York City.

13
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,910
But what set me apart from my
fellow bearded

14
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:20,081
caucasian alums was my
partnership with Sandrene.

15
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:25,652
I'll never forget the moment we
first locked eyes.

16
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,722
I was directing a movement piece
when suddenly

17
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,425
a shock of hay blonde hair
commanded my attention.

18
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,527
Sandrene Rothstein from far off

19
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,932
North Dakota with dreams of TV
stardom.

20
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,733
She was doing research for a
role

21
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,636
in a new detective show, "Rookie
Badge."

22
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,940
From there began a romance
punctuated by a whirlwind

23
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:49,709
of Shakespearian performances
throughout the boroughs.

24
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,113
But when Rookie Badge finally
aired they had

25
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,815
brutally cut out nearly her
entire part.

26
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,583
Sandrene was devastated.

27
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,985
So I invited her to join me at

28
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,821
the Artist Atelier Acting Studio
under

29
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:04,225
legendary acting teacher Buford
Schlesinger.

30
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,960
-: I have only two notes.

31
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:10,998
One, a working actress must
always carry a fan.

32
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:14,734
And two, if you wanna make it in
this business

33
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,873
you've got to immediately lose
10 pounds.

34
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,042
Tucker: Buford forged us in the
flames

35
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,475
of the avant-garde.

36
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,778
Sadly, a chronic battle with
gout left him

37
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,948
wheelchair bound and he
nominated

38
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:30,051
Sandrene and me as his
successors, instructing us

39
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:33,787
to devise our premiere
performance.

40
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:34,788
I can see it now.

41
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,525
3 AM atop a derelict warehouse
in The Bronx.

42
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,228
We had a packed house plus a
comped ticket

43
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,931
for Jax Winn, lead theater
critic

44
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:47,734
of the Black Box Chronicle.

45
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,070
-: Let's knock them dead.

46
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:49,937
-: Yeah.

47
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:51,671
-: David!

48
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,739
(gong rings)

49
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,874
(meditative chanting)

50
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,142
Tucker OC: The stage was set for
us

51
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:58,279
to unveil our signature
innovation.

52
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,648
The Immersive Theater Attack.

53
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,551
A thrusting of the audience into
the performance

54
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,021
with the power to jolt
theatergoers

55
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,023
out of their comfort zone.

56
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,059
Actors: Immersive Theater
Attack!

57
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,598
-: How slow this old moon
wanes...

58
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:22,269
-: Four nights will quickly
dream away the time,

59
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,537
And then the moon shall behold

60
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,875
the night of our solemnities.

61
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,910
Tucker OC: For a moment it
seemed as though

62
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:33,014
Sandrene and I were on the edge
of a new dawn.

63
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,748
(rhythmic drumming)

64
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,584
(actors hooting)

65
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,659
-: Awake the nimble spirit of
mirth!

66
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,997
Turn melancholy forth to
funerals!

67
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,599
Tucker OC: But as quickly as it
began,

68
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,236
so did it abruptly end.

69
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,939
(Sandrene gasps)

70
00:03:58,973 --> 00:03:59,974
-: Oh.

71
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:00,841
-: Nana?

72
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:01,976
-: My god.

73
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,179
Tucker OC: I can still hear Jax
Winn's damning words.

74
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,613
-: Don't write that down.

75
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,816
-: "The tragic death of theater
patron

76
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,252
"Doris Feinstein overshadowed

77
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,720
"an otherwise scattershot
production."

78
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,687
-: Scattershot?

79
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,223
David: "From The Confidential
Collective."

80
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,192
-: It's not my fault that Jax
Winn can't see

81
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,995
that such a "tragedy" is
precisely what

82
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,064
an immersive theater attack is
all about.

83
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,198
-: You monster!

84
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,167
-: What Tucker is trying to say
is that

85
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,170
we are so, so sorry for your
loss.

86
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:34,108
And we promise that such a
tragedy will never happen again.

87
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:40,014
-: Yes, it was a once in a
lifetime anomaly.

88
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,315
-: Oh really?

89
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,084
From our very first workshop
where

90
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:46,287
you forced us to use real guns!

91
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,323
-: To adding unstimulated sexual
intercourse with each other.

92
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,293
-: To last night, when Asher's
Nana, and by the way,

93
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:55,029
our only source of funding,
died.

94
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,833
-: After she lived as she never
had before!

95
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,235
-: I have here an official
petition,

96
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,137
from the members of the
"Artist's Atelier

97
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,272
"Presents The Confidential
Collective,"

98
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:09,243
demanding that Tucker and
Sandrene step down.

99
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,811
-: Judas!

100
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:13,380
Buford, surely you must
appreciate

101
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:16,016
the divine influences at work
here.

102
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,852
Our production's birth.

103
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,652
Nana's death.

104
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,721
It's the circle of life.

105
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:25,192
-: Don't patronize me, young
man.

106
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:31,298
I must respect the will of The
Collective.

107
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:37,704
You two are hereby banned from
all outreach activities.

108
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:41,041
-: Not the Artist's Atelier
Prison Unit.

109
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,743
Without a working knowledge of
iambic pentameter

110
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,447
they'll never be able to reenter
society!

111
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,151
-: Due to your extreme
recklessness,

112
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:54,288
I have no choice but to award
leadership

113
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:57,925
of The Collective into the hands
of David.

114
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,061
-: No!
-: No!

115
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,931
-: Squire, please escort these
two

116
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,698
out of the rehearsal studio.

117
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,467
-: Cowards!

118
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,301
Conformists!

119
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,402
Sandrene: Darling, let's just
go.

120
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,906
-: No no, we will remount our
rooftop spectacular

121
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,110
and it will shake this town to
its very core!

122
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:19,712
(dramatic music)

123
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:23,450
-: Okay Tucker, they're in the
elevator, so please be nice.

124
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,752
If we want to remount the show
we need their money.

125
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,087
-: Well how am I supposed to
impress them when

126
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,957
the injera hasn't even had a
chance to leaven?

127
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,725
-: Nobody forced you to make an
Ethiopian feast from scratch.

128
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,994
-: Well why don't we just open
up a couple cans

129
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:35,863
of baked beans and throw them
into

130
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,265
a Home Depot bucket and call it
a day?

131
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:39,200
Bob: We're here!

132
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,835
Where's our little celeb?

133
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:42,503
Sandrene: Mom!

134
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,804
-: Hi sweetie.

135
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,106
-: Daddy.

136
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,508
-: There's our girl.

137
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,442
-: Hey hey hey!

138
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,742
-: Look at your hair.

139
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,777
Is it yours?

140
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,445
-: Mom.

141
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,779
-: There's the big boy!

142
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,814
-: Tucker, hi!

143
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,316
-: Hey, hello.

144
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,183
Bob: Tuck!

145
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:57,384
-: I love your costume.

146
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,254
-: Oh actually it is a
traditional robe

147
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,256
pilfered from the tomb of one of
the last

148
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:06,026
known relatives of Alexander
the... Good.

149
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,361
-: Okay.

150
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,495
Well here.

151
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:12,132
I brought you this fresh sack of
homemade bison jerky.

152
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,235
-: Oh, you shouldn't have.

153
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,870
Bison.

154
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:17,805
-: Go on.

155
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,273
Tuck, take a pull.

156
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,541
-: Daddy, we're vegans now.

157
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,476
Remember that documentary I sent
you?

158
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,180
-: Yeah, well it's not meat,
it's jerky.

159
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,881
Go on, take a bite.

160
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:29,550
-: You know what?

161
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:34,488
I am going to save this and dive
into it later.

162
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:39,126
-: I'll be offended if you don't
try it.

163
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,195
-: Well I'd hate to offend you.

164
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:42,795
I shall

165
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,933
"Take a pull" as you say.

166
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,435
-: You're so bad.

167
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,874
-: There you go!

168
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,809
Put some hair on your chest.

169
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,178
You're getting that nice smokey
mesquite!

170
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,115
-: I can taste it in the...

171
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,016
In the...

172
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:04,218
The tendons.

173
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,987
-: What time's the performance?

174
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:08,222
-: Oh yeah, what did you guys

175
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,224
transform into theater this
time?

176
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,459
Is it another public restroom in
Prospect Park?

177
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,094
Because we came prepared.

178
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,230
(Deirdre laughs)

179
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,865
-: Well about that.

180
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,167
-: The production is...

181
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,538
Being retooled.

182
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,307
-: Oh geez, how come?

183
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:31,245
-: We decided to leave our
theater company.

184
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,846
-: So there's no show?

185
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,384
-: Well we are gonna remount the
rooftop show on our own.

186
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,088
But you know, first we're gonna
need

187
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,090
some additional funding before
we can do--

188
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,058
-: Ha!

189
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:44,925
I told you!

190
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,360
-: You did, Bob, you did.

191
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,228
-: That they couldn't make it
through to dessert.

192
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:51,932
-: Daddy please, we've been
working on this for four years.

193
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,635
It'll literally make our
reputation in New York.

194
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:57,071
We wouldn't ask for anything
ever again.

195
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:57,938
-: Ever again.

196
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:58,605
-: That's good.

197
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,240
(Deidre and Bob laugh)

198
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,910
-: You really are your mother's
daughter.

199
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:06,347
-: Sandy, your mother and I have
been talking

200
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,116
and we think it's high time you
two start

201
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,019
pulling yourselves up by your
own bootstraps.

202
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,053
(Tucker gasps)

203
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:15,522
-: We are artists, Bob.

204
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,990
Not plumbers.

205
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,893
-: Well we have been bankrolling
this whole

206
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,262
artist lifestyle for long
enough.

207
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:26,033
So it is time to grow up and
start earning a living.

208
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:31,105
Because we cannot justify this
freeloading here any longer.

209
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,072
Got it?

210
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:33,140
Let's go.

211
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,576
We'll see if we can find one of
those halal carts.

212
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,611
-: So what, you're just cutting
us off?

213
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:41,348
-: That bison jerky's my last
handout.

214
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:42,316
You hear?

215
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,384
-: Wait, no, mommy please!

216
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,218
-: Mommy.

217
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:44,853
-: You know I don't have the
forearm

218
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,421
strength to be a waitress.

219
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:50,424
-: Well there is one thing,
but--

220
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,394
-: No, anything mommy, please.

221
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,028
-: You know the Fargo City
Council

222
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,663
is revitalizing Main Street.

223
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:57,664
-: Yeah.

224
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:01,502
-: Well they've renovated the
Fargo Theater.

225
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,670
And they're having a competition
next month

226
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:07,908
to award a residency to one
local theater company.

227
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:12,012
-: Oh Tucker, you should see the
Fargo Theater.

228
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,113
It's so beautiful.

229
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:13,981
-: Yes.

230
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,015
-: Oh yes, wonderful.

231
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,284
We can perform for the spillover

232
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,053
from the local cattle auction.

233
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,355
-: Come to Fargo.

234
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,357
And try and win the theater.

235
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,259
Sweetie, I think you have a
shot.

236
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,427
And you can stay at the ranch

237
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,329
while we're on safari in
Tanzania.

238
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,000
Otherwise, your father's right.

239
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,369
You can't live in fantasy land
anymore.

240
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,304
(subway train rumbling)

241
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,974
Conductor: Stand clear of the
closing doors please.

242
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,048
-: Tucker?

243
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,620
Come have a word with me at the
Atelier.

244
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,196
Have I told you about my
off-off-Broadway

245
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:05,132
production of A Doll's House

246
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,401
Which Walter Kerr called

247
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,537
"a neorealist's wet dream?"

248
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,272
-: Wet dream, yeah.

249
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,074
I wish I had been alive to see
it.

250
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,476
I would've sat in the splash
zone.

251
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,611
-: The first adaptation of that

252
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:22,115
was devised in the jungles of
Siberia.

253
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:26,520
-: I didn't know that they had
jungles in the Arctic.

254
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,055
-: The snow.

255
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,356
(Buford chuckles)

256
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,358
The mosquitoes!

257
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:36,430
Collaborating with comrades
toward a single goal.

258
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:40,701
It made me the artist I am
today.

259
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,303
If you're ever going to discover

260
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,639
the true purpose of theater

261
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:46,473
-: Yes.

262
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:51,111
-: You must have this experience
too.

263
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,815
-: But the New York theater is
my home.

264
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:57,751
-: But you'll never understand
it until you step away

265
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:01,588
to discover the true purpose of
that theater.

266
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,658
-: I see.

267
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,261
It's all clear to me now.

268
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:10,531
-: It's all for your own good,
my boy.

269
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,533
-: The gout has eaten its way
from your foot

270
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,669
to your brain and infected it.

271
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,772
-: That's medically impossible.

272
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:22,109
-: King Lear would be proud.

273
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,245
-: Tucker, you must realize.

274
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,815
You're standing in your own way.

275
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,387
-: Do you see this?

276
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,188
It's literally real fake fur.

277
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,457
I'm sure you can get tons for
it.

278
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,392
Also this one.

279
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,693
-: Oh my god.

280
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,094
Sandy.

281
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:41,762
-: Brian.

282
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:42,629
-: Is that you?

283
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:43,497
-: Brian!

284
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,364
-: Hey.

285
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:45,465
So how are you?

286
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,400
How's it going?

287
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,835
Who are you with?

288
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:49,403
-: Oh.

289
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,237
Tucker.

290
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,439
No no no no, who are you repped
by?

291
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,373
-: Oh.

292
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,309
Oh no no, I don't have an agent.

293
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,443
-: Really?

294
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,378
You didn't get signed after your
Rookie Badge recurring?

295
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:00,247
-: Oh no, we took over the
theater company

296
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,517
right after that, so we've been
really busy.

297
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,153
-: So I just got promoted to
coordinator

298
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,889
at United Talent International.

299
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:09,289
-: UTI, right.

300
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,525
-: I'm starting to hip pocket my
own clients

301
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,427
and I would love to send you out
on some stuff.

302
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,661
See if anything sticks.

303
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:15,495
-: Really?

304
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,664
-: Sandrene, you are way too
legit

305
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:20,701
to spend your life pawning
pashminas.

306
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,369
Caller: You'll never perform in
this city again!

307
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,370
(caller hangs up)

308
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,671
-: Hello?

309
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:25,572
Hello?

310
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,308
-: Did you find us a theater?

311
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:29,209
-: No.

312
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:33,580
Everyone in this town thinks
we're murderers.

313
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:36,483
Or, as your father's lawyer
says,

314
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,886
"involuntary manslaughterers."

315
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,554
-: Great.

316
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:41,856
-: There's gotta be a way.

317
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,457
What are we missing?

318
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,226
(playful music)

319
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,433
Sandrene.

320
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:55,736
Brilliant!

321
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,603
Brilliant!

322
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:57,738
-: What?

323
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,842
-: This face mask has particles
of 24 karat gold in it.

324
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,542
If we chemically separate it and
melt it down

325
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,777
into bullion, I've heard tell of
a man

326
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:06,279
in Venezuela who will pay top
dollar for--

327
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:06,948
-: Tucker!

328
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:08,248
-: What?

329
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,416
-: Look at us!

330
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,652
Is this what our life is gonna
be like?

331
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,520
-: What choice do we have?

332
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,621
We can't get real jobs.

333
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:16,657
-: Of course.
-: Of course.

334
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:22,262
-: We can go to Fargo.

335
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,497
-: Sandrene, please be serious.

336
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,899
-: I am.

337
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:27,802
The competition, the Fargo
Theater.

338
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:30,470
This could be our chance to do
what we've always dreamed.

339
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:34,574
-: No, I will not cast my
theatrical pearls before...
bison.

340
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,944
-: You're missing the forest for
the trees.

341
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:39,212
We wouldn't have to worry about
money.

342
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,948
We'd live at my parents' ranch
and we'd

343
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:44,584
have the freedom to make
whatever we want.

344
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,187
Like a retreat.

345
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:49,423
-: A retreat.

346
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:53,861
Like the jungles of Siberia...

347
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:55,328
-: There are no jungles in
Siberia.

348
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,931
-: But nobody in Fargo would
have experience.

349
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,365
We'd have to start from scratch.

350
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,466
-: Exactly!

351
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:03,838
We'd have a blank canvas to
create whatever we want.

352
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,274
Also rent's due tomorrow, so
unless

353
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,810
your gold extractor's up and
running

354
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:12,312
we best start looking for a
tent.

355
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,246
-: Oh.

356
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,550
(upbeat mandolin music)

357
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:26,493
(train bell rings)

358
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,005
(cows mooing)

359
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,642
Ahh, the city gates.

360
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,880
At least we've arrived.

361
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:47,014
-: Yeah, but my parents' ranch

362
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:48,950
is still two miles down that
way.

363
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:50,650
-: Let's go.

364
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,719
-: We should've just stayed in
the car.

365
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:57,024
Tucker: Ahh, there she blows.

366
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,595
Sandrene: Mmm yes, the historic
Fargo Theater.

367
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:05,066
-: We would be its ideal
custodians.

368
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:06,500
-: Come with me.

369
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:13,473
(Tucker and Sandrene gasp)

370
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,312
-: This could be our Globe.

371
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,982
Though, you know,

372
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,283
Hopefully less flammable.

373
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,889
-: I used to sneak in here.

374
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:30,290
Pretend I was on Broadway.

375
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,328
Never actually got to perform
here though.

376
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:42,335
-: But soft, what light through
yonder window breaks?

377
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,405
It is the east.

378
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,307
And Juliet is the sun.

379
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,011
-: Oh Romeo, Romeo.

380
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,347
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

381
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:58,019
Deny thy father and refuse thy
name.

382
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:01,354
Or if thou wilt not, be but
sworn

383
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,891
my love and I will no longer
be--

384
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:05,725
Morten: Rothstein?

385
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:07,627
-: Mr. Mortenson?

386
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:11,032
-: Sandy Rothstein, live and in
person?

387
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:12,699
Treading the boards?

388
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,136
Oh fer cute, Sandy Rothstein.

389
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:18,906
How long has it been since our
legendary drama class?

390
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,373
You look wonderful!

391
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,042
-: So do you.

392
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:22,109
-: Thank you.

393
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:24,511
-: And actually I go by my stage
name St. Jean now.

394
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,013
-: Sandy St. Jean, I like that.

395
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:27,048
-: Sandrene.

396
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:28,983
-: Sandrene St. John, even
better.

397
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:30,017
-: Well you came up with it.

398
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:31,819
-: Well let's applaud me!

399
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:32,652
(Sandrene laughs)

400
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,155
-: Excuse me good sir, but we
were

401
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:36,523
in the throes of artistic
creation.

402
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,792
-: No no no, Tucker, this is Mr.
Mortenson.

403
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:40,161
My high school drama teacher.

404
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:41,461
He's the one that taught me how
to sing

405
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,396
and dance and get rid of my
accent

406
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,899
so I could make it in New York.

407
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:45,833
-: It's true.

408
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:46,934
And you are?

409
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:49,036
-: Tucker Charlemagne, if you
please.

410
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,638
-: Tucker's my fiance.

411
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,706
-: Oh.

412
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,075
Cute.

413
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:55,508
So what are you doing home, huh?

414
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,643
Visiting the folks?

415
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,046
-: No, we are here to start an
artistic

416
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,083
revolution and claim this
theater.

417
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:03,516
-: I see.

418
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,485
-: Oh, maybe you can help us
actually.

419
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,687
We need to cast our ensemble and
Mr. Mortenson

420
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:10,091
knows all the best actors in
town.

421
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:11,859
-: It's true, I do.

422
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:13,995
But I'm afraid they're not
available.

423
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:15,562
-: Why not?

424
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,065
-: Because they're in my
ensemble.

425
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,499
Ensemble!

426
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,534
(dance music)

427
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:22,769
Get out here, kids.

428
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:24,005
There you are.

429
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,572
Your body is your instrument.

430
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,042
You're a symphony, all of you.

431
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:29,576
Okay, no tension.

432
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,079
There you go, that's beautiful.

433
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,784
You see, a lot has changed since
you left, Sandy.

434
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:42,189
West Fargo High has cut the
drama department.

435
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:43,057
-: What?

436
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,757
Why?

437
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,591
-: They used the money to buy

438
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,460
an ice bath for the football
team.

439
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,562
So I had to go out on my own,
build my own

440
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,464
repertory company to perform all

441
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,466
the classics like we used to do.

442
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,769
And yes, there is a competition

443
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:58,672
for the theater, but it's
perfunctory.

444
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:02,076
The Red River Players are poised
to win.

445
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,744
We could use an immense talent
like yours.

446
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:05,980
(Tucker laughs)

447
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:07,781
-: Sandrene would never betray
me.

448
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,050
-: Tucker, please.

449
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,985
-: There's a dearth of local
talent here.

450
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:12,853
A lot of people auditioned.

451
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,754
If you want to see the rejects,
they're all

452
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:17,825
performing open mic night down
at the Sons of Norway.

453
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,126
Sandy.

454
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,027
You.

455
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:24,764
-: And so friend becomes foe.

456
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,633
-: Come on, I need to get a
drink.

457
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,036
-: Norway.

458
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,603
Ibsen, very good.

459
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,541
(chill hip hop music)

460
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:41,681
-: Good.

461
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,219
-: Well if only we were looking

462
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,221
for farmhands and cowpokes.

463
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,655
-: Don't fret, darling.

464
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,789
I'm gonna ask around.

465
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,225
We will find our band of merry

466
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,893
minstrels or my name isn't--

467
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:54,128
Hank: Sandy?

468
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,931
-: Oh my god, Hank!

469
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:58,866
(Hank laughs)

470
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,002
-: Look at you, Miss Thing.

471
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:04,537
How long has it been, seven
years?

472
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:07,707
-: Yeah, since that summer after
graduation.

473
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:08,575
Sure has.

474
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:09,743
-: How now?

475
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:10,744
-: Tucker, this is Hank.

476
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:11,879
Hank, this is Tucker.

477
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:13,014
-: Her partner.

478
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,682
Creatively, spiritually,

479
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,886
and soon to be... matrimonially.

480
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,654
-: And you told me you weren't
the marrying kind.

481
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,657
-: Yeah, well a lot has changed
since high school.

482
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,626
-: And yet here you are.

483
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:30,898
(crowd applauds)

484
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:31,798
-: Yes!

485
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,470
-: Tough crowd tonight, man.

486
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:40,241
-: Aw please, your music's just
lost on these fossils!

487
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:41,909
-: Oi Hank, you're up.

488
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:42,943
-: All right.

489
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:49,183
-: Who is that hayseed?

490
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:50,784
-: No, that "hayseed" is my
boyfriend

491
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:51,852
from high school, remember?

492
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,753
I told you about him many times.

493
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,588
-: He still seems very enamoréd.

494
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:56,623
-: Tuck, please.

495
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,025
He never left Fargo.

496
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,994
You know how that bothers me.

497
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:02,063
-: You don't seem botheréd.

498
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:04,832
-: Before our next act, I'm
obliged

499
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:08,768
to remind you all that the Red
River Players

500
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:11,338
will be presenting a medley from
their

501
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:14,809
production of Pirates of
Penzance

502
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:18,678
at the Fargo Theater competition
this month.

503
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:19,779
Whoop de doo.

504
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,923
Also, if you don't want to be a
part

505
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:32,625
of that musical theater drivel.

506
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:33,294
Dryvel?

507
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:34,261
Dribble?

508
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:36,263
-: Drivel, you were right the
first time.

509
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:37,131
-: Drivel.

510
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:38,665
Drivel, drivel.

511
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:42,203
And want to join a theatrical
revolution,

512
00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:45,239
find the handsome couple at the
bar.

513
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,676
And now, the man himself,
Buffalo Hank!

514
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,078
(crowd applauds)

515
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:53,314
-: His name is Buffalo Hank?

516
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,283
-: I'm gonna start with an oldie

517
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:59,719
but a goodie for a friend here
tonight.

518
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:02,655
I'm gonna need her to join me to
sing it.

519
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:03,991
Sandy, get up here!

520
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:04,892
Come on!

521
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:05,826
-: No thanks.

522
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,894
-: Come up here.

523
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:09,263
-: No no, I couldn't possibly.

524
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:10,931
-: Get on up there, girl!

525
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:12,366
Hank: Sandy Rothstein, get up
here!

526
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:14,201
-: Okay okay, fine.

527
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:16,237
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

528
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,073
(crowd applauds)

529
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:21,342
(acoustic guitar music)

530
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,311
-: I think you'll recognize

545
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:13,427
-: So Billy was thrown in jail,

546
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,030
covered in puke, wearing just
the helmet.

547
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,432
-: Hey screw you man, I still
had a flag around my waist.

548
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:19,300
-: Oh yeah, the flag!

549
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,501
(group laughs)

550
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,870
-: Wow, sounds like quite the
funeral.

551
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:23,770
-: Oh yeah.

552
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:30,177
So uh, Tuck.

553
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:32,346
How'd you meet Sandy?

554
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,746
-: Tucker.

555
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,216
Charlemagne. The First.

556
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:38,751
And Sandrene and I met doing a
production

557
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:42,089
of Romeo and Juliet in the park.

558
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:44,191
-: Aww, Central Park?

559
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:46,360
-: Thompson Square Park.

560
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:48,395
It was a movement based
interpretation

561
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:50,898
for the safe injection site.

562
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,035
-: So you really think you can

563
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:57,004
take on the Red River Players?

564
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:59,840
I mean they've performed
indoors.

565
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:06,080
-: Once I find my ensemble and
train them in the tradition

566
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:10,184
of the avant-garde we will be
unstoppable.

567
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:13,120
-: That what they call that
fancy scarf?

568
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:14,088
"Avant-garde"?

569
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,023
(group chuckles)

570
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:17,224
How about those red pants?

571
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:18,525
Are they a part of the costume?

572
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,893
Does that help you perform?

573
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:21,495
-: Oh for Pete's sake, stop it.

574
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,330
-: No, this isn't...

575
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,167
-: Tucker, we're razzing you,
man.

576
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:28,335
We're just having fun.

577
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:29,536
Billy: We're just razzing you!

578
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,105
We're having a good time!

579
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,206
Greta: Be sensitive.

580
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,073
-: Beloved!

581
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:36,143
(tense music)

582
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:40,047
Was the hope drunk wherein you
dressed yourself?

583
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,949
Hath it slept since?

584
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,851
-: Immersive theater attack.

585
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:47,488
-: And wakes it now to look so
green and pale,

586
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:52,192
At what it did so freely?

587
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:58,198
From this time, such I account

588
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,367
Thy love.

589
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:01,268
-: Oh my god.

590
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:03,137
This is a flash mob.

591
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,507
-: Art thou afeard to be the
same in thine own

592
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,110
act and valor as thou art in
desire?

593
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,246
Wouldst thou have that which
thou

594
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,015
esteem'st the ornament of life,

595
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,551
and live a coward in thine own
esteem?

596
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,386
-: Prithee peace!

597
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,956
I dare do all that may become a
man.

598
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,992
Who dares do more is none.

599
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,627
-: What beast was't then that
made you

600
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,929
break this enterprise to me?

601
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:31,832
(uplifting music)

602
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:42,943
(crowd gasps)

603
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:43,944
-: Hey!

604
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:46,146
We don't hit our women out here!

605
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,448
-: No no no no no!

606
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:50,517
(rock music)

607
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,086
-: It's a fight, it's a fight!

608
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,588
-: It's stage combat, you
simpleton!

609
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:55,923
Ow ow ow ow ow!

610
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:56,890
Yorick: Should we call the
police?

611
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:57,558
-: Go, go go go!

612
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:58,459
Sandrene: Get off of him!

613
00:25:58,492 --> 00:25:59,326
-: Sandrene!

614
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,294
Get him off!

615
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:02,329
(Sandrene shrieks)

616
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:05,532
(Tucker and Sandrene groan)

617
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,369
(wistful music)

618
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:14,942
(Tucker and Sandrene laugh)

619
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,425
(bluesy harmonica music)

620
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,026
-: So I hoisted up my britches,

621
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,095
gathered my things, and
hightailed it

622
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:37,498
out of the theater as fast as I
could.

623
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:38,932
-: Incredible.

624
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:42,336
-: But I do miss the sense of
community.

625
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:47,341
-: Well our theatrical
revolution could give you a
community.

626
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:48,509
-: Revolution?

627
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:50,010
Oh I don't know.

628
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:54,281
I'm already blacklisted in 47
States.

629
00:26:54,314 --> 00:26:56,383
-: Shall we make that 48?

630
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:57,985
Policeman: Okay now, rise and
shine.

631
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:58,652
Everybody out.

632
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:02,222
(electronic door buzzes)

633
00:27:05,492 --> 00:27:06,660
-: Tucker, hey, hi.

634
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:08,162
-: No, please, no photographs.

635
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:09,530
-: No no no, we were there.

636
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:10,497
Last night.

637
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:13,500
Here you go.

638
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:16,203
Hi, I'm Brady.

639
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:18,038
This is Jack.

640
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,674
-: What you guys did was
amazing.

641
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:22,509
-: Oh yeah, when you guys got in
that fight.

642
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:24,445
-: We wanna do what you guys do.

643
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:27,414
And we're not the only ones.

644
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:28,315
-: Jack!

645
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:31,251
What are you doing here?

646
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:33,554
Shouldn't you be at lacrosse
practice?

647
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:36,356
-: Mom, we agreed that if I got
into

648
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,625
a play I didn't have to do
lacrosse.

649
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:41,028
-: Yes, but the Red River
Players

650
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:43,163
did not see your special spark.

651
00:27:43,197 --> 00:27:44,998
-: Well these guys do.

652
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,568
Radio Policeman: We got a 419 on
I-12.

653
00:27:47,601 --> 00:27:49,303
-: 10-4, Captain Mikkelsen
responding.

654
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,004
I'll be there in five.

655
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:52,306
Stay out of trouble.

656
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,173
-: Yeah yeah.

657
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:54,241
Okay, bye mom.

658
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:56,076
Radio Policeman: Okie doke, bye
now.

659
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:03,517
-: They're here!

660
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,085
-: Hey everybody, this is Uther.

661
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:07,054
He can't see you so good, so.

662
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:08,021
Watch out for these chairs.

663
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:08,689
-: Oh thank you.

664
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:09,723
Jack: Told you they'd come.

665
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:10,657
Leah: As long as they'll sign

666
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:11,625
my community service forms.

667
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:13,327
Yorick: Are we picking teams?

668
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,295
-: Look at them, Sandrene.

669
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,397
So young, so raw, so--

670
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:18,699
-: Salutations everyone!

671
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:19,566
-: Hello.

672
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,268
-: They're perfect.

673
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:27,608
-: Now if we are going to devise
a play

674
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:30,177
that will win us that theater,
we need

675
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,281
to assess your individual
strengths so that

676
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:39,319
we may build them into our final
performance.

677
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:42,456
-: So we're not going to just

678
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:45,292
memorize lines and say them
good?

679
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:54,568
-: The stage is where you
arrive, not where you begin.

680
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:56,069
Write that down.

681
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,405
This is obviously going to take
a while,

682
00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:00,340
so let's clear out a rehearsal
space.

683
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:01,208
-: Wait!

684
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,143
We can't do that in here!

685
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:04,711
Lunch is in an hour.

686
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:09,383
-: We need a three dimensional
sketchpad

687
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:13,186
where artists can take risks,

688
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,588
fail,

689
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:17,157
and ultimately bear their open
wounds

690
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,594
to the healing salve of artistic
creation.

691
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:28,769
-: Oh, we need a room with some
open space to move around.

692
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:29,469
-: Oh!

693
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:31,171
-: Yes, that makes more sense.

694
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:31,973
-: That's what I said.

695
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:34,842
-: Well, what about the
Tankhouse?

696
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,310
-: The what?

697
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:38,779
-: It used to be the storeroom
for the lodge,

698
00:29:38,813 --> 00:29:41,181
but then the raccoons invaded,
so now

699
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:44,418
I just use it as my Aquavit
distillery.

700
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:48,221
(Uther sniffs)

701
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:50,257
-: Oh, I know that smell.

702
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:54,461
I squatted in here for a few
moons.

703
00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:58,332
Painted some self-portraits to
keep me company.

704
00:29:58,365 --> 00:29:59,633
(tense sting)

705
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:02,369
I didn't have a mirror.

706
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:03,905
-: They're very nice.

707
00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:05,539
(rhythmic drumming)

708
00:30:05,572 --> 00:30:09,409
All human progress has been in
pursuit of comfort.

709
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:10,644
Well guess what?

710
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:14,247
Comfort is the enemy of
creation.

711
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:15,749
Therefore, partner off.

712
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:18,886
One of you bend over, the other
vigorously

713
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,521
knead your partner's tailbone.

714
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:24,892
-: Get some real pressure in
there.

715
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,760
-: Try a fist.

716
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:29,429
-: I have a passion for the
technical side of theater.

717
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:30,797
Absolutely definitely not

718
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:33,600
the in-front-of-people side of
theater.

719
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:36,503
So this is pretty much my worst
nightmare.

720
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,171
-: Nina!

721
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:40,273
Speak the speech.

722
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:41,809
-: Can I please just take notes?

723
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:43,710
-: It'll be so easy.

724
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:47,648
The wonderful thing about Tucker
and me is we're always on

725
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,349
-: The same page.
-: The same page.

726
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:51,718
-: Mmm, yes, very often we are
thinking.

727
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:54,822
-: The same thoughts.
-: The same thing.

728
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,659
-: Whoa, nice, we got a couple
of naturals over here.

729
00:30:58,692 --> 00:30:59,526
-: Thank you.

730
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,627
-: How does that feel?

731
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:02,295
-: My buddy came to visit North
Dakota the other day

732
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:04,364
and he was complaining about the
cold.

733
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:05,666
And I said what'd you expect?

734
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:08,635
It's got "coat" right in the
name!

735
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:09,536
-: Ha!

736
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,476
-: I want you to be.

737
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,313
-: Slippery as a noodle.
-: Stiff as a board.

738
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:20,982
-: Perfect technique.

739
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:21,849
-: Lovely pressure.

740
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:22,950
-: The point, the point.

741
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:24,785
There you go, really dig in
there.

742
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,420
Yorick: Geez Leah, ow.

743
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:27,487
-: I'm Leah.

744
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:29,790
I'm the founder of the militant
wing

745
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:32,592
of Fargo's women's alliance The
Pink Panthers.

746
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:36,363
Every month I bleed in a cycle,
I howl at the moon!

747
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,665
(Leah howls)

748
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:41,501
(group applauds)

749
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:45,873
-: Like a bolt of lighting!

750
00:31:45,907 --> 00:31:46,908
-: Swimming in noodles-

751
00:31:46,941 --> 00:31:47,942
-: Shooting up your spine-

752
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:49,811
-: Whether 'tis nobler...

753
00:31:49,844 --> 00:31:52,412
-: I didn't really fit in as a
kid.

754
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:54,414
The more I got into history,

755
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:57,684
the more I realized my true
identity.

756
00:31:57,718 --> 00:32:00,687
I am the reincarnated Sweyn
Forkbeard.

757
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,522
And the Tankhouse is a great

758
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:05,325
outlet for my warrior
tendencies.

759
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:06,961
-: Okay, all right, let's go
over this one more time.

760
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:09,463
It's called "stage combat" so
that

761
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:12,365
you don't actually have to hit
me.

762
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,803
See, you did it again...

763
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,306
(Nina sobbing)

764
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:20,707
-: Take five!

765
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:21,943
-: I think we're really getting
somewhere.

766
00:32:21,976 --> 00:32:26,346
-: Ever since my ill-fated
attempt at DIY laser eye
surgery,

767
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:29,917
I have mastered the scent-driven
lifestyle.

768
00:32:30,717 --> 00:32:35,589
I am the master of my body in
space!

769
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,025
-: Watch out, watch out!

770
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:38,926
-: My mead!

771
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:43,064
-: That was a choice.

00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:58,645
-: I don't sing without the
music.

777
00:32:58,678 --> 00:33:01,949
-: Well let's see what happens
if you do.

778
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:06,419

00:33:56,503 --> 00:33:57,771
You're so tight.

787
00:33:58,438 --> 00:34:02,375
Excuse me, this is an active art
zone.

788
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:03,410
-: Oh, sorry.

789
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:06,780
I heard there was an audition
here?

790
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:07,747
Sandy.

791
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:08,682
It's me.

792
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:09,817
Mackenzie.

793
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:12,954
I was a freshman when you were a
senior at Fargo High.

794
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:14,121
When you were Fantine in Les Mis

795
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:16,456
I was starving prisoner number
two.

796
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,027
We actually swapped mics after I
died in the first scene.

797
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:20,928
-: Yes!

798
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:22,864
Kenzie!

799
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:26,033
(Sandrene and Mackenzie laugh)

800
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:26,968
-: Oh yeah.

801
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:29,170
I'd always have to go off
looking for you.

802
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:32,572
You were usually huddled away in
some corner with Hank.

803
00:34:32,606 --> 00:34:33,908
You guys were so cute.

804
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:35,675
-: Well thanks for coming in
today.

805
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:38,112
-: Don't just skulk there like a
street urchin.

806
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:40,114
State your credentials.

807
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:41,182
-: Oh.

808
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:42,482
(clears throat)

809
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:43,885
Mackenzie Billingham.

810
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,419
CCM class of 2021.

811
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:49,656
BFA musical theater with a
concentration on acting.

812
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:52,559
(Tucker snickers)

813
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:55,729
-: Musical theater "acting?"

814
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,530
(Tucker laughs)

815
00:34:57,564 --> 00:35:00,634
More like musical theater
schmacting.

816
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,075
-: I've actually been
specializing in sense memory.

817
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:10,777
So I've been reading up on Lee.

818
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,747
-: Who's Lee?

819
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,982
-: Strasberg!
-: Strasberg!

820
00:35:15,016 --> 00:35:18,886
-: Lee Strasberg, the founder of
the method.

821
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,820
-: The method?

822
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:21,488
-: Isn't that what killed that
Joker guy?

823
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:22,489
-: Yes.

824
00:35:22,522 --> 00:35:24,758
That's how you knew he was doing
it correctly.

825
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:25,659
-: Okay.

826
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,997
(tense music)

827
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:34,068
-: Let's see how sensitive your
memory really is.

828
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:37,771
(whimsical music)

829
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:38,672
-: Okay.

830
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:42,642
I'm in a hallway and...

831
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:47,081
I can smell my grandma's chicken
soup.

832
00:35:47,114 --> 00:35:48,581
(soup boiling)

833
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:49,482
-: Mmm.

834
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,489
-: I can hear the gentle summer
rain hitting the skylight.

835
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:57,892
(rain falling)

836
00:35:57,925 --> 00:36:01,228
I'm walking past the dark wooden
door.

837
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:04,098
With the brass handle carved by
my grandpa Sven.

838
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:05,732
Brady: I'm not sure you carve
brass.

839
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:06,599
-: Go on.

840
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:07,935
Open it.

841
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:08,836
-: No.

842
00:36:09,703 --> 00:36:11,238
No, I can't.

843
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:13,808
It's always locked, that's my
dad's office.

844
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:15,508
(ghostly echos)

845
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:18,980
-: You know where the key is
hidden don't you?

846
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:22,515
-: It's in the fern next to the
door.

847
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:23,884
-: Grab it.

848
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:24,784
Open it.

849
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,754
-: I don't want to.

850
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:29,056
-: Open it!
-: Open it!

851
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,558
(Mackenzie screams)

852
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:33,094
-: It's my dad!

853
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:36,130
Fucking our tennis coach Jim!

854
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:37,731
I hate you!

855
00:36:37,764 --> 00:36:40,533
I hate you dad, screw you!

856
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,103
-: Yes!
-: Well done, dear.

857
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:43,636
-: It's always those locked
doors.

858
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,239
-: You guys are sick.

859
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:46,673
Yorick: I wanna go next.

860
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,242
-: That was amazing.

861
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:50,077
-: Brilliant.

862
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:52,645
So what do we call ourselves?

863
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:58,052
(playful sneak music)

864
00:37:00,787 --> 00:37:01,956
-: Pst!

865
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,858
The Tankhouse Theater.

866
00:37:05,692 --> 00:37:08,728
Their leader, Tucker, says he
wants to start

867
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:10,797
some sort of a theatrical
revolution.

868
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:11,866
-: Oh please.

869
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,868
He's all hat and no cattle.

870
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,735
Fargoans are gonna see through
him

871
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:17,872
like long johns in a
thunderstorm.

872
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:18,839
-: No.

873
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:19,907
No, they're good.

874
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,276
They got me emotional.

875
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:24,979
I'm never actually emotional
onstage.

876
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:26,814
-: You can be emotional
sometimes.

877
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:27,647
-: Okay, thank you.

878
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,516
-: I mean I don't always believe
you,

879
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:30,583
but yeah yeah yeah, you're
emotional.

880
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:31,819
-: Aww, that's really nice of
you.

881
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:32,752
-: Just get to the point.

882
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:33,454
-: Okay okay.

883
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:34,288
So they're gonna do something

884
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:35,890
called an immersive theater
attack

885
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:37,324
at the farmer's market on
Sunday.

886
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:39,793
Apparently it's gonna shake this
town to its core.

887
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,228
-: I'm not gonna let some
foppish dandy

888
00:37:41,262 --> 00:37:43,630
take this theater away from me.

889
00:37:43,663 --> 00:37:44,932
Here's what I want you to do.

890
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:46,233
I want you to infiltrate the
group,

891
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:47,902
make yourself indispensable, and
then once

892
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,669
you've earned their trust, just
yank

893
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,771
the carpet right out from under
them.

894
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:55,109
-: Mr. Mortenson, call me a
calculator.

895
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:57,644
'Cause you can count on me.

896
00:37:57,677 --> 00:37:59,013
-: Did you just say that out
loud?

897
00:37:59,046 --> 00:37:59,880
-: I'm so sorry.

898
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:00,580
-: Just get outta here.

899
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:01,748
-: Okay, yeah, no, I'm sorry.

900
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:02,615
-: Hey Sandy!

901
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:04,018
Here, let me help you.

902
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,853
-: No, I really gotta get these
back to the theater.

903
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:07,154
We're only taking a five for
dinner.

904
00:38:07,188 --> 00:38:08,022
Thank you.

905
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:08,721
-: I feel real bad about what
happened

906
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:10,157
at the bar the other night.

907
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:11,292
-: No, don't even worry about
it.

908
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:14,028
-: No, seriously, not cool on my
part.

909
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:16,163
You guys seem like you make a
good match.

910
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:17,164
-: Well thank you.

911
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:19,200
I appreciate that.

912
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:21,734
-: I was just really pumped to
see you.

913
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:23,670
You know, my mom had a little
party

914
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:25,738
to watch your Rookie Badge
episode.

915
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:26,706
-: What?

916
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,375
I had like two lines in that.

917
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:29,243
That's so sweet.

918
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:31,278
-: No, seriously, when you told
that cop

919
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:32,880
the suspect threw the girl's
remains

920
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:35,216
into the dumpster, I totally
bought it.

921
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:36,984
(Sandrene laughs)

922
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:41,355
So can you still audition for
stuff out here?

923
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:43,257
How does that work?

924
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,258
-: Yeah, I mean kinda.

925
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:46,793
I can self-tape for stuff.

926
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,896
Actually, I just ran into this
agent guy in New York.

927
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:51,132
He said he'd started sending me
out more.

928
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:53,134
But who knows about that, you
know?

929
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,034
-: Whoa.

930
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:56,170
That's awesome.

931
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:58,671
-: Yeah.

932
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:02,009
Yeah, I guess it is kinda cool.

933
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:05,279
Well, thank you.

934
00:39:05,312 --> 00:39:06,280
This is my stop.

935
00:39:06,313 --> 00:39:11,318
-: Hey, if you ever need help
with all that,

936
00:39:11,352 --> 00:39:12,920
Let me know.

937
00:39:12,953 --> 00:39:14,221
-: Thank you.

938
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:17,258
-: As long as you thank me in
your Oscar speech.

939
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:20,060
-: If I had a nickel for every
time someone asked me that.

940
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:22,029
(Sandrene and Hank laugh)

941
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:23,197
Okay, I'll see you.

942
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,131
-: Yup, okay.

943
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:24,999
Break a leg!

944
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:25,665
Sandrene: Thanks!

945
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:28,402
-: Five, six, seven, eight.

946
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:29,336
Yup.

947
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,438
Okay, that's not it at all.

948
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:32,273
That's okay.

949
00:39:32,306 --> 00:39:34,308
Just lift up your hands like
this.

950
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:35,342
-: Mackenzie.

951
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:41,415
So after some reflection, I
think that we should

952
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:43,250
make the truth you spoke about
your father

953
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:45,752
the centerpiece of our
performance on the morrow, hmm?

954
00:39:45,785 --> 00:39:46,820
-: Oh.

955
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:48,489
Oh I love that idea.

956
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:50,124
I'm so ready to share that with
the world.

957
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:52,792
-: Yeah, me too, but it is a
great responsibility.

958
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:55,728
Do you think you can execute?

959
00:39:55,762 --> 00:39:57,398
-: You can count on me.

960
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:00,367
-: Like a calculator.

961
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:02,836
Oh.

962
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,206
Uh-uh-uh, director eats first!

963
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,007
Nina: And antibacterial hand
wipes.

964
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,309
Please take one.

965
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:12,745
-: Titania.

966
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:15,082
Come in Titania, are the players
in position?

967
00:40:15,115 --> 00:40:18,819
-: Oberon, everyone is in
position except Mackenzie.

968
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:19,987
She hasn't checked in yet

969
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,056
and I don't see her anywhere.

970
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,257
-: We should do it now.

971
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,993
Lydia's here, she's the head
judge of the competition.

972
00:40:26,026 --> 00:40:27,261
Where is Mackenzie?

973
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:27,928
-: I don't know.

974
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:28,862
Don't worry about McKenzie.

975
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:29,796
She's the most professional of
the bunch.

976
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:33,334
Sandrene: Well everyone else is
in place.

977
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,836
-: Good work, Titania.

978
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:36,804
Oberon out.

979
00:40:44,211 --> 00:40:45,946
Ladies and gentlemen!

980
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,549
My name is Tucker Charlemagne.

981
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:51,318
And I'm afraid I have some
terrible news.

982
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:52,853
There's been a murder!

983
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:54,255
(crowd gasps)

984
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:55,788
Over there!

985
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:56,857
Come with me.

986
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:58,826
Follow!

987
00:40:58,859 --> 00:40:59,860
Quickly!

988
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:02,896
Townsfolk, stay on my heels!

989
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,965
Just around this vehicle.

990
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:08,068
No!

991
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:11,572
Oh my goodness!

992
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:13,073
What a disaster!

993
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:17,144
But look, she's still alive.

994
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:19,380
Beloved, who did this to you?

995
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:20,547
-: It was...

996
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:21,548
It was him!

997
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:23,017
(dramatic piano sting)

998
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,485
(Yorick evil laughs)

999
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:26,020
(crowd gasps)

1000
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:27,787
-: He's getting away!

1001
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:30,591
-: I can find him!

1002
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,326
-: Quick, lead us.

1003
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:33,494
-: But I am weak.

1004
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:34,395
Catch me.

1005
00:41:35,863 --> 00:41:36,864
-: You there.

1006
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:38,899
-: What can I do?

1007
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:40,601
I'm just a kid.

1008
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:44,571
-: Play that piano like her life
depends on it.

1009
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:45,606
-: Okay.

1010
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:49,376
(upbeat synthesizer music)

1011
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,513
What an authentic expression of
care.

1012
00:41:52,546 --> 00:41:57,885
-: I'm no expert, but
authenticity seems to strengthen
him.

1013
00:41:57,918 --> 00:41:59,386
-: That way!

1014
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,354
-: Oh my god.

1015
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:02,589
-: Well if you don't want me to
be anorexic.

1016
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,457
-: Shh fourth wall-

1017
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,391
Hey come on, let's go!

1018
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:05,059
-: That way!

1019
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:07,561
Come on everybody, let's go!

1020
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:12,966
This way, let's go, let's go.

1021
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,401
Inside, thank you, inside.

1022
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:15,436
-: There's the beast!

1023
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,371
(Yorick evil laughs)

1024
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:18,205
(crowd gasps)

1025
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:21,542
-: I have killed your precious
art!

1026
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:24,545
My power is greater than ever
and there's

1027
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:27,181
nothing you can do as stop me!

1028
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:29,950
-: Oh god!

1029
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:32,553
There's no hope.

1030
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:37,491
How can we ever save art?

1031
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:40,594
-: Bringing him down will take

1032
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:43,931
a truth bomb of epic
proportions!

1033
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:45,332
-: Yes.

1034
00:42:45,366 --> 00:42:46,333
Yes.

1035
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:47,301
Yes!

1036
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:50,137
Quickly, does anyone have a
truth that needs

1037
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,073
to be spoken that hasn't been
given voice before?

1038
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:55,008
Do you have a...

1039
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:55,676
What about you?

1040
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:58,545
Come on, a secret, a truth?

1041
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,147
Come on, please, anyone, anyone.

1042
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,081
Do you have a truth?

1043
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:01,982
Please, anybody.

1044
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,617
Anybody, a truth?

1045
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,918
What about...

1046
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:07,621
You!

1047
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:13,260
(crowd murmuring)

1048
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,633
I say, a truth that hasn't been
spoken!

1049
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:30,144
Nothing about a dad?

1050
00:43:30,177 --> 00:43:31,245
Tennis coach?

1051
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,182
A door? okay.

1052
00:43:38,085 --> 00:43:39,520
-: Okay.

1053
00:43:39,553 --> 00:43:41,622
-: All right, very well.

1054
00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:43,590
I shall do this myself.

1055
00:43:45,526 --> 00:43:47,961
From the dawn of time- not right
now.

1056
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:50,164
From the dawn of time,

1057
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:52,266
-: No, but if it's all the same
to you,

1058
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:55,235
there is a pretty big truth that
I,

1059
00:43:55,904 --> 00:43:57,604
we, would like to get off our
chest.

1060
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:58,672
-: Dude, not now.

1061
00:43:58,705 --> 00:43:59,573
Seriously.

1062
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:02,176
-: It is going to be okay.

1063
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:03,043
-: Brady!

1064
00:44:03,076 --> 00:44:03,912
-: I promise.

1065
00:44:03,944 --> 00:44:05,746
-: Hey, what's going on here,
kiddo?

1066
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:07,481
-: Dear town!

1067
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:08,449
Jack and I.

1068
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:12,719
We're together.

1069
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:14,521
(crowd murmuring)

1070
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:17,157
(tense music)

1071
00:44:29,703 --> 00:44:31,271
-: You guys.

1072
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:34,107
(crowd applauds)

1073
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:40,781
(Sandrene giggles)

1074
00:44:40,815 --> 00:44:42,449
-: Called that.

1075
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:43,784
-: Die.

1076
00:44:43,818 --> 00:44:47,688
(Yorick death cries)

1077
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:50,290
(Sandrene gasps)

1078
00:44:50,324 --> 00:44:52,159
-: It's gonna be okay.

1079
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,060
-: Oh yes.

1080
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,732
All: Art is truth brought to
life,

1081
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:01,735
and the truth shall set you
free!

1082
00:45:01,768 --> 00:45:04,571
(crowd applauds)

1083
00:45:07,508 --> 00:45:09,443
-: Beloved, how amazing!

1084
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:19,219
-: What an unmitigated disaster.

1085
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:22,055
-: Darling, it turned out better
than what we had planned.

1086
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:23,657
Let's just go back to the ranch,

1087
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,593
have a bacchanal, and move
forward okay?

1088
00:45:26,627 --> 00:45:27,594
Brady: Wait, I'm confused.

1089
00:45:27,628 --> 00:45:28,830
That was amazing, right guys?

1090
00:45:28,863 --> 00:45:30,664
-: Did you hear the applause?

1091
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:33,200
-: Yeah, the crowd loved it.

1092
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,002
-: No!

1093
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:35,569
If we don't have artists
committed

1094
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:37,504
to our work, then what do we
have?

1095
00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:38,605
Mackenzie: Hey!

1096
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:41,241
(tense music)

1097
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:47,347
-: What happened to you?

1098
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:49,851
-: You really thought I'd join
your group of misfits?

1099
00:45:49,884 --> 00:45:51,184
(Mackenzie laughs)

1100
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:53,353
-: That was cute back there!

1101
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:55,589
I wouldn't call it theater, per
se.

1102
00:45:55,622 --> 00:45:57,825
More like a prank really.

1103
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:00,427
-: You two gathered to conspire
against us?

1104
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,296
-: Good luck to you, Kenzie.

1105
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,197
Have fun in a dance studio

1106
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:06,266
conforming for the rest of your
life.

1107
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,236
(Tucker and Sandrene laugh)

1108
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:13,740
-: The way I see it, you're like
the boy who cried wolf.

1109
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:16,410
Your little trick can only last
for so long.

1110
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:18,478
People will catch on.

1111
00:46:18,512 --> 00:46:20,347
And when they do, you can kick

1112
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,784
and scream and prank all you
want.

1113
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:25,452
No one will listen.

1114
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:27,822
-: Mr. Mortenson, what happened
to you?

1115
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,623
You used to be such a
sweetheart.

1116
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:32,726
-: Sandy, you had such promise
in the day, come join us.

1117
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:34,127
You don't belong with these
people.

1118
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,195
-: No way.

1119
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:36,797
-: There's no way she would
sully her lily white

1120
00:46:36,831 --> 00:46:39,399
hands with your crowd-pleasing
drivel.

1121
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:40,667
(actors murmuring)

1122
00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:43,270
Yorick: Drivel, I know that one.

1123
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:44,304
-: All right.

1124
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:47,909
Let's settle this right now.

1125
00:46:47,942 --> 00:46:50,344
A Modern Major General-off.

1126
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:51,244
Just you and me.

1127
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:52,613
(tense music)

1128
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:53,881
Yorick: Should I get my sword?

1129
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:55,482
Uther: I smell trouble brewing.

1130
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:56,650
-: A Modern Major General-off?

1131
00:46:56,683 --> 00:46:58,285
I've never seen one in real
life.

1132
00:46:58,318 --> 00:46:59,386
-: What's a Modern Major
General-off?

1133
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:01,154
-: "I Am the Very Model of a
Modern Major-General"

1134
00:47:01,188 --> 00:47:03,490
is the fastest song in the
English language canon.

1135
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:05,425
-: Major General-offs have been
illegal since two

1136
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:09,696
RSC members tried it in 1984 and
broke their jaws.

1137
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,165
-: Betrothéd, let me do this.

1138
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:14,735
-: No darling, this is extremely
perilous.

1139
00:47:14,768 --> 00:47:15,602
-: I know.

1140
00:47:15,636 --> 00:47:16,904
He taught me the part in high
school.

1141
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:18,672
I can beat him.

1142
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:20,374
-: Come on!

1143
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:22,776
We gonna do this or what?

1144
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:23,644
-: I love you.

1145
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:24,544
-: Wait.

1146
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:27,481
En garde.

1246
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:47,808
to discover the true purpose of
theater,

1247
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:50,443

-: It is absolutely not a thing.

1251
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:59,586
-: What do you, explain your
point with words please.

1252
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,088
-: When you're dancing with the
lighting,

1253
00:52:01,122 --> 00:52:02,857
and dancers, and your lighting
with dancers,

1254
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:05,993
you wanna see their angles and
the bodies and the shapes.

1255
00:52:06,027 --> 00:52:06,994
-: Look, poppet.

1256
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:07,962
-: Huh?

1257
00:52:07,995 --> 00:52:10,730
-: The group is really starting
to "cohese."

1258
00:52:10,764 --> 00:52:13,834
-: Yes, it's like they're
melting together

1259
00:52:13,868 --> 00:52:18,505
like a Croque Monsieur.

1260
00:52:18,538 --> 00:52:19,206
-: You mad?

1261
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:25,046
-: Did you consider maybe I
didn't wanna

1262
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,916
come out to the whole farmer's
market?

1263
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:31,785

about, man?

1264
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:33,586
I mean your mom?

1265
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,622
Dude, she was totally happy.

1266
00:52:35,655 --> 00:52:38,259

watching.

1267
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:41,996
This town is mad conservative,
dude.

1268
00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:43,563
You have no idea.

1269
00:52:48,568 --> 00:52:49,703
-: I do though.

1270
00:52:58,545 --> 00:52:59,447
-: Don't do that.

1271
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:02,749
-: Boys, what is doing on over
here huh?

1272
00:53:02,782 --> 00:53:07,620
-: Nothing like a little
showmance to spice up the gumbo.

1273
00:53:07,654 --> 00:53:09,622
-: Did we ever tell you about
the first time

1274
00:53:09,656 --> 00:53:11,524
that Sandrene and I made love?

1275
00:53:11,558 --> 00:53:12,893
-: Why do you guys smell like
garlic?

1276
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:15,595
-: It was a cast party just like
this one.

1277
00:53:15,628 --> 00:53:16,897
-: Just let me out first.

1278
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:18,798
Just let me out first!

1279

1282
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:28,175
Can I get 10 extra large with

1283
00:53:28,209 --> 00:53:30,011

("call waiting" beeps)

00:53:37,952 --> 00:53:39,053
Mr. Marlow.

1287
00:53:39,086 --> 00:53:41,788
Is that a scimitar or are you
just happy to see me?

1288
00:53:41,822 --> 00:53:44,691
(Tucker chuckles)

1289
00:53:46,093 --> 00:53:47,161

1290
00:53:50,364 --> 00:53:51,899
A self-tape?

1291
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:52,799
Really?

00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:54,869
Yeah.

Yeah, okay.

00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:37,644
the energy centers around the
pelvic floor.

1308
00:54:37,677 --> 00:54:39,046
-: Ooh yeah, that's good.

1309
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,749
Tucker: Trust the process,
children.

1310
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:44,151
Yorick: Oh Brady, look what you
did.

1311
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:45,219
(Yorick chuckles)

1312
00:54:45,252 --> 00:54:46,153
-: Oh my god, no!

1313
00:54:46,187 --> 00:54:47,154
I'm done with this!

1314
00:54:47,188 --> 00:54:49,056
-: All right, calm down
everybody, calm down.

1315
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,357
I know it's wet, I know it's
cold, all right?

1316
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:51,658
But we're gonna do a couple more

1317
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:53,828
sacrum scrubs and then it's back
to town.

1318
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:55,963
(trumpet blaring)

1319
00:54:55,996 --> 00:54:57,031
Sandrene: Darling, look.

1320
00:54:57,064 --> 00:54:57,865
The Squire.

1321
00:54:57,898 --> 00:55:00,733
-: All the way from New York
City?

1322
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,939
Ah.

1323
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,173
Good Squire.

1324
00:55:06,207 --> 00:55:07,808
What news bring you?

1325
00:55:07,842 --> 00:55:09,310
-: Hear ye, hear ye!

1326
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:13,214
I come bearing tragic news!

1327
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:16,851
It is with great sorrow that I
inform you that

1328
00:55:16,884 --> 00:55:20,955
Buford Schlesinger, the honored
artistic director

1329
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:24,959
of the Artist's Atelier, after
his decades-long

1330
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:29,296
battle with gout, has passed
away!

1331
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:32,066
(actors murmur)

1332
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:33,901
-: No no no no no!

1333
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:36,871
(Tucker crying)

1334
00:55:36,904 --> 00:55:37,770
No!

1335
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:40,174
Buford!

1336
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,045
No!

1337
00:55:46,713 --> 00:55:47,381
Buford!

1338
00:55:48,282 --> 00:55:49,984
Why?

1339
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:52,920
-: I don't know what this is
about right now.

1340
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:54,889
-: Rehearsals dismissed!

1341
00:55:58,058 --> 00:56:00,693
-: I'm sorry, but we kinda got a
ride with you--

1342
00:56:00,727 --> 00:56:01,896
-: Get another ride!

1343
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,332
-: Absolutely, totally
understand.

1344
00:56:05,366 --> 00:56:06,867
We'll figure it out.

1345
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:08,903
(Squire crying)

1346
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:10,838
♪ Why take it ♪

1347
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:13,274
♪ It is thine ♪

1348
00:56:14,808 --> 00:56:16,076
-: Again.

1349
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,378
-: I can't, Mr. Mortenson.

1350
00:56:17,411 --> 00:56:18,946
I've done it a thousand times.

1351
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:20,080
-: Again please!

1352
00:56:20,114 --> 00:56:24,218
-: I'm literally dying up here,
I can't do this anymore!

1353
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:25,085
-: You're dying?

1354
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,887
From singing a song?

1355
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:27,754
Get her outta here.

1356
00:56:27,787 --> 00:56:30,991
Get her smelling salts for all I
care.

1357
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:31,926
Hey!

1358
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:33,726
Lisa, Ashley, what the hell are
you doing?

1359
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,964
I told you, no cell phones in
the rehearsal space.

1360
00:56:36,997 --> 00:56:40,100
-: Why don't we ever get to
massage each other?

1361
00:56:40,134 --> 00:56:42,203
-: What the hell are you talking
about?

1362
00:56:42,236 --> 00:56:44,505
-: Brady is posting them all at
the Tankhouse cast party.

1363
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:46,773
It looks so fun.

1364
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:48,108
-: I'm so jealous.

1365
00:56:48,142 --> 00:56:51,812
All of their warmups are
clothing optional.

1366
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,449
-: Theater is about hard work.

1367
00:56:55,482 --> 00:56:56,984
Precision.

1368
00:56:57,017 --> 00:56:57,885
Pain.

1369
00:56:58,852 --> 00:57:01,055
It's not some bordello.

1370
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:02,056
-: Well maybe if you had more
fun

1371
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:03,991
you wouldn't have lost the
Major-General off.

1372
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:05,025
-: Excuse me?

1373
00:57:05,725 --> 00:57:08,329
-: Just doing a tongue stretch.

1374
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,270
-: Well it won't be fun when I
show Captain Mikkelsen this.

1375
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:18,005
(Tucker crying)

1376
00:57:18,038 --> 00:57:19,406
-: Oh Buford!

1377
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,909
Why would you leave me here?

1378
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:27,881
(mischievous music)

1379
00:57:30,985 --> 00:57:34,555
-: Pretty cool getting to be a
part of the movie magic.

1380
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:38,125
Hope I can do uh... "Logan"
justice.

1381
00:57:38,158 --> 00:57:40,060
-: Yeah, hold on, sorry.

1382
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:41,128
The lighting is perfect right
now,

1383
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:42,296
so if we could just get started

1384
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:44,131
'cause they're casting this off
the tape.

1385
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:46,934
And it's for the CW, so I need
to look CW-ish.

1386
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:47,968
-: Whoa!

1387
00:57:48,002 --> 00:57:49,303
CW.

1388
00:57:49,336 --> 00:57:53,407
Are you gonna be a sexy witch or
a sexy werewolf?

1389
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:55,809
I'm kidding.

1390
00:57:56,543 --> 00:57:57,478
-: Okay, let's get going.

1391
00:57:57,511 --> 00:57:59,146
Tucker's guru just died and I
need to hold

1392
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:02,549
the bucket for him while he
purges his grief.

1393
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:03,951
-: Wait.

1394
00:58:03,984 --> 00:58:06,820
Does he know you're here?

1395
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:08,589
-: Tuck really hates network
television.

1396
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:11,091
He thinks it's "lulling the
masses into a stupor

1397
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:14,361
"while they get disenfranchised
by the ruling class."

1398
00:58:16,397 --> 00:58:17,531
Or something.

1399
00:58:17,564 --> 00:58:21,168
(Hank and Sandrene laugh)

1400
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:25,873
I know he's a lot, and I know
you don't

1401
00:58:25,906 --> 00:58:28,409
understand him, but he's
passionate

1402
00:58:28,442 --> 00:58:32,479
and ambitious and driven and
we...

1403
00:58:32,513 --> 00:58:34,348
Need each other.

1404
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:38,852
-: But you can't be honest with
each other?

1405
00:58:38,886 --> 00:58:43,957
You always told me that your big
dream was to be on TV.

1406
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:44,858
-: It was.

1407
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:48,128
It is.

1408
00:58:50,331 --> 00:58:51,198
-: Well.

1409
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:55,269
Is Tucker a part of that dream?

1410
00:58:57,905 --> 00:59:00,307
(tense music)

1411
00:59:01,442 --> 00:59:04,178
-: Come here come here come
here.

1412
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,581
-: Thank you so much.

1413
00:59:07,614 --> 00:59:09,083
You're the best.

1414
00:59:12,252 --> 00:59:13,620
-: Okay.

1415
00:59:13,654 --> 00:59:16,990
(playful sneak music)

1416
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:19,493
-: Pauline.

1417
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:20,494
-: Whoa!

1418
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:22,396
Morten, what are you doing
hiding down there

1419
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:26,033
like a pregnant possum in a
pumpkin patch?

1420
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:29,403
What has gotten into you?

1421
00:59:29,436 --> 00:59:30,904
Seems like everyone around here
is losing

1422
00:59:30,938 --> 00:59:34,208
their right minds over this
competition.

1423
00:59:35,509 --> 00:59:38,011
-: Something I wanna show you.

1424
00:59:38,045 --> 00:59:38,912
-: Huh?

1425
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:46,487
Oh.

1426
00:59:48,422 --> 00:59:51,024
-: Did you sleep at all last
night, darling?

1427
00:59:51,058 --> 00:59:51,892
-: I'm not sure.

1428
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:55,929
I took about eight Melatonin at
5 AM.

1429
00:59:55,963 --> 00:59:57,431
I just can't stop thinking about

1430
00:59:57,464 --> 01:00:00,234
the last thing that Buford ever
said to me.

1431
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:03,670
I was to find the true purpose
of theater.

1432
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:07,207
-: Well we've brought people
together

1433
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:10,010
and helped them find their
voices as artists.

1434
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:11,512
And our final performance can be
a place

1435
01:00:11,545 --> 01:00:15,482
to showcase what makes our
ensemble so special.

1436
01:00:17,084 --> 01:00:17,718
-: No.

1437
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:18,619
-: No?

1438
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:19,753
-: No.

1439
01:00:19,787 --> 01:00:24,725
Buford sent me here to redefine
theater as we know it.

1440
01:00:24,758 --> 01:00:25,759
-: Oh is that what he said?

1441
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:29,062
-: And these people will be the
raw materials

1442
01:00:29,096 --> 01:00:31,064
with which I craft my
masterpiece!

1443
01:00:31,098 --> 01:00:33,100
-: Tucker, you're getting
carried away.

1444
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:34,501
-: Hey Tucker?

1445
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:36,370
Yorick and I have been
channeling our rage

1446
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:38,539
into this really cool stage
combat sequence

1447
01:00:38,572 --> 01:00:40,374
that we think would be great for
the finale.

1448
01:00:40,407 --> 01:00:42,376
-: Ooh, and I can't wait to try
out my crowd work.

1449
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:43,510
-: Thank you all for your
suggestions,

1450
01:00:43,544 --> 01:00:45,179
but they will not be necessary.

1451
01:00:45,212 --> 01:00:46,280
-: Tucker.

1452
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:48,182
-: I've been very clear with you
all from the outset.

1453
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:51,318
Our mission here is to create a
theatrical revolution

1454
01:00:51,351 --> 01:00:52,753
so that I may take my rightful
place

1455
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:55,155
at the apex of the avant-garde.

1456
01:00:55,189 --> 01:00:58,459
Now Buford's death, I'm sorry,
confirms.

1457
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,395
That my time is now.

1458
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:06,667
-: So, like, we've all never
been totally sure who Buford is?

1459
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:07,501
-: Yeah.
-: Yeah.

1460
01:01:07,534 --> 01:01:09,036
-: That's very funny.

1461
01:01:11,772 --> 01:01:14,274
Ladies and gentlemen, there
comes a point

1462
01:01:14,308 --> 01:01:17,010
in every artist's journey where
he, or she,

1463
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:19,580
must take a step back from
creating their own work

1464
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:22,516
and take part in the equally
fulfilling task

1465
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:25,285
of executing other people's
instructions!

1466
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:26,153
-: Ha.

1467
01:01:27,654 --> 01:01:29,590
-: I'm sorry, Nina.

1468
01:01:29,623 --> 01:01:30,657
Something humorous?

1469
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:32,793
-: That's exactly what Morton
said when I demoed

1470
01:01:32,827 --> 01:01:35,195
my take for the lighting design
of Pirates.

1471
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:37,064
-: Yes dear, weren't you the one

1472
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:39,533
that teased them about
conforming?

1473
01:01:39,566 --> 01:01:40,667
-: No.

1474
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:42,769
No no, no no no no no no, that
is completely different.

1475
01:01:42,803 --> 01:01:44,705
Look, this is not a debate.

1476
01:01:44,738 --> 01:01:47,508
You will all execute my
instructions,

1477
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:51,278
we will win that theater, and
that is final!

1478
01:01:58,452 --> 01:01:59,620
-: Whoa!
-: Hey!

1479
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:00,621
-: What happened?

1480
01:02:00,654 --> 01:02:03,657
-: No one leaves this room until
I am satisfied!

1481
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,259
-: My phone is charging in the
bar

1482
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:07,094
My mom is gonna wonder where I
am.

1483
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:08,462
-: This is a fire hazard.

1484
01:02:08,495 --> 01:02:09,396
What are we going to eat?

1485
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:11,265
There's no food in here.

1486
01:02:11,298 --> 01:02:13,835
-: There's plenty of Aquavit.

1487
01:02:13,868 --> 01:02:14,701
-: Eww.

1488
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:15,602
-: Ugh.

1489
01:02:16,703 --> 01:02:19,706

1491
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:39,159
-: Faster!

1492
01:02:39,192 --> 01:02:40,294
Faster faster faster!

1493
01:02:40,327 --> 01:02:41,361
Slower slower slower!

1494
01:02:41,395 --> 01:02:42,796
One hand fast, the other slow!

1495
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,731
That one's fast, that one's
slow!

1496
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:46,099
Go go go!

1497
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:47,801
'Drene are you getting this?

1498
01:02:47,835 --> 01:02:48,669
-: Yes.

1499
01:02:48,702 --> 01:02:50,771

-: Oh my god, it's 9:55.

1506
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:21,936
We have five minutes to get
there.

1507
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,371
-: Tucker, you weren't keeping
track of the time?

1508
01:03:24,404 --> 01:03:25,305
-: I didn't hear the lark.

1509
01:03:25,339 --> 01:03:27,207
Did you hear the lark?

1510
01:03:28,408 --> 01:03:29,811
Yorick: I'm gonna use the
slingshot.

1511
01:03:29,844 --> 01:03:31,012
Nina: No no no, I think we
decided on

1512
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:33,313
the North Korean style movement
piece with the streamers.

1513
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:34,715
Uther: I hear footsteps.

1514
01:03:34,748 --> 01:03:36,683
Brady: Did we decide live horse
or a dead horse?

1515
01:03:36,717 --> 01:03:37,551
Uther: Hello?

1516
01:03:37,584 --> 01:03:39,553
Where is everyone?

1517
01:03:39,586 --> 01:03:41,388

mouthwash?

1520
01:03:47,628 --> 01:03:49,596
Yeah, hello, this is Captain
Pauline Mikkelsen

1521
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:52,733
of the Fargo PD, I just had a
question for you

1522
01:03:52,766 --> 01:03:56,203
about an immersive theater
performance.

1523
01:03:56,236 --> 01:03:59,239
(tense piano music)

1524
01:04:03,543 --> 01:04:04,378
-: Lydia.

1525
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:06,480
-: Oh hi, nice to see you.

1526
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:11,184
-: Whoa!

1527
01:04:12,452 --> 01:04:13,387
What are you whispering about?

1528
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,254
Do you need tampons?

1529
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:15,756
'Cause I have those.

1530
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:16,623
Nina: No, I--

1531
01:04:16,657 --> 01:04:17,491
-: Do you need Extra Plus?

1532
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:18,358
I have that too.

1533
01:04:18,392 --> 01:04:19,493
-: No no, I only use pads.

1534
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:22,396
-: Tucker, you changed your mind
30,000 times last night.

1535
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:24,631
Now nobody has any idea what's
going on and everyone

1536
01:04:24,665 --> 01:04:27,701
thinks your masterpiece is gonna
be a disaster.

1537
01:04:27,734 --> 01:04:29,937
Lydia: And now, ladies and
gents,

1572
01:07:15,036 --> 01:07:17,872

mine own eyes.

1573
01:07:17,905 --> 01:07:20,875
-: Ah yes, the eye of the play!

How could you do this to me?

you,

01:07:44,698 --> 01:07:45,967
but can we please talk about
this--

1586

-: I trusted you!

1587

-: Now you're going to lie?

1589
01:07:56,911 --> 01:07:59,981
-: He was helping me with a
self-tape.

-: A.

1591

Self.

1592
01:08:05,752 --> 01:08:06,888

(audience murmurs)

1594
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:15,029
I can never forgive you.

1595
01:08:15,062 --> 01:08:17,631
-: What's a self-tape?

1596
01:08:17,664 --> 01:08:20,935
-: Well I'm sorry, but it's for
a new CW show.

1597
01:08:20,968 --> 01:08:22,469
It's between me and one other
girl

1598
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:25,639
and I find out any minute if I
got it.

Jack: Sorry, what's happening?

1600
01:08:33,214 --> 01:08:35,149

-: Wow!

1602
01:08:35,883 --> 01:08:38,152
Are you gonna be a sexy witch?

1603
01:08:38,185 --> 01:08:39,686
Or a sexy werewolf?

1604
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:40,620
Brady: Oh my god, Sandrene, you
have

1605
01:08:40,654 --> 01:08:42,189
to come on my podcast when
you're famous.

1606
01:08:42,223 --> 01:08:43,790
-: Yeah, I'm sure all 13 of your

1607
01:08:43,824 --> 01:08:45,159
listeners would love that,
Brady.

Can we stop this?

1611
01:08:51,265 --> 01:08:53,034
I love you, okay?

1612
01:08:53,067 --> 01:08:54,001

1615
01:08:58,172 --> 01:08:59,639
You have a missed call!

1616
01:08:59,673 --> 01:09:03,144
Ooh-hoo, it's from 2-1-2.

1617
01:09:03,177 --> 01:09:04,511

Yeah.

1622

What?

1623
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:19,160
What?

1624
01:09:20,194 --> 01:09:21,228
You're kidding!

1625
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:22,629
Oh my god!

1626
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:23,530
Oh my god.

(audience cheers and applauds)

1629
01:09:29,003 --> 01:09:30,171
I got it!

1630
01:09:30,204 --> 01:09:31,604
I got the part!

1631
01:09:35,009 --> 01:09:35,876
-: Yeah!

1632
01:09:37,111 --> 01:09:40,147
-: No no no no, stop stop stop
stop!

1633
01:09:40,181 --> 01:09:44,185
Sandrene, you're not gonna do it
right?

1634
01:09:44,218 --> 01:09:45,785
-: What?

1635
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:48,956
-: Think about our artistic
revolution.

1636
01:09:49,824 --> 01:09:51,058
-: Tucker.

1637
01:09:51,092 --> 01:09:54,661
Tucker, this is all I ever
wanted.

1638
01:09:54,694 --> 01:09:57,530
It's the opportunity of a
lifetime.

1639
01:09:57,564 --> 01:10:01,668
They're literally flying me out
tomorrow morning.

1640
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:03,670
-: I can't believe you're gonna
be on the CW.

1641
01:10:03,703 --> 01:10:06,007
This is so amazing.

1642
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:06,907
-: No.

1643
01:10:08,742 --> 01:10:10,077
It's not amazing.

1644
01:10:11,012 --> 01:10:12,146
It's betrayal.

1645
01:10:14,781 --> 01:10:15,916
Ensemble.

1646
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:16,817
And.

1647
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,653
I guess, audience.

1648
01:10:21,422 --> 01:10:24,691
I'm afraid I have an
announcement to make.

1649
01:10:24,724 --> 01:10:28,728
Sandrene is no longer a member
of the Tankhouse.

1650
01:10:30,865 --> 01:10:33,300
She was too busy selling out.

1651
01:10:33,334 --> 01:10:36,837
(audience gasps)

1652
01:10:36,871 --> 01:10:38,873
-: Truly typical, Tucker.

1653
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:40,707
You hide behind your art, but
you

1654
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,877
wish you had these
opportunities.

1655
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:46,180
And it kills you to see others,
especially me, get them!

1656
01:10:46,213 --> 01:10:49,183
'Cause you think you're better
than everyone else!

1657
01:10:49,216 --> 01:10:51,118
And you're not.

1658
01:10:51,152 --> 01:10:52,086
You're not.

1659
01:10:55,823 --> 01:10:59,659
-: Heaven truly knows that thou
art false as hell.

1660
01:10:59,692 --> 01:11:00,727
-: How am I false?

1661
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,129
-: Leave her alone!

1662
01:11:02,163 --> 01:11:04,165
Sandrene needs a real man.

1663
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:06,666
(audience applauds)

1664
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:09,036
-: Oh no no no, Hankery, take
her!

1665
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:12,605
You can be happy little hayseeds
together.

1666
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,041
You, we, are done!

1667
01:11:15,276 --> 01:11:16,444
-: Great!

1668
01:11:16,477 --> 01:11:19,980
Then you can just swiftly move
out of my parents' ranch,

1669
01:11:20,014 --> 01:11:23,217
which you've been staying in by
the way, for free!

1670
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,385
(audience oohs)

1671
01:11:24,418 --> 01:11:25,386
-: "Free" is--

1672
01:11:25,419 --> 01:11:26,586
-: Did you even send my mother a
thank you note?

1673
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:28,956
-: If I hear about these thank
you notes one more time--

1674
01:11:28,989 --> 01:11:30,991
-: Everyone just shut up!

1675
01:11:32,226 --> 01:11:34,061
We dedicated our time and effort

1676
01:11:34,095 --> 01:11:36,197
to this company because we
believed in you two!

1677
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:37,664
And now look at you!

1678
01:11:37,697 --> 01:11:39,066
You're childish and you're
selfish

1679
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,634
and you don't care about art!

1680
01:11:43,104 --> 01:11:44,905
I am resetting for top of show

1681
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:46,773
and we are trying this again!

1682
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:47,674
Okay?

1683
01:11:51,278 --> 01:11:52,847
-: Oh, that must be it.

1684
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,883
(audience applauds)

1685
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:00,888
-: Look, they're clapping.

1686
01:12:00,921 --> 01:12:02,923
-: Why are they clapping?

1687
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:13,367
-: Wow.

1688
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,902
How much fun was that?

1689
01:12:14,935 --> 01:12:18,405
Let's give it up for The
Tankhouse Theater.

1690
01:12:22,977 --> 01:12:23,844
-: Stop!

1691
01:12:24,812 --> 01:12:25,813
Stop!

1692
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:26,914
-: Is this part of it too?

1693
01:12:26,947 --> 01:12:27,780
-: I don't know.

1694
01:12:27,815 --> 01:12:30,017
-: I have sworn testimony
confirming

1695
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:33,187
Tucker Charlemagne and Sandrene
Rothstein's

1696
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:36,957
prohibition from performing in
New York.

1697
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:38,259
Due to their negligence leading

1698
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:40,261
to the death of an audience
member

1699
01:12:40,294 --> 01:12:42,263
during one of their
performances.

1700
01:12:42,296 --> 01:12:44,465
No one implicated in a felony

1701
01:12:44,498 --> 01:12:48,202
can take possession of a city
landmark.

1702
01:12:48,235 --> 01:12:50,737
They cannot win the theater.

1703
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:51,805
-: Please.

1704
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:53,474
Shire Reeve, I implore you.

1705
01:12:53,507 --> 01:12:56,709
-: In good conscience I can't
let you corrupt my son,

1706
01:12:56,743 --> 01:12:59,712
or these people, for one more
minute.

1707
01:12:59,746 --> 01:13:02,049
-: I'm the corrupter?

1708
01:13:02,082 --> 01:13:05,152
I shared my gifts with you
yokels!

1709
01:13:05,186 --> 01:13:08,289
Pearls suckled from the teat of
America's

1710
01:13:08,322 --> 01:13:11,358
theatrical breast, New York
City!

1711
01:13:11,392 --> 01:13:12,759
You heard of it?

1712
01:13:12,792 --> 01:13:14,828
It's not my fault if these
bumpkins

1713
01:13:14,862 --> 01:13:16,931
can't grasp the grandeur I'm
giving them!

1714
01:13:16,964 --> 01:13:18,265
-: Tucker, control thyself!

1715
01:13:18,299 --> 01:13:20,901
-: And thank you, Sandy
Rothstein,

1716
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:22,436
for teaching me that success
only comes

1717
01:13:22,469 --> 01:13:25,439
when you toss aside those you
care about most

1718
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:29,742
in the pursuit of your own
selfish purposes.

1719
01:13:29,776 --> 01:13:32,179
Well consider yourself tossed.

1720
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,819
Lydia: Well in light of this
news, I guess

1721
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:41,055
we have no other option but to
award

1722
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:44,391
the Fargo Theater to the Red
River Players.

1723
01:13:44,425 --> 01:13:47,428
(audience applauds)

1724
01:13:54,868 --> 01:13:55,735
-: Oofta.

1725
01:13:56,403 --> 01:13:57,404
-: Oh my god.

1726
01:13:58,872 --> 01:14:00,374
I cannot believe the Tankhouse
people

1727
01:14:00,407 --> 01:14:02,309
are full on psycho murderers.

1728
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:05,813
I wonder who tipped off Captain
Pauline.

1729
01:14:06,914 --> 01:14:07,780
Oh my god.

1730
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:10,251
It was you.

1731
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:12,920
Mr. Mortenson, I love that.

1732
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:14,021
-: Shh.

1733
01:14:14,054 --> 01:14:15,923
Just keep your voice down.

1734
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:18,392
This is nothing to be proud of.

1735
01:14:20,961 --> 01:14:23,364
-: Well then why did you do it?

1736
01:14:25,933 --> 01:14:27,835
-: You have your whole life
ahead of you.

1737
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:29,536
Endless possibilities.

1738
01:14:32,006 --> 01:14:36,443
All I have is a past filled with
missed opportunities.

1739
01:14:36,477 --> 01:14:38,412
And a present that I'm working

1740
01:14:38,445 --> 01:14:40,914
very hard to make tolerable.

1741
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:45,552
-: I'm sorry, I didn't realize
that...

1742
01:14:45,586 --> 01:14:46,453
-: What?

1743
01:14:50,257 --> 01:14:53,093
That I'm not through dreaming?

1744
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:58,932
(dramatic music)

1745
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:31,231
-: Tucker!

1746
01:15:33,967 --> 01:15:35,436
-: Uther, what are you doing
here?

1747
01:15:35,469 --> 01:15:38,172
-: What are you doing here?

1748
01:15:38,205 --> 01:15:39,206
-: I'm done!

1749
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:41,208
I'm going to let this river
carry me northward

1750
01:15:41,241 --> 01:15:45,646
to Canadia where I will start
anew amongst the moose.

1751
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:50,417
-: Tucker, do you know why I
keep my glasses on?

1752
01:15:50,451 --> 01:15:54,088
-: Yes, it was after a failed
corrective eye surgery

1753
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:55,656
that you did on yourself with a
laser pointer.

1754
01:15:55,689 --> 01:15:58,525
-: Bah, that's just the party
line.

1755
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:01,628
In truth, my eyes work.

1756
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:02,463
-: What?

1757
01:16:02,496 --> 01:16:06,166
-: They can reveal things in
people.

1758
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,035
I can't control it.

1759
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:10,471
And the emotional burden is...

1760
01:16:10,504 --> 01:16:12,573
It's too much for me.

1761
01:16:12,606 --> 01:16:14,875
So I keep myself blinded.

1762
01:16:15,676 --> 01:16:19,079
Most people aren't ready for the
truth.

1763
01:16:24,218 --> 01:16:26,387
-: I'm ready for my truth.

1764
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:27,488
-: I know.

1765
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:30,124
(tense music)

1766
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:36,997
Buford: Have I told you about

1767
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:40,367
my production of A Doll's House?

1768
01:16:40,401 --> 01:16:45,406
Our first adaptation was devised
in the jungles of Siberia.

1769
01:16:46,473 --> 01:16:49,443
("Siberia" echoing)

1770
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:53,213
(dramatic music)

1771
01:17:29,516 --> 01:17:32,186
(upbeat music)

1772
01:17:58,412 --> 01:18:01,148
(audience oohs)

1773
01:18:05,252 --> 01:18:08,255
(audience applauds)

1774
01:18:35,516 --> 01:18:36,350
(Sandrene sobs)

1775
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:37,417
Sandrene: I'm sorry.

1776
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:38,318
-: It's okay.

1777
01:18:38,352 --> 01:18:41,655
-: I just feel so guilty and
ungrateful

1778
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:46,126
and just a total asshole.

1779
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:48,695
Leaving all these people that I
love and care about.

1780
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:50,230
-: Look.

1781
01:18:50,264 --> 01:18:52,566
If they really love you, they'll
understand

1782
01:18:52,599 --> 01:18:54,735
that you've gotta follow your
dreams.

1783
01:18:54,768 --> 01:18:56,470
And if they don't, then it
sounds to me

1784
01:18:56,503 --> 01:18:59,506
like they got some growing up to
do.

1785
01:19:00,374 --> 01:19:04,745
You are the most talented person
I've ever met.

1786
01:19:04,778 --> 01:19:07,581
(dramatic music)

1787
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:14,421
Wow.

1788
01:19:15,823 --> 01:19:17,424
That was so crazy.

1789
01:19:19,192 --> 01:19:20,160
-: Yeah.

1790
01:19:20,193 --> 01:19:24,131
-: I've been waiting for so long
for a sign.

1791
01:19:24,164 --> 01:19:27,701
For some reason for me to get
out of here and this is it.

1792
01:19:27,734 --> 01:19:30,604
I can come with you, I'll make
your place a home.

1793
01:19:30,637 --> 01:19:35,642
You're gonna be so busy and you
need stability.

1794
01:19:36,243 --> 01:19:36,878
-: Well--

1795
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:37,711
-: I can cook.

1796
01:19:37,744 --> 01:19:39,546
I can clean, I can take care of
you.

1797
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,714
Hell, maybe I can even figure
out

1798
01:19:40,747 --> 01:19:41,849
the music scene in New York
City.

1799
01:19:41,883 --> 01:19:43,818
-: Okay, Hank, Hank, hi.

1800
01:19:46,486 --> 01:19:47,822
No.

1801
01:19:47,855 --> 01:19:49,523
This is my journey.

1802
01:19:50,757 --> 01:19:54,227
And if I have learned anything
it's that

1803
01:19:55,662 --> 01:19:57,464
I can't have someone depending

1804
01:19:57,497 --> 01:20:00,300
on me to give their life
meaning.

1805
01:20:05,238 --> 01:20:06,106
Okay?

1806
01:20:06,908 --> 01:20:07,774
-: Yeah.

1807
01:20:11,913 --> 01:20:13,213
-: Guys guys guys!

1808
01:20:13,246 --> 01:20:13,881
Okay.

1809
01:20:13,915 --> 01:20:15,215
Uther, how did you get here?

1810
01:20:15,248 --> 01:20:16,416
-: Uber.

1811
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,284
-: Oh.

1812
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:19,653
Didn't know they had that.

1813
01:20:19,686 --> 01:20:23,290
Look, I just, I wanted to say
that I am,

1814
01:20:23,323 --> 01:20:26,660
I'm so sorry for all the
horrible

1815
01:20:26,693 --> 01:20:30,597
eloquently-worded things that I
said earlier.

1816
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:34,234
I've come to the realization
that...

1817
01:20:34,267 --> 01:20:37,872
I now understand the true
purpose of theater.

1818
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,642
It's about community, you know?

1819
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,878
And bringing people closer.

1820
01:20:47,414 --> 01:20:51,284
Trying to figure out this crazy
life together.

1821
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:55,422
And I wanna be here.

1822
01:20:57,391 --> 01:20:59,927
I wanna be a part of your
family.

1823
01:20:59,961 --> 01:21:01,361
Your community.

1824
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:10,838
-: No thanks, I think we're all
set.

1825
01:21:10,872 --> 01:21:11,906
-: Yeah.

1826
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:13,908
I'm gonna help Yorick get his
distilling license

1827
01:21:13,941 --> 01:21:16,376
so that he can sell his
moonshine legally.

1828
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:18,311
Proceeds will go to Tankhouse.

1829
01:21:18,345 --> 01:21:18,980
-: What?

1830
01:21:19,013 --> 01:21:20,114
Wait, what?

1831
01:21:20,148 --> 01:21:24,584
-: We are turning Tankhouse into
our permanent theater.

1832
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:26,420
-: That's.

1833
01:21:27,521 --> 01:21:29,356
Amazing.

1834
01:21:33,527 --> 01:21:36,864
If you could just find a place
for me here,

1835
01:21:36,898 --> 01:21:40,001
I would be eternally grateful.

1836
01:21:40,034 --> 01:21:42,837
(dramatic music)

1837
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:48,475
-: You know, someone once told
me a stage

1838
01:21:48,508 --> 01:21:51,813
is where you arrive, not where
you begin.

1839
01:21:53,848 --> 01:21:55,782
If you want to join us.

1840
01:21:56,884 --> 01:21:59,653
You'll have to audition.

1841
01:21:59,686 --> 01:22:02,389
-: Just like everyone else?

1842
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:04,558
-: Just like everyone else.

1843
01:22:06,393 --> 01:22:07,260
-: Yes.

1844
01:22:09,496 --> 01:22:10,363
-: Okay.

1845
01:22:12,332 --> 01:22:13,835
Sign me up.

1846
01:22:13,868 --> 01:22:16,536
(Uther laughs)

1847
01:22:21,508 --> 01:22:22,810
-: Oi!

1848
01:22:22,844 --> 01:22:24,544
Everyone!

1849
01:22:24,578 --> 01:22:26,313
To Tankhouse!

1850
01:22:26,346 --> 01:22:28,415
Patrons: To Tankhouse!

1851
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:30,450
-: Tankhouse.

1852
01:22:31,853 --> 01:22:34,521
(upbeat music)

1853
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:40,494
-: Ooh!

1854
01:22:40,527 --> 01:22:41,661
I am so sorry.

1855
01:22:42,897 --> 01:22:47,068
Tonight is our opening night of
"Art Assault"

1856
01:22:47,101 --> 01:22:48,769
An immersive show that we've
been

1857
01:22:48,802 --> 01:22:51,873
working on the past few weeks.

1858
01:22:51,906 --> 01:22:54,041
-: I was given a more
instrumental part

1859
01:22:54,075 --> 01:22:55,675
in the production since Sandrene

1860
01:22:55,709 --> 01:22:57,711
had to leave to shoot her show.

1861
01:22:57,744 --> 01:22:59,513
It was a little awkward at first

1862
01:22:59,546 --> 01:23:03,316
because Tucker kept forgetting I
wasn't Sandrene.

1863
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:05,285
-: I'll take care of it.

1864
01:23:06,453 --> 01:23:07,320
Whoa!

1865
01:23:08,688 --> 01:23:09,656
I forgot.

1866
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:11,792
-: I heard she's coming to the
show tonight.

1867
01:23:11,826 --> 01:23:13,928
-: Yeah, we're back together.

1868
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:14,795
-: Boing!

1869
01:23:14,829 --> 01:23:15,729
-: On one condition.

1870
01:23:15,762 --> 01:23:16,563
-: Our one rule is I'm not
really supposed

1871
01:23:16,596 --> 01:23:18,732
to talk about him in my standup,
so.

1872
01:23:18,765 --> 01:23:19,934
-: Yeah.

1873
01:23:19,967 --> 01:23:21,035
-: So I'm hanging with my
girlfriend

1874
01:23:21,068 --> 01:23:22,569
the other day, sucking her dick.

1875
01:23:22,602 --> 01:23:25,672
(audience laughs)

1876
01:23:25,705 --> 01:23:26,540
Future mother-in-law everybody.

1877
01:23:26,573 --> 01:23:29,476
Give it up for Pauline, police
captain.

1878
01:23:29,509 --> 01:23:31,078
-: We weren't able to get the
licensing

1879
01:23:31,112 --> 01:23:33,915
for my moonshine, but we were
able to use

1880
01:23:33,948 --> 01:23:38,085
the equipment to make a cologne
designed by Uther.

1881
01:23:39,053 --> 01:23:43,024
Turns out his crazy sense of
smells does come in handy.

1882
01:23:43,057 --> 01:23:47,028
We got it in all the duty frees!

1883
01:23:48,129 --> 01:23:49,931
-: So since the competition I've

1884
01:23:49,964 --> 01:23:52,399
taken over as technical
director.

1885
01:23:52,432 --> 01:23:54,969
That's why it's so neat in here.

1886
01:23:57,038 --> 01:24:00,640
-: After some self-reflection,
and Leah sitting me down

1887
01:24:00,674 --> 01:24:03,643
and explaining to me how I'm
part of "the problem,"

1888
01:24:03,677 --> 01:24:05,478
I decided I needed to take a
step back

1889
01:24:05,512 --> 01:24:07,781
from leadership for a while.

1890
01:24:10,084 --> 01:24:12,752
So I demoted myself to squire.

1891
01:24:15,622 --> 01:24:16,723
Scroll for you, sir!

1892
01:24:16,756 --> 01:24:17,757
-: Thank you, good sir.

1893
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:18,725
-: Good day!

1894
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:24,098
Nina: This is why we have spell
check.

1895
01:24:33,074 --> 01:24:34,275
-: Oh.

1896
01:24:34,308 --> 01:24:37,544
So I've been taking an
experimental acting class at
CCM.

1897
01:24:37,577 --> 01:24:39,914
So I had to come see Art
Assault.

1898
01:24:39,947 --> 01:24:42,482
Once I confronted my dad about
the whole

1899
01:24:42,515 --> 01:24:46,187
sense memory exercise, he
finally came out to me.

1900
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:49,190
But yeah, he and Jim should be
here any second.

1901
01:24:49,223 --> 01:24:52,425
(rhythmic babbling)

1902
01:24:55,495 --> 01:24:57,098
-: Beat the chest!

1903
01:24:57,131 --> 01:24:59,532
King Kong the chest, yes.

1904
01:24:59,566 --> 01:25:00,500
-: Sandrene?

1905
01:25:02,103 --> 01:25:04,771
Sandrene: Hey guys!

1906
01:25:04,804 --> 01:25:06,506
Brady: How are you?

1907
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:08,508
Sandrene: I missed you so much!

1908
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:10,510
Nina: You looks so pretty.

1909
01:25:10,543 --> 01:25:12,512
You really got that CW glow.

1910
01:25:12,545 --> 01:25:15,149
(actors chatter)

1911
01:25:19,253 --> 01:25:20,754
-: I've missed you guys.

1912
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:22,656
-: We've missed you too.

1913
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:24,791
-: I love your romper.

1914
01:25:24,825 --> 01:25:28,695
-: Let's all take five in the
antechamber, huh?

1915
01:25:29,897 --> 01:25:31,999
Take me, thank you.

1916
01:25:32,033 --> 01:25:33,935
I just wanted to give them a
little space.

1917
01:25:33,968 --> 01:25:37,771
Nina: Actually it's time to
hydrate, guys.

1918
01:25:39,506 --> 01:25:40,141
-: Hi.

1919
01:25:40,174 --> 01:25:41,775
-: Hey 'Drene.

1920
01:25:41,809 --> 01:25:44,979
I was just counting the chairs
for the...

1921
01:25:45,012 --> 01:25:47,815
(dramatic music)

1922
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:56,891
-: How's the show?

1923
01:25:56,924 --> 01:25:58,658
-: Good, good, yeah, really
good.

1924
01:25:58,692 --> 01:25:59,592
Great actually.

1925
01:25:59,626 --> 01:26:03,264
Jack, he's really come out of
his shell.

1926
01:26:03,297 --> 01:26:05,665
Leah has a beautiful movement
piece

1927
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:08,002
about cryptic pregnancies that
came to her

1928
01:26:08,035 --> 01:26:11,906
in a dream actually, so yeah,
it's great.

1929
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:14,842
-: Look at you giving the actors
freedom.

1930
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:15,742
It's nice.

1931
01:26:18,645 --> 01:26:19,847
-: What about you?

1932
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,148
How's your... show?

1933
01:26:22,716 --> 01:26:23,750
-: It's great.

1934
01:26:23,783 --> 01:26:26,120
We just finished filming the
first two episodes.

1935
01:26:26,153 --> 01:26:27,587
Learning a lot.

1936
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:28,956
The cast is cool.

1937
01:26:32,759 --> 01:26:36,263
-: Are you gonna go see Hank
after this, or...

1938
01:26:36,297 --> 01:26:37,131
-: What?

1939
01:26:37,164 --> 01:26:38,032
No.

1940
01:26:38,065 --> 01:26:39,699
No, Tucker.

1941
01:26:39,733 --> 01:26:42,569
He's just trying to find himself

1942
01:26:42,602 --> 01:26:44,138
Like the rest of us.

1943
01:26:48,675 --> 01:26:51,112
I'm really happy though.

1944
01:26:51,145 --> 01:26:52,813
I hope you are too.

1945
01:27:00,754 --> 01:27:02,689
-: I really do miss you.

1946
01:27:05,326 --> 01:27:06,626
Nina: Oh hey, Tucker?

1947
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:07,895
-: Ah, Nina.

1948
01:27:07,928 --> 01:27:08,996
What news bring you?

1949
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:11,731
-: Sorry, it's just we have to
open the house now.

1950
01:27:11,765 --> 01:27:14,601
It's company members only.
