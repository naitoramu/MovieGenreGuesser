1
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:02,532
It is Friday morning.

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,608
And it is another beautiful day,

3
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:07,687
In Scranton, Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:11,226
Oh my God !

5
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:18,491
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:22,848
We have a serious problem here.

7
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:25,049
Alright everybody. Lock the doors.
Turn off the lights.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,525
Pretend you're not here.

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:27,499
Are we in danger ?

10
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:31,170
There's no time to think about it. This is real.

11
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:34,346
Just shh, everybody.

12
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,590
Michael, should I call the...

13
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:42,906
What ?

14
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,672
The I.T. tech guy and me, did not
get off to a great start.

15
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:21,711
Synchro : Occeane
Transcript : Nikki

16
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:25,171
Yeah I tried to install it myself.

17
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:29,423
But, you guys have these things
so password-protected.

18
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:31,950
That just means you have
to enter your password.

19
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:34,031
What's your password, Michael ?

20
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:37,102
It's...

21
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:39,220
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Yes.

22
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:47,923
Michael !

23
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:50,521
- Sorry.
- Please don't do that.

24
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:52,212
Okay, I'm sorry. What is going
on in there ?

25
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:53,503
Why is he here ?

26
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:54,880
What are you doing?

27
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:56,131
I can't tell you.

28
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:58,100
- You have to tell me.
- I don't have to tell you anything.

29
00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:59,553
Look, Michael.

30
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,513
I know you don't want
to have to think about this.

31
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:03,903
But if something were to happen to you,

32
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:06,830
God forbid, then I would need
to know in order to take over.

33
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:08,681
Dwight, nothing is going
to happen to me, okay ?

34
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:09,731
I'm in the best shape of my life.

35
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:10,871
Look at this.

36
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,253
Yeah, but that doesn't matter,
you could get a brain aneurysm.

37
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,463
- I'm not going to get a br-
- Or get hit by a car.

38
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:16,000
- Stop.
- Or a bus or a train.

39
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:17,603
You could get poisoned.
Fall down a well.

40
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:19,271
- Step on a mine. Choke.
- Okay,

41
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,530
If I step on a mine in
Scranton, Pennsylvania,

42
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:23,000
and die, you can have my job, okay ?

43
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,182
Why don't you just go away ?

44
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,582
There are certain things a boss
does not share with his employees.

45
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:30,052
His salary.

46
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,190
That would depress them.

47
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:33,410
His bed.

48
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:35,022
It...

49
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:40,460
And I am not going to tell them
that I'll be reading their e-mails.

50
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,741
- So how do you search ?
- By keyword phrase.

51
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:47,560
Try profits.

52
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,602
No, try Michael Scott.

53
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:53,451
Michael, boss, and funny.

54
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:57,900
Oh my God !

55
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,313
E-mail from Stanley.

56
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:03,572
Stanley, terribly nice guy.

57
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,493
"Sorry I didn't write back sooner."

58
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:07,983
"I can't go to the game tonight
because my boss, Michael is an ass"

59
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,122
"And making me stay late."

60
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:11,170
Well, Stanley's an ass.

61
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:13,072
Not one of our harder workers.

62
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,721
Hey, what's the deal Michael ?

63
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:22,283
Why are you spying on our computers ?

64
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:26,041
Oh, no. Everybody, Oscar's gone crazy.

65
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:28,000
What other ghost stories
have you got for us ?

66
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:29,742
That I'm a robot ?

67
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:34,612
I will destroy, everything in my path.

68
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:36,912
Actually, we just...

69
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,390
- Okay.

70
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,581
- Oil can. Oil can.

71
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,293
Tin man.

72
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:49,730
Actually we just got a memo from I.T,

73
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,743
saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.

74
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,313
Oh,  what ?
No, that defeats the whole purpose.

75
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:56,443
So it's true ?
You have access to our e-mails ?

76
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:57,613
You know what the problem is ?

77
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:58,642
I think I do.

78
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,513
The problem is that when people
hear the term "Big Brother",

79
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:05,320
They immediately think
it's scary or bad.

80
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:08,512
But I don't, I think,
"Wow. I love my Big Brother".

81
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:11,193
I gotta erase a lot of stuff.

82
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:14,582
A LOT, of stuff.

83
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:18,851
Oh, hey. Just so you know.
If you have any sensitive e-mails,

84
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,963
they need to be deleted immediately.

85
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:22,722
- I know.
- Good.

86
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:27,193
Hey.

87
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:32,230
Something just happened.

88
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:36,113
Dwight just told Angela that she has
to delete all of her sensitive e-mails.

89
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:37,553
- Immediately !
-  What ?

90
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,270
I know.

91
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,452
- Do you they're like...
- No.

92
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:43,800
Right, no.

93
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:50,893
Maybe.

94
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,531
It's like squishing a
spider under a book.

95
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:56,423
It's gonna be really gross.

96
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:59,410
But I have to look and make
sure that it's really dead.

97
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:01,800
So...

98
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:03,782
If you guys see anything.

99
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,491
Hey, Dwight ?

100
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:09,891
My friend is kind of into these
two girls that he works with.

101
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:10,672
Nice.

102
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,572
One is tall and brunette.

103
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:16,191
And the other is short and blond.

104
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:18,552
And perky and kind of judgmental.

105
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:21,851
Who do you think he should choose ?

106
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:24,660
Does he have access to
their medical records ?

107
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,082
I think on of the greatest things
about modern America,

108
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,252
is the computerization
of medical records.

109
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:34,940
As a volunteer sheriff,

110
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:38,360
I  can look up anyone's psychiatric
records or surgical histories.

111
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,223
Yeast infections.

112
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:45,250
There are a huge number of
yeast infections in this county.

113
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,192
Probably,

114
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:52,580
because we're down river,
from that old bread factory.

115
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:57,581
Meredith has an E-vite, from Jim.

116
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,333
"Barbecue at Jim's tonight."

117
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,240
Tonight ?

118
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,580
Wonder where my e-vitation is ?

119
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,693
Click on guest list.

120
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,863
Angela, Stanley, Oscar...

121
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,662
Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.

122
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,472
Must be...

123
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,061
No.

124
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:26,423
Hey, Angela. How's it going ?

125
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:27,823
It's okay.

126
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:30,243
Listen, are you bringing anyone 
to Jim's party tonight ?

127
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,550
No. Are we supposed to ?

128
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,691
No. I mean, I don't know.
I don't think so.

129
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:37,501
Excuse me.

130
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:54,491
There's always a distance between
a boss and the employees.

131
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:57,360
It is just nature's rule.

132
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:59,472
It's intimidation, mostly.

133
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:02,023
It's the awareness that they are not me.

134
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:04,363
I do think that I am very...

135
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:08,431
approachable as one of the guys.

136
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:12,601
But  maybe I need to be even approachabler.

137
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:16,522
- That's pretty.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,161
Are you going to eat with us ?

139
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,773
Of course. Hanging with my crew.

140
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:24,890
Crew that I am one of.

141
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:28,553
Hanging with my Cup of Noodles.

142
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,582
This is a meal in a cup, right here.

143
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,890
Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college.

144
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:36,356
Lived on this stuff.
Brain food.

145
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,720
You know what I really,
really miss about college ?

146
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,576
The parties.

147
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:45,773
Everybody'd go, the athletes,
the nerds, the professors.

148
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:48,251
The professors would go to the parties ?

149
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:50,573
Yeah. They were the most fun.

150
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:53,433
We always invited them.

151
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,963
It's true. I'm having a party.

152
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,672
I've got tree cases of imported beer.

153
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:02,630
Karaoke machine

154
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:04,920
And I didn't invite Michael.

155
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:07,543
So, three ingredients for a great party.

156
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,343
And it's nothing personal,
I just think that if he were there,

157
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:12,821
people wouldn't be able to
relax and you know, have fun.

158
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,161
And my roommate wants to meet everybody.

159
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:18,063
Because, I'm pretty sure he
thinks I'm making Dwight up.

160
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,890
He is very real.

161
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:28,510
What ?

162
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:35,263
Oh! Yes! Thank you.

163
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:44,250
Question.

164
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:46,551
On the internet, there are
several different options,

165
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:48,361
to get to your house
for the party tonight.

166
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:51,212
No, no, no. Keep that down.

167
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:52,940
Why ?

168
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,811
Because not everybody
knows about the party.

169
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:58,571
Like who ?
Who doesn't know ?

170
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:01,003
Michael.

171
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:04,340
Why just Michael ?

172
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,382
Because it's a surprise.

173
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:08,450
Is it ?

174
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:09,800
Oh, that's perfect.

175
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:11,582
So don't tell.

176
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,802
- I won't.
- Okay.

177
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:17,741
So, Dwight thinks that tonight
is a surprise party for Michael.

178
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:19,952
- Really ? That's great.
- I know.

179
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,911
Maybe we can get him
to hide and wait somewhere.

180
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:24,772
Oh man.

181
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:28,022
Oh, you know what ? Speaking of which,
I was just trying to get a handle on,

182
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:30,271
You know, the numbers
for food and stuff.

183
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:32,341
So do you think Roy's gonna come or...

184
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:33,663
Oh, no, he can't make it.

185
00:09:33,758 --> 00:09:35,500
Oh, okay. Cool.

186
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:40,253
- Hey there.
- Hey.

187
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,162
Almost quitting time.

188
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,641
Yup. It's, 4:00.

189
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:49,542
One more hour to take care
of anything you forgot to do.

190
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:55,301
Hey, you know, I don't know
if you have any plans tonight.

191
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,281
But if you don't, we could hang out.

192
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,283
- I can't.
- You have plans ?

193
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:06,420
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah, I do too, I do too.

194
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,761
- You do?
- Big plans. I do yeah.

195
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:09,452
Because you just...

196
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:11,423
- You wanted to hang out.
- Tonight, no I can't do it tonight.

197
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:14,693
Improv class. I have improv class.
Hanging out with...

198
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:16,131
- Really ?
- My improve buds.Yeah.

199
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:17,443
Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun.

200
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,072
Oh, it's the best. It's the best.

201
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,951
I would not miss it for the world.

202
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:23,193
But if something else came up,
I would definitely not go.

203
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,262
Improv sounds great.

204
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:30,751
It is.

205
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,043
Okay.

206
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:37,442
Alright.

207
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:40,011
What ?

208
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:42,763
I think Stanley just coughed.

209
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:53,261
Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk
you to your vehicular transport ?

210
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,042
- No thanks.
- Alright.

211
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:57,151
- Oscar, you have big plans tonight...
- I'm on a call.

212
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:57,982
Okay.

213
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,970
Kevin. Big man, big man !

214
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:01,481
What are you doing tonight ? 
Where you off to ?

215
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:02,900
My brother is in town.

216
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:05,671
and we are going to see the 
Alaska Film Festival...

217
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:07,171
- ...at the Si...
- Okay, alright.

218
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:10,962
Hey, Angela. Rushy, rushy. 
Where you rushing off to ?

219
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:13,873
- I'm just leaving for the day.
-  Yeah. Where are you headed ?

220
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,813
Charity. Bake Drive.

221
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,172
- Liar ! You are a liar.
- No, I'm not !

222
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:24,030
Dwight. Oh, Dwight, my loyal compadre.

223
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:26,503
You and I are hanging tonight.

224
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:31,342
The two of us. We are celebrating, 
our freedom and our manhood.

225
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:34,300
You know what ? Why don't we watch that
 show you've been wanting to watch?

226
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,822
That stupid Battleship Galaxy.

227
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:37,902
Battlestar Galactica ?

228
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:40,770
That's, whatever stupid show you
want to watch, we're watching it.

229
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:44,011
Unfortunately I've got plans.
I have to go to practice.

230
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,513
Soccer practice.

231
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:48,921
I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.

232
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:50,283
Clarinet.

233
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:51,981
You too, Dwight ?

234
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:53,501
Have  fun tonight.

235
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:57,441
Whatever it is that you're doing. 
And I'll see you Monday.

236
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:01,342
He has no idea.

237
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,330
Quick announcement everybody, 
if I can get everybody's attention.

238
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,031
We do have wine in the kitchen.

239
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:15,722
And there is, ah, beer 
available on the porch.

240
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:18,673
nd despite what you might think,
it's not all for Meredith and Kelly.

241
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,211
- So please enjoy.
- Jim !

242
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:22,433
You really think this is a good idea ?

243
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,640
A hide-a-key rock?

244
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:26,420
Hey, you must be Dwight.

245
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:28,581
- You don't work with us.
- That's because Mark's my roommate.

246
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:31,672
Hey, I love the Birkenstocks.

247
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:33,103
Thanks. Yeah.

248
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,312
I always keep an extra set in the car for special occasions.

249
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:38,780
Jim, come here.

250
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:40,862
When is the guest of honor coming ?

251
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,750
- Later-ish.
- He's going to love it !

252
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,483
Great.

253
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:50,042
I just wanted to let you guys know that
 we will be taking the tour like I promised

254
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,751
Hey ! Just in time.

255
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:54,112
Do you want to go on a group tour ?
We were just about to leave.

256
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:54,713
Definitely.

257
00:12:54,718 --> 00:12:57,042
Well, the group tour 
is now leaving then.

258
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:58,360
Ladies and gentlemen !

259
00:12:58,408 --> 00:12:59,911
Just a few things that we're going
to be pointing out to you today.

260
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:02,241
You will be able to see both bedrooms.

261
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:05,512
If we're lucky, maybe get a chance
to peek into the bathroom.

262
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:09,151
Who knows ? I have to remind you also
that flash photography is prohibited.

263
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:12,313
And as much as you can, please refrain from touching things.

264
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,843
I know you might want to.

265
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,190
Hey, is Katy coming ?

266
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,033
Actually, I haven't talked
to her in a while.

267
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:19,300
Is it cool if I call her?

268
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:21,401
We'll talk about that later.

269
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:24,222
Okay, let's get right into it. 
I need two people for the first scene.

270
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,680
Mr. Kotter.

271
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:28,410
Mr. Kot-ter !

272
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:30,533
Okay, Michael. And...

273
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,852
Anybody ? How about Marybeth ?

274
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,090
- Okay.
- Come on.

275
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:40,051
- Okay, so you start us off, Marybeth.
-Alright, great.

276
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:48,561
Detective Michael Scarn,
I'm with the F.B.I.

277
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:49,360
Think about this.

278
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:54,330
What is the most exciting thing that can 
happen on TV or in movies or in real life?

279
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,172
Somebody has a gun.

280
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:00,580
That's why I always start with a gun,
because you can't top it.

281
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,062
You just can't. 

282
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,971
I'm supposed to meet my doctor here.

283
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,603
Have you seen him ?
He's a very angry midget.

284
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:09,232
Boom ! Freeze ! Michael Scoon, F.B.I.

285
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:10,583
You know what you did

286
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,742
Yeah, you thought you could get away
with your little ruse didn't you?

287
00:14:15,848 --> 00:14:18,303
Didn't you ? Well, you didn't.

288
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:20,770
Because I know where you hid the diamonds.

289
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:23,023
I've been on to you and 
your little friends for weeks.

290
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:26,782
I'm  not even in the scene.

291
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:28,370
Stop, stop ! Stop.

292
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:31,702
- Okay, you shot me. Great. Stop.
-  Why...

293
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:34,082
You can't just shoot 
everyone in the scene.

294
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,361
if you hadn't stopped the scene, 
you would've seen where it was going.

295
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:37,800
Okay. What about the scene the set up ?

296
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:40,332
No, it wasn't.

297
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,162
No more guns. No. No. Michael.

298
00:14:43,586 --> 00:14:45,411
I want you to give me all
the guns you have.

299
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,820
Just get rid of all your 
guns and give them to me.

300
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:50,253
Great.

301
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:53,061
Okay.

302
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,280
Jim's bedroom.

303
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:07,503
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.

304
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,001
Cool. This is your desk.

305
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,373
- This is my desk.
- Your home office ?

306
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:14,662
Home office. This is it.

307
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:17,050
Yeah. You have to sit down 
so I can get the full effect.

308
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,520
Okay. Sure, will do.

309
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:23,862
Okay, wait. So that would make me...

310
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:26,911
Like right here.

311
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:27,811
Yeah.

312
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:29,620
Yep, that feels about right.

313
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:31,531
And then Dwight would be like...

314
00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:33,551
You know what ? 
Let's just leave that image out of it.

315
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:35,072
Because this is a happy place.

316
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,172
Happy thoughts, Pam. Happy thoughts.

317
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:42,370
- Yearbook.
- Yeah, you don't have to.

318
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:45,882
Alright, yes, that's not 
gonna be awkward at all.

319
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:51,401
Oh, yeah.

320
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:53,610
You were so dorky !

321
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,830
Thank you.

322
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:04,253
- Freeze !
-  I'm in.

323
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:05,512
You want to go over the
rules one more time ?

324
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:07,253
No, no, no.

325
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:13,113
I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.

326
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,891
I promise it's worth it.

327
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:20,312
Oh, I can see you walking out of here.

328
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,253
And you're thrilled with your reading.

329
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:26,382
What are you...

330
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,663
- Michael, what did you tell him ?
- Nothing.

331
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:38,213
Then why are his hands up ? Bill ?

332
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,001
He told me he couldn't show it to me, but he has a gun.

333
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:45,810
Okay, let's call it a day.

334
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:47,282
That was good.

335
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:50,083
Good work, everybody.

336
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,841
Angela, burger, dog ?

337
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:54,360
Having fun?

338
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:56,590
I got sap on me.

339
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,753
Chicken, hot dog, burger.

340
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:01,771
I'm a vegetarian.

341
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:04,271
There's soda inside.

342
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,640
I didn't think the premium laser color 
copy batch would sell as well as it did,

343
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,003
would sell as well as it did.

344
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,410
It surprised us all. 
I'll tell you why, because.

345
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:13,053
I'm sorry, guys, can we 
please not talk about paper ?

346
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:15,531
There's gotta be something
else that we can talk about.

347
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:26,703
I think it's alright. I mean,
Jesus drank wine.

348
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,163
Hey, Phyllis. Come here for a second.

349
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,001
Sure.

350
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:39,521
Have you heard anything about any
secret office romances or...

351
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,752
You tell me.

352
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:44,753
Well, you do mean you and Jim, right ?

353
00:17:46,675 --> 00:17:48,360
Oh, God. I am so sorry.

354
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:51,242
I mean, I thought, you guys 
hang out all the time.

355
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:54,503
And you're talking all the time. 
I'm sorry, it's like...

356
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:56,861
It's okay. It's okay.

357
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:02,911
Not so fast, fire guy.

358
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:06,400
How do we get to Bernie's 
Tavern from here ?

359
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:07,992
So, Bernie's, huh?

360
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:07,990
- Don't worry, we're all going to carpool.
- So, Bernie's ?

361
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,672
We're all going to Bernie's ?

362
00:18:10,786 --> 00:18:12,450
Sorry. We're not going as a group.

363
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:14,612
It's just a private friend 
who happens to know

364
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:17,281
all of us from different ways is 
throwing a private birthday thing.

365
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:18,060
Right, right, right.

366
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:21,002
Well,  guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's
 with you but I have an office party.

367
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,480
Big office party I need to go to. 
So, can't get out of it.

368
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:24,721
- Good job.
- Hey, see you later.

369
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:26,683
Nice job Bill.

370
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:27,900
Not.

371
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,563
hey, how's your new 
side project going ?

372
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,062
- Oh, yeah, I gave that up
- Really ?

373
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,401
Yeah. It turns out I was, 
just grasping at straws.

374
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,222
Just becase two people are hanging out,

375
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:50,522
it doesn't mean that they're together.

376
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:52,681
You know ? 
Like people can just be friends.

377
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,323
And I think that it was really unfair of us,

378
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:57,151
to assume that there was
anything else going on.

382
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:12,522
- Everybody.
- Dwight.

383
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:15,763
Who opened the morgue for this thing ?

384
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:17,540
I was just driving by. 
Thought I'd drop in.

385
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,422
Here's some wine. I would love a 
glass if you're gonna open it.

386
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,450
Hello temp. Take my jacket.

387
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,983
Oh, come on. That guy ?

388
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,362
He is a good guy. Not a terrorist.

389
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:32,320
Karaoke. I love it.

390
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:35,533
I am a karaoke fiend !

391
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:38,353
I call dibs, I've got next. 
I've got next up.

392
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:42,092
Come on. 
Let's, Let's get this party started !

393
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:45,322
Okay. Where's that wine ?

394
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:49,640
Okay, this is a duet, so, somebody else ?

395
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:53,223
Pam, you want to...
Come up and sing this one.

396
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,520
Need somebody else. 
Takers, please.

something going on</i>"

401
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:14,811
This is the part that goes to the, girl.

me that I can't explain."</i>

00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,213

404
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:06,440
- I am...
- Shut up !

405
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:07,170
Funny story.

406
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:09,432
They way I got into improv was,

407
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:10,902
I got into improv,

408
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,333
The story about me getting into improv was, 


409
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:16,933
that I was walking down the street,
that I waw walking down the street.

410
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:18,293
And the guy says : 

411
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:20,802
"Hey, you're funny, you're the 
funniest guy I've ever seen. "

412
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:24,171
"Or my name is not Dale Earnhardt."

413
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:27,042
And that was an improv.

414
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:31,531
The real way was that I found a flyer.
