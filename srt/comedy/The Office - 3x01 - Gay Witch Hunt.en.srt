1
00:00:12,836 --> 00:00:16,618
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.
I got Jim's, uh, old job.

2
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:18,508
Which means, at my ten-year
high school reunion,

3
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:20,881
it will not say,
"Ryan Howard is a temp."

4
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:25,653
"Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate
at a mid-range paper supply firm."

5
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:29,795
That'll show'em.

6
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:51,220
You have no idea how
long I've wanted to do that.

7
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:53,826
Me too.

8
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:57,528
I think we're just drunk.

9
00:00:57,703 --> 00:01:01,505
No, I'm not drunk. Are you drunk ?

10
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,621
No.

11
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:08,027
Jim.

12
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:13,422
You're really gonna marry him ?

13
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:17,989
Okay.

14
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:28,001
Jim is gone.
He's gone. I miss him so much.

15
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:32,910
Oh, I cry myself to sleep. Jim !

16
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:35,451
False. I do not miss him.

17
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,050

21
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:09,831
No, that is the fun of this place.

22
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:12,631
I call everybody "faggy."
Why would anyone find that offensive ?

23
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:15,622
Okay, I think Oscar would just like if
you used "lame" or something like that.

24
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:18,783
- That's what "faggy" means.
- No, not really.

25
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:22,402
- Apparently, you called Oscar faggy.
- Yeah.

26
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,912
For liking the move "Shakespeare
in Love" more than an action movie.

27
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:28,290
It wasn't just an action move,
it was "Die Hard."

28
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,483
All, all right,
Michael, but Oscar's really gay.

29
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:32,121
- Exactly.
- I mean for real.

30
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:35,212
- Yeah, I know.
- No, he's attracted to other men.

31
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:38,273
Okay, little too far. Crossed the line.

32
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:44,161
Okay, I am telling you,
Oscar is an actual homosexual.

33
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:47,751
Yeah, he told me this morning.

34
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:51,230
And obviously he hopes
he can count on your discretion.

35
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:53,400
I would've never called
him that if I knew.

36
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:58,110
You don't...
you don't call retarded people retards.

37
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:03,642
It's bad taste. You call your friends
retards when they're acting retarded.

38
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,701
And I consider Oscar a friend.

39
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:11,090
Listen man, I am so sorry.
I had no idea.

40
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:12,582
- Oh, it's fine.
- No.

41
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:13,953
- It's okay, it's okay.
- No, it's not. I just-

42
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:16,542
I feel terrible about it. I...

43
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:20,781
I have been calling people
faggy since I was in junior high,

44
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:23,242
and I have never made this mistake.

45
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:25,213
If I don't know how to behave,

46
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,892
it is because I am just
so far the opposite way.

47
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:35,892
You know ? I'm just- I-I
can't even imagine- the... thing.

48
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:40,851
Maybe we could go out for a
beer sometime, and you could tell me...

49
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:44,552
how you do that to another dude.

50
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:50,051
That sounds like a great,
wonderful idea. Let's do that.

51
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:11,013
It explains so much.

52
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:13,632
No, I'm not gay.

53
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:20,133
And I don't understand why
anyone would think that I'm gay if...

54
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:30,711
Yeah, I'm gay.

55
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:37,351
I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin
paper is less flammable, sir, but

56
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:40,312
I can assure you that it
is certainly not more flammable

57
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:43,141
Why did I transfer to Stamford ?

58
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:46,110
I... think that's pretty obvious.

59
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,611
I got promoted.

60
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:51,450
And you can't beat that view. Right ?

61
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:55,270
Hey, Big Tuna. You're single, right ?

62
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,431
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I am.

63
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:02,071
Pretty hot, huh ?

64
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:06,510
She's completely crazy.

65
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:12,830
Steer clear, Big Tuna.
Head for open waters.

66
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:14,862
Okay.

67
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:16,362
Okay.

68
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:20,881
I ate a tuna sandwich on my first day...

69
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,142
so Andy started calling me Big Tuna.

70
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:28,762
I don't think any of them
actually know my real name.

71
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:31,802
Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy,

72
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:34,400
you know ? Cut-your-throat-to-get-ahead
type of guy. But,

73
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,813
I mean, I'm not threatened by him.

74
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,692
I went to Cornell.
You ever heard of it ?

75
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:42,912
I graduated in four years,
I never studied once,

76
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:44,683
I was drunk the whole time,

77
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:49,913
and I sang in the a capella group,
"Here comes Treble."

78
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:54,881
So, end of day, we are going to have
a little diversity policy freshener,

79
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:58,031
because of some more problems
at the Scranton branch.

80
00:05:58,097 --> 00:06:01,853
And I have a list of business
startups I got from the Chamber.

81
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,960
Yes, I am going to need
someone to cold call them.

82
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:07,252
Oh, I can do that.

83
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:09,331
Tuna's  nice enough

84
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:12,793
I don't-I don't know
how well he's fitting in here.

85
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:17,322
He's always looking
at the camera like this.

86
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,072
What is that ?

87
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:21,623
Can you tell who's gay and who's not ?

88
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:22,962
Of course.

89
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,661
What about Oscar ?

90
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:29,171
- Absolutely not.
- Well, he is.

91
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:32,612
Well, he's not dressed
in women's clothes, so...

92
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:37,022
There could be others. I need to know.

93
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:38,973
I don't want to offend anybody else.

94
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:43,371
You could assume everyone is,
and not say anything offensive.

95
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:49,222
Yeah. I'm sure everyone would appreciate
me treating them like they were gay.

96
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:56,660
Hey, what about Angela ? She's hard
and severe. She could be a gay woman.

97
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:58,930
- I really don't think so.
- I don't know.

98
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:02,250
I can imagine her with another woman.
Can't you ?

99
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:10,542
Do some research. Find out if there's
a way to tell by just looking at'em.

100
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:13,692
Jim told me you could by gaydar online.

101
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:15,312
That's ridiculous.

102
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:19,323
Yeah, probably.
He didn't tell the truth a lot.

103
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,241
- Let's call him and get the website.
- Definitely.

104
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:24,680
What's gaydar ?

105
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:28,373
Oh, oh, gaydar, yes ! No, uh,
I think they have it at Sharper Image.

106
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:34,822
Oh, you know what ?
I can check for you. No problem.

107
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,953
It's sold out.

108
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:42,061
Yeah, sorry about that. That's a bummer.

109
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,123
- Well, they're sold out.
- Damn.

110
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:48,250
Try Brookstone.

111
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:55,582
I miss that.

112
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:05,261
Chicken or fish ?

113
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:10,461
chicken.

114
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:16,142
- So, you, uh, having a good day ?
- Excellent. Thanks.

115
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:19,103
Good. I'm glad.

116
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:23,032
Okay.

117
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,143
Yeah, I didn't go
through with the wedding.

118
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:30,652
I got cold feet a few days before,

119
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:35,691
and... I can't really explain it. I just
had to get out of that relationship.

120
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:37,520
We still had to pay for all the food.

121
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:42,343
So we froze it.
But I'm... I'm doing well.

122
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:47,131
I have my own apartment,
and I'm taking art classes,

123
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:49,793
and I have lunch
for the next five weeks.

124
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,683
After Pam dumped me, I, um...

125
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,961
I kind of stopped taking care
of myself for a while there, and, uh...

126
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:02,430
I hit bottom when, uh...
I had a drunk driving arrest.

127
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:06,110
I've  been working out, and, um...
you know,

128
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:09,132
I'm not gonna take her for granted.

129
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:16,390
I gotta win her back.

130
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:18,643
I got them a toaster.

131
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:22,022
They called off the wedding
and gave the toaster back to me.

132
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:24,312
I tried to return
the toaster to the store,

133
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,230
and they said they no longer
sold that kind of toaster.

134
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:31,273
So now my house has got two toasters.

135
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:40,640
It is so cool that you're gay.
I totally underestimated you.

136
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,780
Yes, I am super cool.

137
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:49,783
I am an accountant at a failing
paper supply company. In Scranton.

138
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:52,993
Much like, uh, Sir Ian McKellen.

139
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,692
Sure, sometimes I watch "Will & Grace."

140
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:01,511
And I want to throw up.

141
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:04,140
It's terribly loud.

142
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:08,761
I do like it sometimes,
when Harry Connick Jr. is on.

143
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,323
He's so talented.

144
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:33,027
Okay. Who put my calculator is Jell-O ?

145
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:37,362
Good one.

146
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:42,979
But, uh, seriously. Guys, who did this ?

147
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:49,473
Seriously, guys. Who did this ?

148
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,241
I need to know who
put my calculator in Jell-O

149
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:57,421
or I'm gonna lose... my freakin'mind !

150
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,632
You know, it-it's amazing to me that
in this day and age, you could be so...

151
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,813
obtuse... a-about sexual orientation !

152
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:14,993
I watch "The L Word,"

153
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,031
- Okay ?
- Good, good.

154
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,321
I watch "Queer as [beep]."

155
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,943
- That's not what it's called.
- So...

156
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:23,022
Okay, Michael, are you aware
that you outed Oscar today ?

157
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:25,122
What ? What does that even...

158
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:29,150
Coming out is a significant
moment for a gay person.

159
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:33,010
And they should be allowed to select
the timing and manner of announcing it.

160
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,152
Well, gay pride, right ?

161
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:40,291
Gay pride parade ?
It's not like... Gay Shame Festival.

162
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:44,261
All right, now Oscar's feeling
discriminated against by his coworkers,

163
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:47,320
primarily Angela, and, um...
that's your fault.

164
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,822
I think Angela might be gay.

165
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:52,180
Could Oscar and Angela
be having a gay affair ?

166
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:54,570
- No.
- Maybe. Is that what this is about ?

167
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:55,911
- No.
- I don't.

168
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:57,952
No. It's not possible.

169
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:01,112
- Anything's possible.
- Okay, you know, imagine...

170
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:03,350
you were gay.

171
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:08,401
Well, I'm not gay, Jan, and you
should know that better than anybody.

172
00:12:08,465 --> 00:12:09,383
Michael !

173
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:12,820
Your immaturity is
extremely disappointing

174
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:14,450
and may even lead to a lawsuit,

175
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:17,421
which is the absolute last thing
this company needs right now,

176
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,421
- Do you understand ?
- I know.

177
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:22,651
The company has made
it my responsibility today

178
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:28,653
to put an end to 100,000
years of being weirded out by gays.

179
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,272
Am I the first gay man you ever knew ?

180
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:33,540
Trick question.

181
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:37,602
Because you can't always tell,
so how would I know ?

182
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,483
Was that the right answer ?

183
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,400
- Yep ?
- Michael,

184
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,663
Dwight's looking at gay
pornography on his computer.

185
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,210
Uh, Michael knows, Pam.

186
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:50,272
Okay, he asked me to do this
just for him. He has his own reasons.

187
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:55,772
Okay.

188
00:12:56,357 --> 00:13:00,243
Nothing  wrong with this stuff.
At all. This is fine.

189
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,223
You know what ? Gay porn, straight porn,

190
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:06,681
it's all good.
I don't particularly get into this,

191
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:09,480
but, uh... You know what ?

192
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:14,972
I totally see the merit.
And, actually... It is quite beautiful.

193
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:17,130
- Oh, damn popups.
- What are you doing ?

194
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,292
- Watching some of your friends.
- This is stupid.

195
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,243
- Excuse me.
- Don't touch me. Help ! Ow.

196
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:26,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop it !

197
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:28,283
All right,
everybody in the conference room.

198
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:33,943
I don't care if you are gay
or straight or a lesbian, or overweight.

199
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:37,532
Just get in here ! Right now !

200
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:42,712
Did you know that "gay"
used to mean "happy"?

201
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:46,562
When I was growing up, it meant "lame."

202
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:52,863
And now it means a man
who makes love to other men.

203
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:56,802
We're all homos. Homo sapiens.

204
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:59,910
Gays aren't necessarily
who you think they are, people.

205
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:02,210
I mean, anybody can be gay.

206
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:11,293
Businessmen. Like antique dealers,
or hairdressers, or... accountants.

207
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:16,312
Oscar, why don't you take
this opportunity to officially come out

208
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:17,782
to everybody here,

209
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:20,381
however you want to do it.

210
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:25,302
Go ahead.
Stand up. I'm doing this for you.

211
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:30,413
Yes, I'm gay.

212
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:36,370
And...  I didn't plan on sharing that
part of my life with you today, so...

213
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:39,200
Whatever. Can I sit down now ?

214
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:41,480
I am not offended by homosexuality.

215
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:46,901
In the'60s, I made love to many,
many women. Often outdoors.

216
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:49,002
In the mud and the rain.

217
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:54,012
And it's possible a man slipped in.
There would be no way of knowing.

218
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:59,112
Who, should be the judges
and juries of our society ?

219
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:00,773
Judges and juries.

220
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:03,500
Yes, that's a good point.
She has a good point.

221
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:09,460
Because  gay marriage,
currently, is not legal under U.S. law.

222
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:12,881
I bet a lot of straight
men wished that applied to them.

223
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:16,813
So they could go out there and
have some torrid, unabashed, monkey sex.

224
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:20,451
As much as they could. You know,
that sounds pretty good, right ?

225
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:22,491
That sounds great.

226
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:23,750
Yeah, Dwight ?

227
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:27,072
I think all the other office gays
should identify themselves,

228
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,201
or I will do it for them.

229
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,181
- No one else in this office is gay.
- What about Phyllis ?

230
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:34,100
She makes absolutely
no attempt to be feminine.

231
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:36,223
I'm getting married to Bob Vance.

232
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,462
- You are ?
- Congratulations !

233
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:41,570
- When did you get that ?!
- That's great.

234
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:43,630
Congratulations, Phyllis. That is great.

235
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:48,410
And frankly, kind of amazing.
See ? Everybody has a chance.

236
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:51,152
- Thank you.
- But still, Phyllis...

237
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:56,540
In college, did you ever experiment
with other women ? A lot of women do.

238
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:59,282
No, and you know me in high school.

239
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:02,482
Of course, we all thought
you were gay in high school.

240
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:06,290
Yeah, right. Ha, ha !

241
00:16:07,877 --> 00:16:09,813
And I take that as a compliment.

242
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:12,153
Well, with your ties
and your matching socks-

243
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:14,452
Well, I just liked to look good,
okay, so-

244
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:15,832
You sound pretty defensive, Michael.

245
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,843
No, I am just coming out myself.
I am coming out hetero.

246
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:22,062
I think the problem with this office is

247
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:24,703
that YOU are sending mixed signals
about my being here.

248
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:28,083
No, no, no.
The only signal that I am sending is,

249
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:33,393
"Gay good." Look, if I was gay,

250
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:37,892
I would be the most flamboyant
gay you've ever seen.

251
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:41,980
I would be leading the
parade covered in feathers, and

252
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:45,860
just... I'd be waving that rainbow flag.

253
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:48,560
I don't think I can
work here any longer.

254
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:54,042
This has been the worst,
most backwards day of my life.

255
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,271
You misunderstand-okay. All right.
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bop. You know what ? Okay.

256
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:03,311
Okay. I, uh... I'm gonna put
my money where my mouth is. You ready ?

257
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:05,150
- What are you doing ?
- I am going to embrace Oscar.

258
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:08,182
You might want to watch this, Angela,
because you can't catch anything.

259
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:08,841
Here we go.

260
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:10,381
- No.
- We are going to make a statement.

261
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:13,603
You and I are going to
make a statement together.

262
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:15,561
- Oscar is my friend.
- I'd rather not.

263
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:17,963
- And I just don't care who sees it.
- I...

264
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:19,280
- Doesn't bother me.
- I really would-

265
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,270
would-I'd really rather not.

266
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:22,031
Come here, friend. You're my friend.

267
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,910
No, NO !

268
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:25,673
I don't want to touch you !

269
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:28,811
Ever consider that ? You're ignorant.

270
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:32,042
And insulting. And small.

271
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,240
Okay.

272
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:41,282
All right.

273
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:48,891
I'm sorry, Michael. Michael. I'm sorry.

274
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:52,711
That was a good idea. Come on.

275
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:56,953
Come on. All right.

276
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,461
- I'm sorry I called you "faggy."
- I know, I know.

277
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:02,300
- You're not faggy.
- I know you are.

278
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,760
- You're a good guy.
- You too.

279
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:07,442
Michael appears to be gay too.

280
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:10,113
And yet, he is my friend.

281
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:12,912
I guess I do have a gay friend.

282
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:15,391
You know what ?
I'm gonna raise the stakes.

283
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,992
- You don't... really don't...
- I want you to watch this.

284
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:23,700
And I want you to burn
this into your brains.

285
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:27,321
- I don't think we need to-
- Because this is an image

286
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,683
that I want you people to remember.

287
00:18:29,746 --> 00:18:31,961
For a long time to come.

288
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,770
Whenever you come into the office,
I want you to think about this.

289
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:37,412
We don't need to-

290
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,933
- Yes, we do.
- What ?

291
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:57,363
I did it.

292
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:00,292
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

293
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:05,033
See ? I'm still here.

294
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:08,510
We're all still here.

295
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:14,822
Oh, come one, Dwight ! Come on, man !

296
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,120
We're not in the playground anymore.

297
00:19:17,185 --> 00:19:19,543
There are new rules.

298
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:21,380
We have to be mature

299
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:27,110
, but we can't lose the
spirit of childlike wonder.

300
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:30,671
What is love, anyway ?

301
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,432
Maybe it's suppose
to break all the rules.

302
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,372
Like me and Jan.

303
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:39,161
Or Oscar and some guy.

304
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:41,222
Life is short.

305
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:46,581
When two people find each other...
what should stand in their way ?

306
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,001
It is very easy for you to be a hero.

307
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:53,772
All you need are honesty,
empathy, respect, and open-mindedness.

308
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:56,732
I'm glad today spurred social change.

309
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:58,832
That's part of my
job as regional manager.

310
00:19:58,937 --> 00:20:03,620
But you know what, even if it didn't,
at least we put this matter to bed.

311
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:07,523
That's what she said. Or he said.

312
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:15,143
Oh, there's Gil, Oscar's roommate.

313
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:22,690
I wonder if he knows.

314
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:28,711
I was going to quit, but Jan offered me
a three month paid vacation

315
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:29,801
and a company car.

316
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:33,201
All I had to do was sign
something saying I won't sue.

317
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:35,960
Gil and I are going to Europe.

318
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:39,763
Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.

319
00:20:45,297 --> 00:20:48,490
"Hope this helps, Jim."

320
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:57,121
Nice.

321
00:20:57,225 --> 00:21:00,543
- What are you doing ?
- Shh. Don't be scared.

322
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,373
It works. Heh.

323
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,841
Oh no.
