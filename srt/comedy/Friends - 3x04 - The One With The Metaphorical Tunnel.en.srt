00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,220
Welcome, everybody!
Welcome to Amazing Discoveries!

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,780
It's on again!

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,210
Guys, could we please
not watch this?

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,060
This ever happen to you?
You go to get a glass of milk...

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,460
...but these cartons are so
flinging, flanging hard to open!

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,460
Boy, you said it, Mike.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,220
-There's gotta be a better way.
-There is, Kevin!

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,780
-Can we please turn this off?
-No way, Kevin!

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,450
What if I told you there's
a new product that guarantees...

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,460
... you'll never have to open up
milk cartons again?

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,820
Meet the Milkmaster 2000!

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,540
-Intrigued?
-You' re flinging, flanging right I am!

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,540
This is the first time he's used this.
You'll see how easy this is to do.

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,340
-This works in any milk carton.
-Wow, it is easy!

15
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,820
Now I can have milk every day.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,370
The One With the Metaphorical Tunnel

17
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,610
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

18
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,610
It's official.
There are no good movies.

19
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,290
So let's go to a bad one,
and make out.

20
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,820
Perhaps you'd like me to turn
so you can bunny-bump against my back?

21
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,620
-Hey, man. What's up?
-Maybe you can tell me.

22
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,330
My agent wants to know why I didn't
show up at my audition today. . .

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,020
. . .my first good one in weeks.
How could you not give me the message?

24
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,780
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt. . .

25
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,940
. . .but it wasn't me.

26
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,020
Yes, it was.
It was him!

27
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,180
Okay, it was me!

28
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,460
-How was it you?
-Well, it was all so crazy, you know?

29
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,460
Chandler was in the closet,
counting to 1 0. . .

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,660
. . .and I hadn't found a place
to hide yet.

31
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,220
I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all
down on my hand. See? All of it.

32
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,420
Yep, that's my audition.

33
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,420
See? Now, this is why I keep
notepads everywhere.

34
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,420
Yep. And that's why we don't
invite you to play.

35
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,820
What is the great tragedy here?
Get yourself another appointment.

36
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,850
Estelle tried. The casting director
told her I missed my chance.

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,250
Well, that is unfair!

38
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,020
I'll call her.
I'll tell her it was my fault.

39
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,020
You can't. The casting director
doesn't talk to friends.

40
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,380
-She only talks to agents.
-What a sad little life she must lead.

41
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,620
-What are you doing?
-No, I know, I know.

42
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,140
Hi, this is Caitlin
from Phoebe Buffay's office.

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,650
Is Anne there for Phoebe?

44
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,100
She'll know what it's about.

45
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,700
Hang up. Hang up right--

46
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,060
Annie? Hi. Listen, we've got
a problem with Joey Tribbiani.

47
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,610
Apparently, he missed his audition.
Who did you speak to in my office?

48
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,930
Estelle? I don't know
what to do with her.

49
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,300
So your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment. The world doesn't stop.

50
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,940
Is anybody else scared?

51
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,220
If Joey loses this audition, then
that is it for Estelle. I don't care!

52
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,860
Annie, you are a doll. What time can
you see him? I need a pen. Pen!

53
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,970
Get the woman a pad!
Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!

54
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,980
Oh, now you want a pad.

55
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,460
Where's my boy?

56
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,660
Here's my boy!

57
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,740
And here's his Barbie!

58
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,540
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?

59
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,050
He picked it out at the store.
He loves it.

60
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,740
He carries it everywhere,
like a security blanket.

61
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,580
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.

62
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,420
Yeah, it's cute.

63
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,460
Why does he have it again?

64
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,770
So he's got a doll. So what?

65
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,660
Unless you' re afraid
he's gonna grow up to be. . .

66
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,460
. . .in show business.

67
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,940
This wouldn't have
to do with the fact. . .

68
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,220
. . .that he's being raised
by two women?

69
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,260
You know what? It's fine. If you' re
okay with the Barbie thing, so am l.

70
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,620
Give Daddy the Barbie.
Give me the Barbie.

71
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
Don't you wanna play
with a monster truck?

72
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,330
No? Okay.

73
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,700
How about a Dino-Soldier?

74
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,900
You are so pathetic.

75
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,220
Why can't your son
just play with his doll?

76
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,100
I gotta go to work.

77
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,340
Has anybody seen my left boob?

78
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,780
I loved that movie.

79
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,740
Here it is.
What are you doing?

80
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,500
I' m sorry. It just felt nice.

81
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,450
Answer the phone.

82
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,260
I only got one arm. You should
do stuff for me. Get me a sweater.

83
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,220
Just do it! It's Janice.

84
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,820
And if I get it, I'll have
to see her tonight.

85
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,130
That's great.
I'll have to see her tonight.

86
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,500
Why don't you want to see Janice?

87
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,810
Last night at dinner,
when the meals came. . .

88
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,620
. . .she put half her chicken piccata
on my plate and took all my tomatoes.

89
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,380
And that's bad. . .

90
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,860
. . .because you hate chicken piccata?

91
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,620
You didn't want to share your tomatoes.
Tomatoes are very important to you.

92
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,020
Suddenly, we were this "couple. "

93
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,660
And this alarm started going off
in my head.

94
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,970
"Run for your life!
Get out of the building! "

95
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,100
Men are unbelievable.

96
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,820
What is it with you people?

97
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,900
The minute you feel something,
you have to run away?

98
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,610
I know. That--

99
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,740
That's why I don't want to go tonight.
I' m afraid I'll say something stupid.

100
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,020
You mean that "guy thing" where
you act mean and distant. . .

101
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,860
. . .until we break up with you?

102
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,290
You know about that?

103
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,620
What do I do?
I wanna get past this.

104
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,010
I don't want to be afraid
of commitment.

105
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,620
I want to go through the tunnel
to the other side!

106
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,780
Where there's no fear of commitment.

107
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,180
Do we have any--

108
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,380
Do we have any thoughts here?

109
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,260
I've never been through
the tunnel myself because. . .

110
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,780
. . .you' re not allowed through
with more than one girl in the car.

111
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,060
But it seems to me it's pretty much
like anything else. Face your fear.

112
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,060
Fear of heights?
Go to the top of the building.

113
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,620
You' re afraid of bugs.

114
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,050
Get a bug.

115
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,420
You have a fear of commitment.

116
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,860
So I say you go in there and you be
the most committed guy there ever was!

117
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,250
Amazingly, that makes sense.

118
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,940
-Do you think?
-Oh, yeah! Go for it, man!

119
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,250
Jump off the high dive!

120
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,020
Stare down the barrel of the gun!
Pee into the wind!

121
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,010
If I' m staring down
the barrel of a gun. . .

122
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,980
. . .I' m gonna be pretty much peeing
every which way.

123
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,450
It's your audition from this morning!

124
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,020
Can I use the phone?

125
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,620
Sure, that's what it's there for.
Emergencies and pretend agents.

126
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,100
Come on, baby! Come on!

127
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,940
Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay
returning a page.

128
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,540
Okay, she's in her car.
I'll have to patch you through.

129
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,380
very nice touch.

130
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,900
Okay, go ahead.

131
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,530
Talk, talk, talk!

132
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,940
Hi, Annie?

133
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,730
Fantastic. You got it!

134
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,900
Will he work for scale, you ask me?
Well, I don't know about that.

135
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,020
Except that I do and he will.

136
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,980
Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.

137
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,340
I would love to have lunch with you!

138
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,340
How about we have lunch next--

139
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,020
Went through a tunnel.

140
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,660
Unbelievable.

141
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,580
Oh, thank you so much!

142
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,060
It was really fun. I mean, I've never
talked on a car phone before.

143
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,620
You are so amazing!
Could you do me this huge favor?

144
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,220
There's another audition I want,
and Estelle couldn't get me in.

145
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,820
I don't know.
It was fun one time, but--

146
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,340
Please? It would just be
this one more.

147
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,940
Well, actually it's two.

148
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,220
Two?

149
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,900
Well, really it's three.

150
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,610
Please? You' re so good at it.
I love you.

151
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,460
Okay. But just these three, right?

152
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,930
No, it's four.

153
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,260
So how come you wanted
to eat in tonight?

154
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Because I wanted. . .

155
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,740
. . .to give you this.

156
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,660
Are you a puppy!

157
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,420
Contact paper!

158
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,620
What do you say when someone
you' re sleeping with. . .

159
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,540
. . .gives you contact paper?

160
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,340
Wait, there's more.
See, the contact paper is to go. . .

161
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,620
. . .in your brand new drawer!

162
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,450
See, the drawer actually
goes in my dresser.

163
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,020
You didn't have to do this.

164
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,570
Yes, I did.

165
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,140
Yes, I did.
Because you' re my girlfriend. . .

166
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,100
. . .and that's what girlfriends
should get.

167
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,490
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. . .

168
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,620
. . .because, oh, my God!

169
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,890
Who would've thought that someday. . .

170
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,020
. . .Chandler Bing would buy me
a drawer?

171
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,420
Well, not me.

172
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,380
But that's what's happened.
And there's more.

173
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,940
We should take a trip.

174
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,650
We should?

175
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,370
We' re a couple,
and that's what couples do.

176
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,940
And I wanna meet your parents.

177
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,900
We should take a trip
with your parents!

178
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,220
I don't think we need to because
you' re tripping me out right now!

179
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,250
Are you okay?

180
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,300
No, I am.

181
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,820
I actually am! This is amazing.

182
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,140
My entire life, I have feared
this place.

183
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,850
And now that I' m here, it's like,
what was the big deal?

184
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,860
I could probably say, "Let's move in
together," and I'd be okay.

185
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,530
You probably want us
to move in together?

186
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,740
-It doesn't scare me!
-Yeah, well it scares me!

187
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,660
I' m not even divorced yet! You just
invited me over here for pasta. . .

188
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,820
. . .and now you' re talking
about moving in together.

189
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,860
And I wasn't even that hungry.

190
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,860
You know what? It's getting really
late, and I should just--

191
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,860
Don't go! I've scared you!
I've said too much!

192
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,020
I' m hopeless and awkward
and desperate for love!

193
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,540
Hey, Janice, it's me.

194
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,740
I wanted to apologize in advance
for having chased you down the street.

195
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,810
Here you go, honey. This will help.

196
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,540
So I catch up to her
and she says. . .

197
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,090
. . .this relationship's going too fast
and we have to slow down.

198
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,860
That is never good.

199
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,340
Then I got all. . .

200
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,660
. . .needy and clingy.

201
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,090
Wait a minute. Maybe it's
not so bad. How did you leave it?

202
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,260
She said she'd call me.

203
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,780
Oh, God.

204
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,370
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.

205
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,820
This ice cream tastes like crap,
by the way.

206
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,410
Well, it's that
low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.

207
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,460
We save the real stuff
for the truly terminal cases.

208
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,690
When you' re getting screwed over all
the time, you gotta switch to low fat.

209
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,010
Yeah, you do.

210
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,420
You don't think I' m terminal?

211
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,220
Not at all. You' re not terminal.
We just need some damage control.

212
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,220
Okay. Should I call her?

213
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,450
It's a critical time. If you feel
yourself reaching for that phone. . .

214
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,010
. . .go shopping, get your butt
in a bubble bath.

215
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,690
If you want her back,
you have got to start acting aloof.

216
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,860
She has to know you' re not needy.

217
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,660
So what you have to do is. . .

218
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,700
. . .you have to accidentally
run into her on purpose. . .

219
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,660
. . .and then act aloof.

220
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,220
So I' m not gonna lose her?

221
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,380
Oh, honey, you' re not a total loser.

222
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,890
I said, "So I' m not gonna lose her?"

223
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,450
Guess who's here!

224
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,540
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!

225
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,540
Real American hero
I'm G.I. Joe!

226
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,170
Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.

227
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,700
G.I. Joe?

228
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,780
You really think he'll fall for that?

229
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,980
G.I. Joe?

230
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,300
Cool! Can I play?

231
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,450
Look, Ben! It's a toy that protects
U.S. oil interests overseas!

232
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,850
Go, Joe!

233
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,300
-There you are!
-No, it's not. Sorry.

234
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,140
But, Phoebe, wait, wait.
Phoebe!

235
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,260
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay!
See, I didn't recognize you. . .

236
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,980
. . .in those pants.

237
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,130
That Tv movie I went in for,
did you hear anything?

238
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,940
I think I got a shot at it.

239
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,620
Yes, they called!
You didn't get it!

240
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,650
Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.
I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

241
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,210
That's okay. These things happen.

242
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,180
But they shouldn't happen.
You know what?

243
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
You' re in a terrible,
terrible business.

244
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,010
I don't want to be the person
who makes you look like that.

245
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,180
I' m okay. See?

246
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,180
Now you' re sad and creepy.

247
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,180
I' m sorry. I quit.

248
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,530
No, no, you can't quit!
You' re the best agent I ever had.

249
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,100
Rejection is part of being an actor.
You can't take it personal.

250
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,740
They said they'd never met an ltalian
actor with a worse ltalian accent.

251
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,780
They actually said that?

252
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,740
Oh, God, there's that face again.
See? I can't do this job!

253
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,020
This is why
you have to do this job!

254
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,410
Agents always lie.

255
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,460
Estelle just says stuff like,
"They went another way. "

256
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,420
But this? I can use this.

257
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,340
I can work on a new accent.

258
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Yeah, okay. If it
helps you, okay. Yeah.

259
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,820
You'll never get me, Joe!

260
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,580
No, thank you.

261
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,980
What are you doing here?

262
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,260
Just a bit of shopping.

263
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,730
How have you been?

264
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,260
Are you being British?

265
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,690
Not anymore.

266
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,820
Why are you shopping here?
You don't live in this neighborhood.

267
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,460
Were you here waiting for me?

268
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,010
I' m just. . .

269
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,220
. . .picking up some things for a party.

270
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,140
Barley?

271
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,900
What kind of party serves barley?

272
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,100
I' m sorry if my friends aren't
as sophisticated as yours.

273
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,890
Where is this party?

274
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,940
Here in Chelsea.

275
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,820
Whose party is it?

276
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,140
A woman's.

277
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,260
What woman?

278
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,770
Chelsea.

279
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,820
Either you' re seeing somebody
behind my back. . .

280
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,580
. . .which would make you
the world's biggest jerk. . .

281
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,010
. . .or you' re pretending
to see somebody. . .

282
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,540
. . .which makes you so pathetic
I could cry right here!

283
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,220
So which of these two guys
do you want to be?

284
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,900
Can I be that guy?

285
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,620
Okay, we got some more good
rejections. Lots of stuff to work on.

286
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,610
Okay. Shoot.

287
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,460
Okay. Oh, the zoo commercial.

288
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,660
I didn't get it?

289
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,610
They said that you
"weren't believable as a human being. "

290
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,660
So you can work on that.

291
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,580
Great.

292
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,970
What else?

293
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,620
The off-Broadway-play people said
that you were "pretty but dumb. "

294
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,610
Oh, no wait. I' m sorry.
That's "pretty dumb. "

295
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,420
Look, it's okay, no, no, no.
Really.

296
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,650
Look. . .

297
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,090
. . .I really appreciate this. . .

298
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,020
. . .but I' m gonna have to
go back to Estelle.

299
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,740
Don't get me wrong.
You' re a better agent than she is. . .

300
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,530
. . .but at least with her, I don't want
to blow my pretty dumb brains out.

301
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,620
Yeah, no, I understand.

302
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,300
You do? Thanks. Okay.

303
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,450
Sorry.

304
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,330
Wait a minute.

305
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,780
Wait a minute.

306
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,220
Did you make all that stuff up
to get out of being my agent?

307
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,780
Oh, he caught me.

308
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,740
I am so busted!

309
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,970
That's what I suspected!

310
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,220
And then I just, you know. . .

311
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,220
. . .threw the bag of barley at her
and ran out of the store.

312
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,410
My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof,"
not "a doof. "

313
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,740
I've actually ruined this, haven't l?

314
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,180
Is it time for the good ice cream now?

315
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,180
Yeah, it is.

316
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,860
You know what?
Everything's gonna be okay.

317
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,620
Can you hold on for a second?

318
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,220
What do I do?

319
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,260
I don't know.
This is unprecedented.

320
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,970
If we did what you did,
a man would never call.

321
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,220
I got it! Pretend you just woke up.
That'll throw her off!

322
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,460
-Be sleepy!
-Yes! And grumpy!

323
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,220
What are you--?
Stop naming dwarfs!

324
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,820
I' m so glad that you called.

325
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,220
I know I've been acting
really weird lately. . .

326
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,420
. . .and it's just because
I' m crazy about you. . .

327
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,060
. . .and I just got stupid and scared. . .

328
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,020
. . .and stupid a couple more times.

329
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,210
And I' m sorry.

330
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,500
Really?

331
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,700
Really?

332
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,860
He's so lucky.
If Janice were a guy. . .

333
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,820
. . .she'd be sleeping
with somebody else by now.

334
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,260
I love you too.

335
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,100
It's so unfair!

336
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,420
G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?!

337
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,860
I don't know what to tell you guys.
That's the doll he chose.

338
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,540
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

339
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,940
Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.

340
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,460
And if you guys can't deal with it,
that's just your too bad.

341
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,130
What are you being such a weenie for?
So he has a Barbie. Big deal.

342
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,340
You used to dress up like a woman.

343
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,060
What?

344
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,250
The way you used to dress up
in Mom's clothes?

345
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,300
What are you talking about?

346
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,340
The big hat, the pearls,
the little pink handbag?

347
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,020
Okay. You are totally
making this up.

348
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,260
How can you not remember?

349
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,220
You made us call you "Bea"?

350
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,660
Oh, God.

351
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,700
I've literally never been this happy.

352
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,420
Wasn't there a little song?

353
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,620
Oh, please, God,
let there be a song.

354
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,210
There was no song.
There was no song.

355
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,740
I am Bea

356
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,820
-I drink tea--
-That's enough.

357
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,420
Won't you....

358
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,780
Won't you....

359
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,010
Won't you....

360
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,940
Won't you dance around with me?

361
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,770
I am Bea

362
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,370
I drink tea

363
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,460
Won't you dance around with--?

364
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,330
Ross?
