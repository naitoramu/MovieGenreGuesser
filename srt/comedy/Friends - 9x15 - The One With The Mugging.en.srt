1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,881
Guys! Guys! I've got great
news. Guess what.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,425
- Monica's pregnant!
- Really?

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,971
Let's get past the moment.

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,015
- What's your news?
- Thank you.

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,434
I got a job in advertising.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,645
Honey, that's incredible!

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,107
Gosh, what's the pay like?

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,903
Oh, come on, people.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,281
If I don't know who makes the most...

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,784
...how do I know who
I like the most? Hi, Joey.

11
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,287
It pays nothing. It's an internship.

12
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,373
We have interns at "Days of Our Lives".

13
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,626
Right. So it'll be the same,
except less sex with you.

14
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,755
What do you think they'll
have you do there?

15
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,092
It's a training program, but they
hire the people they like.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,261
- That's great!
- There's gonna be some grunt work...

17
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,057
...which will stink. A grown man
getting people coffee is humiliating.

18
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,938
Humiliating and noble.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,399
Thank you.

20
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,236
You know, if I didn't
already have a job...

21
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,488
...I would've been good in advertising.

22
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,408
Ross, you did not come up with:
"Got Milk?"

23
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,576
Yes, I did! I did!

24
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,290
I should've written it down.

25
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,584

28
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,052
Where's Chandler? I want to wish
him good luck on his first day.

29
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,722
And I smelled bacon.

30
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,142
- He just left.
- Who did?

31
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,438
Joey, you're never gonna
believe it! She called!

32
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,190
- She did?
- You got it!

33
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,025
- I did?
- What is she talking about?

34
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,445
I don't know, but it sounds great!

35
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,780
Your agent called.
You got that audition!

36
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,323
- With Leonard Hayes?
- Yes!

37
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,202
Oh, my God, that is great!
It's for a play on Broadway.

38
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:44,498
And in a real theater. Not that little
one underneath the deli like last time.

39
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,333
- Is it a good play?
- It must be.

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,087
I read it and didn't
understand a single word!

41
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,006
- Leonard Hayes is starring in it.
- Yeah, and directing.

42
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,676
He was so good in
that movie of "Macbeth".

43
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,679
- You saw that?
- No, but I saw the previews.

44
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:03,059
They played it right before "Jackass".

45
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,602
- He's done some amazing work.
- Oh, yeah.

46
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,980
I loved him in those phone commercials.

47
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:12,067
When the monkey hits him in the face
with the giant rubber phone...

48
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,153
Maybe the monkey
will be at the audition.

49
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,115
Don't make me more nervous
than I already am!

50
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,835
- Good morning.
- Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?

51
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,963
Oh, no, no. I'm an intern,
just like you guys.

52
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,718
Except for the tie, the briefcase
and the fact that I can rent a car.

53
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,719
Seriously, you're an intern?

54
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:44,015
I'm heading in a new career direction
and you gotta start at the bottom.

55
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,686
Dude.

56
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:52,316
I know I'm a little older than you guys,
but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.

57
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,362
The comedian. USO.

58
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,493
It's U.S.A., sir.

59
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,418
This is Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, these are the producers.

60
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,546
And as you probably already
know, this is Leonard Hayes.

61
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:23,722
It is so amazing to meet you.
I am such a big fan of your work.

62
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,767
I've been blessed with
a lot of great roles.

63
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:32,106
Tell me about it, huh?
"Unlimited nights and weekends!"

64
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,568
Are you making fun of me?
Because I am not a sellout.

65
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,446
I didn't do it for money.
I believe in those phones!

66
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,992
I almost lost a cousin because
of bad wireless service.

67
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,330
No, I wasn't making fun of you. I think
you were great in those commercials.

68
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,832
- Really?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,084
Well, I do bring a certain
credibility to the role.

70
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,464
Are you kidding? When they shoot
you out of that cannon...

71
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,968
"Hang up that phone!"

72
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,304
- One take.
- Wow.

73
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,516
- So shall we read?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

74
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:11,729
Top of Act 2. This is my entrance.
You got it?

75
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,902
What the hell are you still doing here?

76
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,864
- I think you know.
- Bastard!

77
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,577
I am what you made me.
You know what? I could go right now.

78
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,454
- Go! Go!
- I can't.

79
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,333
Oh, I want to, Long Pause...

80
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,629
...but I can't.

81
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:44,553
So sorry. You're not supposed
to say "long pause."

82
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,601
Oh! Oh, I thought that was your
character's name. You know?

83
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,271
I thought you were, like, an Indian
or something, you know, with the...

84
00:05:56,023 --> 00:06:00,152
No. Thank you so much for coming in.
We appreciate it. Thank you.

85
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,154
You don't want me to do it again?

86
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,948
- I could do an accent.
- No.

87
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:09,202
You know, Southern.
"I could go right now, mon!" Huh?

88
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,124
My God in heaven.

89
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:19,588
Joey, hang on. Leonard, can
we talk to you for a moment?

90
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:25,928
Yes? You've got to be kidding.
He can't act.

91
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,846
I don't care if you think he's hot.

92
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:32,684
If you want to sleep with him,
do it on your own time. This is a play.

93
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,146
If you insist on this...

94
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,356
...I will call my agent so fast...

95
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:41,360
...on a cell phone connection so clear,
he's gonna think I'm next door!

96
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:47,783
Hi, thank you so much for
whispering for my benefit.

97
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,412
Tell me what I did wrong. I'd love to
work on it and try it again for you.

98
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,790
And also, how you doing?

99
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:02,757
Give me another chance.
I really want to get better. Please?

100
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,510
If you want to come back today...

101
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,429
...here are my notes. Ready?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:14,351
- You're in your head. Thinking too much.
- I really doubt that.

103
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,272
No, no. It's that you're not
connected with anything in your body.

104
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,691
There's no urgency.
The scene is a struggle.

105
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,403
It's a race.
Also, what you did was horizontal.

106
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,490
Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.

107
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:32,953
And don't learn the words.
Let the words learn you.

108
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,835
Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?

109
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,882
Hey, do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

110
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,886
I can't. I've got a date
with that waitress, Katie.

111
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,223
I know we've only gone out,
like, twice, but I don't know...

112
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,353
...I have a good feeling about her.
- Oh, I hear divorce bells.

113
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,231
Give me your wallets,
and there won't be a problem.

114
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,191
- What?
- I have a gun.

115
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,570
Okay, relax, Phoebe.
Just stay calm.

116
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,991
Oh, my God, I can't find my wallet!

117
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,663
- All right, lady, now give me your purse.
- No.

118
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:20,959
What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd
be my death, Phoebe Buffay!

119
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,671
- Lowell, is that you?
- Phoebe?

120
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,551
- Oh, my God!
- Unbelievable! Oh, my God!

121
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:34,181
I'm sorry. Ross, this is my old friend,
Lowell, from the streets!

122
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,767
- Lowell, Ross.
- Ross, nice to meet you.

123
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,102
Yeah, a real pleasure.

124
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,523
It's been so long! Oh, so long.

125
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,194
- I can't believe you're still doing this.
- I know. But I quit smoking.

126
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,154
Good for you.

127
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,031
You look like you're doing well.

128
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,826
I guess your mugging days
are behind you.

129
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,371
Oh, my God.
Phoebe, you used to mug people?

130
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,792
Excuse me, Ross,
old friends catching up.

131
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,676
- How'd the audition go?
- They want to see me again, but...

132
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,596
...Leonard Hayes did not like me.

133
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,432
- What happened?
- He said I wasn't urgent enough.

134
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:23,438
Everything I did was horizontal,
and I should be more vertical.

135
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:29,236
- He said that I should think less.
- Well, so far so good.

136
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,571
Honey, I'm old!

137
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,866
What's wrong?

138
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:39,454
I am so much older than these other
interns. I can't compete with them.

139
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,039
So you're a little older.

140
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,084
Look at the positive.
You have all this life experience.

141
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:49,840
Yes, but I don't think life experience
is gonna help me with these.

142
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:55,971
Wow! It's like they're on fire!

143
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,895
- What are they?
- Prototype sneakers.

144
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,564
I need ideas on how to sell them.
Which I can't do...

145
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,359
...because no self-respecting
adult would ever wear these.

146
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,152
I'll give you $500 for them.

147
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,284
- What am I supposed to do?
- Come on, sneakers are easy.

148
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:21,163
- You wear them all the time.
- They're not called sneakers anymore.

149
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:27,253
They're called "kicks" or "skids."
I think I heard somebody say "slorps."

150
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,549
They've got wheels that pop out from
the bottom so you can roll around...

151
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:36,136
...because apparently
walking is too much exercise.

152
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:40,682
"Kids! Kids! Roll your
way to childhood obesity!"

153
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,687
Would you help me try to sell these?

154
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:49,942
Okay. Have you considered
using a girl with huge knockers?

155
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,611
That's not what they're looking for.

156
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,363
Hey, that would work on me.

157
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,575
Why do you think I buy
Mrs. Butterworth's?

158
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,587
You'll never guess what just happened.

159
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,423
- Phoebe and I got mugged!
- Are you okay?

160
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,218
Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.

161
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,470
How do you know a mugger?

162
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,933
I'm sorry, I have friends
outside the six of us.

163
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,228
Know how she knew him?
Because Phoebe used to mug people.

164
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,146
Seriously?

165
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,858
Well, I'm not proud of it,
but, you know...

166
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:37,239
...when I was living on the street and
I needed money for food and stuff...

167
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:41,326
- That is awful.
- I wasn't rich like you guys, okay?

168
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:45,580
I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.

169
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:49,918
I had a hard life.
My mother was killed by a drug dealer.

170
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:54,882
- Your mother killed herself.
- She was a drug dealer.

171
00:11:55,716 --> 00:12:00,679
It was a good thing she knew him.
I was about to do some serious damage.

172
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,264
Okay.

173
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,935
This must have brought back
some bad memories for you, Ross.

174
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,938
- Why?
- Ross was mugged as a kid.

175
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,400
- You were?
- Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.

176
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,736
It was outside St. Mark's Comics.

177
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:20,908
I was minding my business, seeing what
kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.

178
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,160
Wonder Woman.

179
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,455
Anyway, I was heading
towards this bakery...

180
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:31,293
...to pick up a couple of dozen
linzer tortes for someone...

181
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,548
...when out of nowhere, this thug
with a pipe jumps out and says:

182
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,009
- "Give me your money, punk!"
- Oh, my God.

183
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,054
I know. And the worst part
was, they took my backpack...

184
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:48,060
...which had all the original artwork I did
for my own comic book, "Science Boy".

185
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,438
Oh, yeah! What was
his super power again?

186
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,525
A super-human thirst for knowledge.

187
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,278
I better get to class.

188
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,657
Are there any more of your
friends I should look out for?

189
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,951
No. Actually, you might want to stay
away from Jane Street.

190
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,830
That's where Stabby Joe works.

191
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,628
- I think we have a problem here.
- What?

192
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:19,967
Back in my mugging days,
I worked St. Mark's Comics.

193
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:24,679
- Yeah?
- A pipe was my weapon of choice...

194
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:28,017
...and preteen, comic-book nerds
were my meat.

195
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,853
So?

196
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,523
There was one kid who had
a sticker on his backpack that said:

197
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,942
- "Geology rocks!"
- "Geology rocks!"

198
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,991
- Oh, my God!
- I know! I mugged Ross!

199
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,249
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry.

200
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,168
But can I just run to the bathroom?

201
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:58,380
- No. Leonard doesn't wait.
- But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!

202
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,259
Joey, here we go!
Let's go. Very quickly.

203
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,844
- I really need...
- We must go now, quickly.

204
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,098
- Yeah. Yes, sir.
- Ready?

205
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,853
- What the hell are you still doing here?
- I think you know!

206
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:17,608
- Oh, you sick bastard!
- I am what you made me! Know what?

207
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,527
- What?
- I could go right now.

208
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:28,577
- Then go. Go!
- Oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!

209
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,957
Cut. That was good!

210
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,669
- Very good. You did everything I asked.
- I did?

211
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,423
Yes. Plus which, you've got this,
I don't know, this squirmy quality...

212
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,593
...you bring to the character
I couldn't have imagined.

213
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,303
Here's what we're gonna do:

214
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,014
Come back tomorrow
for the final callbacks.

215
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:52,309
Do all of this, what you got
going now. But you know what?

216
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,061
More. More. Can you do that?

217
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:58,566
Sure. I don't have time to say
thank you because I really gotta go!

218
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,987
Look at that! Still in character.
I like him.

219
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:08,950
I plant seeds. I can't explain it.
I don't know.

220
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,957
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Putting on the sneakers...

221
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,835
...to get in the young mindset,
see if it sparks anything.

222
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,755
- Oh, anything yet?
- Yes, how's this?

223
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:26,969
"They're so uncomfortable, it's like
getting kicked in the nuts for your feet."

224
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,193
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing.

225
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,987
No, that seems about right.

226
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:50,826
Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.
Apparently, that makes me a good actor.

227
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,996
I got a callback, so I'm drinking
everything. Oh, by the way...

228
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,498
...that eggnog in our fridge was great!

229
00:15:56,707 --> 00:16:01,253
- Joey, that was formula.
- We gotta get more of that.

230
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:07,551
These aren't half bad. You should
suggest these to Ralph Lauren.

231
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,889
Okay, first of all, that's stupid.
Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.

232
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:18,354
All right. I feel younger already.

233
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,567
Yeah, I think I broke my hip.

234
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,445
- Hey, you!
- Hey.

235
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,197
Hey. How was class?

236
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,117
No one asks me that. What's wrong?

237
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:36,330
- Nothing. I really want to know.
- Oh.

238
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:40,875
Well, there was actually a rather lively
discussion about the Pleistocene...

239
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,587
All right, nothing is worth this.

240
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,507
I have a confession to make.

241
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,719
Okay, you know that girl that
mugged you when you were a kid?

242
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:56,600
What are you talking about?
It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.

243
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,270
You don't have to lie anymore.
I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.

244
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,022
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

245
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:06,402
You don't think I would have defended
myself against a 14-year-old...?

246
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,322
- "Give me your money, punk!"
- Oh, my God, it was you!

247
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,786
I can't believe it. You mugged me?

248
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:20,041
Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,960
But, you know, if you think
about it, it's kind of neat.

250
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,799
I mean, well, it's just that I've
always felt kind of like an outsider.

251
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:32,511
You know, the rest of you have
connections that go way back...

252
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:37,308
...and, you know, now you
and I have a great one.

253
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,268
It's not the best!

254
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,565
I know. Please forgive me.
I don't know what to say.

255
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:48,485
There's nothing you can say! That was
the most humiliating thing ever.

256
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:51,906
- Even more humiliating than...
- Let's not do this!

257
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:58,746
And then, at the end of the commercial,
the girls get out of the hot tub...

258
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,373
...and start making
out with each other.

259
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,961
That's interesting.

260
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:10,007
Just one thought: You didn't
mention the shoes.

261
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,136
Who's next? Chandler.

262
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,140
You start with a guy
putting on the shoes.

263
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,351
- He's about my age.
- Your age?

264
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,940
He's rolling down the street
and he starts to lose control.

265
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,650
Maybe he falls.
Maybe he hurts himself.

266
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,529
Just then, a kid comes flying
by wearing the shoes.

267
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:36,325
He jumps over the old guy and laughs.
And the line reads:

268
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,202
"Not suitable for adults."

269
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:44,040
- Well, Chandler, that's great.
- Thank you, sir.

270
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,878
Or, man who's two
years younger than me.

271
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:53,300
You see, that has a clear selling point.
It appeals to our key demographic.

272
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,470
- How did you come up with that?
- I don't know! I don't know!

273
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:02,351
I was just trying to get into a young
mindset, and stuff started to flow.

274
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,189
- That is great. Good work.
- Thank you.

275
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,066
We'll see all of you tomorrow.

276
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,871
The cold weather hurts my hip.

277
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:33,424
Hey, Ross. I know you're still mad at
me, but can I just talk to you for a sec?

278
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:38,262
Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
Sure, go ahead.

279
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,598
I just really wanted to apologize again.

280
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:46,603
And also show you something
I think you'll find very exciting.

281
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:52,234
Oh, my God! "Crap from the street!"

282
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,991
Look, Ross. In this box...

283
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:03,745
...are all the things I got from mugging
that I thought were too special to sell...

284
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,872
...or smoke.

285
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,419
Anyway, I was looking
through it, and I found...

286
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,879
..."Science Boy."

287
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,634
Oh, my God!

288
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,180
I never thought I'd see this again.

289
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,726
It's all here!

290
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,438
What made you save
it all these years?

291
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,108
I guess I just thought
it was really good.

292
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,652
And maybe it would be
worth something one day.

293
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,990
You really thought "Science Boy"
was worth saving?

294
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:45,287
Yeah. But you should know I also have a
jar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.

295
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,001
Still, this is amazing!

296
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,128
Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.

297
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:57,758
You're welcome. Thank you for
Science Boy. I learned a lot from him.

298
00:20:58,342 --> 00:20:59,844
You're welcome.

299
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:06,266
- I need an answer!
- I can't tell you something I don't know.

300
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,310
- You know!
- I don't know!

301
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:14,442
- I need an answer now!
- You want an answer? The answer is...

302
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,743
She never loved me.
She only loved you.

303
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,663
You knew this all along
and you never told me?

304
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:32,917
I can never forgive you, or myself. I have
nothing to live for. Bang! And scene!

305
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,172
Absolutely amazing.

306
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:43,470
- The part is yours.
- Thanks! Now I really gotta go.

307
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,600
No, wait! Congratulations!
You did it.

308
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,936
You did it. You can relax now. Yeah.

309
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,492
Wow! That's a big cable bill.

310
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:11,707
You don't have a job,
but you have no problem ordering porn.

311
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,835
On a Saturday afternoon?

312
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,546
I was in the house!

313
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,968
Hey. Phoebe didn't by any
chance mention that...

314
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:25,638
She was the huge guy that
mugged you? Yeah.

315
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,350
I see. You didn't happen to tell...

316
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:32,770
- Everybody we know? Yeah.
- Great. Thanks.

317
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:38,275
[ENGLISH]
