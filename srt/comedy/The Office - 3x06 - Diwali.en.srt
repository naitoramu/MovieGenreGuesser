1
00:00:01,717 --> 00:00:03,500
There you go.

2
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:10,051
Nice dress, Ryan.

3
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:12,900
It's not a dress.
It's a kurta.

4
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:13,561
Okay.

5
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:17,496
Tonight,one of our most
ethnic coworkers, Kelly,

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,358
has invited us all
to a Diwali celebration

7
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,338
put on by her community.

8
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:24,337
What is Diwali,
you may ask?

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Well, to have Kelly explain it,

10
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:30,590
"It's..."

11
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:32,300
"It's so super, fun.

12
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:34,105
"And it's gonna be great."

13
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:36,846
A lot of gods with
unpronounceable names.

14
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:41,011
20 minutes later, you find out
that it's essentially a Hindu Halloween.

15
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:43,312
- You look so handsome.
- You really do.

16
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:45,900
- I love the material.
- I know.

17
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:47,700
How come you didn't get me one?

18
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:49,681
I...

19
00:01:12,027 --> 00:01:14,632
Episode 6
"Diwali"

20
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:17,252
The catch 22 team
Raceman

21
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:19,920
http://www.theofficeus.fr/
http://www.1000fr.com/

22
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:24,603
Okay, so between Meredith's minivan,

23
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,103
and if I borrow Bob's Yukon,

24
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,062
that should fit about 12 people.

25
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,400
I actually might not go.

26
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:32,571
- I'm feeling kind of tired.
- Do you wan make Appletinis

27
00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:34,301
and watch Sex and the City at my place?

28
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:36,901
Oh, I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

29
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:39,601
I don't get why you won't go.

30
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,602
Did I do something wrong?

31
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:42,202
I mean, I thought we
were really close friends.

32
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:44,791
- I just feel kind of tired,you know.
- Maybe you've got mono.

33
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,001
Maybe.

34
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,602
I just...

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,500
I don't really have anyone to go with.

36
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:50,800
Well, go with Dwight.

37
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:52,202
He's single too right?

38
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:54,002
Yeah, totally single.

39
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:55,003
100% available.

40
00:01:56,695 --> 00:01:58,902
Are you guys going to this
Indian thing tonight?

41
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,300
I don't know.
Who's, uh, who's going?

42
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:06,500
Ohh...you mean, like,
is Pam going?

43
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:08,602
Don't go.
They eat monkey brains.

44
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:10,203
Hey, hey, hey, stop that.

45
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,200
That is offensive.

46
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:13,900
Indians do not eat monkey brains.

47
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:15,301
And if they do...

48
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:17,701
sign me up.

49
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:20,102
Because I am sure
that they are very tasty.

50
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,100
And nutritional.

51
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:29,002
It's important that this company
celebrates its diversity.

52
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:31,902
And you know what, Stanley?

53
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:34,701
Comewanzaa time,
I have got you covered, baby.

54
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:36,801
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.

55
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:38,283
Really?

56
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:40,001
You should. It's fun.

57
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:42,990
I love the people here.

58
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:48,200
And if there was one thing
I don't really care for,

59
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:52,173
is that they can be
terribly, terribly ignorant

60
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,700
about other cultures.

61
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,393
And I don't want them embarrassing me

62
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,601
in front of my girlfriend Carol.

63
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:03,693
Diwali is a very important holiday
for the Hindus.

64
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:05,290
But, frankly,
I'm a little appalled

65
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:09,301
that none of you know very much
about Indian culture.

66
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,803
So with out further adieu, Kelly!

67
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:13,500
You are on.

68
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,802
Um, Diwali is awesome.

69
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:19,600
And there's food,

70
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:20,941
and there's gonna be dancing.

71
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,003
And, oh, I got the raddest outfit.

72
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:24,100
- It has sparkles...
- Kelly...

73
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,702
Um, why dot you tell
us a little bit about

74
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:30,002
the origins of the holiday?

75
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:33,401
Oh, um, I don't know.
It's really old, I think.

76
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:34,802
How many gods do you have?

77
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,203
Like hundreds, I think.
Maybe more than that.

78
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,903
And that blue, busty gal--
what's her story?

79
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:42,202
She looks like Pam
from the neck down.

80
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,002
Pam wishes.

81
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:46,503
Kelly, I'll take this one.

82
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:50,300
Diwali is a celebration
of the coronation god king Rama

83
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:52,603
after his epic battle
with Ravena,

84
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:54,403
the demon king of Lanka.

85
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:56,301
It symbolizes the battle
between good and evil.

86
00:03:56,508 --> 00:03:58,002
All right, all right.
This isn't Lord of the Rings.

87
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:03,712
Oops, sorry.

88
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:07,701
I started biking to work.
Josh does it.

89
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,900
And he lives a lot
farther away than I do.

90
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:12,200
And  also, it saves gas money.

91
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:14,700
It keeps me in shape.
Helps the environment.

92
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:19,200
And now I know it makes me
really sweaty for work.

93
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:23,201
Nice basket.

94
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:25,300
Thank you.

95
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:31,400
Now, a lot of people say
that Kelly is one in a million.

96
00:04:31,508 --> 00:04:33,303
And that's true,
but it's also not true.

97
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,002
Because, frankly, there are
literally billions of people

98
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:39,001
just like Kelly
in the world.

99
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:41,601
Here are some
famous Indians.

100
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:47,600
Suahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

101
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,193
He is a Nobel-Prize-winning
physicist.

102
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:52,503
Impressive.

103
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:55,000
Apu, from The Simpsons.

104
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:56,341
Hilarious Indian.

105
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:58,503
M. Night Shyamalan.

106
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:01,002
The Viage, Unbreakable,
Sixth Sense.

107
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:01,992
I see dead people.

108
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,602
<i>Okay!Spoiler alert.</i>

109
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,191
- He was dead the whole time.
- Just stop it!

110
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:10,403
- What's-? 
- Oh, wha

111
00:05:10,697 --> 00:05:12,103
Where did that come from?

112
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:19,102
Karen, my chips got stuck in
the vending machine again.

113
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:21,502
I need your...
skinny little arms.

114
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:22,703
Oh.

115
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:24,101
Did you shake it?

116
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:26,103
Yeah, I shook it,
I shook it.

117
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,950
We have such a roller coaster thing,

118
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:34,242
Karen and I.

119
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:37,313
- Excuse me?
- Roller-coastery friendship.

120
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,133
Hot  and cold.
On again, off again.

121
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,603
Sexual-tension-filled type of deal.

122
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:45,003
It's very Sam and Diane.

123
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:47,650
- Wow.
- From Cheers.

124
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:48,303
Yep.
Yeah.

125
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:50,900
And  another thing about
the Indian people,

126
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:52,902
they love sex positions.

127
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,803
I present to you "The Kama Sutra".

128
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:59,202
I mean, look at that.
Who has seen that before?

129
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:01,702
I have, that's the union of the monkey.

130
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:04,602
Oh, that's what they call it.

131
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,702
This is the best meeting
we have ever had.

132
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:09,200
- Thank you, Kevin.
- I find this incredibly offensive.

133
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:10,500
Well, I find it beautiful.

134
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:13,382
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do
in her own house is fine.

135
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:15,902
But we shouldn't all be subjected to it.

136
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:17,702
Actually, she's right.

137
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:19,002
This isn't appropriate.

138
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,123
- Why don't I take these?
- You're not gonna collect them.

139
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:25,002
No, this is delightful,
charming culture.

140
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:27,602
My Indian cultural seminar
was going great

141
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:30,102
until Toby decided
that he was too immature

142
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,301
or to deal with 
culturally explicit images.

143
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:35,700
It's just sex, people.
Everybody does it.

144
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:37,600
I'm doing it with Carol.

145
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:39,805
Probably tonight.

146
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:44,006
All right.

147
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:45,600
I think you guys should be all set.

148
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,601
Oh, here's the corporate card
for dinner.

149
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,602
Thanks.
Now, Karen...

150
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,903
Let's keep it to $20 a person this time.

151
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:51,900
Got it.

152
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:55,983
Once a quarter,
the sales staff at this branch

153
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:59,303
has to stay late to do
order form consolidation.

154
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:01,481
Which...amazingly,

155
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,800
is even less interesting
than it sounds.

156
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:07,800
- You guys ready to party?
- What's that?

157
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:10,203
I said, are you ready

158
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,600
to part-ay!

159
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,703
Isn't this fun, not wearing shoes?

160
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:25,101
I wish some of us still
had our shoes on.

161
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,402
Stop it.
It's a disease.

162
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:28,900
I've...told you.

163
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,501
I thought you said
this was a costume party.

164
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,730
What does that
look like to you?

165
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,803
An Indian woman
in a sari.

166
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:44,303
Hey, Kevin, it's a costume.

167
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,202
You just cool it, okay?

168
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,400
Carol? Carol.

169
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:58,550
I'm a vegetarian.
What can I eat?

170
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,810
It"s all vegeterian.

171
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:01,981
I'll just have some bread.

172
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,693
You used your hands.

173
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:11,422
Oh, yuck.

174
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:15,620
What, a little too spicy?

175
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:19,263
These s'mores are disgusting.

176
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:21,490
They're not s'mores.
They're samosas.

177
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,553
Do you think they have any s'mores?

178
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,690
All they are is chocolate,
graham cracker, and marshmallow.

179
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:29,642
How difficult would that have been?

180
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,411
So...you're Kelly's
sisters, huh?

181
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:43,343
- What?
- Rupa, Neepa, Teffani.

182
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,321
Stop acting like such little losers,
and just be cool.

183
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:47,270
Come on, Ryan
Come on.

184
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,671
Leave him alone.
I hate you guys.

185
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:52,052
They said something
about Zach Braff.

186
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,031
That's very official.

187
00:08:58,408 --> 00:08:59,713
I decided to come.

188
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:02,630
I feel a little
underdressed.

189
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:05,921
But at least I'm not dressed
like a slutty cheerleader, right?

190
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:08,411
Is that mean?

191
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,951
Temp! Temp!

192
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:44,273
Stop it , stop it right now.

193
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,122
Ryan is a temporary worker
makes no money.

194
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:49,173
Wali is a whole doctor,

195
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:51,432
so handsome, makes good money.

196
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:53,343
- You think I wanna date a doctor?
- He's a perfect match.

197
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,062
Hey, big tuna,
you ready?

198
00:09:58,496 --> 00:09:59,141
Yep.

199
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:04,010
One, two, three.

200
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:05,672
Shot!

201
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:09,432
Ohh! Holy mother of God.

202
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:11,162
Ooh, that burns.

203
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,332
Golly!

204
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:38,962
Wow, thirty years.

205
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:41,972
And you two only met
once before the wedding night.

206
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:43,651
- Yes.
- Wow.

207
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:46,660
How long have you been
married to the cheerleader?

208
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:48,501
Oh...

209
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:51,871
She's not a cheerleader.
She thought this was a costume party.

210
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,801
Um, no, we're not married.

211
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:56,741
Yet!

212
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,303
She's very fair.

213
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:02,412
She is very fair.
Very fair and very kind.

214
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:07,101
So, tell me, is your marriage
the kind of thing

215
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:10,363
where when you die, she has to
throw herself on fire?

216
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:12,440
No?
Okay.

217
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,233
It's still very cool.

218
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:16,860
Okay, thanks.

219
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:23,522
One, two, three.

220
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:25,032
Chug!

221
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,673
Are you okay?

222
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:40,651
I'm gonna be.

223
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:45,911
Hi.
I'm just gonna...

224
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:47,241
Just a sec, just a sec.

225
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:49,803
Everyone.

226
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:51,953
I'm sorry, could I have
your attention, please?

227
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,561
Thank you.

228
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:57,682
Sorry, I just have
an announcement to make.

229
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:05,122
Okay, I have learned a lot
about Indian culture tonight.

230
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:09,353
But I have learned
even more about love.

231
00:12:10,768 --> 00:12:12,570
And I know you're all thinking,

232
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:15,111
"Who is this crazy gringo,
and what is he talkin' about?"

233
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:16,972
Well, I'm not crazy.

234
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:19,890
Maybe I'm crazy in love.

235
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:23,682
So, without further adieu,

236
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,961
Carol...Carol Stills..

237
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:31,182
I would like you...

238
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:37,180
to do me the honor of making me
your husband.

239
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:41,690
Oh, Michael

240
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:42,831
What do you say?

241
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:46,550
Can we talk about this in private?

242
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:48,432
I didn't hear you.

243
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:50,873
Can we talk about this
in private?

244
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:53,753
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

245
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:57,631
Okay.

246
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:06,872
I get it
You're not ready.

247
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:07,870
We'll wait.

248
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,610
- This is our ninth date, Michael.
- Well, yeah, but I--

249
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:14,582
I feel like I've known you
many lifetimes.

250
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:19,801
- Maybe I'm Hindu after all.
- Okay, I'm not Hindu. But....

251
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:24,740
Carol... Carol, I just feel like--
I just like you so much.

252
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:27,220
I'd better go.

253
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:29,291
Okay? You can find
a way home, all right?

254
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:29,951
Yes.

255
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,113
- Okay.
- Okay.

256
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:36,113
- Okay
- Good night.

257
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:38,142
Hey, you know what?

258
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:39,441
Why don't come with you ?

259
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:42,800
'Cause I've got this book
called The Kama Sutra.

260
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:44,270
- Okay, good night, Michael.
- All right.

261
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:47,921
Good night.

262
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:57,131
Well, I was a temp,
but I got promoted.

263
00:13:57,527 --> 00:14:00,720
So, the compensation
is a lot more competitive.

264
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:03,820
So you're saving money now
to start a family and home?

265
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,632
Oh, or travel.

266
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:09,782
And,and buy an Xbox. 

267
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:16,172
Is there anything you wanted
to ask us tonight?

268
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,222
Can you believe my boss

269
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:20,771
proposed to his girlfriend
in public?

270
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:22,483
That is so Michael.

271
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:24,280
Is it?
He's really outgoing, huh?

272
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,070
Yeah.

273
00:14:27,485 --> 00:14:29,800
Hey, would you excuse me
for a second?

274
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:37,003
It's hot in there.

275
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:40,131
-  How's the naan?
- Dry.

276
00:14:40,518 --> 00:14:42,142
You looked like you
were having fun.

277
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:44,833
I am. You should come
dance with us.

278
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:47,441
I have to watch our shoes,
so they don't get stolen.

279
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:49,892
- Who are you texting?
- No one.

280
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:08,522
Andy, no a cappella

281
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,831
Oh, come on, guys, please.

282
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,870
Tuna! Are you kidding me?!

283
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,862
- Here.
- That's so spicy.

284
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:51,921
Y eah.

285
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,270
- You waiting for a call?
- No.

286
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,340
Wow.

287
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:10,422
Pam...

288
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:14,212
When Carol
said no tonight,

289
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,573
I think I finally realized
how you must be feeling.

290
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:21,392
We are both the victims
of broken engagements.

291
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:25,343
Well, you were
never really engaged.

292
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:30,042
I was in that marriage arena,
Though.

293
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:32,832
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

294
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,932
Ohh...well.

295
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:41,083
I kind of thought something
would happen tonight too.

296
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,242
We're so alike.

297
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:50,632
So alike.

298
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:04,531
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

299
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:07,150
- I'm rejecting your kiss.
- What?

300
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,651
Can I have a ride home?

301
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:29,800
If you sit in the back.

302
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:33,461
Okay, guys.

303
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,330
Hey, can I have a ride, man?

304
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:43,652
I, uh, I have my bike.

305
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:45,430
No way, dude.

306
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:47,542
I am not driving home.

307
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:52,601
I brought an inflatable bed
for just such occasions.

308
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,451
You're welcome to share it, 
though.

309
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:55,901
It's a roomy twin.

310
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:58,190
Okay.

311
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,072
Hey, dummy,
get , the car.

312
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:26,783
I'm a drunk driver.

313
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,601
Yes, you are.

314
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:31,210
Here, let me take that.

315
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:33,433
Just, get in the car.

316
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:35,382
You  can really hold
your liquor, though.

317
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:37,483
Yeah, you can't.

318
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:38,512
Okay.

319
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,691
And I am just going to lie down
in the back,

320
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:45,671
- If that's all right.
- Sure.Here's you bike.

321
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:48,472
Just don't puke on anything.

322
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:54,792
You okay?

323
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:56,082
- So good.
- Good.

324
00:19:02,345 --> 00:19:04,190
These are not my shoes.

325
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:15,881
This is just like that s
