Internet sensation of 2004,

00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:21,086

<i>He just made far, far too

It was just easier for corporate

Think she did him? I bet
there's something there.

48
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,921
I was with them in
the kitchen yesterday,

49
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,116
and they were all too happy
to be cleaning the freezer.

50
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,590
If they get married before I
do, I'm going to kill myself.

Who's getting married?
Nobody.

If somebody doesn't tell me,
I'm gonna start screaming.

They're not getting married.
It's just talk.

58
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,700
Did everybody know
about this but me?

59
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,744
There's nothing to know.
It's just gossip.

60
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,242
Okay. Okay.

61
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,941
We haven't told anyone
that I'm pregnant.

62
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,283
What with her being unmarried,
knocked up by some guy.

63
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,788
The yakety-yaks in this office
would have a field day.

64
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,619
Yeah, and we don't want
them at the wedding thinking

65
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,717
Jim's being marched down the
aisle by my dad with a shotgun.

66
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,325
Wait, there's not going
to be a shotgun?

67
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,422
Nope.

68
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,161
No shotgun? Because
that changes everything.

69
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,699
Can't back out
now, Halpert.

70
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,530
What are you going to do about
it? There's no shotgun, so,

71
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,135
free at last,
free at last.

72
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,437
No, keep it up.

73
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,070
You'll never guess
what I know.

74
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,083
Okay. Let me finish
this thought.

75
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,018
Eric likes Megan.

76
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,549
He most definitely does.

77
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,713
He's been asking her out
repeatedly for weeks.

78
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,726
She finally said yes. They went
out on a group date the other night.

79
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,159
Apparently
it went very well.

80
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,154
How do you know this?
People tell me things.

81
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,200
I guess I have
a face you can trust.

82
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,258
I think it's because
of my low cheek bones.

83
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,833
And boom. Okay, what is it?
What can't I guess?

84
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,502
I hate, hate, hate
being left out.

85
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:09,305
Whether it's not being picked for
a team or being picked for a team

86
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,545
and then showing up and realizing
that the team doesn't exist,

87
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,487
or that the sport
doesn't exist.

88
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,313
I should have known.
Poopball?

89
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,493
Oh, man, I know how
you feel. Third wheel.

90
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,759
I have been the third wheel
so many times in my life.

91
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,593
My mom told me something once
that made me feel a lot better.

92
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,764
She said, "The third wheel
is what makes it a tricycle."

93
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,130
What are you
talking about?

94
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,471
I am talking about your group
date with Megan and Eric.

95
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,770
At Tinks?
Yes.

96
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,275
How'd you know about that? Well...

97
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,573
Did Stanley tell you?

98
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,681
Stanley was on your
group date?

99
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,814
No. Stanley
was with his wife.

100
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,443
I waved at him
but he didn't wave back.

101

(CHUCKLES)

102
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,523
Does anybody else
know about this?

103
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,649
No.

104
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,056

105
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,228
There he goes.
There he goes.

106
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,993
So, what is the scuttlebutt?
Anybody hear anything?

107
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,901
Nothing? I got a little
something-something.

108
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,805
I don't know
if I should say.

109
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,237
So just keep it
to yourself, then.

110
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,506
Stanley is having
a midlife crisis.

111
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,774
Stanley is way past
the middle of his life,

112
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,577
especially considering
his height-to-weight ratio.

113
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,210
Well, apparently,
he and his wife

114
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,914
were out dancing at a
club for young people.

115
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,581
Teri's out of town,
Michael.

116
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,850
Who?
Stanley's wife, Teri.

117
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,759
She's at an interior
decorating expo in Philly.

118
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:34,729
And Stanley hates crowds, kids and music.
I think you should check your facts.

119
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,340
You stupid son of a bitch.
You set me up.

120
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,500
What are you
talking about?

121
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,206
Stanley's wife
is out of town.

122
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,270
He was with somebody.

123
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,407
He was definitely
with someone.

124
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,007
Oh! Was he? Well, who? His sister?

125
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,312
(LAUGHS)

126
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,513
I don't get it!

127
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,819
If that was his sister, then what
they were doing was totally illegal.

128
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,015
Drugs?

129
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,622
Making out.

130
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,700
Okay.

131
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,899
Okay.
No, it's okay.

132
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,004
Never mind.
Carry on.

133
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,140
(WHISPERING) Stanley

No. No.

Okay.
He's holding a pencil.

147
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,044
He could be doing a crossword
puzzle with that pencil.

148

there? Same letter here and here.

T.

T! Yes! Yes!
That is a T.

you have a problem with that?

No, no, no, no, no. I just
had a quick question for you.

00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,737
Pays 5 million dollars.
Nudity required.

159
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,340
You have to stop this.

160
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,407
(WHISPERING) Did you hear that
Stanley's having an affair?

161
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,079
(WHISPERING) I did. From you.
You got to stop telling people.

162
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,783
Okay. I get it. You feel out of the
loop and you feel sorry for yourself,

163
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,019
and it's really sad because
everybody thinks you're a loser.

164
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,254
Do you even know if it's
true? Do you have any idea?

165
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,923
Because you might be
ruining his life.

166
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,867
Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!
No, no, no, no!

167
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:55,965
(HONKING)

168
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,169
It's time to stop being
polite and get real!

169
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,536
Stanley,
you having an affair?

170
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,645
That is ridiculous. Of course
not. Why would you think that?

171
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,913
So it's not true.
Okay. Well...

172
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,617
(SIGHING) Oh!

173
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,353
Those interns, they told me
they saw you at the club,

174
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,254
and they all said
it was you.

175
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:22,029
It was clearly just racial
profiling gossip. The little...

176
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,229
Damn! I told her
it was a stupid idea...

177
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,295
It's so stupid.
...to go up in that club.

178
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:31,070
It's just that Teri's been
traveling a lot lately.

179
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,634
I know. I know.
It's been lonely.

180
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,203
Oh, I bet. I...

181
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,441
Cynthia's been
keeping me company.

182
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,111
She was my nurse when
I was in rehabilitation.

183
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,723
We used to go on these
long walks on the treadmill.

184
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,292
I didn't intend...

185
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,693
Wait, wait, wait.

186
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,089
So it is true?

187
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,928
Yeah, but Michael, I'm
going to go break it off.

188
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,195
That's where I'm headed
right now. I swear.

189
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,998
Oh, my God.
Wait a second.

190
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,234
Do people often say they're going on
sales calls and then go someplace else?

191
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,332
Because that's not cool.

192
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:08,073
I just need you to promise not to
say a word about this to anyone.

193
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,537
Michael, please.

194
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,412
I'm not saying
a damn thing.

195
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,849
I'm counting
on you, Michael.

196
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,409
Okay.
You can count on me.

197
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,183
Oh, that smells good.

198
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,624
Yeah, I might have extra. It
just depends on how many I eat.

199
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,755
Did you hear about Angela?
That's pretty weird.

200
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,267
Yeah. What do you
mean exactly?

201
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:34,472
Well, the fact that she apparently
is dating an 81-year-old billionaire.

202
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,535
Owns a Quiznos
on the turnpike.

203
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,733
Really?
Uh-huh.

204
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,908
(EXCLAIMING) Right?

205
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,279
How do you un-tell
something? You can't.

206
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,312
You can't put words
back in your mouth.

207
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:52,085
What you can do is
spread false gossip,

208
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,788
so that people think that everything
that's been said is untrue,

209
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,462
including "Stanley
is having an affair."

210
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,896
<i>It's like the end of Spartacus. I've
seen that movie half a dozen times,</i>

211
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,704
and I still don't know
who the real Spartacus is.

212
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,770
And that is what makes that
movie a classic whodunit.

213
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,304
Kelly has an eating
disorder? MICHAEL: Yes.

214
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,437
She always
eats my lunch.

215
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,607
Anorexia.
She's an anorexitic.

216
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,043
We should do something.

217
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,278
Nothing can be done.

218
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,345
Just have to tell everybody
and hope for the best, I guess.

219
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,219
I'm worried about Erin because
she's not a very good worker.

220
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,818
I don't know how long
she's going to last here.

221
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,762
Really?
Yeah. So...

222
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,229
And Andy is gay.

223
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,995
Andy Bernard?
Mmm-hmm.

224
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,736
(WHISPERING) Did you
hear Pam is pregnant?

225
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,804
(WHISPERING) Really?
Yeah.

226
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,103
She's going to hate
being a mom.

227
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,107
(KEVIN CHUCKLING)

228
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,910
What?
Tea.

229
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,716
So?
You would.

230
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,522
I like tea.
Oh, I bet you like it.

231
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:05,427
Yeah. I like it a lot.
I love tea.

232
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,626
Do you like it as much
as you like men's butts?

233
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,737
What?
Because you're gay.

234
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:19,042
Who told you that? Was it
Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi?

235
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,240
Or did you run into
someone from my high school?

236
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,412
This is not the first time rumors
about me being gay have come up.

237
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,313
Twice before, actually.

238
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:33,182
Just a weird coincidence.
It's a little too weird.

239
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,290
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

240
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,496
Almost makes you wonder if it's
not a coincidence at all. Whoa!

241
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,865
Which it is, of course.

242
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,126
But it makes you wonder.

243
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,405
Did you hear the rumor
about me, that I'm gay?

244
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,540
I did, yes.

245
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,269
And?
What?

246
00:11:56,115 --> 00:12:00,176
Do you think it's true?
Do you think that I'm gay?

247
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,779
Are you attracted
to other men?

248
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,185
(SCOFFING)

249
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,647
No.

250
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,893
But let me kick
you a scenario.

251
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:13,394
I'm at, like, a beach cabana
and Brad Pitt approaches,

252
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,157
tries to lean in
and kiss me.

253
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:23,104
I would definitely resist, like,
at first, but if he was persistent,

254
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:28,606
I might give in a little bit to
just sort of see what it felt like.

255
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:34,747
Would I push him away? How hard? Like,
what if he's, like, really aggressive?

256
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,859
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little
bit, he would still need to get to you?

257
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:45,090
This is not real Brad Pitt, this is,
like, in my... This is my fantasy.

258
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:49,199
Or it's, like, not fantasy, it's,
like, what I'm... It's just a scenario.

259
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:55,834
Well, I wish I could help you. I don't...
You might be gay. You might be gay.

260
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,678
<i>OSCAR: What exactly
is my responsibility here?</i>

261
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,271
To comfort insecure
heterosexual men?

262
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,317
That can't possibly
fall to me.

263
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,575
PHYLLIS: (SOFTLY)
How far along is Pam?

264
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,244
A few months. That's why
they're rushing the wedding.

265
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,517
(SOFTLY) Guys, guys, guys, you
can't believe everything you hear.

266
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,751
Like Stanley
having an affair.

267
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,818
That is crazy.
There's no stock in it.

268
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,027
It's a weird day for false
facts. Just let it go.

269
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:26,095
Okay, everybody, big day. Last day
for our interns. Lot of other stuff.

270
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,533
Who knows what to believe?
Dwight, the honors.

271
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:37,007
Present these to the Dean for credit.
And as a gift, I've attached my card.

272
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,107
Call me any time
of the day or night.

273
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,747
Why would we call
you at night?

274
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,245
Well, now you can't call me
at all, so problem solved.

275
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,880
You're going to regret that
when you find yourself

276
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,017
between a moose
and her cubs at night.

277
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,263
Look to the intern on your
left. Now to your right.

278
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,228
One of you will do exceedingly well
in business, just unlimited potential.

279
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,870
One of you will make a
living and nothing more.

280
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,900
And one of you will make a great mother.

281
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,573
It's up to you to choose
which you want to be.

282
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,511
I am so happy
you're eating again.

283
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,812
Me, too.

284
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,350
Tuna, how come you never
try to set me up?

285
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,714
I don't really do that. But Pam
might have some friends, though.

286
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,448
Women friends?
Yeah.

287
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,055
Not guy friends?

288
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,624
Are you interested
in her guy friends?

289
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,427
No. I mean, for the
record, I prefer women.

290
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,627
Okay. But off the record,
I'm kind of confused.

291
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,928
Really?

292
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,131
Yeah, the evidence is sort of
stacked against me, I feel like.

293
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,435
Well, you've got to figure
this out. Yeah, right?

294
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,703
Yeah.
How?

295
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,540
You've got to have
sex with a woman.

296
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,637
Righto.

297
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,682
And then a man.
And then compare.

298
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:44,738
Oh!

299
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,008
All right.

300
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,343
Well, hey.
Yep.

301
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,616
Congratulations to you.
On what?

302
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,349
(CHUCKLES) Come on.

303
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:58,056
Little baby Tuna.
Little junior Toro.

304
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,827
You know, a baby conceived out
of wedlock is still a bastard.

305
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,930
What?

306
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,097
Want me to say it again?

307
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,730
Why did that come
into your brain?

308
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,274
Can I talk to you
for a second?

309
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,510
So, they know.

310
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,905
Who did you tell? I didn't
tell anyone. Who did you tell?

311
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,141
Nobody.

312
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,084
Hey, did one of you tell Stanley
that I have asthma? Because I don't.

313
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,417
If it gets out they
won't let me scuba.

314
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,981
If I can't scuba, then
what's this all been about?

315
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,424
What am I working toward?

316
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,052
What? You think I'm the
voice of the Taco Bell dog?

317
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,824
What are you guys talking about? I have
a daughter. How could I be a virgin?

318
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,196
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy
rumor about themselves today?

319
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,432
ALL: Yes.

320
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,067
Yeah, yeah! You know what,
let's discredit these rumors.

321
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,270
Yeah, sure, but who's been
saying all that stuff?

322
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,508
It's not important, Jim. I just think
we shouldn't listen to any of this crap.

323
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,412
Sure, but we should
get to the bottom of this.

324

it back to the beginning.

I need to do
mine first.

326

another person inside of me

327
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,517
working me
with controls?

328
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,025
I heard that from Andy.

329
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,594
I heard it from Erin.

330
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,688
KEVIN: What?

331
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,426
I heard it from Michael.

332
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,257
Michael.

333
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,193
PAM: Michael?

334
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,566
He's over here.

Nowhere.

Hmm?

337
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,617
You told people that
I use store-bought manure,

338
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,279
when I showed you where
my manure comes from.

Michael, don't.

341

KEVIN: Michael, no.

that I'm gay?

Yes.
Yes!

348

But, guys, I'm a victim here, too. Okay?

349
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,774
People have been saying
that I'm a J. Crew model.

350
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,779
No, we heard
that about Jim.

351
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,981
Jim? No, no, I spread the rumor that
somebody here was a J. Crew model

352
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,386
and I was referring
to myself.

353
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,682
How is that
a bad rumor?

354
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,694
Because a lot of people think that models,
even though they're very attractive,

355
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,254
are somewhat vapid. It's set
our industry back quite a bit.

356
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,358
Michael, why? Why say all these
things? Why make up an eating disorder,

357
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,128
Stanley's affair,
me being a spokesdog?

358
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,173
You told everyone
I was having an affair?

359
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,970
Okay, okay,
here's the thing.

360
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,777
There was one true rumor out there today.
I didn't want everybody to know what it was,

361
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,146
so all of you are off the hook
except for this one person.

362
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,510
Well, then what's
the one true rumor?

363
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,918
We have a right to know.

364
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,852
Michael, am I gay?

365
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,219
The one true rumor, and this is going
to ruin this person's life, is that...

366
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,286
That Pam's pregnant.

367
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,626
ANGELA: I knew it, I knew it.
I knew it!

368
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:52,531
Her breasts were a tiny bit
bigger. At first, I thought,

369
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,036
"Oh! She has a new
bra with padding."

370
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,906
But then I thought,
"Pam doesn't need padding."

371
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,768
It just didn't
add up, Jim.

372
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,108
Okay, thank you.

Stop. Don't.

378

and you can't fall on the sword this way.

379
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,924
The real thing is that
Stanley Hudson had an affair.

380
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,329
No.
Yes.

381

Thank you for trying
to defend us,

382
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,593
but actually Pam is pregnant
and we can prove it.

383
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,069
Yes. If everybody would
like to see the proof.

Okay.

about the pregnancy?

A week? A month? A year?

Michael, we only told
our parents last week.

Did you pee on a stick?

I did. But it
was inconclusive.

398

Oh! Oh!

No, I have to take it
or it'll seem suspicious.

If you talk to her, you're
going to tell her about Stanley

seem more suspicious.

You can't do this.

Well, it turns out that
Teri was already suspicious

422
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,408
because she had caught Stanley
and Cynthia a few months ago.

So Stanley promised that he would
stop, and he did. End of story.
