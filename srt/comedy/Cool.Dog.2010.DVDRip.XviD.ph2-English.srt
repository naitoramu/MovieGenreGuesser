Not exactly. But we are
going somewhere this
coming weekend.

171
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,269
Where?.

172
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,500
Well, your father
got a big promotion.

173
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,543
He's gonna be
the general manager
of a new insurance office

174
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,808
in New York City.
Isn't that great news?.

175
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,940
Does this mean
we have to move?.

176
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,384
Well, yes it does, sport.

177
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,889
You'll love it, Jimmy.

178
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,289
It's so much more
exciting than here.

179
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,328
None of this small town
thinking there.

180
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,863
But I like Eagle Rock.

181
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,660
And what about my friends?.

182
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,428
Well, you'll
make new friends.

183
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,665
Sport, we'll be able
to come back and visit
from time to time.

184
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,206
Well, you boys can.

185
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,243
Well, I suppose
that'll be okay.

186
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,042
Rainy and l
are pretty good
at making friends.

187
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,048
[sighs]

188
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:48,849
[melancholy music]

189
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,287
Jimmy, we can't take Rainy.

190
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,917
What do you mean?.

191
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,484
(Laura)
The apartment
the company's paying for

192
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,029
doesn't allow pets

193
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:02,124
But Rainy's part
of the family. Right Dad?.

194
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,533
Yes, he is.

195
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,505
Then we have to take him.
We can hide him,

196
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,770
and he'll be quiet
and nobody will know.

197
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,311
Jimmy, this is very
important to your father.

198
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,110
We've all made sacrifices
so he can get this promotion.

199
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,448
Now I don't think
we can be selfish
about it now, can we?

200
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,249
But it's Rainy.
We can't leave him alone.

201
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:27,884
Jimmy, we talked to Charlie.
He's a security guard
at the Fairgrounds

202
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,953
and he's agreed to look
after Rainy until we find
an apartment that allows pets.

203
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,828
You called him,
didn't you, honey?

204
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,925
Y es. And Charlie told me
he loves animals.

205
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,996
And he promised to take very
good care of Rainy until we
find another apartment.

206
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,540
He promised.

207
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:46,408
No! I won't go!
I 'm staying here
with Rainy.

208
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,969
Come on, boy.

209
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,981
Jimmy!

210
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,142
I told you!

211
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:56,416
Laura, the boy lost
his mother five years ago,

212
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,652
And now he feels
like he's gonna lose
his best friend.

213
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:03,252
It's not so easy for him.

214
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,789
[melancholy music]

215
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,879
Hi, Mommy.

216
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,418
I miss you
so much.

217
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:31,616
I have some
really bad news.

218
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,717
We're movin'
to New York City

219
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,025
so I don't think I'll be
seeing you as much
[sniffs]

220
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,622
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,329
And the worst thing is,

222
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,201
is that Rainy
can't come with us.

223
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,036
[whining]

224
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:54,205
I wish you could hold me
just one more time.

225
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,912
Can you please ask God
if he can take care of Rainy?

226
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,443
I mean, he's
a really good dog

227
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,184
and I'll be back
as soon as I can.

228
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,427
Come on, boy.

229
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,616
[horses neighing]

230
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,716
[several animal noises]

231
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,958
It doesn't look
like he'll have
many friends here.

232
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,629
He'll have plenty of room
to run around, Jimmy.
It's only temporary.

233
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,038
Dad, can we
please take him?.

234
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,440
I'm sorry, son.
It's just not
possible now.

235
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,878
But I promise,
I'll find another apartment
as soon as we can, okay?.

236
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,142
Come on, sport.

237
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:07,014
[funny horn honking]

238
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,613
[animal bleating]

239
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,988
Well, hello.
What can I do for you?.

240
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,924
Hi, I'm Laura Warner.

241
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,293
I called you a couple
days ago about our dog.

242
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,731
Oh, yeah.

243
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,032
So, where's the animal?.

244
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,665
His name
is Rainy.

245
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,538
Of course it is.

246
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,906
Hey, and don't worry.

247
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,912
I'll take real good
care of him.

248
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,177
I got a real nice place
for him right inside.

249
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,582
Can I come say goodbye?.

250
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,985
Well, uh, parish regulations--

251
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:48,118
Please! He's
my best friend
in the whole world.

252
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,357
All right.
All right.

253
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,524
You gonna get him?.

254
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,706
(Jimmy)
Promise to give him
leftovers? He especially
loves chicken.

255
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,643
Sure. Fine.

256
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,942
Stay there.

257
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,413
Okay.

258
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,814
[whimpering]

259
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:17,151
Come on, Rainy.
Come on. Let's go.

260
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,748
All right, now,
put him in there.

261
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,555
Could I have
a minute with him?.

262
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,064
[sighs]
Make it quick!

263
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,860
[sighs]

264
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,096
Guess this is where
you'll be staying
for now, boy.
[sighs]

265
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,535
[whimpering]

266
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,598
[melancholy music]

267
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,109
I'm so sorry, Rainy.

268
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,544
I'll miss you so much.

269
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,911
[whimpering]

270
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,974
But, I'll check in, okay?.

271
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,546
Here.

272
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:56,220
This is where we're going.
It's New York City.

273
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,956
Here's our address.

274
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,433
In case you ever
wanna come to visit
us. Okay?.

275
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,132
And I'm also
leaving this with you.

276
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,702
So, you can play
your favorite song
and never forget me.

277
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,521
[whimpering]

278
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,286
Well, I guess that's it.

279
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,827
[whimpering]

280
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:33,991
I'll see you again soon.

281
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,229
[whimpering]

282
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:41,569
I love you, Rainy.

283
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,801
Bye.

284
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:44,934
[whimpering]

285
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,353
You okay, sport?.

286
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:02,224
[melancholy music]

287
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,159
(Dad)
Off we go.

288
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,484
(announcer over speakers)
All passengers
to New York City

289
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:03,248
the train will leave
from Platform Five
in ten minutes.

290
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,120
All passengers
to New York City,
ten minutes.

291
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,022
[train horn]

292
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,220
[lively music]

293
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,128
(Laura)
Look at this. Park A venue,

294
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,164
Rockefeller Center,
Grand T erminal shopping.

295
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:29,271
This is really
so exciting,
isn't it, boys?.

296
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:33,978
Well, our lives
are about to change
for the better.

297
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:42,284
Hey. I got
a surprise for you.

298
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:47,321
Season tickets
for the Yankees.

299
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:57,735
I love you, Jimmy.
You're gonna have
to trust me on this.

300
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,247
Come on.
Try and cheer up, son.

301
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,803
I thought we were
near TriBeCa.

302
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,748
Laura's right, Dad.
It looks terrible.

303
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,308
Maybe we should
find a new place.

304
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,183
One that
allows dogs.

305
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,053
Well, it's probably
nice inside.

306
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,184
Come on, let's
check it out.

307
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:01,429
(Laura)
I thought all
New York apartments
had elevators.

308
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,907
Apparently not, dear.

309
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,637
Maybe we should
go back home.

310
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,646
[angry]
This is home
now, Jimmy!

311
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,814
[door creaking]

312
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,219
Who are you?.

313
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,156
We're the Warners.
We're moving in
to apartment 12.

314
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,591
Oh, yeah.
[crunch]

315
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,458
This is
my wife, Laura.

316
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,057
I'm Muriel.
This is Reuben.
[playful music]

317
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,364
Hm. Pleasure.

318
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,165
This is
our son, Jimmy.

319
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,207
We didn't
know there would
be children.

320
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,267
Well, it is
in the paperwork.

321
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,403
(Muriel)
Oh?

322
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,311
Hey.

323
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,487
So it is.

324
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,455
What'd you say
your name was again?.

325
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,388
Jimmy.

326
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,256
(Muriel)
Jimmy, are you
a good boy?

327
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,489
Yeah.

328
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,964
You'd better be.

329
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,467
(Muriel)
Reuben will show
you the apartment.

330
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:08,199
(Jimmy)
Excuse me.
I was just wondering
if you allow pets.

331
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,207
(Muriel)
Pets?

332
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,506
Absolutely not.

333
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,638
Why?.

334
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,272
Have you got a pet?.

335
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,510
Y eah. A dog. Rainy.

336
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:23,544
That lease clearly
states, in red ink--

337
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,180
We didn't bring him
with us.

338
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,488
Well good. 'Cause we
don't permit 'em.

339
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,926
Dogs is
filthy animals. Mm-hm.

340
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,054
And dangerous.

341
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,620
Yeah.

342
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,725
Well, Rainy's really clean.
And he won't bite anybody.

343
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,736
He's the best dog
in the whole world.

344
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,398
He really is a good dog.

345
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,441
(Muriel)
Listen to me.

346
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:47,672
The only
thing worse than dogs
is precocious little kids.

347
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,647
Unfortunately, the law
forbids me from keepin'
them out.

348
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:55,210
Reuben, show them
the unit!

349
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,381
Right this way.
Come on, come on.
Oh, I gotta fix that.

350
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,550
Wow.

351
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,186

354
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,605

00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,345
No.

490
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,686
That's too bad.

491
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,021
Ow!

[suspense music]

00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,988
See what I mean?.
No money, big hurt.

494
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,796
Better have some lunch
money for us tomorrow, Jimmy.

(girl)
Hey, guys.
Leave him alone.

496
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,904
You are all bullies.

497
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,069
Ain't that cute?
Jimmy's girlfriend
is protecting him.

498
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:44,582
I 'm not his girlfriend.
But I am telling on you
if you don't leave.

499
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,209
Boo!

500
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,753
Come on guys. Let's leave
the lovebirds alone.

501
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,757
T omorrow, Jimmy.

502
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,089
All right, guys.

503
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,719
Are you okay?.

504
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,593
Yeah.

505
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,632
But, I could have
handled myself.

506
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,599
Yeah. I can see that.

507
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,693
Well, thanks.

508
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,704
No problem.
I'm Amy.

509
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,205
Nice to meet you.

510
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,970
Don't think
about them. They're
just dumb bullies.

511
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,773
Like to pick on kids
smaller than they are.

512
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,905
They wouldn't do this
if Rainy was here.

513
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,573
Who's Rainy?.

514
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,810
My dog.

515
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,977
He always came
to school with me.

516
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,179
Where is he now?.

517
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,245
I had to leave him
in Eagle Rock.

518
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:29,726
See, we're from Louisiana,
but my landlords here
don't allow pets

519
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,160
That's too bad.
He sounds pretty cool.

520
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,061
Can he do tricks?.

521
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:38,125
Absolutely. He can
roll over, play dead.
Even ride a skateboard.

522
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,636
Wow.

523
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:43,765
And we love
the same music too.
I left him my iPod.

Hey, Amy.
Thanks again
for today.

530
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,510
You're welcome.

531
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,880
But, if it
happens tomorrow,

532
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,885
maybe let me
take care of it.

That's my landlord.

00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,766
He's the one
who won't let
Rainy live with us.

[suspense music]

541
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,568
That's strange.
I thought no pets
were allowed.

542
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:28,703
That's what they said.
Well maybe they changed
their minds. I'll check.

543
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,873
Okay. See you tomorrow.

to ask you about

I told you,
no pets allowed.

bringing in a cage
with an animal in it

of this building, the Ledgers.

They're as mean
as snakes.

They don't like kids
and they hate animals.

They do?.

620

Oh yeah. There's no way
they're gonna let a dog,

like this one stay here.

Well, it seems like we're
not having any luck.

And I have to go.

are keeping you
secret. Sh.

Just one.

642
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,334
Great. What's his name?.

643
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,967
How come the landlords
are allowed to have pets,
but we can't?.

644
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,240
Well, I wasn't aware
that he had any.

645
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,683
I saw Mr. Reuben bring in
a cage with an animal in it.

646
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,583
It even bit him.

00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:46,582
I was in their
apartment today,

649
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,284
and I didn't see
any dogs.

650
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,725
But I saw him.
And I asked them too.

651
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,127
And what did he say?.

652
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:56,792
No pets allowed.

653
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,494
And what else?.

654
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:01,037
Stop being nosy.

655
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,629
You see?
There you have it.

656
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,835
We must stop
all this talk about dogs.

657
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,368
We're in New York now

It's not much fun
without my best friend.

00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:33,138
We'll figure
something out,
boy. I promise.

813
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,677
(Amy)
See you tomorrow.

814
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,908
(Jimmy)
Bye, Amy.
Thanks again.

815
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,075
She's a good friend.

816
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,656
I can't take you
upstairs, boy.

817
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,158
What can we do?.

818
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:55,725
[groaning]

819
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,132
Come on.
Let's go, boy.

820
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:05,197
[pleasant music]

821
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:10,142
Hey. This might
lead inside.

822
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,840
[kicking]
Ugh.

823

[groaning]

824
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:31,095
We'll have to keep you
here for now, boy.

825
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,636
Come here, boy.

826
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,868
Lie down.

827
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,739
[groaning]

828
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,972
Here. Eat this.

829
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:46,209
I'll come back with more
food and water later.

830
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:49,275
You have to be
very quiet. Okay?.

831
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,911
[groaning]
Sh.

832
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:55,391
Well, have sweet dreams.

833
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,466
[door opens]

834
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,304
(Muriel)
Now don't mess
this up, Reuben.

835
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:16,175
I want to get
rid of one of these
birds. You hear me?

836
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:19,773
They stink to high heaven,
flappin' their little wings
all the time.

837
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,047
And that one
is a vicious gossip.
Chit-chattin' all the time.

838
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,554
Don't mess this up, Reuben.

839
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,749
[birds chirping
and playful music]

840
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,292
This is gonna make
my client very happy.

841
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,328
Y eah. What'll
he fetch?.

842
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,886
Two thousand.

843
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,158
Nonsense. More.

844
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,359
Maybe. Maybe,
twenty-five hundred.

845
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,028
I won't accept a penny
less than three thousand.

846
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,469
[squawks]
Don't be cheap,
don't be cheap.

847
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,099
Okay. It's a deal.

848
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,473
I'll come back tomorrow
and pick up the bird.

849
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,034
Ah, ah. Payment first.

850
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,878
And three.

851
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,682
Beautiful.

852
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:01,383
[squawks]
Take a hike.
[squawks]

853
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,226
Shut up, dummy, shut up.

854
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,025
No, you shut up.

855
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,532
I'll fry you up
and serve you on toast.

856
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,398
I feel sorry for such
a wonderful creature.

857
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,870
Don't be
an idiot, Reuben.

858
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:18,840
We're gonna be rich.

859
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,902
Come on.
Let's go upstairs
and roll around in it.

I'll be right down.

[barking]

870
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,225
Where's the bird?.

871
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,625
He was here
last night.

872
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,458
Where's my bird?.
He's not here now.

873
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,897
No, it's not.
Reuben, go check
the other cages.

874
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:52,127
Right, sweetheart.
I'll look everywhere.

875
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,261
They're here.
I think they're
all here.

876
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,066
So what?.

877
00:52:56,139 --> 00:53:00,735
So I find it hard to believe
that someone broke in here,
last night

878
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,769
with all these other
animals here and only
your bird got stolen.

879
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,145
What are you saying?.

880
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,650
I think you know
what I'm sayin'.

881
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,278
This is ridiculous, huh?.
I want my money,

882
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,255
and I'm not doin'
anymore business
with the two's 'a you.

883
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,849
Reuben, call the police.

884
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,623
Right.

885
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,857
But sweetness--

886
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:27,962
If I call the police,
they're, they're gonna
lock us all up.

887
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,801
Admit what you did.

888
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:30,999
No!

889
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:33,372
Admit it!
This whole
time you--

890
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:37,379
(Muriel)
What in the world
is this?

891
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:40,416
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

892
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,610
These don't look
like little kid prints.

893
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:47,055
These look like
the kind of prints
of some kind of dog.

894
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,387
(Seagal)
You hear me?.
I want my bird.

00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:53,190
(Muriel)
When I find--
Oh, it even chewed a hole.

896
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,629
I can't believe this!

897
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:59,658
[growling]
I knew it.
That Warner
kid has a dog.

898
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,796
Come on, go get it.
Go get it.

899
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,466
Good, yeah.
Come here.

900
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:09,069
But pets
aren't allowed.

901
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:12,410
That mutt
must'a done this.

902
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:15,474
I'm gonna go
have a little chat
with his parents.

903
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,543
(Dean)
It's a little hard
to believe.

904
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:20,886
I mean,
I know Rainy
is a very smart dog.

905
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:25,189
But I can't imagine
him travelin' 2000 miles
to this city to find Jimmy.

906
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,095
Sounds like a movie.

907
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:36,264
I am warning you. Your
lease specifically
states, no pets.

908
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,739
If I find a dog
hiding in here,

909
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,708
you are out!

910
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,871
(Laura)
Please, Mrs. Ledger.
We don't want any
trouble here.

911
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,414
Well, it's too late for that!

912
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,313
(Dean)
Now wait a minute.

913
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:51,150
Now, there's no evidence
that we have any animal
in this apartment at all.

914
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:55,385
So, until you can produce
such evidence, I'll thank you
not to threaten my family.

915
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,120
Oh!

It's okay.

919
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,791
I guess I should go.

920
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,667
Sweetness.

921
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:15,542
(Amy)
What did you bring?.

922
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:16,806
For what?.

923
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:19,976
Uh-oh.

924
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,950
You forgot?.
That's not good.

925
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,454
Mr. Newman said
anyone who didn't bring
a show and tell gets an F.

926
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,547
Maybe he won't
call on me.

927
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:28,886
Here, take mine.

928
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,755
No way. You'll get an F.

929
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,524
[clears throat]
Mr. Warner.

930
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:36,963
Is there something
you'd like to share today?.

931
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:41,094
Uh-- Uh-- l--

932
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,570
Mr. Warner.

[knocking on door]

934
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,102
Come in.

What is the meaning of this?.

00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:54,649
Who does he belong to?.

939
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:58,484
(Jimmy)
Uh, he's my show
and tell, Mr. Newman.

940
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:03,424
Well, this is
a bit irregular,
but go ahead.

[groaning]

948
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:18,769
T oday, I wanna
tell you about
the German Shepherd dog,

949
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:21,310
one of the bravest,
and smartest breeds
there is.

950
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,278
Looks like a stupid
animal to me

951
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,746
You would know.
[Rainy growls,
children laugh]

952
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,181
Gentlemen. Continue Jimmy.

953
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:31,379
In fact, Rainy's so smart,

954
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:34,252
he got invited to train
for a search and rescue team

955
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,884
in the great Smoky
Mountains of Tennessee.

956
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,451
Once, he even saved
a pilot's life.

957
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:42,521
Oh, so now he can fly?.
[children chuckle]

958
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,091
Billy. Let him finish.

959
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:49,297
So about a year ago

960
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:53,502
there was
this pilot flying
over the Smoky Mountains.

00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:14,864
(pilot)
Losing oil pressure.
Rapidly losing altitude.

967
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,764
Mayday. Mayday.

968
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:20,894
(Jimmy)
It was gonna
be a real dangerous
emergency landing.

969
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:24,599
H is wheels touched down,
and the plane landed
in the ice and snow.

970
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:28,633
And Rainy was there

971
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,838
[groaning]

972
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:39,277
(Jimmy)
The pilot set the plane
down safely, but passed out.

973
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:41,380
[barking]

974
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,627
(Jimmy)
Rainy pulled him out
just in the nick of time.

975
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,462
[pleasant music]

976

[groaning]

977
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,704
He won a medal
for that too. The end.

978
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:01,669
Now that was
an A-plus presentation.

979
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,143
Good job, Mr. Warner.

980
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,113
(girl)
He's so cute.

981
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,911
(girl 2)
I wanna pet him.

982
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,475
Thanks, boy.
I'll see you
after school.

983
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,318
He's a German
Shepherd dog,

984
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:22,193
a very dangerous,
unruly animal

985
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:23,926
I fear
for the neighborhood.

986
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,366
Don't worry.
I'll get him.

987
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,461
Know why?.
Check it out.

988
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:31,302
The latest

994
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:49,353
Hell. With this,
I can hear an elephant
fart in Africa.
[fart and elephant calling]

995
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:52,417
It's why they call me
Big-Game Gostavo.

996
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,588
[whimpers]

997
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:57,258
What, what you
gonna do with him
when you catch him?.

998
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:00,496
Let's just say
[suspense music]

999
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:04,734
it won't be PG Thirteen.

1000
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,866
[startled]
Ah, Chihuahua.

1001
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:09,639

What do you think
you're doing?
[roars]

1012
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:09,366
It was the dog.
The dog did this!

1013
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,934
Ah!

1014
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,945

[coughing]

1036
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,315
But we paid you,
Gostavo. You promised
to take care 'a him.

1037
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:32,377
Yeah, whatever
happened to that
not PG Thirteen?.

1038
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:35,117
Are you not
listening to me?.

1039
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:38,820
(Gostavo)
This is the first time ever
I couldn't catch a dog.

1040
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,022
Oh!

1041

Reuben, if we don't
take care 'a this dog

1042
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,866
it's gonna be the end
of the business.

1043
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:49,200
It sounded like he was
inside a dumpster
or somethin'.

Uh-huh. What?

have to talk to M uriel
about the price.

1065
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,780
I, l, I don't
know anything

1066
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,872

Oh my gosh.
They're selling
these poor animals.

1070
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,591
Rainy we need
to call the police.

1071
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,099
Or at least tell Dad.

1072
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:27,932
You ain't
gonna tell nobody,
you nosy little kid.

1073
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,472
Mrs. Ledger,
this is against the law.

1074
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,065
Only if the law
catches me.

And I'm gonna
make sure it don't.

You didn't think
I could lasso, did you?

What you gonna do
with the kid?

1145
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,991
I'll send him
to Mexico for
a couple 'a years.

01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,694
By the time he
gets back he won't

You know, Muriel.
He's not such a bad kid.

1153

[melancholy music continues]

everything that we
all strive for.

1438
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:03,463
Courage, determination,
loyalty, and kindness.

1439
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:07,030
Rainy, with the help
of this courageous
young man here,

1440
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:10,544
broke up a nefarious
animal smuggling ring.

1441
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:13,012
Amy helped too.

1442
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:16,414
(Amy)
Here I am.

1443
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:18,782
(mayor)
Well done, Amy.

1444
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:21,788
And so
it is, without
further ado,

1445
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:24,848
I present
the Golden Key
of our fair city,

1446
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:27,326
to Rainy.

1447
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,090
[groaning]

1448
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:33,362
[all cheering and applauding]

1449
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:36,131
Does this mean Rainy
could stay with us,
Mr. Mayor?.

1450
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:41,642
As far as I am
concerned he is now
a citizen of New York.

1451
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:45,145
That's my
boy, Rainy.

1452
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:47,579
[groaning]
