1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,260
Whose idea was it to put
everybody in the diner on skates?

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,450
Some idiot customer put a suggestion
in the suggestion box.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,490
-Oh, my God! They took my idea!
-That was you?

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,850
Okay, there you go.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,210
Rachel, I made you cocoa.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,900
Oh, that's so. . . .

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,890
Oh, my God! Are you guys okay?

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,450
Oh, my.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,970
The One With a Chick and a Duck

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,290
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

11
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,490
You know, with that goatee,
you kind of look like Satan.

12
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,210
So that's why the priest
threw holy water on me.

13
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,860
You have to cheer up.

14
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,490
You should come out with Ross and me.

15
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,290
Anything is better than sitting
here crying all day about Kate.

16
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,210
I was crying because
nobody believed Quincy's theory.

17
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,340
I'm gonna be on Tv!

18
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,810
No way!

19
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,530
They're putting together a panel
to talk about the fossils in Peru.

20
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,250
The Discovery Channel's filming it!

21
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,050
Oh, my God!
Who's gonna watch that?

22
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,050
Thanks. You ready to go?

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,220
I saw a girl with that vest.

24
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,450
Thanks.

25
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,900
Most of us think of chocolate and
baskets as traditional Easter gifts.

26
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,060
Some people insist on
giving live chicks as presents.

27
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,090
Unfortunately, most of these guys
won 't live to see the 4th of July.

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,450
As a result of improper care,
they will be dead.

29
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,700
You guys got any of those baby chicks?

30
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,810
I was watching this commercial on Tv,
and, man, those things are cute!

31
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,890
Pete, you're back!
Hey, check this out!

32
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,130
Skates!

33
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,090
You're sturdier than Chandler.
He crumbled like a piece of paper.

34
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,370
How was your trip?

35
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,090
What'd you bring me?

36
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,530
Hotel toiletries from Japan!

37
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,850
These are gonna go
in my permanent collection.

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,370
-Want some coffee?
-That'd be great.

39
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,570
Regular or decaf?

40
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,940
Whichever's closest.

41
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,210
-Ask me what I did today.
-What did you do today?

42
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,890
I bought a restaurant
and I'd like you to be the chef.

43
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,490
Can you believe he
offered me a restaurant?

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,700
What a jerk.
You want me to kick his ass?

45
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,130
It's been my dream since
I got my first Easy-Bake Oven. . .

46
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,890
. . .and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.

47
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,730
I would kill for this job.
I can totally do this job. . .

48
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,490
. . .and God knows, I've paid my dues.

49
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,540
But Pete's doing this
because he has a crush on me.

50
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,290
And you're still not
attracted to him at all?

51
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,290
How could I accept a restaurant
from him? I can't.

52
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,530
I couldn't accept a necklace
from Stu vincent in the 7th grade.

53
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,700
But, Mon, that was totally different.
He was your health teacher.

54
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,300
What, honey?

55
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,210
My side hurts from when
you crashed into me.

56
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,940
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

57
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,370
Oh, God!

58
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,850
Hey, you guys. Guess what?

59
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,020
Got a job on a riverboat?

60
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,050
I didn't wear this suit for a year,
because you hated it.

61
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,330
You're not my girlfriend
anymore, so: : : :

62
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,690
I see. This suit is making a point.

63
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,010
Now that you're on your own, you're
free to look as stupid as you'd like.

64
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,610
You like it, right?

65
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,170
I like it even more on you
than I did on Colonel Sanders.

66
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,690
Ross, I'm kidding. Come here.

67
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,490
What were you gonna tell us?

68
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,260
Was it how you
invented the cotton gin?

69
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,380
So after you put the suggestion
in the box. . .

70
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,850
. . .how long did it take
for it to happen?

71
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,740
About three months.

72
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,260
So I guess that's about two weeks
before the topless thing kicks in.

73
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,690
I got you something.
Open it! Open it!

74
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,380
It's a chicken.

75
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,970
It's cute, huh?

76
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,410
You guys? Do you know
anything about chicks?

77
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,730
Fowl? No.

78
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,250
Women? No.

79
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,490
They are a huge responsibility.

80
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,410
Especially at this age.
They require constant care.

81
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,690
They need just the right food
and lots and lots of love.

82
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,330
Well, no problem there.

83
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,650
Easy, Lenny.

84
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,100
So, I mean, have you thought about it?

85
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,570
Okay, here's the thing.

86
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,620
Not "the thing. "
I hate "the thing. "

87
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,010
What's "the thing"?

88
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,730
I can't do it.

89
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,730
I'm sorry. I wish I could. . .

90
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,650
. . .but you have these feelings for me.

91
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,930
That's what you're worried about?

92
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,690
If that's the problem,
we've got no problem.

93
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,450
I was gonna tell you over dinner,
but I met somebody else, on my trip.

94
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,770
Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.
We met on the plane.

95
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,380
She wanted to finish off
my peanuts.

96
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,410
I thought she said something else.
We had a big laugh.

97
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,330
I got tired of waiting.

98
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,490
That's great. I'm sorry,
but I'm so happy for you.

99
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,890
-Now I can work for you!
-I guess you can.

100
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,890
Oh, my God! This is incredible!

101
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,130
You know what? I'm gonna roll
right into that office and quit!

102
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,890
All right!

103
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,250
Could you give me a little push?

104
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,290
Good luck!

105
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,210
I'm quitting!

106
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,490
I'm okay! I'm all right!

107
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,210
That's exciting.
You went to Japan, made up a woman.

108
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,970
What?

109
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,010
I'm just saying, this "woman,"
I mean, she's fictitious, no?

110
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,970
-Why would you say that?
-You're still into Monica.

111
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,050
You said there's somebody else
so she'd work with you.

112
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,410
If you spend time together,
maybe something might happen.

113
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,650
You're good. You're good.

114
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,380
No, I'm fairly intuitive. And psychic.

115
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,690
It's a substantial gift.

116
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,530
Can you promise me
that you won't tell her?

117
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,290
Absolutely. I promise.
Tell her what?

118
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,370
Thanks a lot.

119
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,290
No, I'm serious.
I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

120
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,490
Okay, but this is the last time.

121
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,900
With a chick-chick here
And a chick-chick there

122
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,700
Here a chick, there a chick
Everywhere a chick-chick

123
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,290
Chicken....

124
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,490
How's she doing?

125
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,850
She?

126
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,100
Don't you think it's a she?

127
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,220
I don't know.

128
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,490
I can't tell. Whatever it was
went back in too quickly.

129
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,900
I gotta change. I'm meeting
some of the cast for drinks.

130
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,250
Excuse me?

131
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,490
What?

132
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,970
I stayed home while
you were at rehearsal. . .

133
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,650
. . .so somebody could be here
with our chick.

134
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,730
Who was up from 2:00 this
morning until 5:00. . .

135
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,890
. . .trying to get her back to sleep?

136
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,370
You don't think I get up
when you get up?

137
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,610
Oh, here it comes.

138
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,290
Yes! Here it comes!
I'm stuck here all day!

139
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,450
And then you come in
and spend two seconds with us. . .

140
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,410
. . .and then expect to go off
gallivanting with your friends?

141
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,530
Well, I don't think so, mister!

142
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,570
I need to relax, okay?
I was working all day.

143
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,300
And you don't think
taking care of our chick is work?

144
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,330
That's not what I said.
I just meant--

145
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,090
I know what you meant!

146
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,700
Did you notice that ever since
we got this chick. . .

147
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,900
. . .we've been fighting
a lot more than we used to?

148
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,700
I don't know, maybe we weren't
ready to have a chick.

149
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,490
I'll take her back tomorrow.

150
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,450
We'll get our $3 back?

151
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,090
I have that Tv thing in two hours,
and I need your help.

152
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,260
What do you think?
This blue suit or this brown one?

153
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,410
The brown one brings out your eyes.

154
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,500
But your butt looks great
in the blue one.

155
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,930
Really?

156
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,300
That aspirin dance really works.

157
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,410
-Is that still. . .?
-I'm fine.

158
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,450
-No, you're not!
-Yes, I am.

159
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,290
Look, I'm fine.
Watch. Look at that.

160
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,740
You've got to go to a doctor, okay?

161
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,810
I have to get ready and go
to a dinner at my boss's house.

162
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,170
There's people there
that I have to meet.

163
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,330
I'm sure you'll make a great
impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel.

164
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,090
It's nice to meet you. "

165
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,250
Come on, you probably
have a broken rib.

166
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,650
I'll go to the hospital tomorrow.
It'll still be broken then.

167
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,090
But you know, I could use a hand
getting ready.

168
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,410
Either help me, or go.

169
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,930
Fine. I'll go.

170
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,610
But before you go,
could you help me first?

171
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,290
Sure. I'll help you.

172
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,450
Good! Do you guys know how
to get a chick out of a vCR?

173
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,610
You know what?
I cannot do this with my left hand.

174
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,210
Would you please help me
with this too?

175
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,820
Let's use this brush.

176
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,140
-This stuff?
-Careful.

177
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,250
Light.

178
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,620
Just sweep it across the lid.
Just sweep it.

179
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,450
Sorry!

180
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,570
That's just poking me in the eye.

181
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,010
I'm sorry. Close. . . .

182
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,130
-Just sweep it.
-I'm sweeping.

183
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,330
Sweep, sweep. . . .

184
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,770
Now make it even,
because we don't. . . .

185
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,860
I don't want it to be too much.
I want it to be subtle.

186
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,980
You don't wear enough of this.

187
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,810
Since when do you think
I don't wear enough of this?

188
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,530
Close your eye.
You're gonna like this better. . . .

189
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,170
-Close, close.
-Blow it.

190
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,730
Because I think this will make you
a little more sophisticated.

191
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,210
Sophisticated like a hooker?

192
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,970
-Guess what I'm doing tonight.
-What?

193
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,010
I'm checking out
the restaurant with Pete.

194
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,530
Monica, I am so excited for you!

195
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,180
I have to tell you something.

196
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,290
What?

197
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,940
I can't tell you.

198
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,890
Wouldn't it be easier to tell
me something that you could tell me?

199
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,090
Well, sure, in a perfect world.

200
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,490
But no. I promised I wouldn't tell,
and I swore to all my Gods.

201
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,610
Does it have to do with
Ross and Rachel?

202
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,810
Does it have to do with Joey?

203
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,330
Does it have to do with Chandler
and that sock he keeps by his bed?

204
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,330
No, but let's come back to that later.

205
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,730
There you go!
Good enough for your party?

206
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,730
Sure.

207
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,610
Sure. I'll just sit next to
the transsexual from purchasing.

208
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,210
All right, I gotta go,
So good luck at the party.

209
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,210
Could you just stay
and help me get dressed?

210
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,900
Sure.

211
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,970
Great. Okay, just turn around.

212
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,290
What?

213
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,450
I don't want you to see me naked.

214
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,410
I've seen you naked a million times.
I ate hot fudge off you naked.

215
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,650
I sucked that mini-marshmallow
out of your bellybutton.

216
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,490
Yeah, but that was different.
We were going out then.

217
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,330
Now it's weird.

218
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,970
Rach, you know, I can see
you naked anytime I want.

219
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,530
What?

220
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,090
All I have to do is close my eyes.
See?

221
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,050
Ross, stop that!

222
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,450
Come on! Don't think of me
like that anymore.

223
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,340
Sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

224
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,010
It's one of my rights
as the ex-boyfriend.

225
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,250
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!

226
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,530
I'm sorry. It will never happen--

227
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,130
Wait a minute! Wait, wait. . . .

228
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,490
Now there are 1 00 of you,
and I'm the king!

229
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,330
Would you grow up? It's no big deal.

230
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,370
All right. Fine.

231
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,460
See what you did?
I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

232
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,370
Oh, my God. All right, look, look. . . .

233
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,370
Easy. Easy.
You have to go to the hospital, okay?

234
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,340
I do. I really do.

235
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,970
I'll get your coat,
then I'll put you in a cab.

236
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,890
You're not gonna come with me?

237
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,490
Of course I am.

238
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,490
I just have to make a call.

239
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,810
Thank you.

240
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,650
What's wrong?

241
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,290
I'm sorry. I just can't go
to the hospital looking like this.

242
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,570
Does it involve travel?

243
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,930
Does it involve clogs?

244
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,530
Clogs or claws?

245
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,810
Clogs.

246
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,060
Claws?

247
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,450
So it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel
or Chandler or Joey.

248
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,970
What about Pete?

249
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,690
What is it?

250
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,050
-What about Pete?
-I don't know!

251
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,930
I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.

252
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,330
-Phoebe, would you just tell me?
-I can't!

253
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,330
-I gotta go.
-But you're so close!

254
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,370
Something to do
with Pete's company?

255
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,100
Go! You'll never get it!

256
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,570
I know.

257
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,330
See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

258
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,210
She's a completely different
kind of chick.

259
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,890
I love you both.

260
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,530
But in very different ways.

261
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,090
What are you doing?
You were gonna take her back.

262
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,130
I did. But the store
wouldn't take her back.

263
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,490
Then I took her to the shelter.
You know what I found out?

264
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,490
If they can't find a home for her,
they kill her!

265
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,050
I won't let that happen
to little Jasmine.

266
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,540
Good, good, because I was
kind of having second thoughts too.

267
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,970
And it's not just chicks.
It's all kinds of other animals.

268
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,610
That's horrible.
You did the right thing.

269
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,740
Thanks. I'm glad
you see it that way.

270
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,290
Funny story!

271
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,850
I don't believe this!

272
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,290
Look at this refrigerator!
It's gigantic!

273
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,090
I could live in this thing!
I'd be cold, but I'm always cold!

274
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,050
Oh, my God! Look at these spider
burners! I love spider burners!

275
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,650
So you like it?

276
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,490
It is so perfect!
Thank you so much.

277
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,130
You're welcome.

278
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,940
Did you just smell my hair?

279
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,290
No! No way! What?

280
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,820
-Oh, God.
-What?

281
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,250
You still have feelings for me.

282
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,170
I'm just excited about the restaurant,
that's all.

283
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
I love you. Is that so bad?

284
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,690
No, it's not bad.
It's not bad at all.

285
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,690
It's really nice.

286
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,730
The only one who stands to get hurt
is me, and I'm okay with that.

287
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,330
You may be okay with getting hurt. . .

288
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,690
. . .but I am not okay with being
the one who hurts you.

289
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,130
That's why I can't take this job.

290
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,490
What?

291
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,420
We probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

292
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,700
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,050
I mean, if that's
really what you want, okay.

294
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,010
I'm sorry things--

295
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,100
Shut up for a second
and let me just see something.

296
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,130
You'd tell me the truth?

297
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,650
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.

298
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,890
Now you stay out here
and you think about what you did!

299
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,970
-That's a duck!
-That's a bad duck!

300
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,090
How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?

301
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,730
What thing? What thing?

302
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,890
Nothing. There was this thing
at the museum. Come on.

303
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,170
Easy.

304
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,100
Now, when you come back, I hope you
remember that that chick is not a toy!

305
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,930
What "thing"? What is this "thing"?

306
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,330
I was kind of supposed to be on Tv
tonight for the Discovery Channel.

307
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,650
Oh, my God!

308
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,570
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

309
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,410
I knew that if I told you,
you'd make me go. . .

310
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,540
. . .and I knew you needed someone
to be with you tonight. Come on.

311
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,610
-I cannot believe you.
-What?

312
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,690
That is the sweetest thing.

313
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,010
You should get some sleep.

314
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,540
Sorry I spoiled your evening.

315
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,890
As long as you're okay.

316
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,060
So I'll see you tomorrow.

317
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,010
See you.

318
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,450
What did you do?

319
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,250
What you doing?

320
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,250
Having a swim.

321
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,690
What about the chick?

322
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,490
Chicks don't swim.

323
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,130
Are you sure?

324
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,500
I don't know.

325
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,610
-Should we try?
-Sure.

326
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,690
See, I told you.
They don't swim.

327
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,020
Well, give him a minute.

328
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,690
It's okay.
It's okay, baby, baby, baby.
