1
00:00:01,674 --> 00:00:03,590
Dunder Mifflin, this is Rolando.

2
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:06,350
Oh, yes, she's been expecting your call.

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,785
Yeah.

4
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:12,479
Karen?

5
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:14,982
- He's on line one.
- Thanks, Ro.

6
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:19,607
Hey, we finally connected.
How's Scranton?

7
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:22,734
I am the regional manager
of Dunder Mifflin, Utica branch.

8
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,769
Turns out it's a pretty easy gig
when your boss isn't an idiot

9
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,365
and your boyfriend's not
in love with somebody else.

10
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:31,210
Look, all I'm saying is
it would be a great opportunity,

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,397
and we'd love to have you come aboard.

12
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:35,436
So think about it, okay?

13
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:38,054
Okay, bye.

14
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:40,332
Look, for the record,

15
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:43,642
a certain Scranton salesman
approached me, okay?

16
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:46,081
- This is perfect!
- He looks like your twin.

17
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:49,520
This is a dummy,
a la <i>Ferris Bueller's day off.</i>

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,271
We have tied a string to the wrist
which goes to the door.

19
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:55,747
When somebody opens the door,
the hand goes down, hits the remote,

20
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:58,728
turns on the tape recorder,
which is me snoring.

21
00:00:59,168 --> 00:01:03,019
Now nobody knows whether I am here
or whether I am gone.

22
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,272
- I will know.
- But you will not tell anyone.

23
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:08,717
I won't need to,
'cause we'll be together playin' hooky!

24
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:12,048
Well, sometimes.
Most of the time, I will be with Ryan.

25
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,308
Or Darryl.

26
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:15,495
Yes.
Oh, good, good, Stanley!

27
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,458
First victim!
This is what I want you to do.

28
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,850
Go out, come back in.
We're gonna hide.

29
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,816
I want you to tell me
if this looks like me.

30
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:24,546
I don't understand why sleeping
is better than you not being...

31
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:26,172
Just go out and come back in.

32
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,489
I got an offer from Utica
for more money,

33
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:30,927
and I'm going to take it.

34
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:33,054
What?

Episode 4x06
"Branch Wars" (1.00)

70
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,465
Hey, everyone,
can I have your attention, please?

71
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,218
I just thought you all should know

72
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:15,180
that Stanley Hudson
is planning on leaving us

73
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,272
because our old friend Karen from Utica

74
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:21,148
is going to give him
more money to work there.

75
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,265
Okay!

76
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,773
No, no, no, no, no, no-no, no, no.

77
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,396
You completely misinterpreted my tone.

78
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:29,022
This is a horrible thing.

79
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,863
Clearly,
Karen is trying to get back at us

80
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:34,023
because Jim dumped her.

81
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:38,188
- I don't think that's what's happening.
- Okay, well, smarty pants. Then why?

82
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:41,414
Why is she trying
to take Stanley from us?

83
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,625
I think it's because of my sales record.

84
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:45,986
That could not possibly be it.

85
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:50,405
You cannot take
the hilarious black guy from the office.

86
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,049
Stanley is part of what makes
this branch so extraordinary.

87
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,346
The bluesy wisdom,
the sassy remarks,

88
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:58,986
the crossword puzzles,

89
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:02,620
the smile,
those big, watery red eyes.

90
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,188
I don't know how George Bush did it
when Colin Powell left.

91
00:03:05,472 --> 00:03:09,053
And if Utica thinks
that they are going to poach Stanley,

92
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:10,652
they have another think coming.

93
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:19,160
- How can I get you to stay?
- Money.

94
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,493
Yeah.
We all want money.

95
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:25,111
But there is none in the budget, so...

96
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,836
- Tell me why you're really leaving.
- Money.

97
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:32,020
Mo money, mo problems, Stanley.
You of all people should know that.

98
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,730
Let me ask you this.

99
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:35,722
- If I were...
- Money.

100
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,438
Oscar.

101
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:41,293
Did you bring it?

102
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:44,418
To be Edwardian.

103
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:45,854
His best work.

104
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:47,981
I've the tablecloth,
don't forget the flatware.

105
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:49,524
Sure thing.
Can't wait.

106
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:53,458
Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members
of the Finer Things Club.

107
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:56,460
We meet once a month
to discuss books and art,

108
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,665
celebrate culture
in a very civilized way.

109
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:02,696
Sometimes the debate can get heated.

110
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,331
But we're always respectful.

111
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:09,781
There is no paper, no plastic,
and no work talk allowed.

112
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,668
It's very exclusive.

113
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:14,574
Besides having sex with men,

114
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:18,344
I would say the Finer Things Club
is the gayest thing about me.

115
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:23,083
So tell me again
why I can't be a part of your club?

116
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:25,883
Because some people think
that you monopolize the conversation

117
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:27,524
by trying to be funny.

118
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:30,017
- Oscar?
- Some people.

119
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:31,649
<i>Hello?</i>

120
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:33,378
Filipellers, how they hangin'?

121
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:35,521
- <i>Michael.</i>
- To the left? To the right?

122
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,071
- <i>Listen, I'm reall...</i>
- Okay,

123
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:39,574
- <i>enough small talk. Go ahead.</i>
- You called me.

124
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:41,799
Yes.
Listen.

125
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:45,086
You cannot tear Stanley
from his family like this.

126
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:47,552
I'm pretty sure
his family's coming with him.

127
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:48,791
<i>No, his work family.</i>

128
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:53,145
Look, this is very hard for me,
but I'm going to give you my best man.

129
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:54,707
You may have Toby.

130
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:56,396
<i>Toby's not a salesperson.</i>

131
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:59,099
You can train him.
He's very, very smart.

132
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:01,213
And funny, and charming.

133
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:04,072
You know...

134
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:06,100
I can't do it.
Toby is the worst.

135
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,045
That...
That was a bluff.

136
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,897
Listen, if you are going to poach
one of my guys,

137
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:13,608
I am going to poach one of yours.

138
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:17,040
- Good-bye, Michael.
- <i>Okay, good-bye.</i>

139
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,709
<i>Wait, wait!
Karen.</i>

140
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:21,430
Could you transfer me
to one of your salespeople, please?

141
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,806
Your best one?

142
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:29,379
I have Ben Nugent on the line.
He is the top salesman in Utica.

143
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,503
- Hi, Ben. Michael Scott.
- <i>Hi, Michael.</i>

144
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:33,833
I'm going to cut
right to the chase here.

145
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:35,443
Do you like magic?

146
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:37,465
Because I am a genie in a bottle,

147
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:39,550
and I'm going
to grant you three wishes:

148
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:43,324
to move to Scranton,
to have a great job,

149
00:05:43,484 --> 00:05:44,847
and to be my best friend.

150
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:48,039
<i>Aren't you the guy
that hit the woman with your car?</i>

151
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:49,569
Get out.

152
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,893
Yeah.
I also saved her life.

153
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:56,336
But I guess that's not as grabby.

154
00:05:56,496 --> 00:05:58,987
<i>Everyone says Scranton branch
is worse than Camden.</i>

155
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,146
<i>Didn't everyone from Stamford quit,
like immediately?</i>

156
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:04,502
No, I fired them, and you're next.

157
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:09,795
So what do you say?

158
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:11,112
Seriously?

159
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:15,086
What is that guy talking about?
Scranton is not lame.

160
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:17,980
Scranton is the cool, fun branch.

161
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:19,882
We're like animal house.

162
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:22,274
Found him!

163
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:23,434
Jim.

164
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:25,551
We're getting crapped on.

165
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:28,266
Word is our branch sucks,
and we've to do something about it.

166
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:30,443
- What you're gonna do?
- What we're gonna do?

167
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,274
We are going to make a monster sale
is what we're going to do.

168
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,481
- Corcoran dropped Staples.
- Did they?

169
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:39,027
Yes, they did. Oh, yes, they did.
And we are going to murder it!

170
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:41,738
You, me, Dwight,
are going to jump into my PT Cruiser.

171
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:45,208
We are going to crush this sale.
We are going to prove...

172
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:47,577
What the hell is that music?

173
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,585
It's Vivaldi.
For Finer Things.

174
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,834
That's the problem. That's the problem.

175
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,751
We need rock and roll, Pam.
Rock and roll!

176
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,245
All right?

177
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:58,414
Oh, my...

178
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,502
god.

179
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,313
That's why people are leaving.

180
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:06,621
I...

181
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:09,096
I have no words.

182
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,738
We just passed the exit for Corcoran.

183
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:25,698
What?
We did?

184
00:07:26,744 --> 00:07:27,746
Surprise!

185
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,329
- Yes!
- Look at his face!

186
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:33,664
- Look at his face!
- What are we doing?

187
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,709
What are we doing, Dwight?
What are we doing?

188
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:39,778
Oh, well, gee, Jim, I don't know.
I guess there's no sales call today.

189
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:43,591
We are going on a panty raid to Utica
is what we're doing.

190
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,885
- We're going to Utica?
- Uh-huh!

191
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:48,679
I'm not going to Utica.

192
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,807
Yes, you are.
Oh, buckle up, Jim.

193
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:54,936
We are going to make Karen wish
that she had never been dumped by you.

194
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:56,854
Utica!

195
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:58,564
- Utica!
- Utica!

196
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:00,625
In your face.

197
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,742
I can't believe you guys.

198
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:06,273
I'm not gonna go further
piss off my ex-girlfriend.

199
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:07,824
- Are you calling Karen?
- No.

200
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:10,517
- He's lying.
- Yep. Get it.

201
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,537
What are you doing?
Stop it, Dwight!

202
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:18,042
- Are you kidding me?
- No communication with outside world.

203
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,001
It had to be done.
It had to be done.

204
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,897
Well, that kinda sucks,

205
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,959
because it had all the photos
of my brother's new baby on it.

206
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,119
So...

207
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:28,917
Oh, no.

208
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,555
That is too bad.

209
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:43,782
- Okay.
- Hey, Dwight, he found it.

210
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:46,821
- I'm just gonna call a cab from here.
- All right

211
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,621
- You're gonna miss the best prank ever.
- All right.

212
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:54,704
Wait.
What are you planning on doing?

213
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:58,502
Do you really wanna know?

214
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:00,168
- Oh, god.
- Follow me. Come here.

215
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:03,129
Here's what we brought.
We brought uniforms

216
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,570
from the warehouse.
I brought silly string.

217
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:08,301
Dwight brought gasoline and rubber
to make stink bombs.

218
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:11,304
- Or real bombs.
- No, no. Not real bombs.

219
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:13,272
Yeah, come on.
It'll be so badass.

220
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:17,476
Maybe. I don't know.
Could be badass. Well...

221
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,020
- Yeah, it will!
- No!

222
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,855
Absolutely, we're not doing this.

223
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:23,524
I already filled bottles with gas.
It's gonna be so badass!

224
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:27,195
You kidding me? We've been driving
with this in the trunk the whole time?

225
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,857
Teach her to offer Stanley more money.

226
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:34,191
So...
the deal was,

227
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:38,164
Dwight doesn't blow anything up,
and I wear a costume.

228
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:41,167
And a moustache.

229
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,409
So why did you and Karen break up?

230
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,174
- Was it the sex?
- What?

231
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:50,426
I can't imagine the sex being bad.
Her body...

232
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,900
You know what,
why don't we play that alphabet game

233
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,524
that you were talking about?

234
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,057
Okay. I will start.

235
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:58,149
"A."

236
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:01,880
"A," my name is Alan,
and my wife's name is Alice.

237
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,721
We live in Alaska, and we sell...

238
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:07,453
Damn it.
What do we sell?

239
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:09,648
Doesn't matter.

240
00:10:09,814 --> 00:10:12,337
- I try to think of what we could sell.
- It doesn't matter.

241
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:14,207
What is that?

242
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:16,021
That sound...

243
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,704
The air conditioning
leaking or something?

244
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:20,873
That doesn't make sense.
It couldn't be.

245
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:22,587
What is that?

246
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,121
Dwight, are you peeing?

247
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:30,049
- I'm peeing in this empty can.
- Oh, my god!

248
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,509
That is disgusting, Dwight.

249
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:33,594
You said
we couldn't make any more stops.

250
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:34,845
Watch the road!

251
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:36,311
Hey, you're making me spray!

252
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:38,115
- I'll kill you, man!
- Oh, my god!

253
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,977
- Michael, Michael, pull over.
- That is just so disgusting!

254
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:43,229
I think I cut my penis on the lid.

255
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,898
Can you imagine a life
where all you have to do

256
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:47,900
is summer in the italian countryside?

257
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,995
I know, right?
I just wanna go and look at art...

258
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:53,274
and swim in the Adriatic.

259
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:56,732
And spend time with George Emerson.
That's what I would do.

260
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:59,271
I mean, it's the best male protagonist
we've read, right?

261
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,499
Totally!

262
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,325
- I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
- What are you doing?

263
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:07,357
Just came to discuss
my favorite E.M. Forster novel.

264
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,788
Pam, these finger sandwiches
look finger-lickin' delicious, Pam.

265
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:15,344
I'm sorry, Andy,
but this is a closed club.

266
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:21,336
The Finer Things Club

267
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:23,902
is the most exclusive club
in this office.

268
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:26,149
Naturally, it's where I need to be.

269
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:30,522
Party Planning Committee is my backup,
and Kevin's band is my safety.

270
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:31,871
Fine.

271
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,258
I'll just...

272
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,146
sit here,

273
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:40,236
in the common area

274
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:42,343
and read my book.

275
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,850
Which happens to be
the very same book you're reading.

276
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,002
All right, just know
you're not in the Finer Things Club.

277
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:50,135
Why can't I be in the club?

278
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:52,798
I can't believe we're here.

279
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:55,372
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Believe it.

280
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:57,088
Do you want the afro wig?

281
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:59,055
No, Michael, I'm not leaving the car.

282
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:01,148
- God. All right, Dwight.
- Yeah.

283
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:03,392
Here's how it's gonna go down.
You and I...

284
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:05,737
Guy's going by.
Shh.

285
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:07,589
You and I are gonna sneak inside.

286
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:09,355
We'll pretend to be warehouse workers,

287
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:11,569
and we'll string
the bejesus out of the place.

288
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:13,063
If we've to defend ourselves,

289
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:16,274
I'll stab the security guard in the eye
with the jumbo chalk.

290
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,749
No! No, you won't do that.
Nope.

291
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:21,152
Then I'll grind up it
and blow it in his eyes.

292
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:24,183
Dwight, nothing with the eyes. Please?

293
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:26,558
Okay, Jim.

294
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:29,994
Oh, my god, that's her.
That's her, go, go, go!

295
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:31,921
- Let's move, move, move!
- Shut up!

296
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:35,594
This is the dumbest thing
we've ever done.

297
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:46,852
I think it's interesting
how Forster uses

298
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:49,754
Italy to represent
sexuality and passion.

299
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:52,772
And that also brought up themes of...

300
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,277
you know, fate and coincidence.

301
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:57,646
And Lucy's torn
between these two things.

302
00:12:57,806 --> 00:12:59,962
She's torn
between passion and convention.

303
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:01,122
Damn it!

304
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,285
It just...

305
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:10,287
To be making the case for passion
in Edwardian times,

306
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,607
- I thought was...
- Yes!

307
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:17,409
Damn it.

308
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,875
Made him sort of ahead
of his time as writer.

309
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:22,054
Very brave.

310
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:24,179
Very brave choice I thought also.

311
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,587
And George, his...
His youthfulness,

312
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:29,036
his...
His freedom

313
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:30,981
evokes...

314
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:33,956
feelings,

315
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,322
- What are you microwaving?!
- Popcorn.

316
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:42,908
Why don't you use the microwave
in the kitchen, Phyllis?

317
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:46,245
Someone needs to clean it.
It smells like popcorn.

318
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,277
So, Stanley, you really outta here?

319
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:57,530
Yep.
Looks that way.

320
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:00,612
I'm gonna miss you, man.

321
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,367
You've been like an uncle to me.
Like a kind old...

322
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,025
uncle Remus.

323
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,638
I wanna stay in touch.

324
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:16,153
<i>We are in a stairwell.</i>

325
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,220
<i>We are climbing some stairs.</i>

326
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:22,275
- <i>I'm breathing heavily.</i>
- Know what?

327
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:25,281
You really don't need to be updating me
as much as you're updating me.

328
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:27,828
<i>There's a guy.
There's a security guard coming by.</i>

329
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:30,998
<i>Hello, we're warehouse workers.</i>

330
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:33,136
<i>Would you like more proof?</i>

331
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:36,454
<i>Oh, my god.
That was very close.</i>

332
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:40,131
- <i>I can see the security guard's eyes.</i>
- No. No. Don't do anything to them.

333
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,343
<i>I have to do something to his eyes!</i>

334
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,535
The eyes...

335
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:45,638
are the groin of the head.

336
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,337
All right, great Scott.

337
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:49,902
If you found that choking hazard poster,
just head on home.

338
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:52,587
<i>We got something far better.
Their crown jewel.</i>

339
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:54,497
<i>Their industrial copier.</i>

340
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:56,493
Isn't that thing huge?

341
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:57,889
<i>It's enormous.</i>

342
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:00,903
<i>But it's got wheels.
We're wheeling it down the hall</i>

343
00:15:01,185 --> 00:15:02,384
<i>into the stairwell.</i>

344
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:04,777
<i>Get the car ready.
Keep the engine running.</i>

345
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:08,236
No. That is a terrible idea.
Don't do this.

346
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:13,207
<i>My hip bone! We're wedged
between the copier and the railing.</i>

347
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:14,799
<i>Ow! God!</i>

348
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:16,752
<i>Ow, my leg!
Jim, leave us!</i>

349
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:18,794
<i>- Don't leave us!
- Save yourself!</i>

350
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:20,954
<i>Don't leave us, help us!
We need help, Jim!</i>

351
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:24,139
Okay, first of all, stop using my name.
And second of all...

352
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,338
- <i>Dwight, you gotta move...</i>
- Damn it, guys!

353
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:29,591
<i>- Dwight, just move over a little bit!
- I'm losing control of my bladder!</i>

354
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,960
Oh, my god,
oh, my god, Karen is back.

355
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,438
<i>Did you say Karen?</i>

356
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,919
<i>Take her to a motel.
Make love to her, Jim.</i>

357
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,565
No, I'm not doing that.

358
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:39,470
<i>Just say you wanna get back together.</i>

359
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,027
No! I'm not doing that.

360
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:43,279
<i>It doesn't have to mean anything.
Just...</i>

361
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:44,933
<i>do it for Stanley.</i>

362
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,205
<i>Come on, Jim. Just climb on top of her
and think about Stanley.</i>

363
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:51,114
<i>Jim,</i>

364
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:53,761
<i>this is it for me.
Promise me something.</i>

365
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:56,593
- Jim?
- <i>Host the dundies.</i>

366
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:00,170
Hey, Karen.

367
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,131
Uh...
what are you doing here?

368
00:16:02,437 --> 00:16:03,787
First of all, hi.

369
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:06,677
- What are you doing here?
- You good?

370
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:10,575
I'm just checking on the other branches.

371
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:13,276
Michael wants me to do that
from time to time, so...

372
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:16,145
<i>Jim, don't tell Karen
about the industrial copier!</i>

373
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:18,349
Copy that.

374
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:22,100
I cried for weeks over that guy.
So, yeah...

375
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:26,751
Seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser
in a ladies' warehouse uniform...

376
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:28,365
felt pretty good.

377
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:32,276
Let me ask you,
did you accomplish what you wanted?

378
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:33,673
Listen, lady,

379
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:35,972
you can expect
these kind of repercussions

380
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:38,167
as long as you keep trying
to poach our people.

381
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:40,002
I'm taking Stanley.

382
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:43,407
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.

383
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,568
Dwight...

384
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,053
Granted,
maybe this was not the best idea,

385
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:54,394
but at least
we care enough about our employees

386
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,525
that we are willing to fight for them.

387
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:01,326
And if you so much
as harm a hair on Stanley's head...

388
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:05,413
we will burn Utica to the ground.

389
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,676
- Jim, hang on a second?
- Yes.

390
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:19,583
So you're still

391
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:21,997
doing this kinda stuff, huh?

392
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:24,100
Yeah.
Trying to quit, though.

393
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:28,342
If you wanted to see me, you could
have just called me like an adult.

394
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:29,802
No, I didn't wanna see you.

395
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:34,338
Not that I'm not happy to be seeing you.
Right now.

396
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:37,059
I'm just saying,
ultimately, I was here for the copier.

397
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:40,646
Equal. I'd say it was equal.
So, good to see you...

398
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:45,501
I mean, it's just that...

399
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:48,488
You know,
Pam and I are still dating, so...

400
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:50,540
and, I just mean that...

401
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:55,002
things are going really well,
so I didn't want to see you...

402
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:57,856
Things are going really well?
Are they?

403
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:00,958
They are. That's great.
That's so great.

404
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,905
I wanna hear more
about how happy you are with Pam.

405
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:07,615
Can you tell me more about that?
Thank you so much for coming to Utica

406
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:08,911
and breaking my copier

407
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:11,780
and telling me how well
things are going in your relationship.

408
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,928
- Really. Thank you.
- All right.

409
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,683
You are welcome.
I'm going to go because of...

410
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:20,912
- traffic.
- Traffic. Yeah.

411
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:22,564
Oh, def...
Go...

412
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:25,722
Go 'cause of traffic. Definitely.
Beat... Beat the traffic.

413
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,174
I... will...

414
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,424
We tried, and we failed.

415
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:40,563
Stanley,

416
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,625
you may go.

417
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:46,174
Here

418
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:48,406
is a box...

419
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:50,966
for your things.

420
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:56,077
But I doubt that
that box will be able to contain...

421
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,388
all the memories
that you have of this place.

422
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:02,978
Fly away, sweet little bird.

423
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:05,775
Fly away and be free.

424
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:07,962
Pam...

425
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,069
I'm gonna need some help
writing a want ad.

426
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:16,888
Wanted...

427
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,006
middle-aged black man with sass.

428
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:22,069
Big butt.

429
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:23,707
Bigger heart.

430
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:26,782
I can't... do this.

431
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:28,064
Michael?

432
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,942
A word.

433
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:31,877
Of course.

434
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:36,220
I changed my mind.

435
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:38,464
I wanna keep this job.

436
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:40,307
Really?

437
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,487
I wasn't really planning on leaving.

438
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:44,412
All I wanted was a raise.

439
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,220
How on earth did Michael call my bluff?

440
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,108
Is he some sort of secret genius?

441
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,763
Sometimes I say crazy things.

442
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,534
Hey.

443
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:03,330
I'm so sorry.
Rolando told me everything.

444
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:06,935
How humiliating.

445
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:11,063
Would it help you
to return to another age?

446
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,751
A time of...

447
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:14,138
refinement

448
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:16,176
and civility?

449
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:19,179
Are you inviting me
to the Finer Things Club?

450
00:20:21,191 --> 00:20:22,410
Oh, come on!

451
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,719
Angela's ashes.
Top of the mornin' to it.

452
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:27,688
Frankie's prose is finer
than a pot of gold, say I.

453
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:29,758
Okay.

454
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,383
Did you get it out of your system?

455
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,750
Yep.

456
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,180
No, I mean I really liked it.
Thought it was a fun read.

457
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:38,532
- Fun?
- Mm-hmm.

458
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:39,836
- Really?
- Yeah.

459
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:41,703
What was fun about it for you?

460
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:43,537
Was it the death of the twins?

461
00:20:46,156 --> 00:20:47,923
No, that wasn't... fun.

462
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:51,323
- Did you even read it?
- Course I read it.

463
00:20:51,503 --> 00:20:52,614
How does it end?

464
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,548
Who was the main character?

465
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,550
Angela.

466
00:20:57,438 --> 00:20:58,438
Nope.

467
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:00,315
Ashes.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
