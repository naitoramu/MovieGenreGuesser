00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:49,329
- Hey what's up ?
- Hey !

3
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:53,130
- Any e-mails today ?
- Hum I don't think so...

4
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:54,455
No ?

5
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:57,436
Check your spam folder.

6
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:00,776
Oh ! there it is !

7
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,765
- What ?

8
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:07,565
"50 signs that your priest
might be Michael Jackson"

9
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:11,256
Well done ! Topical !

10
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,080
I am king of forwards !

11
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:16,136
it's how I like to do business.

12
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,940
Everybody joking around !

13
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,626
We're like Friends.

14
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:22,481
I am Chandler,

15
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,013
and Joey,

16
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:27,833
and Pam is Rachel,

17
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:31,361
and Dwight is Kramer.

18
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:35,310
So the monkey does the
sex thing, right here !

19
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,793
Funny ! that's funny !

20
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:43,713
Not offensive because
it's nature, educational.

21
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:48,033
Do you want the link ? cause then
you could forward it around.

22
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:48,812
Consider it.

23
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:51,033
Maybe.

24
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:52,392
Well, we'll see.

25
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:55,020
Because I don't know if it's...

26
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:55,772
Come on !

27
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:58,652
What has 2 thumbs and
likes to bone your mum ?

28
00:01:58,805 --> 00:01:59,783
This guy !

29
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,182
You are so bad !

30
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:08,323
This guy is out of control !

31
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:09,953
He is a mad man !

32
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:12,620
Better get the bleep
button ready for him.

33
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:16,833
What's up Halpert ? Still queer ?

34
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:23,611
Todd Packer, and I, are total BFF.

35
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:25,233
Best Friends Forever.

36
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:27,743
He and I came up together as salesman.

37
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:31,742
One time we were out, and we met this

38
00:02:32,076 --> 00:02:33,843
set of twins,

39
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:37,123
and Packer told them
that we were brothers.

40
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,283
And so you know,

41
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:40,653
one thing lead to another,

42
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:43,221
and we brought them back to the motel,

43
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:46,303
and then Packer did both of them.

44
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:48,520
It was awesome !

45
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:51,570
Ok.

46
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:53,540
Grade 'A' gossip

47
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:56,020
Right now, Rendal, CFO,

48
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:58,341
resigned, nobody knows why.

49
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:01,071
Are you kidding ?
Everyone knows why !

50
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:03,612
You don't know ? Oh ok,
check this out, all right.

51
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:04,681
- So here's the story.
- Yeah ?

52
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:08,752
So Rendal is nailing his secretary, 
right ? and she's totally incompetent.

53
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,920
Really ? here we go. 
Buckle up, it's going to be a bumpy one.

54
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,531
We're talking blond incompetent. Right?

55
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:17,540
Like ten words a minute...

56
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,343
talking !

57
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:20,951
Well to be fair blondes,
brunettes, sit down,

58
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,521
there are lot of dumb people out there.

59
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:24,231
They are women, right ?

60
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:27,013
I didn't say it !

61
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:27,870
I said it !

62
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:31,893
And then, suddenly for no reasons,

63
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:36,122
this bimbo blows the whistle on the
whole thing, just to be a bitch !

64
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,453
What have I told you
about the bleep button !

65
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:39,312
Hey,

66
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:41,822
What has 2 thumbs and hates Todd Packer ?

67
00:03:41,957 --> 00:03:43,123
This guy !

68
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:44,881
Meant to ask you

69
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:49,190
Do you think you can get someone to drive
me around because of the DUI situation ?

70
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:50,470
Bad boy !

71
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:52,852
Ryan ?

72
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:55,870
Come on kid, let's go.

73
00:03:56,338 --> 00:04:00,641
- Man, Todd Packer could do anything.
- Except pass that breathalyzer.

74
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:09,382
-  You a big William Hung fan?
- Why does everybody ask me that ?

75
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:10,851
Who the hell is that ?

76
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:19,281
- I'm really excited to meet you mum !
- You are ?

77
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:21,562
My mum is coming in to visit.

78
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:25,422
She lives likes 2 hours away,
and she doesn't have a cell phone,

79
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,590
which is cool, cause it's kind of
adding some suspense to my day

80
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:32,553
I keep looking over at the
door, hoping she'll walk in !

81
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:35,851
I've decided to show her around,
she really wants to meet everybody.

82
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,173
Oh yeah ? good, cause
I've a lot of questions.

83
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:40,671
- Oh really ?
- Yeah.

84
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:46,552
As a child, did Pam show any traits that would
endorse her future career as a receptionist ?

85
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:51,540
Hey, send me that link
to the monkey sex video,

86
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:54,720
- I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
- Yes !

87
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:59,271
Forward it like it's hot. Old school !

88
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:02,721
- Michael ?
- Yes Tobby ?

89
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:06,913
I need to talk to you in your office,
it will just take 2 seconds.

90
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,260
Literally 2 seconds ?

91
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:13,221
Tobby is an HR, which technically
means he works for corporate.

92
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:16,701
So he's really not a part of our family.

93
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,650
Also he's divorced, so he's
really not a part of his family.

94
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:24,060
The full story is that Rendal resigned
because of sexual harassment,

95
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:28,203
so corporate asks me to do a 5 minutes review
of the company sexual harassment policy.

96
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:29,593
No no Tobby. No.

97
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:33,801
- It's really not a big deal, Michael.
- It is a big deal, it's a big deal !

98
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:39,302
What are we supposed to do ? Scrutinize
every little thing we say and do all day ?

99
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:40,652
I mean, come on !

100
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,803
And then corporate is
gonna send in a lawyer.

101
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:43,360
What ?

102
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:47,633
- Just to fresh you on our policy.
- No. What ? No.

103
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:51,492
Okay, what is a lawyer
going to come in and tell us?

104
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:55,180
to not send out hilarious
e-mails, or not tell jokes ?

105
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:58,602
Maybe not some of them,
maybe not inappropriate ones.

106
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,343
There is no such thing as inappropriate
joke, that's why it's a joke !

107
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:05,021
Everyone, hello ? everyone, hi !

108
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:07,663
Sorry to interrupt I know you're all busy,

109
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,992
and the last thing you want
is for a major interruption.

110
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,730
But  Tobby has an announcement,

111
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:16,772
that he insists on making right now in
the middle of the day, so take it away.

112
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:18,280
Yeah, ok.

113
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,900
Corporate would like us to do a 5 minute review
with the company sexual harassment policy,

114
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:24,421
so I'll go over that later.

115
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:26,540
I wish you luck Tobby, I really do.

116
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:28,941
But you are going to have
a mutiny on your hands and

117
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,921
I just can't wait to see
how you handle it.

118
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:36,841
A guy goes to a 5$ lady of the night,

119
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:39,842
and he gets crabs.

120
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:42,550
So the next day
he goes back to complain.

121
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,770
And the woman says :
"Hey, it was only 5$,

122
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:51,901
what did you expect, lobster ?"

123
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:55,560
This is what's at stake.

124
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,660
Time to bring out the big guns.

125
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:07,511
I'm heading down to the warehouse,
where jokes are born.

126
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:11,722
Find a killer joke that will just blow 
everybody away at the ceminar later.

127
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:15,521
And, remind them, what
is great about this place.

128
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:17,763
So, here they are !

129
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:21,761
Guys, wondering if I could
get your help for something.

130
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:24,323
I'm looking for a new joke to tell,

131
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:28,311
and it needs to be just killer,
and it does not need to be clean.

132
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:31,603
- What you've got ?
- Like a joke ? A knock knock joke?

133
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,671
Yeah, no. Better, better than that.

134
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,011
Let's have the type you
guys tell all day.

135
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:41,142
Well, those are some awful tight pants
you have on, where did you get them like

136
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:43,621
Q ueers'r'us ?

137
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:44,982
Boys'r'us !

138
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:48,721
All right, but you know,

139
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:51,291
a joke but not necessarily
at my expense.

140
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,633
- so work out.
- Well we can see...

141
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:55,620
all of your business coming
around the corner ok ?

142
00:07:55,637 --> 00:08:00,840
you need to, hide that? Good thing you 
don't have a lot of business to start with.

143
00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:03,180
Oh ok. That was still about me.

144
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:06,376
Hey, so you don't have the
biggest package, don't feel bad !

145
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:08,730
- I don't feel bad !
- I think he feels bad.

146
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,456
- No I don't !
- You look like you feel bad !

147
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,100
- Your little package !
- Well, you know,

148
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:14,850
not exactly what I was looking
for but thanks guys ! Thank you !

149
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:14,822
<i>Little package !</i>

150
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:17,593
- You look good in those pants.
- he got it from his mama !

151
00:08:20,137 --> 00:08:23,023
So remember intent is
irrelevant. And that's it.

152
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,142
Pam ?

153
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:29,270
I just wanted to say that just
my mum is coming in today.

154
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:33,162
- MILF !
- Thanks Kevin.

155
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,641
Usually the day we talk
about sexual harassment,

156
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:38,173
is the day that everyone
harasses me as a joke.

157
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:39,233
She's coming in today,

158
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,232
and maybe just don't joke around
about that stuff in front of her.

159
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:44,143
- Great point.
- Thank you.

160
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:49,201
In fact, basic rule of thumb : let's just act
everyday likes Pam's mum coming in.

161
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:53,443
All right that's it, anybody has
any questions about anything,

162
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:54,672
you know where I sit in the back.

163
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:59,832
- Hi ! Is it over ?
- Yes.

164
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:02,741
- I can go over it with you.
- I know, I know it's good.

165
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:07,450
It is not over until it's over.
Did he tell you everything ?

166
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:06,021
<i>It's over.</i>

167
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:11,690
Obviously he didn't because you
all still look relatively happy,

168
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:13,262
Albeit, bored.

169
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:16,110
Do you realize what we
are losing ? seriously ?

170
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:17,420
E-mail forwards ?

171
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:19,243
Exactly !

172
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:23,870
Can we afford to lose e-mail
forwards ? Do we want that ?

173
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:26,871
I hate them, you send
me these filthy e-mails,

174
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:30,311
and you say forward them to
10 people or you'll have bad luck.

175
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:31,781
Give me a break.

176
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:37,012
Stanley, how about that hot
picture you have by your desk ?

177
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:39,480
Centerfold in a catholic schoolgirls outfit ?

178
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:44,002
I mean it is hot, it is sexy and
it turns him on and I will admit,

179
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:46,840
that best part of my
mornings is staring at it.

180
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:48,452
But what ? are we gonna just take it away ?

181
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,551
That is my daughter, she goes
to Catholic girls school,

182
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:53,401
I'm taking it down right now.

183
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:58,190
- What about office romance ?
- Office relationships are...

184
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:01,231
never a good idea so
let's just try to avoid them.

185
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:04,680
But if you already have one,
you should disclose it to HR.

186
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:08,372
All relationships ?
even a one night stand ?

187
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:11,041
I think the old honor system was fine.

188
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:15,693
For example I have never slept with an
employee, and believe me I could have.

189
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:18,560
- Yeah Meredith !
- No no Catherine,

190
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,280
remember her ? remember how hot she was ?
She would have definitely slept with me.

191
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:20,640
<i>Yes !</i>

192
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:24,421
- She wasn't that hot !
- Yes she was !

193
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:26,211
- Damn it Kevin ! come o...
- Ok, you know Michael...

194
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:28,640
I'm in an office relationship.

195
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:32,411
It's special. She's nice, she's shy,

196
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:36,310
she's actually here if you wanna
meet her, hold on one second.

197
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,133
Oh my god ! put on a shirt !

198
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,920
put on... I told you
that you'd be on camera !

199
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:46,651
I'm sorry she's European.
No I told you that you'd be on camera !

200
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,043
Stop it !

201
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:51,731
What if Pam was a lesbian ?

202
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:57,270
What if she brought her "partner" into
work ? will that be crossing the line ?

203
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:57,793
No !

204
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:00,140
What if they made out,
in front of everybody ?

205
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,563
- Well that would be...
- at home !

206
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:06,000
and I told everybody everything about it.

207
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:09,853
- Okay I'm lost.
- Okay, well then let's act it out !

208
00:11:09,968 --> 00:11:15,002
Pam, you will be girl A,
and girl B will be...

209
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:16,843
Okay we'll use the doll.

210
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:21,261
Pam ? Pam ?

211
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:27,452
I wish Todd Packer was here,
cause he would love this.

212
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,041
I wonder if anybody else
would like to join us.

213
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,281
Ooh, it's coming out of my mouth.Hey !

214
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:35,270
We have to watch Tobby's video,

215
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:38,271
that he's, uh, showing us in order
to brain wash us and now I was wondering

216
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:39,962
if anybody like to join-in ?

217
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:43,673
It could be fun ! Got microwave pizza.
What do you say ?

218
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:45,890
- Jim ?
- No thanks I'm good.

219
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,720
That's what she said.

220
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:51,351
- Pam ?
- My mother's coming.

221
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:55,783
That's what she said. No,
but ok, well suit yourself.

222
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,580
- Hey Tobby.
- Hey Dwight.

223
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:02,652
You said that we could come
to you if we had any questions ?

224
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:03,491
Sure.

225
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,233
Where is the clitoris ?

226
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:17,390
On a website it said at
the crest of the labia.

227
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,400
What does that mean ?

228
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,821
What is the female vagina look like ?

229
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:29,293
Technically I am in human resources,

230
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:32,292
and Dwight was asking
me about human anatomy.

231
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:39,020
I'm just sad the, public school system
failed him so badly.

232
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:42,332
You know, maybe when you get
really comfortable with each other,

233
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:48,092
- you can ask for that.
- Good. Good. And...

234
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:51,412
-  I should get back to work.
- Ok.

235
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,882
<i> In today's fast paced business climate,</i>

236
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:57,541
<i>it can sometimes be hard to know
when a comment or an action,</i>

237
00:12:57,656 --> 00:12:58,830
<i>crosses the line.</i>

238
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,502
<i>Let's take a look at a couple of
scenarios and ask ourselves : </i>

239
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,841
<i>"Where is the line ?" </i>

240
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,402
Natural Redhead

241
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,250
<i>-Hey Rach !
- Hey Joe, Mike !</i>

242
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:15,813
<i>Hey settle a bet : are
you a natural redhead ?</i>

243
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:20,791
Oh my... ! Hey, stop the video !
Stop it right this, stop it right there !

244
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:24,820
That's the girl from that thing,

245
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,162
I banged this girl, right here.

246
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:29,520
- That's her ?
- Yes, this is the one, you remember ?

247
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:31,032
- The party ?
- You banged her ?

248
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:33,280
Right here, you are a naughty girl !

249
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:36,753
Ok, hypocrite, she is a hypocrite !

250
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,321
That is such a scam ! Ok !

251
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:44,572
Yes, yes I did. Ok. But we
can talk about that later.

252
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:48,302
You are not gonna believe this, the
girl in the video we are watching,

253
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:51,681
the corporate gave us,
Darryl banged her !

254
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:58,690
And he's about 90% sure.

255
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:05,571
Don't ever let this little bitch drive you
 around town we got lost for half an hour.

256
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,512
I don't have any DUI so
I can drive myself, but thanks.

257
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:12,722
Where is Michael Snot ?
Sniffing some dude stone ?

258
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,121
Probably.

259
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:20,132
So you are the lawyer, Mr. OMalley,
I know a lot of lawyer jokes.

260
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:23,903
- I love lawyer jokes.
- Well it's probably cause you don't get 'em.

261
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,583
When I said before that
I was king of forwards,

262
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:29,882
you gotta understand that
I don't come up with these stuff.

263
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:32,040
I just forward it along.

264
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:37,131
You wouldn't arrest a guy who is just
delivering drugs from one guy to another.

265
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,100
You seem a little bit agitated
Michael what's the problem ?

266
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:46,272
The problem is that I am the boss
and apparently I can't say anything.

267
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:53,113
Well, that's true, in a way,
you can't say anything.

268
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:55,472
Where's the line ?
Where's the line Jan ?

269
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,962
- Do you need to see the video again, Michael ?
- No, I've seen the video.

270
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:00,573
- He talked the all time.
- No I didn't !

271
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:03,302
What ?

272
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,370
Attention everyone, hello ?

273
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,263
Yes, I just want you to know
that this is not my decision,

274
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:18,932
but from here on out, we
can no longer be friends.

275
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:27,613
And when we talk about things here, we
must only discuss a work associated things.

276
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:31,682
And you can consider this
my retirement from comedy.

277
00:15:32,157 --> 00:15:36,111
And in the future if I want to
say something funny, or witty,

278
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:39,310
or do an impression,
I will no longer,

279
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:42,612
ever, do any of those things.

280
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:47,941
- Does that include "That's what she said" ?
- Yes.

281
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:50,612
Well that is really hard. 

282
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:53,822
You really think you can go all day long ?

283
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:59,493
Well you always leave me
satisfied and smiling so.

284
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:02,103
That's what she said !

285
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,750
Michael, Michael !

286
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:05,901
- Come on !
- Michael please.

287
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:07,493
- Here he is.
- Please.

288
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:09,902
Good one !

289
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:12,673
You would have done the same,
you just didn't think of it first.

290
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:16,590
Michael  please, that's
not my sense of humor.

291
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:21,893
Hello ! Jan, Mr. OMalley,
this is my lawyer James P. Albiny,

292
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:21,873
<i>Your what ?</i>

293
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:25,191
I believe you may recognize
his face from the billboards.

294
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:28,223
He's specializes in free speech issues.

295
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:32,170
And motorcycle head injuries, workers
comp., and die appeal lawsuits.

296
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,641
- This guy does it all.
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.

297
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,753
Michael, Mr. OMalley is your lawyer.

298
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:38,992
What ?

299
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:42,422
Mr. OMalley is our corporate lawyer,

300
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:45,053
we have him on retainer,
to protect the company,

301
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,122
as well as upper level
management, such as yourself.

302
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:51,902
So I'm not in trouble ?

303
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,712
I am so used to being the bad boy.

304
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:57,312
I am so used to fighting corporate,

305
00:16:57,347 --> 00:17:00,622
that I forget that I am corporate,
upper management.

306
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,960
They hooked me up with
an attorney, to protect me.

307
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:11,950
You can't be too careful about what
you say, more money more problems.

308
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:15,272
Ok well let's get you out of here James !

309
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:17,293
I think we're under an hour still so...

310
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:19,681
Yeah but I did a lot of paperwork
at home before I got here !

311
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:22,253
We'll talk about it later,
thanks for coming in !

312
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:30,382
- Hello.
- Oh my god !

313
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,211
- Hi honey !
- Hello !

314
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,280
I love my mum.

315
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:37,353
Okay, that's probably the
most obvious statement ever.

316
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,340
- This is all yours ?
- Yeah, I'm in charge of this...

317
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:43,073
Oh my godness.

318
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:51,782
So a guy goes home and tells his wife :

319
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:54,160
"Honey, pack your bags,
I just won the lottery"

320
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:57,012
she was "Oh my god ! that's
incredible, where are we going ?"

321
00:17:57,028 --> 00:18:01,130
He goes "I don't know where you're
going just be out of here by five !"

322
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:09,721
- This is where I used to keep my computer.
- All right, I remember with the picture.

323
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:13,321
Yeah, yeah but I switch stuff
around because I actually needed

324
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:16,003
like more room for organization.
- Sure.

325
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:20,672
- This is like... organization station.
- Oh there he is.

326
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,770
- Hey handsome.
- You look great.

327
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:26,093
Oh thank you. So,
we're ready for dinner ?

328
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:29,421
Well, you know, actually
I kind of need to stall a bit

329
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:33,191
but it's ok because I am
very used to get in time.

330
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:38,332
I'm gonna go wait in the parking lot and
what kinda tunes you want for the ride !

331
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:41,942
- You're classical or oldies ?
- Anything is fine.

332
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:44,583
Ok, well see ya !

333
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:50,782
- So, which one is Jim ?
- Mum !

334
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:53,342
- Just wanted to know.
- No !

335
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:55,413
- All right. Ok.
- Ten minutes,

336
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:57,611
- Then we can go to dinner.
- I'll make myself busy.

337
00:18:57,956 --> 00:19:00,653
There's this guy he's
at a nymphomaniac convention,

338
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:03,553
And he is psyched 'cause all
these women are smoking hot

339
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:06,843
perfect tens except for this
one chick who looks a lot like...

340
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:10,362
- Phyllis ?
- No no no no, that crosses the line.

341
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:15,923
- Ex-squeeze me ?
- Not you. Kevin,

342
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:19,743
just unwarranted it, hostile
work environment Kevin.

343
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:22,213
- Packer said it.
- No, you said it.

344
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,453
He pointed, a point is not a say.

345
00:19:24,587 --> 00:19:28,381
Look, Kevin, we are a family here,

346
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:31,663
and Phyllis is a valuable member
of that family, like a grand-mother.

347
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:34,043
- I'm the same age as you Michael.
- Well I don't know about that.

348
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:36,383
- We were the same high school class.
- Well, I've late birthdays,

349
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,730
usually Septembers a cut off point...

350
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:42,213
You know what you just
crossed the line, ok ?

351
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:46,140
There is a line, and you went
over it, and you must be punished.

352
00:19:46,157 --> 00:19:47,590
So go to your corner.

353
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,150
- You mean where my desk is ?
- Yes to your corner, go.

354
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:55,271
Ok, I have a lot of
work to do anyway.

355
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:58,783
Oh my ! They really got
to you, didn't they ?

356
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:03,651
They didn't get to
me, I got to them.

357
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:09,412
I am still the same old Michael
Scott, new and improved.

358
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:13,473
You know what ? I love Phyllis, 

359
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:18,670
you know what else ?
I think she is gorgeous,

360
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:23,370
I think she is an incredibly,
incredibly attractive person.

361
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:26,173
Come here, give me a kiss, come on !

362
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:31,601
Michael come on you don't have to worry
I'm not gonna report you to HR.

363
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:31,572
<i>I'm not worried.</i>

364
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:37,022
You know what, the only thing I am
worried about, is getting a boner.

365
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:40,420
Good work today everybody.

366
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,640
Times  have changed a little.

367
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:52,242
And even now we're still a family
here at Dundler Mifflin, families grow.

368
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:58,751
And at some point the daddy can't
take a bath with the kids anymore.

369
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:00,880
I am upper management, and

370
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:05,543
it would be inappropriate for
me to take a bath with Pam,

371
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:07,982
as much as I might want to.

372
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:09,573
He said what ???



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
