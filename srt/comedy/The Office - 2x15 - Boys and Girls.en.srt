1
00:00:00,444 --> 00:00:03,197
So, I'm happy to be here.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,232
It's very nice to see all of you.

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,068
You're all looking well.

4
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:08,980
Today's a Women in the Workplace thing.

5
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:12,568
Jan's coming in from corporate,
to talk to all the women about...

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,507
I don't really know what.

7
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:18,003
But, Michael's not allowed in.

8
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:20,055
She said that about five times.

9
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,482
Women today, though we
have the same options as men,

10
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:27,250
we often face a very
different set of obstacles...

11
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:28,906
In getting there, so...

12
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:30,920
- Hey, what's going on ?
- Michael, I...

13
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,276
Yeah, you know what ? I just...

14
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,821
I just have a few things I wanna say.

15
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:37,770
- What are you doing ?
- Just hear me out.

16
00:00:38,657 --> 00:00:40,703
What is more important than quality ?

17
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:41,972
Equality.

18
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:44,602
Now, studies show that today's woman,

19
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:47,810
the Ally McBeal woman,
as I call her, is at a crossroads.

20
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:49,971
- Michael...
- And, no, just...

21
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,940
You have come a long way, baby.

22
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:54,703
But, I just wanna keep it within reason.

23
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:57,002
- They did this up in Albany.
- You are not allowed,

24
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,530
- in this session.
- And they...

25
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:00,411
Into a lactation room,
which is disgusting.

26
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,441
Now you're really not
allowed in this session.

27
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,791
- I'm their boss, so I feel like...
- I'm your boss.

28
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,342
- Anybody want any coffee ?
- We're fine, Michael.

29
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:13,742
We just need you to leave please.

30
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:15,291
<i>Women in the Workplace.</i>

31
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:19,550
Yeah, translation, I have been banned
from my own conference room.

32
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:21,581
So that Jan can talk in
secret to all the girls.

33
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,033
Oh, sorry, "Women of the Workplace."

34
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:25,321
About what ? I don't know.

35
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:27,561
Clothes, me...

36
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:32,182
Ladies, I am so, so sorry.

37
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:34,230
Can we... start again ?

38
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,342
- We were on such a roll. I really,
- Jan.

39
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:38,331
- apologize for that.
- Yes, Pam.

40
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:40,461
- Michael's still at the door.
- Michael!

00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:14,723
<i>So, one obstacle is</i>

46
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:17,691
<i>how assertiveness is perceived
differently in men and women.</i>

47
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,961
<i>Men, who are assertive
tend to be admired.</i>

48
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,993
<i>They're called...anyone ?</i>

49
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,613
That's a terrible idea.

50
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:27,290
What is ?

51
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:29,072
Them, in there all together.

52
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:32,563
They stay in there too long, they're
gonna get on the same cycle.

53
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,532
Wreak havoc on our plumbing.

54
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,421
Everyone, guys.

55
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,141
Circle up, please.

56
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:42,103
Come on over. Bring your chairs.

57
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,913
Toby, come on over.

58
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:47,022
You're a guy... too. Sort of.

59
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:49,412
Let's do this.

60
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,541
<i>Well, first of all, I,</i>

61
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,841
<i>just wanna warm up a little bit.
Let's just clap.</i>

62
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:55,061
Let's just clap, ready ?

63
00:02:58,488 --> 00:02:59,712
That's what I'm talking about!

64
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,630
I don't know what you're
doing here, Michael.

65
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:04,142
Just having a little "Guys in the
Workplace" kind of thing.

66
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:07,703
Why can't boys play with dolls ?

67
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:10,611
Why does society,

68
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:14,323
force us to use urinals when sitting
down is far more comfortable ?

69
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:16,513
Can you please do this
somewhere else, Michael ?

70
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,083
We have no where else, Jan. This...

71
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:21,052
We could do it in the warehouse.

72
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:23,042
Dwigt. Excellent idea.
Go to the warehouse.

73
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,583
Fine. Actually... Perfect.

74
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,393
Perfect!  You know what ?

75
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:29,520
There is another side to
this place, gentlemen.

76
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:33,543
And I know we all love our cushy
jobs and our fun, exciting office.

77
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,953
But do you realize that underneath us,
there is another world.

78
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:38,613
The warehouse world.

79
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:43,663
A world that is teeming with sweat,
and dirt and life.

80
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:45,661
Life.

81
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:47,743
The bowels of the office.

82
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:51,862
<i>These guys are down there.
They are real men doing real man's work.<i>

83
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,160
<i>We are going to learn
how a warehouse works.</i>

84
00:03:58,056 --> 00:03:59,960
I think this is gonna work out great.

85
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:03,823
Because managing the warehouse
is a very important part of my job.

86
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:06,270
And I haven't been there in months.

87
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:32,732
Remember on "Lost",
when they met the Others ?

88
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,903
I'm so sorry about that.

89
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:41,290
So where are we ?
Pam, are you okay taking notes then ?

90
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,401
Please ? Thank you very much.

91
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:46,241
So let's meet the warehouse !

92
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,663
Let's get some shots.

93
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:50,942
Pan around there.

94
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,990
This is Darryl, one of our
warehouse staff.

95
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:58,160
- Darryl, what is your biggest fear ?
- My biggest fear is that  someone will

96
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,561
distract us from getting
all the shipments out on time.

97
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:04,201
Darryl is actually the foreman
here, and not Roy. Which is cool.

98
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:06,660
There's Roy, ridin' the big rig!

99
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:10,882
so Roy is actually going to be
marrying Pam sometime this summer.

100
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:14,753
And, uh, she's our receptionist.
Sort of a BrAngelina thing.

101
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:16,120
Why ?

102
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:19,603
BrAngelina is the Brad
Pitt and Angelina.

103
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:22,542
- I don't understand.
- Roy, Roy and Pam. It's a Ram.

104
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,143
It's a Ram thing.

105
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:27,353
I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam.

106
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:30,361
I bet he'll try to beat you up.

107
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:32,482
Thanks for the heads-up, Kev.

108
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,500
I got your back if he does.

109
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:39,433
But try to stay out of it.

110
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:43,052
Just  in case there's somebody down
here who shouldn't be.

111
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,501
A little "Good Will Hunting" situation.

112
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:47,093
All right, troops.

113
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:50,770
This is an important day.
A big day.

114
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:55,543
Now, you may look around
and see two groups here.

115
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:58,230
White-collar, blue-collar.

116
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:01,241
But I don't see it that way.
And you know why not ?

117
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:04,163
Because I am collar-blind.

118
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:07,710
Why don't we go around
the table and all say

119
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,461
something that we know we're good at.

120
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:12,261
I will start. I am good
at public speaking.

121
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:16,841
Hi, I'm Meredith, and I'm an al
Good at supplier relations.

122
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:18,611
Great. Phyllis.

123
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:23,411
I'm good at computer stuff.
E-mails, spreadsheets, all that.

124
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:25,123
Really ?

125
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:27,961
- I don't know. I thought that...
- No, okay, stop.

126
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,211
You know, I've seen some of your 
spreadsheets. And I almost always...

127
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:33,620
<i>I don't know how I fit
in with these women.</i>

128
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:35,341
Here.

129
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,080
Or with Jan.

130
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,191
I mean, we get along great. Fine.

131
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:45,253
I guess the person I have the
most in common with is.

132
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,243
Jim.

133
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:49,102
Halpert.

134
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:52,872
Heard there's a rumor
going around about, you know

135
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,972
you used to have a crush on Pam and...

136
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,802
-  Oh, no, no, no.
- No, no. It's cool.

137
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:59,340
'Cause I know you're a good guy,
and I know that that crush

138
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:03,012
ended a long time ago,
so, you know. We're cool, right ?

139
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,243
Yeah. No, yeah, definitely.

140
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,393
You know, it's great with
me, 'cause that way...

141
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,223
I'm glad she has a friend at work
she can get through the day with.

142
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:14,030
That way she's not all, "Bah, bah,"
you know, when she gets home.

143
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:17,340
- I like talking to her too.
- So, we're cool, right ?

144
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,096
- Yes, yeah.
- Good. All right.

145
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,450
- Cool, man.
- Sweet.

146
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:31,986
Hey, Mike, look. How about
we go upstairs, too ?

147
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,223
- Learn how an office works.
- Oh, well...

148
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:36,071
We can both switch places for the day.

149
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,343
Yeah, you know what ? I don't, you're...

150
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:40,931
My job sucks compared to this.

151
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,992
I don't think you'd like it up there.
Guys !

152
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:45,550
You wanna start unloading the truck ?

153
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:48,352
Okay, let's go.

154
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:49,923
Step up.

155
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:52,510
Check this out. Look at that.

156
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:53,932
Look at that.

157
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:56,671
"Hello, how are"...
O-kay.

158
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:00,892
That's great.

159
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:02,910
That is good stuff.

160
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:06,352
In five years, I'd like to be,
five years sober.

161
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:09,030
That is an excellent goal.

162
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,543
Four and a half.

163
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:13,721
I'll tell you one thing. I am not
going to be one of those women

164
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,773
schlepping her kids around in a minivan.

165
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,403
Great.

166
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:20,031
I want an SUV with three rows of seats.

167
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:24,330
Well, I'll be honest. One of the
goals of these women seminars

168
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:27,222
is to feel out if there's any standouts.
Women who could be valuable

169
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,551
addition to our corporate life.

170
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,631
Michael wants us to bond.

171
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:36,830
So we need topics for conversation.

172
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:38,950
- Ponies.
-  No.

173
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:40,443
How about rainbows ?

174
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:42,510
- No.
- Flowers.

175
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,012
<i>- No.
- Make-up.</i>

176
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,782
Hey. You're gonna hurt yourself.

177
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,073
- Stand clear.
- Mike, get off of the lift, please.

178
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:50,242
- I'm fine, I'm fine. I m' fine
- Come on, now.

179
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:53,572
Would you...look. Michael.

180
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:01,050
We'll get somebody
to clean that up.

181
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,590
We're da ones that gotta clean that up !

182
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,690
Damn it, Michael !

183
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:07,752
We have to have this thing serviced.

184
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:10,191
So, guys gripe session.

185
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,512
Here we are.

186
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:15,352
Now, we definitely live
in different worlds,

187
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,473
but we have a lot in common.

188
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:20,750
We even like the same girls, some of us.

189
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:22,653
And that's gonna happen.

190
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,802
You know, we're guys. So...

191
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:26,822
Hey... do you want me to go ?

192
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:30,193
No... why would I... you could.

193
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,932
- I'll go.
- Stay, or...

194
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:36,031
And a big, walk-in closet.

195
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,782
- That's part of my dream too.
- Oh, me too.

196
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:40,452
Great. Great.

197
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:44,173
And, Pam, what about you ?
What is your dream ?

198
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,442
Well,

199
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:49,010
I always dreamed of a
house with a terrace upstairs.

200
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,090
Plant flowers on it, stuff like that.

201
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:53,463
Since I was a girl.

202
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:57,862
More seriously, though,
a husband that I love.

203
00:09:58,816 --> 00:09:59,902
Roy.

204
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,911
And... I love to draw.

205
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:06,420
And I, I did a little in college.
And I'd still love to do something,

206
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,970
where I could work with art
or graphic design in some way.

207
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:10,120
She's real good.

208
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:14,912
You know, the company is offering
a design training program in New York.

209
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,921
I have a job right now.
So I can't really take time off.

210
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,812
It's, it's only on weekends.
And then a few weeks in New York

211
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:24,071
But I'm sure that I could ask
corporate to help you out.

212
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:26,251
It's just that the weekends
aren't good because...

213
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:29,552
There's always a million
reasons not to do something.

214
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:35,073
Let's start with the warehouse.

215
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:37,003
What bothers you as guys ?

216
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,291
- You know ?
- My priority is safety.

217
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:39,743
Okay.

218
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:43,183
So it really bothers me when somebody
comes in here speeding around on a lift,

219
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:46,481
playing with it like a toy.
It kind of gets under my skin, okay ?

220
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:49,590
- Don't-don't shush me.
- No, I...

221
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,342
- That was just
- That bothers me too.

222
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:54,231
- Pam shushes me, it drives me crazy.
- I hate shushing, you know ?

223
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:59,343
That's the thing. What, okay.
What is our... beef as human men.

224
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,553
You know, that's a good
question, Hasselhoff.

225
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:06,522
- Okay. All right.
- What bugs us ?

226
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,602
Good. Guys raggin' on each other.

227
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:11,692
That's what guys do.
And we love it.

228
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:15,272
ll right, let's talk about... clothing.

229
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:19,263
I'm excited about today.
I love girl talk.

230
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:22,910
Dress for the job you want,
not the job you have.

231
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,080
You can use your clothing to send
a message about your ambitions

232
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:29,963
by wearing clothes that reflect
what you aspire to be.

233
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:32,061
<i>I'm not gaining anything
from this seminar.</i>

234
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:35,222
I'm  a professional woman.
The head of accounting.

235
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,010
I'm in the healthiest
relationship of my life.

236
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:41,262
I just think it's insulting that
Jan thinks we need this.

237
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:45,032
And apparently...
judging from her outfit...

238
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,951
Jan aspires to be a whore.

239
00:11:48,468 --> 00:11:50,880
I hate it when girls insist
on taking them out

240
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:54,062
to new restaurants every weekend
night, and then they're like,

241
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,011
"When are we gonna go
on a date date ?"

242
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:57,950
Exactly !

243
00:11:58,075 --> 00:11:59,192
That's so hard.

244
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:02,303
Yeah, and then they make you drive
'em to church the next morning.

245
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:04,432
Like, gas ain't free !

246
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,462
Yeah, on our salaries, man,
what do they expect, you know ?

247
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:10,922
What, "take us out every weekend" ?
You know what I mean ?

248
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,202
- We're not millionaires. No you don't.
- I feel you.

249
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:15,730
You don't feel us. How can you ?
You-you know what ?

250
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,632
- Not literally.
- You say we're the same,

251
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:19,873
but we get compensated 
very differently.

252
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,581
- Yes.
- We work the same hours as you,

253
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,252
And you just said we work a lot harder.

254
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:26,670
- Uh, you do, so...
- But we get paid a lot less.

255
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,741
- Word.
- Like, next to no benefits.

256
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:30,843
I know. God, what is that ?!

257
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,972
- Exactly!
- It blows, it blows, man!

258
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:35,583
You know, this would not
happen if we had a union.

259
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:37,683
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Yeah, no.

260
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:40,051
- Absolutely, that's what we need.
- Man, see.

261
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:41,680
That's what I been sayin', man.

262
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:43,191
We need to do this finally.

263
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,953
Is that necessary ? 'Cause you already
sort of have a union of guys.

264
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,950
It's more than necessary,
Mike. We need this

265
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:53,020
Roy, you still have that card
from the dock workers union ?

266
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,793
- In my truck.
-  Man, hook him up. Come on, man !

267
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:59,580
Yeah. You know what, I think the
problem is the chicks.

268
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,892
- Union, yeah !
- The problem is the chicks.

269
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,611
And you gotta blame them.

270
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:07,871
Are you with us, Mike ?

271
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:10,313
Welcome to the warehouse.

272
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:18,620
Another issue is inequality of
pay between men and women.

273
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:21,461
I'm sure that all of you have
delt with that before.

274
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:23,920
This is important.
Ladies, take a breather.

275
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:28,823
Jan... I, wanted...

276
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,952
Can I help you ?

277
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:37,001
I wanted to say that the guys downstairs
are thinking about forming a union.

278
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:39,553
- What ? A union. I'm not.
- And they have some good points.

279
00:13:39,606 --> 00:13:42,430
Part of my job is knowing
how to talk to women.

280
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:45,540
Let's... be... rational... here.

281
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:47,903
What are the pros, what are the cons ? 

282
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:50,680
The cons are that everyone will
lose their job, Micheal. Everyone.

283
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,063
Office, warehouse.

284
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:56,993
What do you think the...
pros... are... here ?

285
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:59,892
Don't talk to me that way,
please. Just...

286
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,403
They're gonna wanna
hear this from you.

287
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,140
You got yourself into
this, Michael, so

288
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,960
- Well, we're bonding down there.
- It's too bad.

289
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:10,233
I just don't wanna have to tell them
something they're not gonna wanna hear !

290
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,190
Come  on, Jan.
After all we've been through.

291
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,951
- Michael, Michael.
- We have a history.

292
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:16,101
- Michael.
- We have a history. Between us.

293
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:21,313
Don't say another word.
Get... yourself...downstairs.

294
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,791
I'm just saying that we have
something... okay, whatever.

295
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,253
You know what ?

296
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,593
We could get this done a lot quicker
if we formed a type of assembly line.

297
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,412
This here is a
run-out-the-clock situation.

298
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:37,640
Just like upstairs.

299
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,200
Sports metaphors are one
of the ways women feel left out

300
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,002
of the language of the office.
Now, I know this might sound silly,

301
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,121
but many women ask to go over it.
So... fumble means...

302
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:48,672
- <i>Mistake.</i>
- Slip.

303
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:49,560
Right.

304
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:53,292
Par for the course is a golf term,
it means right on track.

305
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:58,933
Below par means worse.
Wait. That's doesn't make sense.

306
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:00,623
What about second base ?

307
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:04,012
Like if Michael said
he got to second base with you ?

308
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,701
- Does that mean he closed the deal ?
- Excuse me ?

309
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:09,902
- I mean, that's a baseball term, right ?
- I don't know what.

310
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:13,192
Michael was... talking about

311
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,080
- Hey.
- Hey!

312
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:24,731
How's it going down there ?

313
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:28,312
It's a complete. Well, actually it's
exactly what you'd expect, so...

314
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,290
- How are the girls ?
- Good.

315
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,863
We watched a video
about our changing bodies.

316
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:35,532
- Did you really ?
-  No.

317
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:36,852
Almost.

318
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:42,510
Something kind of cool. There's this
internship in graphic design

319
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:46,651
that Jan was telling us about.
She made it sound, like, really great.

320
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,952
Nice. Well, what's it all about ?

321
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,831
I think you should do it.
That's great!

322
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:54,192
It's really cool.

323
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:57,753
Cold front comin' in to the warehouse !

324
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:01,242
Better put on your ski boots !

325
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:08,132
Happy New Year Darryl !

326
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,621
Hey, Darryl!

327
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,453
You ever done this ?

328
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:17,782
Are you married ?

329
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,600
- I'm divorced.
- That must have been hard.

330
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:21,822
It was. Yes.

331
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:24,312
You were probably feeling
really depressed and sad.

332
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,803
And that's why you did
that thing with Michael.

333
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:29,650
I think you should all spend a little
more time about your careers

334
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,701
and less time on personal stuff.

335
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:34,130
I think we're all okay with
the balance we've struck.

336
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:36,781
At least you don't have kids.
You have no kids, right ?

337
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,063
- Thank God.
-  Okay

338
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,603
Let's take five.
I think we could all use five.

339
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:45,731
How can someone so beautiful be so sad ?

340
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:50,943
- Hi.
- Did you take care of the situation ?

341
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:52,933
Yeah, yeah. Yes.

342
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:55,623
- I... I have... essentially
- Excuse me.

343
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,473
- Yes, I've taken...
- Excuse me.

344
00:16:57,488 --> 00:17:00,283
I'm told that there's been some
interest in forming a union.

345
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:01,912
And that Michael supported it.

346
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:03,533
Obviously he's not a friend of yours,

347
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:06,171
because he didn't tell you the facts
So let me.

348
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:09,051
If there is even a whiff of
unionizing in this branch,

349
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:11,882
I can guarantee you the branch
will be shut down like that.

350
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:15,083
They unionized in Pittsfield, and we
all know what happened in Pittsfield.

351
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:17,721
It will cost each of you
a fortune in legal fees.

352
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,932
Union dues, and that'll be nothing
compared to the cost of losing your jobs.

353
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:24,761
So I would think long and hard
before sacrificing your savings

354
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:27,490
and your futures just to send a message.

355
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:30,900
If you have any further questions,
you can direct them to...

356
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,231
to Michael.

357
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:38,901
<i>Dreams are just that.</i>

358
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:41,942
<i>They're dreams. 
They help get you through the day.</i>

359
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,742
<i>Like the thing about
the terrace. It's nice.</i>

360
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,183
But, um...

361
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:49,591
I don't know. It was just something
I read in this book when I was 12.

362
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:53,963
The girl in the book has a
terrace outside of her bedroom...

363
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:57,620
<i>And she planted flowers on it.
And I just loved that.</i>

364
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,243
<i>Just always kind of stuck with me.</i>

365
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,601
So, you're not doing it.

366
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,032
How  did you know ?

367
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,462
Why not ?

368
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:10,000
Just not... no big reason.

369
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,870
- Just a bunch of little reasons.
- Come on.

370
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:16,603
Roy's right. There's no guarantee
it's gonna lead to anything anyway.

371
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,592
Roy said that ?

372
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:22,193
What ? You have something
you wanna say ?

373
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:27,161
You gotta take a chance
on something sometime, Pam.

374
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:30,231
I mean, do you wanna be a
receptionist here, always ?

375
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:33,063
Oh, excuse me!
I'm fine with my choices.

376
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,833
You are ?

377
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:37,351
Yeah.

378
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:39,661
It's impractical.

379
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:43,412
I'm not gonna...
try to get a house like that.

380
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:46,031
They don't even make
houses like that in Scranton.

381
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:48,510
So I'm never gonna...

382
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:58,162
Just gonna push this over there!

383
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,950
This is not a good idea right here.

384
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:06,262
Easy does it, okay.

385
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:13,422
Pizza.

386
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:15,751
Great equalizer.

387
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,333
Rich people love pizza.
Poor people love pizza.

388
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,781
White people love pizza.
Black people love pizza.

389
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:24,022
Do black people like pizza ?

390
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:35,771
Hey.

391
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:39,873
Look guys, I'm sorry.

392
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:43,343
Sometimes, Jan... can be such a bitch.

393
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:48,672
Hey, watch it, watch it.
We have a relationship.

394
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,831
Thank you to our host.

395
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:52,542
Hey Michael !

396
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:55,000
This ain't over.

397
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:03,903
Excellent.

398
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:07,700
Is it good to be back ? Yeah. I mean,
I love the guy stuff, But...

399
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:10,010
To run an office,
you need men and women.

400
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:12,932
You know why ? Because you need to have

401
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:16,162
that crazy sexual tension
to keep things interesting.

402
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,730
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.

403
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,262
Hold please.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
