1
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:05,892
What ?

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,186
Oh, nothing.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,752
Pam's on vacation.

4
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:11,941
And she gets back tomorrow.

5
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:13,283
So, it'll be nice to see her.

6
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:15,715
It'll be nice. And...

7
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:17,733
She set a date for the
wedding with Roy.

8
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:20,137
June, summer.

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,748
So, that'll be nice.

10
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:24,560
And that's that.

11
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:28,796
What ?

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,340
Oh, nothing.

13
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:36,816
Jim's been looking at me
kind of a lot all week.

14
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,563
I would be creeped out by it.

15
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:42,813
But it's nothing compared to
the way Michael looks at me.

17
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,343
Spamster.

18
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:33,701
Pam, plus Spam, plus...

19
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,232
- Hamster.
- Right.

20
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,611
Welcome back.
How was your vacation ?

21
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:39,001
- It was great.
- Yeah ? Did you get lucky ?

22
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:41,640
Oop ! Boink.

23
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,150
Roy and I just got back
from the Poconos.

24
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:46,670
I get ten vacation days a year.

25
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:50,283
And I try to hold off taking
them for as long as possible.

26
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:53,972
And this year I got to the
third week in January.

27
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:57,791
I am Pam. Spicoli guy.

28
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:00,793
Oh, God.

29
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,602
He needs numbers.
Okay.

30
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:05,570
Whoa ! God !
Yuck ! Yuck, yuck, yuck.

31
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,280
- What ?
- Yuck ! Wow ! What happened in there ?

32
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:11,473
- I don't know.
- There is stink in there. My God !

33
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:14,840
- What is- what is that ?
- Oh, I don't know.

34
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:17,361
- Is that a bird ?
- No, I don't think it's a bird.

35
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:21,090
Oh, God, how could that happen ?
How could...

36
00:02:21,526 --> 00:02:23,682
- Right in the middle of the carpet.
- What's going on ?

37
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,220
Somebody vomited right in the
middle of the carpet in my office.

38
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,222
- I don't think that's vomit.
- Check it out.

39
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:32,912
- Me ?
- Check it out.

40
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:37,521
Don't be a wuss. Just get, no,
I'm not holding your coffee.

41
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:39,883
- Tell me what it is.
- Oh, that's a real bitch.

42
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:41,370
What is it ?

43
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,561
- Michael.
- What is it ?

44
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:45,000
No, just tell me what it is.

45
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:48,832
Michael, I gotta get outta here !
I can't hold my breath that long.

46
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,662
Open the door up.

47
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:52,943
It smelled terrible.

48
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:59,471
Oh ! Phew !

49
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:01,561
Oh, no !

50
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:04,972
I cannot believe a pipe
burst and left that there.

51
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:07,002
- That's no burst pipe.
- Well, how do you know that ?

52
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:08,173
What is it then ?

53
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:10,822
Hey guys ! Somebody making soup ?

54
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:17,493
Here she comes.
All clean ? Great.

55
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:22,732
- Too stinky.
- That is worse.

56
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:26,152
She probably scrubbed it
into the fibers of the carpet.

57
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,142
Total permeation.

58
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:30,170
I am a big fan of Fear Factor.

59
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,251
I'm a big fan of anything
Joe Rogan does, actually.

60
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:36,433
So, this is sort of like
my audition tape.

61
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:42,723
I can't stand it

62
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:45,223
I can't stand it in here another second.

63
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:50,921
Hey, welcome back.

64
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:51,943
Thanks.

65
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:54,493
So, how was the resort ?
Did you ski a lot ?

66
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:56,393
A little.

67
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:57,900
Good.

68
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:00,701
What's going on here ?

69
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,030
What ?

70
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:05,663
I did not do that.

71
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,840
That sounds disgusting.

72
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,792
It wasn't me.

73
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:14,473
It wasn't me

74
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:16,343
It  was not me.

75
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:27,452
Hey, Jim !

76
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:30,640
I thought that we would be desk
buddies while they change my carpet.

77
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:34,621
That might be a little difficult
with the one computer.

78
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:38,052
But there's definitely
a desk open in the back.

79
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:39,443
Yeah..

80
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:44,363
- Which I guess I'll be taking.
- No, seriously. I don't mind sharing.

81
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,983
No, no, no. Seriously.
I'll be in the back.

82
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:52,643
Hey, Kelly.

83
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:55,852
Are you moving back here ?

84
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:58,611
Just for the day while
Michael's at my desk.

85
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,703
Because Toby used to sit there.

86
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:03,091
But then he had to move over
there because of an allergy.

87
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:07,280
Allergy to...the desk ?

88
00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:09,123
Weird.

89
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:14,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ol' bullpen.

90
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,840
- The ol' bullpen.
-  Don't hate me.

91
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:19,643
- Okay.
- This is great.

92
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:21,301
Yeah.

93
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,423
The pressures of my office are insane.

94
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:24,970
I just- you couldn't understand.

95
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,093
But you guys have it easy out here.

96
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:29,430
You know, I used to sit right here ?

97
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:31,280
- No way.
- Yeah

98
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:34,030
And who had your office ?

99
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:35,872
Ed Truck.

100
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:39,313
Ed Truck was the manager before me.

101
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,000
Horrible. He hated fun.

102
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:44,172
It was like, Ed Truck is walking
toward us.Stop having fun.

103
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,730
Start pretending to do work.

104
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:49,631
What a jerk. He's...You know what ?

105
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,810
I swore to myself, that if I ever got to
walk around the room as manager,

106
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:56,060
people would laugh when
they saw me coming.

107
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,930
And would applaud as I walked away.

108
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:02,240
I'm serious, my closet
doors will not shut.

109
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:05,860
I mean, it only takes so long to measure
to make sure that clothes will hang up.

110
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:08,091
Cause  aren't all
hangers like, that big ?

111
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:10,752
So I don't understand why the closet
engineer didn't think of that.

112
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:12,551
So now I'm doing this new thing,

113
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:14,561
where I just leave piles
of clothes on the floor.

114
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:16,952
And I walk around the
piles to get an outfit...

115
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:18,870
You know who used to sit at that desk ?

116
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:21,470
That guy Miles who quit
to form his own company ?

117
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,361
Todd Packer.

118
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:24,172
- No.
- Yeah.

119
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,471
- I thought he was out on the road.
- He was, but...

120
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:31,671
That desk was empty.
He'd come in and sit there sometimes.

121
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:37,482
When I was in training, many years ago.
Not so long ago.

122
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:41,422
I worked side by side with a
fellow named Todd Packer.

123
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:45,453
And together we rocked the office.

124
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,491
Packer and I once spent a
whole day with our pants off.

125
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:54,751
And when people noticed,
we convinced them that they were crazy.

126
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:57,910
I would gladly pay you Tuesday 
for a hamburger today.

127
00:06:58,078 --> 00:06:59,653
Excuse me one second please.

128
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,193
What is it that you need
right now that can't wait,

129
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:04,541
until I'm off the phone
with a customer ?

130
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,262
A customer. Well, sound the alarm.

131
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:09,533
Okay.

132
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,152
Another time, Packer held this guy's
head in the toilet for like a minute.

133
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:16,321
Guy had no sense of humor about it.
Probably why he wasn't hired.

134
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,980
- What did you hit me for ?
- Oh, Charlie Horse.

135
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,500
- What ?
- Charlie Horse !

136
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:23,391
-  You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.
- Okay !

137
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:28,103
Once, as a joke Packer banged
every chick in the office.

138
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:30,553
It was hysterical.

139
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:36,151
Beyonce, pink the color,
Pink the person, hot dogs,

140
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:38,330
Basically anything that is awesome.

141
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:40,240
- Sno-cones...
- Hey, Jim.

142
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:43,682
Michael wanted me to ask you
how to raise your desk chair.

143
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:47,580
- It's the lever on the side.
- That's what I told him. Thanks.

144
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:55,786
Oh, my God. He is so cute.

145
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,530
Would you talk to him for
me and see if he likes me ?

146
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,756
- No, I don't think I can.
- Please Jim. Please, please, Jim

147
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,002
Please, please ? He's so cute.
I like him so much.

148
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:10,041
And I would do it, but I'm too shy.
Please, Jim ? Please, please.

149
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:13,731
Please ? Please, Jim, please ?
Please, please ?

150
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,433
- Dwight.
- Michael.

151
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:20,942
- Let's set up accounting.
- What ?

152
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:24,571
Old-fashioned raid.
Sales on accounting.

153
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,510
Follow my lead.

154
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:31,120
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Michael.

155
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:32,883
- What's up ?
- Hey, Dwight.

156
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:44,471
Come on, come on !

157
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,440
- Sales rule !
- Yes !

158
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:50,352
Yeah, yeah !

159
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:55,233
- Should we help them pick up their stuff ?
- No, no... 

160
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,802
We don't do that.
We don't do that.

161
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,902
Watch out Pam. You're next.

162
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:00,722
You're gonna throw my
things on the ground ?

163
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:02,633
Maybe.

164
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:05,222
<i>What happened in Michael's
office is wrong.</i>

165
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,303
I understand it. It makes sense.

166
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:13,192
But it's, but it was still wrong.

167
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:16,150
Why would somebody ruin
a perfectly good carpet ?

168
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:19,671
I don't know.

169
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,912
Could have been done out of hate.
Could be done out of love

170
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:27,881
It could be completely neutral.

171
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,121
Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.

172
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:33,092
Well, she doesn't do a
very good job, obviously.

173
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:37,801
because my office still reeks
like you would not believe.

174
00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:41,050
I hate her.

175
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:45,372
You know what ?
I am beginning to think,

176
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:49,551
that what happened to my carpet was
an act of terrorism against the office.

177
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:53,001
Against the office.
The only thing that makes sense.

178
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,482
Hello, am I the 107th caller ?

179
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:01,400
Hello, Rock 107, am I the 107th caller ?

180
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:07,450
Hello, Rock 107,
am I the 107th caller ?

181
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:10,583
I'm totally going to
win us that box set.

182
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,783
Stop. Stop it.

183
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:17,530
Stop it.

184
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:20,972
Don't.

185
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:22,850
Don't.

186
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:24,930
I need to make a sales call.

187
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:29,050
- Please.
- All right.

188
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,161
Am I the 107th caller ?

189
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:43,672
<i>That is so soon.</i>

190
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,493
<i>We'll go back. We'll go back
in a couple weeks, baby.</i>

191
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:49,523
- <i>Yeah, right.</i>
- <i>Okay, maybe another month then<i>

192
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,650
Maybe for, like, Presidents'
Day or something.

193
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:53,500
<i>We can do a three day weekend.</i>

194
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:58,573
<i>And maybe when we get back, I can call
in sick, and get a four day weekend.</i>

195
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:01,831
<i>And when I wake up, I feel fine.</i>
</i>It's so weird.</i>

196
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:04,690
<i>And I just hate it. 'Cause
I try to go to bed at, like,</i>

197
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:05,933
- <i>Are you kidding?</i>

198
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:07,300
Hi, guys.

199
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:09,980
We haven't finished getting things
in order from your last visit.

200
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:11,763
- I'm just walking around.
- Were you ?

201
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:12,781
Well, yeah.

202
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,711
It's just that we're really
swamped over here Michael.

203
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:16,502
I'm not ? Why would you say that ?

204
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,261
Because I'm having fun ?

205
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:21,421
You guys just are working for
the weekend, aren't you ?

206
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,833
I'm working for the week.
Sales team.

207
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,003
Listen to me.
This is what we're gonna do.

208
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm gonna up the ante
a little bit literally.

209
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:32,913
Right here, I'm going to
put a crisp $100 bill.

210
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:35,761
The person with the most sales at the
end of the day gets to keep the cash.

211
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:37,513
Sound good ?

212
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,871
70, 80, 1, 2, 3.

213
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:42,853
$83. Still a lot of money.

214
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,350
And I'm going to...
I'm going to leave it right over here.

215
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:49,962
Where everybody can see it.

216
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:54,950
I will be taking Jim's clients today,
because he is not here.

217
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:58,023
And out of sight, out of the contest.

218
00:11:58,178 --> 00:11:59,832
Let's see who winds up
with the cash, shall we ?

219
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:03,253
- You're going to compete against us ?
- Oh, it is on, Phyllis ! It is so on !

220
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,911
- It is so on !
- God, this is gonna be fun.

221
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:10,291
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us.

222
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,252
So you have 40 boxes going out.

223
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,480
And I will deliver those
personally in the Sebring.

224
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:27,450
Very good. Nice doing business
with you. Thank you.

225
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:29,813
Yes !!

226
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,521
Yeah. Read it and weep.

227
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,423
Look at that. Look at me Phyllis.

228
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,530
Oh, what is that ?
That's my sale.

229
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,451
- What what's that ? What you doing ?
- Nothing.

230
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:50,370
- I think he's dancing.
- No, just...

231
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,621
- That was definitely not dancing.
- You know what, guys ?

232
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,270
It's none of your concern.
It was official business. So just...

233
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:57,471
- Paper business ?
- Yeah, paper business. Is this done ?

234
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,860
N ope.

235
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:01,932
Extreme Home Makeover puts
together a house in an hour.

236
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:04,611
If you were on that crew,
you'd be fired like that.

237
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,731
Somebody did something
bad to Michael's carpet.

238
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:11,332
Maybe that's all we need to know.

239
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:20,013
- Who do you think did it ?
- Are you kidding ?

240
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:22,660
- I thought it was you.
- Really ? I thought you.

241
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:32,452
This was no act of God.

242
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:35,380
A person did this.
A person who works in this office.

243
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,590
Maybe all of them.

244
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:39,651
You know what ?

245
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:43,531
Today is not a good
day for a sales contest.

246
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,780
- We're-we're not doing this today.
- That doesn't seem fair.

247
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:50,320
You want to talk about fair ?
Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?

248
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:54,103
You explain to me how that was fair. And
I'll explain to you how this is fair.

249
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:58,243
Plus, I just, I think that picking today
was sort of taking advantage.

250
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:02,050
- But you're the one who picked today.
- I am a victim of a hate crime.

251
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:04,790
Stanley knows what I'm talking about.

252
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:09,022
- That's not what a hate crime is.
- Well, I hated it, a lot, okay ?

253
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:11,011
I, you know what ?

254
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:14,811
If the guilty person would just come
forward and take their punishment...

255
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,010
We'd be done.

256
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:23,350
Very well. Then you're all punished.

257
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:25,692
- What's our punishment ?
- You're all on time out.

258
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:29,121
Just sit there quietly.

259
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:41,550
Hey.

260
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:43,501
- What's up ?
- Nothing much.

261
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:45,760
Let me ask you something.

262
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:47,773
It's actually a little awkward.

263
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:50,803
What do you think of Kelly ?

264
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,912
I don't know.

265
00:14:53,265 --> 00:14:55,351
Depends if you like a little junk in...

266
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:58,861
She's really cool.

267
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:01,263
- Are you interested in her ?
- Yeah, totally.

268
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,253
- Really ?
- Did she say something ?

269
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,033
She said lots of things.

270
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:08,051
Do you know if she's looking
for a long-term thing ?

271
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:10,861
Or if she'd be cool just, hanging out ?

272
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,223
- I have no idea.
- Can you find out ?

273
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:17,171
Yeah.

274
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:19,131
Sure.

275
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,582
Long-term, definitely.

276
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:26,142
Fall in love, have babies,
spend every second together.

277
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:27,661
But don't tell him that, okay ?

278
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:29,770
Just tell him I'm, like,
up for anything.

279
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:31,550
I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows.

280
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,421
Do you remember Ed Truck ?

281
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,813
Sure, he hired me. 
How's he doing ?

282
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:38,142
How would I know ?

283
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,342
I thought you might.

284
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,643
My biggest fear is turning into him.

285
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:44,242
Michael, you should have
much bigger fears than that.

286
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:46,902
I wasn't talking literally, Creed.

287
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:49,162
Yeah, being buried alive would be worse.

288
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,893
Happy ? Why am I talking to you ?

289
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:52,452
Ed !

290
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:54,173
Hi,  thanks for meeting me.

291
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,800
Must be kind of neat coming back.

292
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,673
Yeah. Shall we go upstairs ?

293
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:02,710
Well, honestly, Ed, I really don't
want to be up there right now.

294
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,092
So, what's the problem with my pension ?

295
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:08,022
No, no, no. You're good.

296
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:09,543
It was clerical. You're good.

297
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,750
Well, somebody did
something in my office.

298
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,943
And I now think that they did it on
purpose and it was directed at me.

299
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:17,253
But what was done ?

300
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:20,101
I didn't get a good look at it.

301
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,661
But it smells horrible.

302
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:26,211
Yeah, somebody once
did that in my office.

303
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:27,801
- Really.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:28,801
Well, that figures.

305
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:32,761
So how did you deal with
people not liking you ?

306
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,310
You can't expect to be
friends with everybody.

307
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:37,733
- sure I can.
- No.

308
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:39,802
They'll always think
of you as a boss first.

309
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,651
Not necessarily.

310
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:43,900
You can love a boss
like you do a father.

311
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:45,661
I'm not sure that ever happens.

312
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:48,963
Well, ok, different management styles.

313
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:51,220
Why can't your workers be your workers ?

314
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:54,092
Family be your family,
your friends be your friends ?

315
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:57,943
Last week, I would've given a
kidney to anyone in this office.

316
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:01,811
I would have reached right into my
stomach and pulled it our for them.

317
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:03,483
But now, no.

318
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,562
<i>I don't have a relationship with
these people that I thought I did.</i>

319
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,860
<i>I hope they ask.</i>

320
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:12,313
<i>So they can hear me say " : no."</i>

321
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:15,280
I only give my organs
to my real friends.

322
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:17,431
Get yourself a monkey kidney.

323
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:22,061
Hey, Brenda, this is,
Jim Halpert from the boat.

324
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:25,513
And I got your number from
the corporate directory.

325
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:29,012
And, well, I'm assuming that
you probably gave it to them,

326
00:17:29,057 --> 00:17:32,643
because you wanted
me to ask you out, right ?

327
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,331
So give me a call back.

328
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,560
You can get my number
from said directory,

329
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:42,690
Or just check your email
cause I just sent you one.

330
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,921
Yikes. Give me a call back, I hope.

331
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:51,563
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

332
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:55,681
You just asked a girl out on the phone !

333
00:17:57,988 --> 00:17:58,783
Yup.

334
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,472
Yes.

335
00:18:02,676 --> 00:18:06,593
<i>Hello. Yes. I'm looking for a gay
nerd named Michael Scott.</i>

336
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,952
Who is this ?
How did you get this number ?

337
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:11,102
<i>Your mom, you gay nerd.</i>

338
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:15,930
Oh my God. Packer. Packster !
Wacky Pack. How you doing ?

339
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:19,401
<i>Hey, listen, did you get
that package I left for you ?</i>

340
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:23,742
No. Did anybody see a
package here today ?

341
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,901
- No, how big was it ?
- <i>It was pretty big.</i>

342
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:28,393
- Really ?
- Yeah.

343
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:31,172
Did you see a big package ?
Where did you leave it ?

344
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:33,972
- <i>Left it in the middle of your office.</i>
- Realy ?

345
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:36,732
Guys, did you see a big
package in my office ?

346
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:40,622
You mean the thing ?

347
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:45,363
Are you kidding me ?

348
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,750
- <i>Special delivery.</i>
- That was Packer !

349
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:53,630
You are dead, you are dead, my friend.

350
00:18:53,738 --> 00:18:58,082
That is hila- Oh God !
Of course it was you.

351
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:02,913
- <i>Sit on the throne, Michael.</i>
- Yeah, yeah !

352
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,080
Oh my God. It was Packer.

353
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:09,553
It takes an advanced sense of humor.
I don't expect everybody to understand

354
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,342
It was done out of love,
just like I thought.

355
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:16,242
It's, God, these people are so,
these are good people

356
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:20,771
We have fun. We just have fun.

357
00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:24,490
I'm just so sorry that
I threw the thing out.

358
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:39,092
- <i>You have 7 unheard messages.</i> 
<i>- Hey, Jim, It's Pam.</i>

359
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:41,183
<i>I keep looking up to say
something to you,</i>

360
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,192
<i>and then Michael's there.
And it's horrible.</i>

361
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:46,450
<i>Anyway, I'm bored. Come back.</i>

362
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:50,181
<i>Hey, guess what. I moved my computer
so I can't see Michael's head.</i>

363
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,981
<i>It's working.
I think I can have a career,</i>

364
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:54,502
<i>as a very specific type of decorator.</i>

365
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:58,832
<i>Sudoku. Level, moderate. Time,
18 minutes. Suck on that Halpert.</i>

366
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:02,203
<i>I'll  transfer you.</i>

367
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,860
<i>Dunder Mifflin this is Pam.</i>
<i>Hold, please.</i>

368
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:07,641
<i>Dunder Mifflin, this is. Okay, sorry.</i>

369
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,640
<i>Michael was standing at my
desk and I needed to be busy.</i>

370
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:12,213
<i>Or who knows what would've
happened. So thank you.</i>

371
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:15,673
<i>What's that word we made up for when
you have a thing stuck in your shoe ?</i>

372
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:19,183
<i>Anyway, I have a thing
stuck in my shoe.</i>

373
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:20,991
<i>I have a chance to sneak
out of here early,</i>

374
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:23,900
<i>And I'm not messing this
up so I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

375
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,672
<i>Calling from my cell phone.</i>

376
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:28,392
<i>I don't know if you guys figured out
who did that to Michael's carpet yet.</i>

377
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:31,662
<i>But I have a theory that it involves
an interdepartmental conspiracy.</i>

378
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:34,862
Everybody in the office.
We need to talk.
