1
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:05,010
- Hey.
- Hello.

2
00:00:06,576 --> 00:00:08,023
- Jim !
- What's up buddy ?

3
00:00:08,097 --> 00:00:10,320
This is not funny.
Why is my stuff in here ?

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,483
Wow, that's weird.

5
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:13,541
Ooh, dollar for a stapler,
that's pretty good.

6
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:15,864
Yeah, well, I'm not paying
for my own stuff, okay ?

7
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:18,967
I know you did this 'cause you're
friends with the vending machine guy.

8
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:20,503
- Who, Steve ?
- Yeah, Steve.

9
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:22,844
What do I want ?
What do I want ?

10
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:25,732
It's a pencil cup.

11
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,178
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's my pencil cup.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,081
Um, I don't think so,
I just bought it.

13
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:34,498
Uh, I think so, and you're
going to hand it over to me.

14
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:35,891
I love these.

15
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:37,952
Okay, fine.

16
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:40,840
My wallet ?

17
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:43,691
Um, oh, there it is. J1.

18
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:47,150
I don't have any...

19
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:49,522
Here you know what,
you can have some nickels.

20
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:54,081
5, 10.

21
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:59,410
15, 20, 25...

22
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,902
Saison 2 - Episode 11
Booze Cruise

23
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:31,323
Transcripts : Nikki (twiztv.com)
Synchronisation : El Uploador

24
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:34,193
Hello everyone.

25
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:35,563
Morning Michael.

26
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:37,141
Where are we going
this afternoon ?

27
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:43,652
Last week, Michael sent out
this mysterious memo.

28
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,060
"It's time for our first quarter
camaraderie event."

29
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,253
"So pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush."

30
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:49,470
"Rubber-soled shoes..."

31
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:51,010
"...and a ski mask."

32
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,322
A ski mask and a swimsuit ?

33
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,480
So that he can have us rob a bank,

34
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:58,581
and then escape through the sewers.

35
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:00,732
And brush our teeth.

36
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:03,640
Yeah ?

37
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,523
- Michael...
- Stanley...bo banley.

38
00:02:06,705 --> 00:02:08,613
- I need to know-
-  Banana fana fo fanley.

39
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,272
- What we're doing.
- Me mi mo manley.

40
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:12,151
- You said bring a toothbrush.
- Stanley.

41
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:13,580
Is this an overnight ?

42
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:18,570
Maybe. The suspense is just
so exciting, isn't it ?

43
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:21,252
Should my wife tell her boss
she's not coming in tomorrow ?

44
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:23,741
- Maybe, I don't know.
- Not maybe, yes or no.

45
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:25,372
Well, no, but...

46
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:28,800
okay, don't spoil it for everybody.
All right ? But, we...

47
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:34,443
are going on a booze cruise
on Lake Wallenpaupack.

48
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:37,962
In January ?

49
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,390
It's cheaper.

50
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,091
This is not just another party.

51
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:44,950
This is a leadership
training exercise.

52
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:46,833
Right ?

53
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:48,861
I'm going to combine
elements of fun

54
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:52,020
and motivation and education
into a single,

55
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:54,211
mind-blowing experience.

56
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,730
It is now time to unveil the
destination of this year's retreat.

57
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:04,772
We are going on a harbor cruise
of Lake Wallenpaupack.

58
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:13,600
- It's a booze cruise !
- All right !

59
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:17,062
I have a test for business school
tomorrow night.

60
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,862
Is it okay if I skip the cruise
and study for that ?

61
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,782
No, this is mandatory.

62
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,572
But don't worry, you know what ?
You're going to learn plenty.

63
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,241
This is going to turn your
life around, Ryan.

64
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,842
I'm already in business school.

65
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,070
- Wait, Michael.
- Yeah?

66
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,473
Why did you tell us to bring
a bathing suit ?

67
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:35,132
To throw you off the scent.

68
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:36,723
Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.

69
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:39,292
Well, just keep the tags on
and you can return it.

70
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:40,723
I took the tags off already.

71
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:42,193
Well, that's not my fault, okay ?

72
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,553
Just-we're not going to pay
for a bathing suit.

73
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:46,893
Okay. I know what
you're all thinking.

74
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:48,701
Who is this smart little cookie ?

75
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,463
Her name is Brenda...

76
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:52,662
...something,
and she is from corporate.

77
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:55,813
And she is here, like you,
to learn from what I have to say.

78
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,742
I am a great motivational speaker.

79
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:01,440
I attended a Tony Robbins
event by the airport last year,

80
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:02,881
and...

81
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,730
It wasn't the actual course.
You have to pay for the actual course.

82
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:10,733
But, it talked about
the actual course.

83
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:16,123
And I've incorporated a lot
of his ideas into my own course.

84
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:19,021
Leader...ship.

85
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:24,981
The word ship is hidden inside
the word leadership.

86
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:27,591
As its derivation.

87
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:31,903
So, if this office is
in fact a ship,

88
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,591
as it's leader...

89
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:36,751
I am the captain.

90
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,290
But...We're all in the same boat.

91
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:41,520
Teamwork.

92
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:45,290
Last  year, Michael's theme was
"bowl over the competition."

93
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,182
So, guess where we went ?

94
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,250
Now, on this ship
that is the office,

95
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:54,921
what is the sales department ?

96
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:57,441
Anyone ?

97
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,481
How about, the sales department
is the sails ?

98
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:04,251
Yes, Darryl, the sales department
makes sales. Good.

99
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:09,170
Let me just explain. I see the sales
department as the furnace.

100
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:12,270
- A furnace ?
- Yeesh, how old is this ship ?

101
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:13,910
How about the anchor ?

102
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:15,660
What does the furnace do ?

103
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,770
All right, let's not get hung up
on the furnace.

104
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,890
This just...

105
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:21,460
It's the sales. I see the sales
department are down there,

106
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:24,600
they're in the engine room and they
are shoveling coal into the furnace,

107
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,312
right ?

108
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:27,072
I mean who saw
the movie "Titanic" ?

109
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:29,133
They were very important
in the movie "Titanic".

110
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,411
Who saw it ?
Show of hands ?

111
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:32,881
Not really sure what movie
you're talking about.

112
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:35,040
- You sure you got the title right ?
-  "Titanic" ?

113
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:37,363
I think you're thinking of
"The Hunt for Red October".

114
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,580
No, I'm...
Leo DiCaprio, come on !

115
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,500
Michael stands in the front
of the boat

116
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:44,022
and says he's king of the world
within the first hour,

117
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:46,060
or I give you my next paycheck.

118
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:49,711
Michael,  everyone in the
engine room drowned.

119
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,990
No, thank you, spoiler alert.

120
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:54,212
You saw the movie,
those of you who did.

121
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:57,980
They're happy down there
in the furnace room.

122
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:00,782
And they're dirty and
grimy and sweaty.

123
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:03,933
And they're singing
their ethnic songs. And...

124
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:07,241
Actually, that might be warehouse.

125
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,760
- What ?
- The, no, no.

126
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:11,821
No I didn't...

127
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,243
okay, well, the...

128
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,590
Okay, in a nutshell what
I'm saying is leadership.

129
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:19,460
We'll get, we'll talk more
about that on the boat. Ship.

130
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:21,411
Aye, aye, Captain.

131
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:25,690
<i>A three hour tour.
A three hour tour.</i>

132
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:27,752
<i>Pam, you are Mary Ann.</i>

133
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:30,283
We have...
The Professor and Ginger.

134
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,790
Welcome aboard.

135
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:34,471
Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey.

136
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:35,931
Uh, the native.

137
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:37,790
Sometimes they come
from neighboring...

138
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:40,672
Oh, uh, we have, uh...
one of the Globetrotters.

139
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:42,190
I am the Skipper,

140
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,581
and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.

141
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:46,693
- Cool.
- Actually, I'm the Skipper.

142
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:49,021
- But you can be Gilligan.
- Oh, I'd rather die.

143
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,663
Hi, I am Michael Scott.

144
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,558
I am the Captain of this party.

145
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,891
I'm Captain Jack.
I'm Captain of the ship.

146
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,538
I'm also captain of anyone
who sets foot on this ship.

147
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,630
Hi, welcome aboard.

148
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:00,011
Okay.

149
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:02,213
In an office, when you are
ranking people,

150
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:04,962
manager is higher than captain.

151
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:08,423
Oh a boat, who knows ?
It's nebul-ose.

152
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,192
Hey look.

153
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:14,092
I'm king of the world !

154
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,743
Okay, all right.

155
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:25,861
Welcome aboard.

156
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:27,761
I am your captain, Captain Jack.

157
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:32,340
And I am Regional Manager of
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott.

158
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:33,542
Welcome, welcome.

159
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:35,251
- Okay, so, um...
- Okay, so.

160
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:37,651
Please. The, uh, life preservers.

161
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:40,792
They are located underneath the seats
all along the perimeter of the boat.

162
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:41,812
But don't worry,

163
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:44,182
you are not going to be needing
life preservers tonight.

164
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:46,703
Well, we might just be, okay ?
Please let me finish, okay ?

165
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:47,793
Thank you.

166
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:50,912
So, the Coast Guard requires that
I tell you where the safety exits are.

167
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:54,143
Now, on this ship, it's very easy.
Anywhere over the sides.

168
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:59,012
Not only am I your ship's captain,
I am also your party captain !

169
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,743
Woo, we're going to get it
going here in just a few minutes...

170
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,133
And I'm your party captain too !

171
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:05,613
And you are going to put on
your dancing shoes later on.

172
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:07,320
- Hey, Mike, Mike.
- So we are gonna...

173
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:09,480
- Uh, if you don't mind.
- Rock it !

174
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:11,260
- What ?
- Please, okay ?

175
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:14,651
If the boat's a-rocking,
don't come knocking.

176
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:15,530
- Michael.
- Yup.

177
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:17,033
Uh, your company employees

178
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:19,271
are not the only people
on the boat tonight, okay ?

179
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:21,160
We're all going to have
a good time tonight.

180
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:24,101
Why don't you let me and
my crew do our job ?

181
00:08:24,188 --> 00:08:25,862
You just sit back and
have a good time ?

182
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:27,502
- Okay, yup.
- All right ?

183
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:32,231
You guys, it's like we're in high
school and we're at the cool table.

184
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:34,363
- Right ?
- Yeah.

185
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,081
Pam, were you a cheerleader ?

186
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:39,621
No, she was total little Miss
Artsy Fartsy in high school.

187
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:41,892
She wore the turtleneck
and everything.

188
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,031
That's hilarious.

189
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,141
It's not hilarious, but...

190
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:47,610
- Where'd you go to school ?
- Bishop O'Hara.

191
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,012
Piss slop who cares-a ?

192
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,312
We played you.

193
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:53,302
You, you really look familiar.

194
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:55,911
Did you, uh, you cheered
for them, didn't you ?

195
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:57,083
Mmm, no.

196
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,101
Yes, I did.

197
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:03,153
A-W-E... S-O-M-E,

198
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:06,981
awesome, awesome is what we are
we're the football superstars.

199
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,682
-  A-W-E
- I remember that !

200
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,071
- S-O-M-E
- We crushed you like 42 to 10.

201
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:12,832
-  Having fun ?
- Yeah.

202
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,540
Everybody's really nice.

203
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,713
Good, well, that is what
Scranton is all about.

204
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,082
Not like you "New Yawkers."

205
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:23,870
When are you going to
start the, uh, presentation ?

206
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:26,270
Well, I already sort of started it
back at the office.

207
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,211
And on the dock
with the Gilligan thing.

208
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:30,141
So, right now, I was thinking.

209
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:32,283
Yes. Okay !

210
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:35,292
Listen up, all you,
Dunder Mifflinites.

211
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:39,890
I would like to talk to you
all about life preservers.

212
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:45,090
Now,  one important life preserver
in business is IT Support.

213
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:48,140
Not now, Mike, we're
doing the limbo !

214
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:52,283
Ha, ha, that's right, partiers.
It's time to limbo, limbo, limbo !

215
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,910
- So, okay.
- All right !

216
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:56,291
I need a volunteer to come up here
and hold my stick.

217
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,851
- Huh, who's it going to be ?
-  Me.

218
00:09:57,886 --> 00:09:59,131
- Okay.
- Me, me, me.

219
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:00,372
Me, me, me.

220
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:03,590
Usually it's a woman.

221
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,692
- I'm stronger.
- Hey, I got an idea.

222
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:08,670
How would you like to steer
the ship, Dwight ?

223
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,803
Keep us on a steady course.

224
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,830
Keep a sharp eye out,
I'm counting on you.

225
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,523
I was the youngest pilot
in Pan Am history.

226
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:17,040
When I was four,

227
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,040
the pilot let me ride
in the cockpit,

228
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,470
and fly the plane with him.

229
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,300
And I was four and I was great !

230
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:25,520
And I would have landed it,

231
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,572
but my dad wanted us
to go back to our seats.

232
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,130
All right, all right.
That was great,

233
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,663
now it's time for
the dance contest !

234
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:38,711
Why don't we do that after
I do my presentation and...

235
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:41,091
Nope ! Dance contest !

236
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:44,410
All right, we'll have a motivational
dance contest. Hit it !

237
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:48,581
Yeah, okay. Dancing.

238
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:53,663
It is a primal art form used
in ancient times

239
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:56,520
to express yourself with the body.

240
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:00,252
And communicate.

241
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,920
Sometimes you have
to take a break

242
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:15,023
from being the kind of boss

243
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:17,163
that's always trying
to teach people things.

244
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,293
Sometimes you just have to
be the boss of dancing.

245
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:34,263
What do you do with
a drunken sailor

246
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:37,430
What do you do with
a drunken sailor

247
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:41,102
What do you do with
a drunken sailor

248
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:44,430
Ear-ly in the morn-ing

249
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:48,690
Hey, come inside and talk to me.

250
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:52,193
I can't. Do you want us
to run aground woman ?

251
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:57,150
Snorkel shot, snorkel shot !

252
00:11:57,536 --> 00:12:00,120
Snorkel shot, snorkel shot !

253
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:01,521
Snorkel shot !

254
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:06,561
Who's next ?
Come on, Pammy, come on, come on !

255
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,490
- I'm not doing that.
- Come on !

256
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:10,190
Tequila !

257
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,303
That's what I'm talking about.

258
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:16,091
Hey, why don't we find like,
a quieter place to hang out ?

259
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,792
You know what, I've just gotta
wait for Darryl to do his shot.

260
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:21,290
Just a minute.
Come on, Darryl, Darryl !

261
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,423
It's getting kind of rowdy
down there.

262
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,822
Yeah.
"Darryl, Darryl, Darryl."

263
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,652
Sometimes, I just don't get Roy.

264
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:34,630
Well.

265
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,491
I mean, I don't know.

266
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:49,603
So.

267
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,650
What's it like dating
a cheerleader ?

268
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:20,591
I'm cold.

269
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:34,011
So, what's this presentation
all about ?

270
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,611
Ah, see, this is of
general interest.

271
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:39,650
It is about...priorities.

272
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:43,203
And making decisions,
using the boat as an analogy.

273
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,563
What is important to you ?

274
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,241
If the boat is sinking,
what do you save ?

275
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:50,011
- Women and children.
- No, no.

276
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:51,732
Salesmen and profit centers.

277
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:53,652
That's a stupid analogy.

278
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:58,262
O-kay, well obviously you don't
know anything about leadership.

279
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:02,313
Well, I was the captain of a
PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat

280
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:03,491
during Desert Storm.

281
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:06,503
Wow, you should be the
motivational speaker.

282
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,533
Him ?
O-kay.

283
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:11,250
Yeah, he gives me real
responsibility, Michael.

284
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,673
Captain Jack delegates.

285
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:15,180
He's let me steer the ship
for the last hour.

286
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,442
I'd like to be engaged.

287
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,122
How did you manage
to pull that off ?

288
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,963
Uh, I've been engaged for
three years,

289
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:27,552
and there's no end in sight.

290
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,752
So, you don't want to ask
my advice.

291
00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:32,473
Suppose your office
building's on fire.

292
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:34,353
Jim, who would you save ?

293
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,221
Let's see...

294
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:42,272
the customer.

295
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:43,813
Cause the customer is king.

296
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:45,892
Not what I was looking for,
but a good thought.

297
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,703
He's just sucking up.

298
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:49,523
When you were in the Navy,

299
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:51,610
did you, um, ever almost die ?

300
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:54,570
Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't
thinking about some customer.

301
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,672
I was thinking about my first wife.

302
00:14:57,278 --> 00:14:59,562
The day I got back on
shore, I married her.

303
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:06,603
You know what,
I would save the receptionist.

304
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,363
I just wanted to clear that up.

305
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:16,320
Hey, everybody, uh, could I have
your attention for just a second ?

306
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,971
Would you listen to me
for a second ?

307
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,353
We were up at the front

308
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:21,972
and we were talking about
what's really important and...

309
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,652
Pam, um,

310
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,040
I think enough is enough.

311
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,142
I think we should set a date
for our wedding.

312
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:29,573
How about June 10th ?

313
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:30,870
Come on, let's do it.

314
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:33,101
Come on baby !

315
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:34,993
Oh, my God, congratulations !

316
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:37,303
Congratulations.

317
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:39,682
Yes !

318
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:41,342
Oh, my God !

319
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,552
I love you baby, come on !

320
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:43,520
Congratulations !

321
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,271
Come on, I don't want
to take credit for this,

322
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:55,373
but Roy and I were just having
a conversation about

323
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,590
making commitments and making
choices, right ?

324
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,822
Did I motivate you ?

325
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:02,610
No, it was, it was Captain Jack.

326
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,403
- Well....
- Captain Jack !

327
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:06,693
Could have been either one of us

328
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,970
because, pretty much, we were
saying the same thing.

329
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,581
Congratulations, that is great.

330
00:16:10,617 --> 00:16:11,923
We gotta celebrate !

331
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:17,630
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
I got an idea, I got an idea.

332
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:20,643
I can marry you right now
as captain of the ship, huh ?

333
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:24,163
I can marry you as Regional
Manager of Dunder Mifflin !

334
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:27,031
No, no, no, no, I want my mom
and dad to be there.

335
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:28,620
Then, I'll give you away !

336
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:30,500
No, thank you.

337
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:38,712
Do you think that'll ever be us ?

338
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:40,343
No.

339
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:43,462
What is wrong with you ?

340
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,413
Why did you even bring me
here tonight ?

341
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:47,082
I don't know.

342
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,773
Let's break up.

343
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,161
Wh-what ! ?

344
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,500
This is where old Captain Jack
drives the boat.

345
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:58,163
Seasick ?

346
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:00,713
Captain Jack says you
should look at the moon.

347
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:02,492
Captain Jack's a fart face.

348
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,022
I'm on medication.

349
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,520
Really ? What ?

350
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:11,130
Vomicillin.

351
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:17,272
Okay, all right,
it's time to be boss.

352
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,633
Time to motivate,
let's blow some minds here.

353
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,510
Okay guys, guys, guys, cool it.

354
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,093
Everybody. Dunder Mifflin
and Scranton employees.

355
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:28,490
Brenda. I have some very, very,
urgent news I need to tell everybody.

356
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:30,193
Right now, listen up.

357
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:32,472
The ship, is sinking.

358
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:34,590
Okay ?

359
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:36,422
We're going down, right now.

360
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:39,122
Just wrap your heads
around the reality of that.

361
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:42,423
Shh, please, everybody, it's my
turn now, okay ?

362
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:43,641
Captain Jack is gone.

363
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:47,810
In five minutes, this ship is going
to be at the bottom of the lake.

364
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,910
And there aren't enough
spaces on the lifeboats.

365
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:52,672
Who are we going to save ?

366
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:54,730
Do we save sales ?

367
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:56,973
Do we save customer service ?

368
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:58,810
Do we save accounting ?

369
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:01,630
This is a business scenario, right ?

370
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,062
It's a scary...

371
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:05,401
- What the hell's going on here ?
- It's a predicament.

372
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:09,031
And it's something that each and
everyone of us have to think about.

373
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,100
I'm in the brig, see ?

374
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:15,040
Boat's not as corporate
friendly as advertised.

375
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:18,762
What is the deal with the guy
jumping overboard ?

376
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:19,873
What was...

377
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:23,453
If he had just waited and
heard what I had to say,

378
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:26,323
he would be motivated right now
and not all wet.

379
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:42,922
Somebody there ?

380
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,420
What happened to you ?

381
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,110
Captain Jack has a problem
with authority.

382
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:55,240
Oh, right, 'cause you announced
that his ship was sinking ?

383
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,050
Yeah, he just totally lost it.

384
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:00,661
If you ask me, he caused the panic.

385
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:07,150
What a night.

386
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:10,490
Well, it's nice for you.
Your friend got engaged.

387
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:12,022
She was always engaged.

388
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:13,612
Roy  said the first one
didn't count.

389
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,410
That's...great.

390
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:21,882
You know, to tell you
the truth, I...

391
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:24,852
used to have a big
thing for Pam.

392
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:26,273
So...

393
00:19:26,585 --> 00:19:28,172
Really ?
You're kidding me.

394
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:31,822
You and Pam ?

395
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,073
I would have never...

396
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:39,193
put you two together.
You really hid it well, God !

397
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,641
I usually have a radar
for stuff like that.

398
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,140
You know, I made out with Jan.

399
00:19:47,178 --> 00:19:48,700
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah ? Yep.

400
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:50,681
Well, Pam is cute.

401
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,322
Yeah.

402
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:55,182
She's really funny and...

403
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:58,490
She's warm and she's just...

404
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,303
Anyway.

405
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,222
Well, if you like her so much, uh,

406
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:05,430
don't give up.

407
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,032
She's engaged.

408
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:11,440
B.F.D. Engaged ain't married.

409
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,133
Never, ever, ever give up.

410
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,183
Don't worry, Michael.

411
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:29,273
I'm taking us to shore.

412
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:31,482
It's a fake wheel, dummy.
