1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:08,550
It's so weird. How did Joey
end up kissing Charlie last night?

2
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:12,888
- I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
- I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too.

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,890
But surprise!

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,602
I missed most of the party.

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,187
Charlie's a girl, right?

6
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:25,734
Yeah, she's this new professor
in my department that I did not kiss.

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,655
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her.
Of all the girls at the party, God!

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,119
- Why do you care so much?
- Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?

9
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:44,086
Because Ross is the father of my child.

10
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:48,466
You know, and I want him
to hook up with lots of women.

11
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:53,762
All I'm saying is, I don't think that Joey
and Charlie have anything in common.

12
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,100
I don't know. They seemed to have
a shared interest in each other's tonsils.

13
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,980
Wow. Joey and a professor.
Can you imagine if they had kids?

14
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,607
And if the kids got her intelligence...

15
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,777
...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...

16
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,363
...those nerds would get laid!

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,660
All right. So, Ross, you're
okay with all this? I mean...

18
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,913
It's no big deal.
I just met her. I'm fine with it.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,628
God, I forgot how hot she was.

20
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,630
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

21
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,758
- Oh, you know, I'll come with you.
- Okay.

22
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:37,222
- So a professor, huh?
- Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.

23
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,267
Her mind is totally acrimonious.

24
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,483
Guess that's not how she used it.

25
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,905
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

26
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:57,075
I don't ordinarily go around
kissing guys at parties.

27
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,702
I'm...

28
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:03,290
Well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really
hope you don't think less of me.

29
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,001
Think less of you? No.
I don't think less of you.

30
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:09,004
I mean, you saw someone you liked
and you kissed them.

31
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,549
Those people who like someone
and don't kiss them...

32
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:16,553
...those people are stupid.
I hate those people.

33
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,055
Actually, I'm a little surprised
at myself.

34
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,435
I mean, Joey's so different
from the guys I usually date.

35
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,771
They're all professors, intellectuals.
Paleontologists mostly.

36
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,899
- You know, very cerebral...
- Yeah, I know the type.

37
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,737
If we want to grab a bite before work,
we'd better get acrimonious.

38
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,992
No?
Am I getting close?

39
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,413

42
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,379
- Hey!
- Hi.

43
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,007
Hey, you guys.
Look what I just got.

44
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,553
Oh, wow! I love those!
Where did you get them?

45
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,642
I bought them off eBay. They used
to belong to the late Shania Twain.

46
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,063
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.

47
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,858
Oh, then I overpaid.

48
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,821
Hey, what's this?

49
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,115
Oh, it's a gift certificate
to this new spa in SoHo.

50
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:04,119
You can't show Phoebe this. She hates
those corporate massage chains.

51
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,831
What, now I can't get a massage?

52
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,375
There are so many things
that she disapproves of.

53
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,670
I can't eat veal. I can't wear fur.

54
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,256
I can't go hunting.

55
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,719
- Do you want to go hunting?
- I would like to have the option.

56
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,515
What's that? Hey, Rachel?

57
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,475
No, you can't go there!

58
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,271
You know how I feel about
these big massage places.

59
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,898
They're putting people like me
out of business.

60
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,359
She wants to go hunting too!

61
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,114
Phoebe, come on,
I don't want to waste it.

62
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,492
It would be like throwing
away 100 bucks.

63
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,662
Okay, this is not about
the money. Okay?

64
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,040
It's about corporate greed
destroying our hearts...

65
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,377
...and leaving us hollow shells.

66
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,339
I don't care about any of that.

67
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:04,013
Well, do you care about friendship?
I feel really strongly about this.

68
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,933
Please don't use this gift certificate.
I'm asking you as a friend.

69
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,187
Oh, not as a friend. Phoebe!

70
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,356
Fine. I won't use it.

71
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,483
- Promise?
- I promise.

72
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,237
- Thank you.
- Well, I am going hunting.

73
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,495
Hey, honey. I missed you today.

74
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,165
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Hey.

75
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:36,753
- What do you wanna do tonight?
- Oh, well, maybe we could...

76
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,892
Okay, trying to turn me on
by making a mess?

77
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,643
Know your audience.

78
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:56,607
Besides, tomorrow we're doing
those fertility tests.

79
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,776
Until then, you need to keep
your tadpoles in the tank.

80
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,363
Do we really need to take those tests?

81
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,615
We've been trying
to have a baby for a year.

82
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,702
I think it's a good idea
to find out if everything's okay.

83
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,915
- Just a few routine tests.
- But I don't want to do it in a cup.

84
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,585
- What is the big deal?
- It's weird! You're in a doctor's office.

85
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,089
It's not okay to do it
in a doctor's office...

86
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,675
...but it is okay to do it in
a parked car behind a Taco Bell?

87
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:30,182
I cannot believe Ross told you that.

88
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:34,728
And in my defense, it was a Wendy's.

89
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,648
Look, I don't want to do
these tests either.

90
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,150
But I really do think
it's a good idea.

91
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,694
I'm sure a doctor's office
can't be worse...

92
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,114
...than on a class trip
to the Hershey factory.

93
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,118
Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too!

94
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,587
Who says wine has to cost
more than milk?

95
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,552
- Hey!
- Hi.

96
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,971
- Come on in. How are you?
- I'm good.

97
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,848
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Please.

98
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,309
I have been crazed all day.

99
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,604
I had a meeting with the dean,
my syllabus for summer school's due...

100
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,898
...and I'm writing the foreword
for a book.

101
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:24,653
I had a pretty hectic day at work too.
Today I had to open a door and go:

102
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,032
So I am just so excited to be here.

103
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,452
- I can't wait to explore the city.
- Lf you need a tour guide...

104
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,038
Oh, you mean it?
That would be so fun.

105
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,251
Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely. Okay.
What do you want to see first?

106
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,589
We could go see the Kronos Quartet
at Avery Fisher Hall.

107
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,427
Okay.

108
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,598
There's a collection of Walt Whitman
letters on display at the public library.

109
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,725
I know.

110
00:07:56,143 --> 00:08:00,397
- But first, I have to see the Met.
- Okay, let me stop you right there.

111
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,525
The Mets suck, okay?

112
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,863
You wanna see the Yankees.

113
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,741
No. No, not the Mets.
The Met. Singular.

114
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,327
Which one? They all suck.

115
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,662
The museum.

116
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,458
I don't think so.

117
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,592
- Hi there.
- Hello. Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.

118
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,636
How may I help you?

119
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,265
Hi. I have a massage appointment
under Rachel Green.

120
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:40,228
- Okay.
- And here is my gift certificate.

121
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:46,652
- This has been torn up.
- And taped back together.

122
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:51,407
Okay. Well, I'll call you as soon
as your massage therapist is ready.

123
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,159
- Okay.
- Have a seat through the glass doors.

124
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:58,580
- Through the glass doors.
- Through the glass doors.

125
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,166
Alrighty then.

126
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,718
Phoebe, your next client's
in the waiting room.

127
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,305
Do we have to talk like that
when they're not around?

128
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,101
Oh, no. No, no.

129
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,314
Listen, is there someone
who can fill in for me?

130
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,860
- Sorry. Everyone is booked.
- That woman can't know I work here.

131
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,570
She's a friend of mine
and I made this big stink...

132
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,864
...about how awful
these massage chains are.

133
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,660
- Then why do you work here?
- Because it's good money.

134
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,829
But that doesn't change the fact...

135
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,208
...that this is an evil, bloodsucking
corporate machine.

136
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,961
Well, I think this is a great place
to work.

137
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,466
Okay, are they listening?

138
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,888
- Ross. Hey.
- Hi.

139
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,182
I need to talk to you about Charlie.

140
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,852
Oh, do you? Do you really?

141
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,813
Yeah, I'm kind of having
a little problem.

142
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:09,985
Look, if you don't know what the word
"acrimonious" means, just don't use it.

143
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,529
Look, you know Charlie, right?

144
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:16,658
- She's cool, funny, her body is so...
- Get to the problem.

145
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,288
Right. She's just so much smarter
than all the girls I've ever dated.

146
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,374
Combined.

147
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,420
You know? And I just...
I don't want her to think I'm stupid.

148
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,842
Are you wearing two belts?

149
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,721
Hey, what do you know?

150
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,395
You were saying you didn't want
to seem stupid.

151
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,149
Well, she wants to go
to all these cultural places...

152
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:53,570
...and I don't know how to talk about
that stuff. You gotta help me out.

153
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,698
I don't want to get involved
in your guys' relationship.

154
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,993
Oh, dude, please. Come on,
you're the smartest person I know.

155
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,289
And I really like this girl, okay?
I don't want to lose her.

156
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,003
- Fine.
- Thanks.

157
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,004
Okay. Let's see.

158
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:15,008
- Oh, you should take her to the Met.
- The Mets.

159
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,180
No, no, no. The Met.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

160
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,143
Oh, that's what she meant.

161
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,813
If they're gonna shorten it, they
should call it the "Muse," you know?

162
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,733
Short for "museum"
and avoid all the confusion.

163
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:37,948
Yeah, most days the place is packed
with confused, angry baseball fans.

164
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,993
Okay. All right,
so I'll take her to the Met.

165
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:47,123
Yeah. Okay. There's this great
rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.

166
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,751
You know what?
She loves architecture.

167
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,505
You should take a walk down Fifth
to the St. Patrick's Cathedral.

168
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:57,384
And there, there's this great
little pastry shop that she'd love.

169
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,179
Jeez. Sounds like you
should be going on this date.

170
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,514
But I'm not.

171
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,226
- And you know what...?
- Okay, slow down.

172
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,688
You're going way too fast.
Okay? Just go back to the Met.

173
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,566
So you gotta tell me exactly
what to do there.

174
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,236
When you walk into the museum,
take a right, okay?

175
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,987
That's the antiquities wing.

176
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:20,449
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,
up to the Byzantine Empire.

177
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,247
Okay. So I walk in the door
and make a right.

178
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:43,222
I have a weird feeling about
this place. How do I know...

179
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,434
...they won't secretly videotape me
and put it all over the Internet?

180
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:53,023
Because, honey, and I mean this
in the sweetest way possible...

181
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,651
...nobody's gonna wanna watch that.

182
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,946
Mr. Bing? Here you are.

183
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,115
Go into that room and deposit
your specimen into the container.

184
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,742
Deposit my specimen?

185
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:07,454
I usually have to call a 900 number
for that kind of talk.

186
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,586
Thanks. Got it.

187
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,672
All right. Honey, my tests
are down the hall.

188
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,051
- Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

189
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,095
Look, I know this is embarrassing,
but nobody cares.

190
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:26,056
No one here even knows you.

191
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,478
Oh, my God!

192
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,982
Oh, come on!

193
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,161
How great is this?

194
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:50,330
We're probably fertile.
Let's go home.

195
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,585
Why are you here?

196
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,046
Sid and I are trying again
and we had trouble last time...

197
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:02,050
No, no, no. I mean, why?
Why is she here?

198
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:06,931
Oh, someone's a little cranky today
because they have to do it in a cup.

199
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,683
Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.

200
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,438
What?

201
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:21,737
This was fun. But I've got
an invasive vaginal exam to get to.

202
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:26,826
I'd love to stay
but I've got a hot date.

203
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:31,079
Please go. Just let me know
if you need a hand.

204
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,087
I think it just fell off.

205
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,720
Hello, "ja".

206
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,099
It's time for your massage, "ja"?

207
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,351
Put your face in the hole.

208
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,233
A Swedish massage
from a real Swedish person.

209
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,152
Okay, then I'm Swedish.

210
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,656
So, what's your name?

211
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,617
It's a normal Swedish name.

212
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,453
Ikea.

213
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,292
- Wow. What an interesting name.
- Yeah.

214
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,670
- You know, l...
- Time for your scalp massage.

215
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,633
Wow. I really love your...

216
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,597
- Is something wrong?
- No, it's just...

217
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,849
It just feels so good...

218
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,809
...Ikea.

219
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:40,024
Hey, say, you'll know this.
What's the capital of Sweden?

220
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,943
Stockholm.

221
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,988
Damn. I wish I knew
if that was right.

222
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,993
Note the painterly lines
and subtle impasto on this canvas.

223
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,913
Monet painted quickly,
and usually outdoors...

224
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,251
...as his elusive subject
was light itself.

225
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,715
Now, do you have any idea
what you just said?

226
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:11,805
No, no. My mouth says the words,
my brain is thinking "monster trucks."

227
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,351
Now, remember,
when you get to the museum...

228
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:20,522
...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.
I just...

229
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:25,235
- I wrote that out phonetically for you.
- Phonetically?

230
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,531
Yeah, that means...
We just don't have time for this.

231
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,411
I gotta say, I'm really impressed you
were able to memorize all this so quickly.

232
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,164
I'm an actor.
I can memorize anything.

233
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,957
Last week on "Days", I had to say:

234
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,460
"Frontal temporal
zygomatic craniotomy."

235
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:45,589
- Wow. What does that mean?
- No idea.

236
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,134
But the guy I said it to
dies in the next scene...

237
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,221
...so I guess it means,
"You'll get eaten by a bear."

238
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,684
Okay.

239
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,480
- So let's move on to the Renaissance.
- Okay.

240
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,984
Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here...

241
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,236
...to highlight the anguish
of the central figure.

242
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,155
Touch it. It's really bumpy.

243
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:16,203
No, no, no. No ad-libbing. And, dude,
you can't touch the paintings.

244
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,621
- Come on.
- No. No!

245
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,801
My specimen's in the room.

246
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:35,222
I just want to thank whoever knocked
on the door while I was in there.

247
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,516
Really helped speed the process along.

248
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,230
Janice, you're not gone?

249
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,732
Sid is still in his room.

250
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:50,278
I don't allow porn at home,
so this is like a vacation for him.

251
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,491
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?

252
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:58,954
- Yeah. The hard part's over.
- That's not the hard part, honey.

253
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:03,667
The hard part's what comes next.
Aren't you worried about the results?

254
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,337
I haven't even thought
about the results.

255
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,839
I just assumed everything
would be okay.

256
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,300
Well, you know what? It probably is.

257
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,052
But what if it's not okay?

258
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,430
I mean, what if there's a reason
we can't have a baby?

259
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,934
Chandler. Look, you and Monica
are meant to have children.

260
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,144
I'm sure it's gonna be just fine.

261
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:29,067
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. I can't
believe I didn't even think of that.

262
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:33,822
I guess I was so worried about
having to come here and do that.

263
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,325
You can do it
in a Taco Bell parking lot...

264
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,994
...but you can't do it
at a doctor's office?

265
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,624
It was a Wendy's!

266
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,096
And that's the Swedish national anthem.
Thank you for asking.

267
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,642
Wow, lkea.

268
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,686
What a rich culture.

269
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,647
You know what?
I have a friend who's a masseuse.

270
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,526
- Oh? "Ja", "ja"?
- "Ja". She's not very good, though.

271
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:20,452
- And why do you think that is?
- I don't know.

272
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,831
Maybe it's because she's got
such callousy fingers...

273
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,666
...from playing crummy guitar.

274
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:38,261
Or maybe she has trouble
loosening your knots...

275
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:41,890
...because you're such
a high-maintenance tight-ass.

276
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,850
- Phoebe!
- You know it's me?

277
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,269
Well, for like a half an hour!

278
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,272
Man, you can lie about Sweden!

279
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,485
How can you come here?

280
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:56,196
- Why didn't you tell me you work here?
- I don't have to tell you everything!

281
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,867
You do if you're gonna make me feel
guilty for getting a free massage.

282
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,285
Tip's not included.

283
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:06,123
Why did you lie to me
about working here?

284
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,586
Because I was ashamed, okay?
I sold out for the cash.

285
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:16,007
And they give me benefits, like medical
and dental and a four-oh-wunk.

286
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:26,185
But, you know, you pay a price.
Now I'm this corporate stooge...

287
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,645
...and punching a clock...

288
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,689
...and paying taxes!

289
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,485
Phoebe, honey,
if you hate it so much...

290
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,405
...you should walk out there
right now and quit.

291
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,200
Be true to what you believe in.

292
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,995
Honey, you have principles,
and I so admire that.

293
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,373
I don't have any.

294
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:52,127
You know what? You're right.
I am gonna quit.

295
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:56,048
- It's time I took my life back.
- Good for you, Pheebs.

296
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:04,139
If you guys have microphones in
there too, I didn't mean any of that.

297
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,683
I love you.

298
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:13,815
Got you!
Die! Die! Die!

299
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:19,238
Respectfully, Professor R. Geller.

300
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,742
Hey, how was the Met?

301
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,994
The museum was amazing.

302
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,538
Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?

303
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,874
Not so much, no.

304
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,752
He had clearly memorized
all this stuff to say...

305
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,672
...and some of it didn't
even make any sense.

306
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,216
- What do you mean?
- Well, for one...

307
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:42,344
...he was talking about paintings
that were nowhere around.

308
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:49,684
Wait a minute. When you guys walked
into the Met, did you go to the right?

309
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:53,814
- No. No, we went to the left.
- Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.

310
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,736
Still, it seems like you guys
are having a great time together.

311
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,240
Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

312
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:06,535
What?

313
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,205
Actually, Joey's your friend...

314
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,000
...and you don't know me that well.
It'd be weird.

315
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,044
Well, I mean, a little.
But no, what? Go on.

316
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,254
Well...

317
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,009
I'm thinking that maybe Joey
isn't the right guy for me right now.

318
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:25,388
You know, maybe I should
be with someone...

319
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:31,185
...I have more in common with.
You know what I mean?

320
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,104
Yeah.

321
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,110
Yeah, but you know what?

322
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,280
I think you should give Joey a chance.

323
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,282
I mean, he's a great guy.

324
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:48,035
And sure, he doesn't know
that much about art...

325
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,913
...but you can always talk about
that with someone else.

326
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,331
- I guess that's true.
- Lf you think about it...

327
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,669
...he memorized all that stuff because
he thought it was important to you.

328
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:00,547
You know, that's the kind of guy
Joey is.

329
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,258
He is very sweet.

330
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,093
Plus, he is hot!

331
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,932
That was gonna be my next argument.

332
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,352
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

333
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,563
Wow!

334
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:19,483
- Thanks, Ross.
- Yeah.

335
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:24,280
Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.
You hooked me up.

336
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,366
Glad I could help, man.

337
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,620
Some of the stuff wasn't where you said
it would be, but I made it work.

338
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:46,135
It is not okay that I'm aroused
by this now.

339
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:50,806
Hello?

340
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,267
Oh. Hi, Dr. Connelly.

341
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,020
No. Well, she's not here...

342
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,730
...but I can tell her.

343
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,650
Should I be sitting down for this?

344
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,543
Well, so, what does that mean?

345
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:26,800
Okay. Okay, thank you.

346
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,594
Thanks.

347
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,352
Hey, sweetie.

348
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,771
Dr. Connelly just called.

349
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,273
With good news?
Of course it's not good news.

350
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,275
You said, "Dr. Connelly just called."

351
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:46,487
If it was good, you'd have said,
"Dr. Connelly just called!"

352
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,822
So, what is it? Is it...?

353
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:53,035
Is there a problem? Is there
a problem with me, or with you?

354
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,997
Actually, it's both of us.

355
00:24:58,373 --> 00:24:59,916
What?

356
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,253
Apparently, my sperm
have low motility...

357
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:08,300
...and you have
an inhospitable environment.

358
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,560
Well, what does that mean?

359
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:22,273
It means that my guys won't
get off their Barcaloungers...

360
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:26,151
...and you have a uterus that is
prepared to kill the ones that do.

361
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:31,198
- It means...
- Wait, Chandler.

362
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,288
It means that we can keep trying...

363
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:42,626
...but there's a good chance
this may never happen for us.

364
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,300
Oh, my God.

365
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:54,095
I'm sorry.

366
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,515
I'm sorry too.

367
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,561
Well...

368
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:05,107
...we're gonna figure this out.

369
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,903
I know.

370
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:30,048
- Good morning, Phoebe.
- Good morning, receptionist.

371
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:33,760
Here's your schedule for the day.
Your first client is in Room 1.

372
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:38,181
"Rachel Green."
Son of a bitch! She came back?

373
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:49,734
Are you ready
for your Scottish massage?

374
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,320
Put your face in the hole, lassie!

375
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,162
