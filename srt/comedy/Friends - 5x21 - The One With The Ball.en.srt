1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,172
I'll get coffee.
Want anything, baby doll?

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,174
I'm fine. Thanks.

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,217
I can't pull off "baby doll", can I?

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:13,430
No, I think we learned that
from the "sugar lips" incident.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,515
I'll make some tea.

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,894
How you doing, pumpkin?

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,357
- So it's going well for you two?
- I know. Really well.

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,276
I'm gonna ask Phoebe
to move in with me.

9
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,778
What do you think?

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,988
It's great!
When will you ask her?

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,991
Tonight. But don't say anything.

12
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,743
I swear. I promise.

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,243
I'm so excited!

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,788
But listen, do not
get her flowers, okay?

15
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,126
Because she cries when they die.
Then there's the whole funeral.

16
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:48,424
- I'll see you after work, sweetie.
- Okay. Bye.

17
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,968
So what movie should we see?

18
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:55,180
Gary's gonna ask you
to move in with him!

19
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,097
What? Really?

20
00:00:56,348 --> 00:01:00,978
He made me promise not to tell,
but I couldn't hold it in any longer!

21
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,312
I can't believe this.

22
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:06,817
Right? Because it's fast.
Because it's so fast. It's fast.

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,820
Relax. It's Phoebe, not you.

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,030
Good for you, Pheebs.
Way to go.

25
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,867
No, but it is fast, isn't it?

26
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,537
- I like him but I'm not ready.
- So what are you gonna do?

27
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:23,083
I don't know. I'll just handle it.
I'll ask you to talk to him!

28
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,334
Me? Why me?

29
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,587
Because you are
so afraid of commitment.

30
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:31,300
You talk to him. Make him scared
like you, make him a man.

31
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,011
I'll try, but I'm not sure
what good it'd do.

32
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,722
I'm less afraid of commitment
than I used to be.

33
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,475
That is so sweet.

34
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:43,979
Still terrified.
I'll take care of it.

35
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:50,569
The One with the Ball

36
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,787
Hey, Ross, is Staten Island
really an island?

37
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,957
That's why they call it
Staten "Island".

38
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:49,586
Oh, I thought it was
like Long Island.

39
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,510
Also an island.

40
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:57,720
What time is it?

41
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,597
2: 17.

42
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:04,060
We haven't dropped
this ball for an hour.

43
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,186
Are you serious?

44
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,271
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't say anything.

45
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,566
I didn't wanna jinx it.

46
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,320
We are pretty good at this.

47
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,948
We totally forgot about lunch.

48
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,618
That's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

49
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,538
I think my pants are a little loose.

50
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,170
Hey, you guys. Is Monica here?

51
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,756
I bought something.
I'm not sure she'll like it.

52
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,927
It may seem crazy, but I've wanted
this since I was a little girl.

53
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,846
You bought Shaun Cassidy!

54
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,264
No. I wish!

55
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,434
Okay, you ready?

56
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,398
Check it out.

57
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,028
What is it?

58
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,281
What the hell is that?

59
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,699
It's a cat.

60
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,452
That is not a cat!

61
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,870
Yes, it is!

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,915
Why is it inside out?

63
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,586
Excuse me!

64
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:17,132
But this is a purebred,
show-quality sphinx cat.

65
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,801
How much did you pay for that?

66
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,429
It was extravagant,
but I got a good deal.

67
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,057
- How much?
- Thousand bucks.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,936
On a cat?

69
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,064
It's not a cat!

70
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,316
All right. Listen, ball boys.

71
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:38,153
My grandma had one when I was little.
It was the sweetest thing.

72
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,489
It would sit in my lap
and just purr all day long.

73
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,576
I would drag a string
and it would chase it.

74
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,662
Free cats do that too, you know.

75
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,665
It's not a cat!

76
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,502
I'm really excited about this, okay?
I don't care what you think.

77
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:58,548
I'm gonna set up a litter box
for Mrs. Whiskerson.

78
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:02,303
What am I gonna call her?
Fluffy?

79
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:10,269
Do you wanna get something to eat
or see how long we can throw this ball?

80
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,772
The ball thing.

81
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:19,945
Wouldn't it be great if we could go
for two hours without dropping it?

82
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,989
Yeah, it would!

83
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,285
Let's do it.

84
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,539
I have to pee.

85
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,460
And Rachel's in the bathroom!

86
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,050
Man, I didn't think we'd make it.

87
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,427
I know.

88
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,264
Don't switch hands, okay?

89
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:58,192
Hey, ladies.
What are you in here for?

90
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,112
What are you doing here?

91
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,364
I am here to report a crime.

92
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,159
It's a crime that
we don't spend time together.

93
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,786
What's up?

94
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:14,082
You're thinking about moving in with
Phoebe, and I thought we should talk.

95
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,543
You know, man to...

96
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,711
...well, me.

97
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,921
Sure, okay.

98
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,549
Are you crazy?

99
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,591
Are you insane?

100
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:28,055
If you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be living together.

101
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,849
I considered that.
It'd make me happy.

102
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:31,891
You mean scared.

103
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,477
No, I mean happy.

104
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,104
Scared happy.

105
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,481
What are you doing?

106
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,316
I'm trying to open your eyes!

107
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,360
If you live with Phoebe,
she is always gonna be there.

108
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,572
You get home, she's there.
You go to bed, she's there.

109
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,908
You wake up and oh, yes, she's there.

110
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,411
I know. I can't wait!

111
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:55,082
Were your parents happy or something?

112
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,836
I was lucky enough to find
someone that I really love.

113
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,381
I just want to be around her
as much as I can.

114
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,342
When you say it,
it doesn't sound so scary.

115
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,885
You know what I'm saying?

116
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,845
Yeah, I think I do.

117
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,180
You know what?

118
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,726
Move in with her. Move in right now.
Maybe I'll move in with Monica.

119
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:18,522
No, it's too soon for you guys.

120
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,150
You're right about that.

121
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,363
When they found the remains
of the Mesozoic mastodon...

122
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,241
...they discovered what appeared
to be the remains...

123
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:33,787
...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.

124
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,707
How did it get there?

125
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,837
Maybe this should be more
of a quiet game.

126
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,340
Hey, guys.

127
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,467
I left my watch here last night.

128
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,761
- It was here. Where is it?
- I don't know.

129
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,304
I'm late for work.

130
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:54,099
How do you know?
You don't have a watch.

131
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:58,312
Can you stop throwing the ball
for one minute and help me find it?

132
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:02,483
Oh, I don't know...
Yeah, can't do it.

133
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,656
- What?
- Do not drop that ball.

134
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,157
We haven't dropped it in...

135
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,493
Two hours, 27 minutes.

136
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,996
Really?

137
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,623
I won't make it in to work today.

138
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,127
I don't feel very good.

139
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:29,593
For a second, I thought I was
feeling better, but I'm not.

140
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,762
Hey, Rach.

141
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,766
Check it out. Almost three hours
without dropping it.

142
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,812
Congratulations.
That's quite a waste of time.

143
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,149
You have scratches all over you.

144
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,651
Well, it's my cat.

145
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:47,861
Oh, I got a cat.

146
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,154
I don't want a cat!

147
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,616
Don't worry, it's not a cat.

148
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,536
You guys, this cat is nothing
like my grandmother's cat.

149
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,706
It's not sweet.
It's not cute.

150
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:05,296
I dragged a string, and it flipped out
and scratched the hell out of me.

151
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:09,633
I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me...

152
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,470
...I know it's saying, "Rachel!"

153
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:22,521
Doesn't sound as crazy
as paying $1000 for a cat.

154
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,482
You paid $1000 for a cat
when you owe me $300?

155
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:30,111
Well, I was gonna let you
play with it.

156
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,328
Did you talk to Gary
about moving in?

157
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,749
I think you should do it.

158
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,878
He's a great guy and he loves you
a lot. You are a very lucky lady.

159
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,174
You are useless!

160
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,219
Freaking out about commitment
is the one thing you can do...

161
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,428
...and you can't even do that right!

162
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,933
Sorry. If he asked me,
I'd move in with him.

163
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,480
Get out of here, good-for-nothing.

164
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,066
Hey, Chandler.

165
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,195
Hey, Gar.

166
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,696
Hey, sweetie.

167
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,575
Can I talk to you for a second?

168
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,202
You look pretty today.

169
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,623
Thanks. Okay.

170
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:23,624
Here's the thing.

171
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,960
I really want this relationship
to move forward.

172
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,423
If you're not moving forward,
you're moving backwards.

173
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,633
No, if you're not moving forward,
you're staying still.

174
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:38,263
And staying still is good.
Watch this.

175
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,227
I want you to move in with me.

176
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,521
That is so sweet.

177
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:48,023
But don't you think
it's too soon?

178
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,068
There's so much we don't know
about each other.

179
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,407
Okay. I get it.

180
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:02,913
I don't want us to jump into something
that we're not ready for.

181
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,834
I don't want
to mess up what we have.

182
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:13,007
I'm worried it's gonna
be a big mistake.

183
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:19,095
Which is why my answer is yes!

184
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,764
Really?

185
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,518
You're so happy.

186
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,193
Monica, stop throwing it so hard!

187
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,988
We're on the same team!

188
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,158
You guys have been doing this
for four hours?

189
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,827
That's right, baby.

190
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,247
- All right. Let me in.
- No, no! Don't do it!

191
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,749
What?

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,212
He's a dropper.

193
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,464
Oh, yeah. That's right!

194
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,466
I'm not a dropper!

195
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,762
It's really a three-person
game, you know?

196
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,598
It's throwing and catching.

197
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,851
All right.

198
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,856
Oh, it's so hard.

199
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,991
Don't worry, guys.
It's not a cat.

200
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,911
Oh, good God!

201
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:28,207
I give up. I don't know what
I'm gonna do with this thing.

202
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:31,585
Baking it didn't help?

203
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,963
Take it back to where you got it.

204
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,091
I tried. They won't take her back.

205
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:42,346
Maybe that's because she's
a minion of the Antichrist.

206
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:44,765
Why won't they take it?

207
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,518
They said they would only
give me store credit.

208
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,480
What am I gonna do?
Get 1000 regular cats?

209
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,233
You can keep it until you
find out what to do with it.

210
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,860
That's not the point.
I'm out $1000...

211
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,528
...I'm all scratched up...

212
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,701
...and I'm stuck with this stupid cat
that looks like a hand!

213
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,663
Oh, my God!

214
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,624
The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me!

215
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,544
My vision's been compromised!

216
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,548
Oh, God! Okay.

217
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,009
It's okay. Man, that was close.

218
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,472
Yeah, you almost overreacted
to something.

219
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:31,437
- We have great news.
- We're moving in together. Yea!

220
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,063
Congratulations.

221
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,773
- I'm so excited!
- So am I.

222
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:39,236
You're not more excited than I am.
No way. I'm the most excited.

223
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,821
See you at the station later.

224
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:45,284
I'll see you later.
Don't forget about the moving-in!

225
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,202
So you're moving in with him?

226
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:51,665
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
Maybe it'll be all right.

227
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,125
I do like him a lot...

228
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,086
...and probably do it
eventually, anyway.

229
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:00,215
Plus think of all the money
I'll save on stamps.

230
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,841
Do you write him a lot?

231
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,011
I heard when people live together...

232
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:08,265
...they split the cost
of stamps, don't they?

233
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,978
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's right.

234
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,401
Sorry, the oven mitts
really freaked me out.

235
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,785
Hey, honey.

236
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,162
Did you find any apartments
in Brooklyn Heights?

237
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,705
No, nothing.

238
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,039
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

239
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,541
- Nothing at all?
- No.

240
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:40,422
If something opens up, we'll move in.
If it has a pool. I need a pool.

241
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:44,343
Can I talk to you?

242
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:49,390
Take a seat.

243
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,100
You okay?

244
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,477
You feel all right?

245
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:57,022
I feel great because
we're moving in together.

246
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,482
So you...

247
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:03,654
You checked the paper for listings
in Brooklyn Heights, right?

248
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,864
You checked the "Post"?

249
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,451
Yeah, there was nothing.

250
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,577
Can I get some water?

251
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,747
In a minute.

252
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,749
You checked today's "Post"?

253
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,418
Yeah, today's.

254
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,005
Because this is today's "Post".

255
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,341
And these are the listings I found.

256
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,636
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.

257
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:31,390
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights,
Brooklyn Heights!

258
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,770
Oh, are these for rent?
I thought people were just bragging.

259
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,231
Let me tell you what's going on here.

260
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,776
Don't look at the table.
Look at me.

261
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,821
Somebody asked someone
to move in with him.

262
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,824
Someone said yes,
but now she has doubts...

263
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:54,079
...because things are moving too fast.
Does that sound possible?

264
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,626
Yes, fine! I am someone!

265
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,296
You want me to say it?
I have doubts!

266
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,883
I'm sorry!

267
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,803
It's okay that you feel this way.

268
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,974
It is soon and there's things
we don't know about each other.

269
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,643
Everything I know about you,
I really like.

270
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:22,108
Things I don't know, I'll learn in
a place with our names on the mailbox.

271
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,694
That's so sweet.

272
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,406
But if it's too soon for you,
we don't have to do it.

273
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,075
I want you to be happy.

274
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,869
Living with you would make me happy.

275
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,329
You don't have to say that.

276
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,332
I want to live with you.
I want to move in with you.

277
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,667
Are you sure?

278
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:44,171
Definitely, yes! Let's live in
an apartment we both live in.

279
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,256
Oh, that's great.

280
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:47,717
Oh, wait, one sec.

281
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:52,554
Hey, you! Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?

282
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:58,852
I always wanted to say that every time
I was in these rooms, which was never.

283
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,438
<i>Show cat!</i>

284
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,983
Quality show cat!

285
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,110
Show cat!

286
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,278
Oh, my God!

287
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,072
What's wrong with your baby?

288
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,324
That's not a baby. That's a cat.

289
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,035
- It's creepy looking.
- Oh, no.

290
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:20,415
It's actually very sweet.
It's very sweet. Look.

291
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,169
Yeah. Do you want it?

292
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,754
No, I hate cats.

293
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,797
Then what are you doing to me?

294
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:32,636
Get out of here, all right?
Move on!

295
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,179
What an unusual cat.

296
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,390
Yes, thank you! Exactly.
You want it?

297
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,600
Maybe.

298
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:42,355
I was thinking about getting a cat
from the shelter, but...

299
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,396
Okay. Why not?

300
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:47,067
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.

301
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,402
- What?
- Okay, 1000.

302
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,321
Didn't you want me to adopt your cat?

303
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:56,327
I do, but you'll have to look at this
as more of an investment than a cat.

304
00:17:56,577 --> 00:18:00,372
Okay, yeah.
I just wanted a cat.

305
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:06,461
Obviously, you know how to haggle,
so I won't try and take you on.

306
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:10,883
So $800, and I don't call the cops
because you are robbing me blind!

307
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,511
Blind! Just take the cat.
Leave the money. Run away!

308
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,180
Run away. Damn it!

309
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:22,269
Can't you at least smile or something?

310
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:27,691
Did anybody just hear that? Anybody?

311
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:36,158
- I'm starving.
- Come on, guys. Suck it up!

312
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,160
We're closing in on 10 hours.

313
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,370
It's gut-check time!

314
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:44,959
I don't know who made you the boss.
We invented this game.

315
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,002
I made this game what it is!

316
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,630
Not fun anymore?

317
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,632
I'm still hungry.

318
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:55,761
There's pizza at my place. We can eat
with one hand. Are you with me?

319
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,931
- I am.
- All right, let's go! Come on!

320
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:02,309
Let's go, Team Monica!

321
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,523
We can work out the name later.

322
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:12,027
What is your cat doing in my bowl?

323
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,405
I'm defrosting a chicken.

324
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,200
I sold Mrs. Whiskerson.

325
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,202
Thank God!

326
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:21,328
Get your money back?

327
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,871
Yeah, $1500.

328
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,708
You made a profit?

329
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,005
I just came for the red velvet pillow.

330
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,550
- There you go.
- Thanks, Rachel.

331
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,720
Don't forget, you can come
visit her anytime.

332
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,141
Oh, good. Great.
I'll keep that in mind.

333
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:49,230
So is this some kind
of snake or something?

334
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,784
I like waking up with you.

335
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,662
I like waking up with you too.

336
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,706
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.

337
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,459
I could stay here all day.

338
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,461
That would be great.

339
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:15,925
- We could have breakfast in bed.
- Wait, just a second.

340
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,512
Oh, no.

341
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:27,185
All right. Come on, Monica!
Look alive. Come on!

342
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,148
Oh, good. You're all up.

343
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,611
It's six o'clock in the morning.
Why aren't you at Gary's?

344
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,571
Oh, yeah. That's over.

345
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,741
Gary's such a great guy.
You can work it out.

346
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:44,453
- He shot a bird.
- That is over.

347
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,330
- I'm sorry.
- That's terrible.

348
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,915
Are you okay?

349
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,209
I'll be all right.

350
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,378
Here, Pheebs.

351
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:55,172
I don't feel like playing.

352
00:20:58,967 --> 00:20:59,968
It's okay.

353
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,388
It's okay.

354
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,641
It didn't happen.
No one needs to know.

355
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,018
She's not an official ball player.

356
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:12,189
Only official ball players
can drop the ball.

357
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,025
- Come on.
- Let's go.

358
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,694
You wanna get breakfast?

359
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,654
Okay, let's race!

360
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:22,449
First one there wins.

361
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,786
You guys wanna eat here?

362
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,043
That was great, huh?

363
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,420
Can you believe how long we did it?

364
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,756
It is amazing it lasted that long.

365
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,716
My arm is killing me.

366
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,553
No, I meant with
the dropper over here.

367
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,097
How did I get this
reputation as a dropper?

368
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,516
I am anything but a dropper.

369
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,811
Ross!
