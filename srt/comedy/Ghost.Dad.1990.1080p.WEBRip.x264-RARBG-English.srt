DADDY?

363
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,741
I DON'T LIKE THIS TRICK.

364
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,510
I HATE IT.
STOP IT.

365
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,479
AND WOULD YOU
STOP IT, DADDY?

366
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,813
YOU'RE
SCARING AMANDA.

00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,121
DADDY,

00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,724
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,926
YOU'RE AN OWL!

380
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:19,561
YOU'RE A DUCK!

381
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:22,665
YOU'RE WHITE HOUSE
CHIEF OF STAFF
JOHN SUNUNU!

382
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,868

YOU'RE TOASTING
SOMETHING.

00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:32,941

POST. A HOST.

387
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,077
A GHOST?

388
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:38,013
HE'S A GHOST!

389
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:43,418
YOU'RE A GHOST!

390
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:44,419

00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:07,075

00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:14,849

00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,055
IS DADDY GOING AWAY
LIKE MOMMY?

401
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:24,993
TRY TELEPATHY, DAD.

402
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:27,462
I THINK THAT'S HOW
GHOSTS COMMUNICATE.

403
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:28,998
CONCENTRATE.

00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,110
I HEAR IT, TOO.

407
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:45,580
CAN YOU MOVE YOUR LIPS
OR SOMETHING, DAD?

408
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,783
THIS IS REALLY WEIRD.

409
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:55,490
DADDY, ARE YOU GOING TO
GO AWAY LIKE MOMMY DID?

410
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:58,560

TO THE HEREAFTER...

469
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:01,275
I SENSED A DISTURBANCE
IN THE SPIRIT ETHER,

470
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:03,011
WHICH IS ALMOST ALWAYS

471
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:06,048
A SURE SIGN
OF INTERCORPOREAL
MALTRANSFERENCE.

472
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,218

473
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:13,221
IT MEANS
THEY SCREWED UP.

474
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:15,356
IT'S THE AFTERLIFE
EQUIVALENT

475
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:16,991
TO MISPLACING
YOUR PAPERWORK.

476
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,392
IT'S RARE,
BUT IT HAPPENS.

477
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:20,394
ANYWAY, IT'S
A SPECIALTY OF MINE.

478
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:22,798
I'VE WRITTEN A BOOK
ON IT, ACTUALLY.

479

MOST LOCAL BOOKSTORES.

482
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,906
LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

483
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:33,174

486
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:42,851
WELL, OF COURSE
I CAN SEND YOU BACK,

487
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,886
BUT WHY
SHOULD I WANT TO?

488
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,420
BECAUSE IT'S
FOR MY CHILDREN!

489
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:48,723

00:26:56,732 --> 00:27:00,335
YES. WHY DO YOU
FIND THAT SO FUNNY?

00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:07,141
THIS... THIS IS
A TEMPORARY STATE
YOU'RE IN.

495
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:08,877

THAN THREE DAYS,

497
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,881

498
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,883

00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,952
HAVE YOU STARTED

501
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:20,221
NO. NO FLICKER.

502
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,123
YOU MIGHT MAKE IT
TO WEDNESDAY,

503
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:23,758
MAYBE EVEN
WEDNESDAY NIGHT,

504
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,426
BUT NO,
NOT THURSDAY.
QUITE IMPOSSIBLE.

505
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:27,996
BUT I'VE GOT TO
MAKE IT TO THURSDAY.

506
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:29,463
IT'S FOR MY CHILDREN.

00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:32,466
MY WIFE DIED
A FEW YEARS AGO,

508
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:35,770

514
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:55,056
BUT ON... ON THE BOOK,
IT'S SPELLED EDITH.

515
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:56,991
BUT IT'S PRONOUNCED
EH-DITH.

516
00:27:56,992 --> 00:27:58,326
BUT IT'S
A GIRL'S NAME.

517
00:27:58,327 --> 00:28:00,394
LOOK, IT IS NOT
A GIRL'S NAME.

518
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:02,296
EH-DITH
IS A BOY'S NAME!

519
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:04,032
WHO ARE YOU
NAMED AFTER?

520
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,100
I WAS NAMED
AFTER MY GRANDMAMA!

521
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,468
AND THEY
CALLED HER EH-DITH?

522
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,804
NO! HER NAME IS EDITH!

523
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:11,940
SO YOU SEE?

524
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,875
IT IS A GIRL'S NAME!

525
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:15,978
NO, IT'S NOT!

526
00:28:17,012 --> 00:28:20,949

PLEASE STAND STILL?

527
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,483

WANT TO DISAPPOINT
MY CHILDREN AGAIN!

530

531
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:34,328
BUT I MUST HAVE
FURTHER READINGS.

532
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:37,431
I'M GOING TO CALL
FOR YOU AGAIN,
AGREED?

533
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:39,033

534
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:41,269
NOW JUST SEND ME BACK.

535
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,503

1, 2, 3...

1230
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:29,775
LIFT.

1231
01:10:29,776 --> 01:10:32,344
GOOD, GOOD.

1232
01:10:32,345 --> 01:10:34,012
O.K., WHAT
HAVE WE GOT?

1233
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:35,647
SHE FELL.

1234
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,616
150. BP...
80 OVER 30.

1235
01:10:37,617 --> 01:10:39,084
PUPILS FIXED
AND DILATED.

1236
01:10:39,085 --> 01:10:40,752
DOCTOR, HER BLOOD PRESSURE'S
DROPPING. WE'RE LOSING HER.

1237
01:10:40,753 --> 01:10:42,020
COME ON! MOVE IT!

1238
01:10:42,021 --> 01:10:43,556
EKG HOOKED UP.

1239
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,758
BOO!

1240
01:10:46,759 --> 01:10:48,027
DIANE.

1241
01:10:50,763 --> 01:10:52,398
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1242
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:55,402
TAKING AFTER
MY OLD MAN, I GUESS.

1243
01:11:05,745 --> 01:11:07,380
DIANE.

1244
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:17,656
DIANE,
STOP FOOLING AROUND

1245
01:11:17,657 --> 01:11:19,925
AND GET BACK
IN YOUR BODY.

1246
01:11:19,926 --> 01:11:20,992
NO WAY.

1247
01:11:20,993 --> 01:11:24,464
THIS IS GREAT!

1248
01:11:28,668 --> 01:11:29,668
DIANE,

1249
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:31,803
GET BACK
INTO YOUR BODY

1250
01:11:31,804 --> 01:11:33,639
BEFORE SOMETHING
SERIOUS HAPPENS.

1251
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:36,408
LIKE WHAT?
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

1252
01:11:36,409 --> 01:11:38,544
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT YOU,
ISN'T IT?

1253
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:40,579
I'M THINKING
OF ME RIGHT NOW.

1254
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:43,415
THIS GHOST LIFE IS BETTER
THAN MY CRAPPY LIFE.

1255
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:45,584
I'M NOT GOING
BACK TO IT.

1256
01:11:45,585 --> 01:11:50,088
DIANE, LIFE IS
ALL THERE IS.

1257
01:11:50,089 --> 01:11:51,758
BELIEVE ME.

1258
01:11:55,428 --> 01:11:57,829
I'M BEGGING YOU,

1259
01:11:57,830 --> 01:12:00,500
DON'T WASTE IT.

1260
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:02,802
DADDY?

1261
01:12:06,138 --> 01:12:07,774
OH, MY GOD.

1262
01:12:13,613 --> 01:12:15,548
WHAT... WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO YOU?

1263
01:12:16,716 --> 01:12:18,084
DIANE...

DON'T WASTE IT.

1267
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:33,765
SHOULDN'T WE TRY
TO FIND YOUR BODY?

1268
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,734
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

1269
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:37,703
IT'S YOU.

1270
01:12:37,704 --> 01:12:39,572
PLEASE,
I'LL HELP YOU LOOK.

1271
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,742
I'M NOT
DOING ANYTHING

1272
01:12:43,743 --> 01:12:49,581
UNTIL YOU GET BACK
INTO YOURS.

1273
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:52,719
DADDY, WHY WON'T YOU
LET ME HELP YOU?

1274
01:12:53,853 --> 01:12:57,657
I WANT YOU...

1275
01:12:59,492 --> 01:13:02,228
TO LIVE...

1276
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,570
BECAUSE...

1277
01:13:16,175 --> 01:13:17,877
I...

1278
01:13:20,212 --> 01:13:23,182
BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME.

1279
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:27,119
YES.

1280
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,590
OH, DADDY.

1281
01:13:32,091 --> 01:13:33,825
OH, MY.

1282
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,827
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

1283
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,295
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

1284
01:13:37,296 --> 01:13:39,865
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

1285
01:13:39,866 --> 01:13:42,067

1286
01:13:42,068 --> 01:13:43,636
HELP ME.

1287
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:55,147
OH, MY GOD.

1288
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:06,091
LOOK,
DADDY, LOOK.

1289
01:14:06,092 --> 01:14:07,693
WHAT?

1290
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:09,562
IT'S YOU.
IT'S YOU.

1291
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:14,901
IT SAYS
CURTIS BURCH,
BUT IT'S YOU.

1292
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:21,139
IT'S THAT
CAB DRIVER'S NAME.

1293
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:24,676
I HAD NO
IDENTIFICATION.

1294
01:14:24,677 --> 01:14:26,913
HE HAD MY WALLET.

1295
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,716
I'LL GET BACK
INTO MY BODY

1296
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:33,319
IF YOU GET BACK
IN YOURS.

1297
01:14:40,259 --> 01:14:43,128
GO, DADDY! GO, GO!

1298
01:14:43,129 --> 01:14:44,997
GO! PLEASE, GO!

1299
01:15:20,867 --> 01:15:22,702
DADDY?

1300
01:15:30,977 --> 01:15:33,379
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

1301
01:15:35,247 --> 01:15:38,884
THERE'S A TERRIBLE
DRAFT UNDER MY GOWN.

1302
01:15:38,885 --> 01:15:41,387
THEY TOOK
MY UNDERWEAR OFF.

1303
01:15:44,023 --> 01:15:45,357
OH, DADDY.

1304
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:49,261
I HURT EVERYWHERE.

1305
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,903
IT'S THE MOST
WONDERFUL FEELING.

1306
01:16:01,674 --> 01:16:03,108
YOU SHOULD HURRY.

1307
01:16:03,109 --> 01:16:04,310
HURRY.

1308
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,960
I'M SORRY.

1309
01:16:21,961 --> 01:16:23,161
I'M LEAVING.

1310
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,030
I JUST...

1311
01:16:25,031 --> 01:16:26,364
I'VE TRIED,

1312
01:16:26,365 --> 01:16:29,367
BUT I CAN'T SIT
ON A BEDPAN AND GO.

1313
01:16:29,368 --> 01:16:31,704
I'VE GOT TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

1314
01:16:32,872 --> 01:16:34,706
SHE'S FIBRILLATING.
GET THE PADDLES

1315
01:16:34,707 --> 01:16:36,742
AND GET THE EPI.
IS RESPIRATORY HERE, YET?

1316
01:16:36,743 --> 01:16:38,109
GET ON IT, STAT.

1317
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:39,377
WE'RE LOSING HER.

1318
01:16:39,378 --> 01:16:41,047
CHARGING.

1319
01:16:49,388 --> 01:16:51,990
WOW. SUPER RAD.

1320
01:16:51,991 --> 01:16:54,893
WOW, I'M O.K.
GIVE ME A SECOND.

1321
01:16:54,894 --> 01:16:57,462
WHAT A RUSH.
I GUESS I'M CURED, HUH?

1322
01:16:57,463 --> 01:16:59,264
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP,
EVERYBODY.

1323
01:16:59,265 --> 01:17:00,398
OH.

1324
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:01,432
WELL, THANKS.

1325
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:02,769
BYE!

1326
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,376
COME, LET'S GO.
WE FOUND DADDY'S BODY.

1327
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:12,878
HE'S RIGHT HERE.

1328
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:14,245
HE'S NOT A GHOST
ANYMORE.

1329
01:17:14,246 --> 01:17:16,816
LET'S GO.

1330
01:17:50,282 --> 01:17:52,051
JESUS CHRIST!

1331
01:18:05,564 --> 01:18:07,499
WAIT A MINUTE.

1332
01:18:17,076 --> 01:18:18,309
AAH!

1333
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:19,477
AAH!

1334
01:18:19,478 --> 01:18:21,212

COMMAND?

1341
01:18:36,562 --> 01:18:38,396
COMMAND?

1342
01:18:38,397 --> 01:18:40,832
I COMMAND YOU TO...

1343
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:43,568
GO TO HELL AND SIT
ON A RED-HOT COAL

1344
01:18:43,569 --> 01:18:45,837
AND WAIT FOR ME...

1345
01:18:45,838 --> 01:18:48,039

1346
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:51,376
