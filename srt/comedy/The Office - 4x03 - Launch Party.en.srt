1
00:00:00,193 --> 00:00:03,474
And the same thing goes for
quarterly reports. They're unreadable.

2
00:00:03,634 --> 00:00:05,592
They're just numbers,
and boring, and black.

3
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:09,009
So what I was thinking is that maybe
we should have some sort of graphic.

4
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:12,333
Like if we have a bad quarter,
put in a storm cloud.

5
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:15,224
And,

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,438
when we have a good quarter...
fireworks.

7
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:21,233
Or a race car.

8
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:23,569
Doesn't have to be a race car.

9
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:25,191
Use your imagination.

10
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:27,951
There's this cube on the screen,
and it bounces around all day.

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,584
And sometimes it looks like it's heading
right into the corner of the screen

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,666
and at the last minute
it hits the wall and bounces away.

13
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,258
We are all just dying to see it
go right into the corner.

14
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:43,666
Pam claims that she saw it one day when
she was alone in the conference room.

15
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:44,826
Okay...

16
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:46,884
I believe she thinks she saw it.

17
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:49,677
I saw it.
I saw it, and it was amazing.

18
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:51,715
Who said I didn't see it?
Did Jim say that?

19
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:52,991
I saw it!

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,601
We have a lot of colored paper here.

21
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:58,187
Why, oh, why,
do we keep printing this on white?

22
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,771
No!
Come on!

23
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,888
Yeah.

24
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,396
I know.

25
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:03,884
I know.
It's bland.

26
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:07,070
- It's never gonna happen.
- Dude, you've gotta believe.

27
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:09,573
Maybe
we could have some sort of riddle...

28
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:12,311
- Wait for it.
- Like something

29
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:14,256
that you have to look for...

30
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:16,518
Sort of a <i>Where's Waldo</i>?

31
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:23,019
All r-- All right.
Let's quit while we're ahead.

32
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,595
- That was so awesome.
- That was awesome.

33
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:26,695
Thank you.

34
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:30,116
Some days, I am just on fire.

35
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:32,089
What can I say?

36
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:39,378

"LAUNCH PARTY"

71
00:02:05,643 --> 00:02:07,173
Hey, there he is.

72
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:08,933
Hey, Meredith.
How you feeling?

73
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:10,636
I never thanked you for coming.

74
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:13,168
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.
Well, we all came, so...

75
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,371
Well, I real appreciate you coming.

76
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:17,315
I'm singling you out.

77
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:20,329
Anyway, I have this sharpie.

78
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:23,075
And I was wondering
if you could sign my cast.

79
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:32,139
- Can you write where I can read it?
- Yep.

80
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:39,913
I'll read this when I get home.

81
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,233
All right.

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,972
Michael, this is the press release
I told you about.

83
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,653
Ryan wants you to share it.

84
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:49,777
Oh, does he?

85
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:50,748
He does.

86
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:53,124
Okay.

87
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:54,932
Attention, earthlings.

88
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,310
I have some news.

89
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,556
Today's the big day that I'm heading
to New York to attend a party

90
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:06,333
with sushi and important people.

91
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:09,562
On an unrelated note,
if anybody has an interesting anecdote

92
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:13,262
that is not boring and easy to memorize
please drop by my office before I leave.

93
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:14,364
Thank you.

94
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,199
Was that really
what Ryan wanted you to tell us?

95
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,547
And...

96
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:22,998
"Today the Dunder Mifflin Infinity
website officially launches."

97
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,360
Well, the website is the brainchild
of my brainchild, Ryan.

98
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:28,294
It is my brain grandchild.

99
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:30,651
And, to celebrate its birth,

100
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,654
all of the different branches
are going to have satellite parties

101
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:38,553
which will be connected via web cams
and fibers to the real party,

102
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:42,902
which is going on in New York City
at a very exclusive nightclub.

103
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:46,362
And that is where all of the VIPs,

104
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:51,514
including yours truly, will be partying
with new york city's finest.

105
00:03:51,702 --> 00:03:53,653
And I do not mean policemen.

106
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,984
"The company
is projecting record high sales

107
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:59,760
"and that by 6:00, the website will be
the new best salesman in the company."

108
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,942
Watch out, Dwight.

109
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,789
That's ridiculous.
I'm not gonna be beaten by a website.

110
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:07,072
- Actually, it sounds like you are.
- Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?

111
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:09,660
That's from Ryan?
Does it mention if he's seeing anybody?

112
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,171
No.
I'll find out tonight.

113
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:12,775
Yes, please let us know.

114
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:14,699
I can make more sales than a computer.

115
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,095
In fact, I challenge that website
to make more sales than me today.

116
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,536
- Waste of time.
- What's tha pipsqueak?

117
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:23,517
Waste of time.
The website's going to win.

118
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:26,631
- You believe a computer can beat me?
- I don't care, but yes.

119
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,994
- I'll prove you wrong.
- I don't care, and you won't.

120
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:31,363
- You'll see.
- I won't be watching, and I won't.

121
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:35,799
Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.

122
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,491
It's very complicated.

123
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,858
It's caused a lot of unpleasantness
between Dwight and Angela.

124
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:44,576
Who were both already prone
to unpleasantness.

125
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,471
Stanley, you're dancing.

126
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,925
No, I'm not.

127
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,307
Yeah, I created a website.

128
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:03,083
Look. At the end of the day,
Apple's apple is flying at 30,000 feet.

129
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:04,792
This is a paper company.

130
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:07,851
And I don't want us to get lost
in the weeds or into a beauty contest.

131
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:10,015
I told you
I don't want you doing these things.

132
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,658
You can use your own office
or do it in the hall.

133
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:15,624
Convergence, viral marketing.
We're going guerilla.

134
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:18,787
We take it to the streets while keeping
an eye on the stree, Wall Street.

135
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:22,726
I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.
In other words, it is what it is.

136
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,328
Buying paper just became fun.

137
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:30,492
And this is
where I will record your sales.

138
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,266
Very nice.

139
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:35,245
And then will say something positive

140
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:37,757
like "kudos" or "job well done."

141
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,053
Or zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.

142
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:44,979
- I can't tell if he's mocking me.
- Just ignore him.

143
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:47,576
Can't do that.

144
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:49,638
It's really hard for me
to let things go.

145
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:51,020
I was.
Mocking.

146
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:52,772
Thank you.

147
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:57,486
I just feel like we need something more
to acknowledge when I make a sale.

148
00:05:57,735 --> 00:06:00,853
- Yes, like a chime or a bell.
- Or a gong.

149
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,126
Go to my car.

150
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,651
Open the trunk.

151
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:11,583
Inside, you will see many pelts.

152
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:13,835
Under the smallest one is a case.

153
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:16,492
Inside that case is a bear horn.

154
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:17,604
Bring it to me.

155
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,877
Yes!

156
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:28,131
Isn't 7:00 P.M.
a little late for a lunch party?

157
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:30,543
Lunch party?

158
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:32,564
It's supposed to say launch party.

159
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:34,898
What is wrong with you?

160
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,251
Angela is worse than usual lately,
and we have a party to throw.

161
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:43,141
So I googled
"how to deal with difficult people,"

162
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,315
and I got all of this.

163
00:06:46,142 --> 00:06:48,690
So we're gonna try out
some new things today.

164
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:52,249
How do you feel about the fact
that the banner says "lunch"?

165
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:53,632
I feel angry.

166
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,147
Angry at you.

167
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:57,483
Angry at you for doing something stupid.

168
00:06:57,643 --> 00:07:00,218
Angry at me for believing
you could do something not stupid.

169
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,674
I'm so sorry to hear that.
That must be awful.

170
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,001
It is awful.

171
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:07,856
You've made this day awful.

172
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:11,172
Maybe you could just change
the "u" into an "a".

173
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:13,497
Then it would say "lanch" party, Kevin.

174
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:15,697
Would it be better
if it said "lanch" party?

175
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,287
- Lunch party.
- It's supposed to say "launch."

176
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:21,951
Easy, booster seat.
Nobody cares about this party anyway.

177
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,914
I care!

178
00:07:23,114 --> 00:07:25,558
Plan a party, Angela.
Oh, and the entire world will see it.

179
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:27,775
Oh! And here's $65 for your budget.

180
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:30,406
And here are 4 idiots
who'll do nothing but weigh you down.

181
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,297
Oh, and your cat's still dead.

182
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,574
- 20 seconds to go time.
- Got it.

183
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:35,734
Carb up.

184
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,211
Really?
Power gel?

185
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:41,821
Hey, you wanna win,
you gotta fuel like a winner.

186
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,244
Okay.

187
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:44,581
We start...

188
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,106
as soon as I make this shot.

189
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,757
What would you say if I told you
we could pull a prank on Dwight

190
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,719
and at the same time not be working?

191
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:01,455
What?

192
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,624
- He goes through a breakup.
- I'm aware of that.

193
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:07,007
But he's also being super-annoying,
and I'm not a perfect person.

194
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,432
- You got one!
- Three reams!

195
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:13,992
In your face, machines!

196
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:17,258
What kinda prank are you thinking?

197
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,085
What if I told you
I could offer free shipping?

198
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,737
Sure, I'll hold.

199
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:28,036
Who am I? (del vo)

200
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:36,988
You tell me. (del vo)

201
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:42,012
Not sure.

202
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:44,286
Just became self-aware.

203
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,711
So much to figure out.

204
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,741
I think I'm programmed to be your enemy.

205
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:55,038
I think it is my job to destroy you
when it comes to selling paper.

206
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,650
How do I know this isn't Jim? (del vo)

207
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:16,518
What is a Jim? (del vo)

208
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:20,169
It appears
that the website has become alive.

209
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,565
This happens to computers
and robots sometimes.

210
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:24,393
Am I scared of a stupid computer?

211
00:09:24,553 --> 00:09:27,021
Please!
The computer should be scared of me.

212
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:31,399
I have been salesman of the month
for 13 out of the last 12 months.

213
00:09:31,592 --> 00:09:32,893
You heard me right.

214
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:34,580
I did so well last february

215
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,994
that corporate gave me
two plaques in lieu of a pay raise.

216
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:45,162
Yes, it's too tight.

217
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:46,322
Way too tight.

218
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,550
- Really?
- This is why I'm here?

219
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:49,843
Why is it so tight?

220
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:51,597
It's a european cut.

221
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,108
It just looks bad.

222
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,429
What's hanging?

223
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:02,071
- Setting up the web cam for the party.
- Oh, good. Okay, cool.

224
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,109
How many pounds
I could lose by 7:00?

225
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,097
Depends how much
you've eaten already today.

226
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:11,259
I had...

227
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:14,526
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

228
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:18,865
Just one second, we're in a meeting.
I'll see if he's available.

229
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:20,212
It's Jan.

230
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:23,759
Why don't you wanna go tonight?
What--

231
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:25,506
All your friends will be there.

232
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,582
<i>My friends?
Michael, I was terminated.</i>

233
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:28,667
Just.

234
00:10:29,353 --> 00:10:30,972
- <i>Is it that important to you?</i>
- Yeah!

235
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:32,381
- <i>All right.</i>
- Thank you.

236
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,689
<i>Go by yourself.</i>

237
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,370
No--
No.

238
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,852
No. If I go by myself,
everybody'll think I'm a big loser.

239
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,357
- <i>Well...</i>
- I've your permission to invite Carol?

240
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,541
- <i>What? Jesus, Michael!</i>
- I'm sor--

241
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:46,709
I'm sorry.
It's just the first...

242
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:49,844
girl that popped into my head.
I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.

243
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:52,623
Nice!

244
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,410
Website check, please.

245
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:56,055
305.

246
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:57,855
3-0-5.

247
00:10:58,015 --> 00:11:00,866
You, my friend, are winning handsomely.

248
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,670
Oh, it just made another sale--
380.

249
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:07,551
You, my friend,
are in a very close second.

250
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,409
- 402.
- Okay, why don't you just lay off?

251
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,676
What you want me to do, not announce it?
412.

252
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,291
So, this is the dealio.

253
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:21,813
God has smiled upon me

254
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:25,220
and given me two tickets
to the big party in New York tonight.

255
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:27,337
What are you doing this evening?

256
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:32,851
Look at that.

257
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:35,532
They have their own
little language now, like twins.

258
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,275
- Sure, we'll go.
- All right.

259
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,995
Fight it out amongst yourselves.
I was thinking Pammy,

260
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:41,796
but boys' night out is also good.

261
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:43,448
Oh, I'm sorry.
What?

262
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:48,393
- One of the tickets is for him.
- Just let me know who the winner is.

263
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,381
- Not it. I won.
- Not it. Nope.

264
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,798
Definitely not.
If anything, it was a tie.

265
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,695
Tie goes to the girlfriend.

266
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,615
No, I realize you normally reorder
in november, but what I'm suggesting--

267
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:03,288
You did what?

268
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:07,254
Oh! No! That's exactly
what you're not supposed to do, damn it!

269
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:08,825
Why reorder from a computer

270
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:11,526
when you could have the personal touch
of a salesman?

271
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,864
- How's it going?
- Fine. Good.

272
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:16,011
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

273
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:19,038
- You look a little worried.
- I do not look worried.

274
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,248
You do look worried. (del vo)

275
00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:36,193
"Here's a suggestion, computer.
"I assume you read binary.

276
00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:41,159
"So why don't you 011-11-011-011?"

277
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:46,928
Um, while you were typing that,
I searched every database in existence

278
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:49,727
and learned every fact
about everything...

279
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:51,100
And mastered the violin.

280
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,662
Oh, and sold more paper.

281
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:09,418
I asked for assort cutlery,
and I got back spoons.

282
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:10,715
These are worthless.

283
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,881
I want to understand what you're saying,

284
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,007
but it's difficult for me
when you use that tone.

285
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:21,608
Phyllis, these are spoons.

286
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:26,377
Spoons have round tops
and are used to scoop things.

287
00:13:27,324 --> 00:13:28,923
What we need are forks

288
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:33,057
which have prongs
or tiny spears on top.

289
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:36,468
And we need knives which have blades.

290
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:38,763
Do you understand me now?

291
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,601
Yes.

292
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:42,259
Goody.

293
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:48,116
- Hey.
- What's up?

294
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:50,032
- What's going on?
- Paper delivery.

295
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,427
- Oh, yeah?
- Kelly ordered this online.

296
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:04,371
What are you doing?

297
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:07,501
I'm in the fight of my life against
this computer, and every sale counts.

298
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:09,650
But when you put
paper in the shopping cart,

299
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,399
it says, "Thanks for shopping
with Dunder Mifflin."

300
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,852
Damn it, Kelly, it knows!

301
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:16,623
It knows what you did!

302
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:18,712
- Who knows?
- Return it. Return it now.

303
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:19,773
Hey...

304
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,274
How about instead of yelling
at our sweet Miss Kapoor

305
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:25,756
over 500 sheets of paper,
you get back to your desk

306
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,954
and start selling multiple reams,
like a man.

307
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:30,621
You don't understand.

308
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:33,343
Okay,
if this makes the difference,

309
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:35,978
I'm gonna tell it
that you were responsible.

310
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:37,730
Who's "it"?

311
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:45,259
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

312
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:47,273
You still missing Ryan?

313
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:49,297
Not so much anymore.

314
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:56,020
I am not a bad person.

315
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,555
When I left Staples,
I took some of their leads with me,

316
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:00,553
but I never intended to use them.

317
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:02,390
What did intend to do with them?

318
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:05,504
Who knows?
Maybe keep them as a souvenir.

319
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,333
Maybe use them.

320
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:10,964
Yes, Mr. Galliatto, how would you like
to pay 10% less for paper

321
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:12,890
than you're paying right now?

322
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,508
It's not important
how I got your information.

323
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:18,289
What is important
is that you say yes.

324
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:20,056
- Good.
- All right.

325
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:22,173
I'm ready to go,
and I'm calling shotgun.

326
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,978
- I'm driving?
- Yes, thank you.

327
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,320
Let me just say good-bye to Pam.

328
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,008
Oh, yeah, you better.
You better say good-bye to Pam.

329
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,618
Say good-bye to Pam.

330
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:32,539
Good-Bye.

331
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:34,484
I love you.

332
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:39,022
I love you--
Okay.

333
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:41,983
I'm leaving inside Jim's car

334
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:43,923
I don't know when I'll be back again

335
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:45,823
Yes, I do

336
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:48,913
Tomorrow I'll be back

337
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,796
I'll be back tomorrow

338
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:54,565
So you know what? Why don't you guys
take off a little bit early tonight?

339
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,245
Because there's a party.

340
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:59,785
A party for the web site
I've been planning for two weeks.

341
00:16:00,114 --> 00:16:04,147
If you are not this tall,
you may not ride the roller coaster.

342
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:05,789
- See you tomorrow.
- Perfect.

343
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:08,600
So let me just get
some basic information from you.

344
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,936
Oh. I didn't realize we could use the
leads we stole from Staples. (del vo)

345
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,047
I'm sorry, so sorry.

346
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:20,530
Yes, could you repeat that?

347
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:24,583
Yes!
Ten reams for the U.S. district court!

348
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,610
Did I mention the 40 reams
for the battered women's shelter?

349
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:29,747
No!

350
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:36,452
Stop it!
Give me that!

351
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:37,666
Give it!

352
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:40,179
- Did you see the board?
- There's still an hour.

353
00:16:43,114 --> 00:16:44,464
You ever read this?

354
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,737
Yep.

355
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,596
A long time ago, but I liked it.

356
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,043
I got it for Ryan.

357
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,386
I wanted to get him "Oh, the places
you'll go," but they were sold out.

358
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:55,103
It's the same sort of stuff in here.

359
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:56,815
It's not, but it's a good book.

360
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:00,846
What was that?

361
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:02,220
Leaving Pennsylvania.

362
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:04,942
Two kisses.

363
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,416
- One for me, one for Jan.
- Gotcha.

364
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:09,891
You should come for dinner.
You and Pam, that'd be fun.

365
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:11,936
- That would be fun.
- Wanna come over friday?

366
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,034
- I can't.
- After work, you guys--

367
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:15,596
Oh, no, because--

368
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,770
Let me know when we're close.

369
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,782
Yes.
Actually, I will tell you right now.

370
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:25,818
It's a club called chat room,
and there's a password to get in.

371
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:28,121
Which is actually "password," so...

372
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,317
Okay.

373
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:31,093
What are you doing?

374
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:33,703
That is an invitation
to an online party.

375
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,644
No.
I'm sure that's not--

376
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:37,753
Are there...

377
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:40,585
three "Ws"
at the beginning of the address?

378
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,610
- Yes.
- Yep.

379
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,342
Well, the invitation says "VIPs only."

380
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,833
Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan?

381
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:53,607
We're already in the city.

382
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:56,048
The main part with the buildings.

383
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,673
What am I supposed to do?
What do you want me to do tonight?

384
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,970
And if you tell me that I have to drive
back to Scranton to the satellite party,

385
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,868
I am going to throw up.

386
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,690
Okay, I'm going to throw up.

387
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,060
I'm throwing up.
You're making me throw up, Ryan.

388
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:12,173
You know that is is like?
I will tell you.

389
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,584
This is like when the freshmen
would throw a party,

390
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:16,778
and wouldn't let any of the seniors go.

391
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:22,864
Doesn't it piss you off sometimes that
little twerp got the promotion over us?

392
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,961
Oh, actually I withdrew
from consideration.

393
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,566
Yeah, I withdrew too.

394
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:37,045
Four, three,

395
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,467
two, one!

396
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:40,627
Yes!

397
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:46,040
After numerous projections
that the computer would crush

398
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,612
all salesmen in its path,

399
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:50,146
I am very happy to report
that our very own

400
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:52,241
Dwight Schrute

401
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:56,451
has crushed
his electronic nemesis, if you will,

402
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:58,838
by a whopping 52...

403
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,075
- reams!
- Reams!

404
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:02,003
Say it again--
Announcing it.

405
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:04,287
- 52 reams!
- No, no, the first part.

406
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:07,029
Dwight has defeated the computer!

407
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:09,042
Hey.

408
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:10,667
So...

409
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:12,456
What do you think?

410
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:14,457
I did it for you.

411
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:16,345
I didn't ask you to do it for me.

412
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:17,797
You didn't have to.

413
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,324
How do you tell someone it's over?

414
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:23,405
You send them a notarized letter, right?

415
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:25,986
Well, what if the recipient
is your notary?

416
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:30,840
- Hello, Pam.
- Hello.

417
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:34,370
Hey, do you have any men
that you can fix me up with?

418
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,971
I would like
to have a relationship with a man.

419
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,616
I'll get back to you.

420
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:41,849
Let me know.

421
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,369
You beat me.
You are the superior being. (del vo)

422
00:19:57,846 --> 00:19:59,520
All right, who wants to party?

423
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,309
- Why aren't you in New York?
- Oh-ho, what?!

424
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,210
Oh, I think I faked Oscar out.

425
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,771
You said you weren't coming back
and we could leave early.

426
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:08,462
I think I faked Stanley out too.

427
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:11,459
Who else thought that I was leaving,
and that he could go home early?

428
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:12,431
Gotcha,

429
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:14,060
gotcha, gotcha.

430
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,838
Well, who needs New York?

431
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:18,702
Right? We can have a killer party
right here in Scranton.

432
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:19,746
Thank you.

433
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:22,803
No, no. It's gonna be nothing
like the party you've been planning.

434
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:24,666
This is going to be good.

435
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:26,645
And everybody's gonna come.

436
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:28,992
What's wrong with Dwight?

437
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:32,318
- He beat the computer.
- Oh, hey, good for you.

438
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:34,163
Good for you.
Scranton power!

439
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,266
You know what? Angela, I'd like you
to come into my office in ten minutes.

440
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:40,695
Bring something to write with,
and to write on.

441
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:41,855
Good.

442
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,478
It was a pretty disappointing day.

443
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:49,196
It was kind of a slap in the face.

444
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,526
To realize that...

445
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:56,439
I wasn't as important as I thought I was
to a certain young executive...

446
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:58,275
Who I'd cared about.

447
00:20:58,435 --> 00:21:01,088
But you know, I'm not gonna cry over it.

448
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:03,620
I did that in the car on the way home.

449
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:06,266
- How we doing on time?
- The party starts in an hour.

450
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:09,605
Good, these are some things
that I would like to have happen.

451
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:15,400
"Beer, light beer, streamers, orchids,
better lighting, something made of ice."

452
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,524
It's just things.
This is how I want it to feel.

453
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:20,135
"Pizza with mushrooms, pizza
without mushrooms, white pi-- "

454
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,252
I would like this party

455
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:25,592
to be sexier,
cooler, more important--

456
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,247
"Chocolates, someone famous,
cool music,

457
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:30,231
confetti, go-go dancers"?

458
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:32,822
I want it
to embarrass all other parties.

459
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,220
I want it to be a party
that the guys in New York

460
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,268
watch on the web cam and say,

461
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,950
"How did they get Al Roker to come?"

462
00:21:41,495 --> 00:21:43,053
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

463
00:21:43,213 --> 00:21:45,429
Yes, you can.
I know you can.

464
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:48,118
I wouldn't say that
if I didn't 100% believe it.

465
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:49,438
Who else could do this?

466
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:52,630
- Okay. Okay.
- No, seriously.

467
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,557
Anyone else could do it better?
Because we don't have a lot of time.

468
00:21:58,226 --> 00:21:59,657
I'll get the pizza.

469
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:07,394
What do you think of Angela?

470
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:10,765
I think she's efficient.

471
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:12,793
No, not like that.
As a woman.

472
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:16,788
W-O-M-A-N

473
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:18,278
I hadn't noticed.

474
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:20,775
You hadn't noticed she's a woman?

475
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:24,395
I hear she's single and ready to mingle.

476
00:22:25,082 --> 00:22:26,784
I'm thinking
about making a play for her.

477
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:29,380
What do you think?
Crazy, right?

478
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:32,975
I think it's inappropriate
to date someone you work with.

479
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:35,225
- Isn't that part of the fun?
- No.

480
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:37,001
I think you should date Kelly.

481
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,517
She works here too.
How is that any different?

482
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:42,748
She works in the annex.

483
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:45,265
You're also welcome to date Toby.

484
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:48,542
Okay.

485
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:51,829
- Good news.
- We get to go home?

486
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:55,986
Guess who just ordered
from your favorite pizza place, <i>Alfredo</i>?

487
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:57,651
Wait...

488
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,140
<i>Alfredo's pizza cafe</i>...

489
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:02,218
Or <i>pizza by Alfredo</i>?

490
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,159
- Same thing.
- No.

491
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:07,731
I don't understand
when you all talk at the same time!

492
00:23:07,891 --> 00:23:09,994
Oscar, talk to him.

493
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:13,134
Michael, there's a very big difference
between these two pizza places.

494
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:17,068
Both in quality of ingredients
and in overall taste.

495
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:19,106
Which one did you order from?

496
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:21,684
<i>Pizza by Alfredo</i>.

497
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,249
All right, you know what?
Okay, okay.

498
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:25,369
What is better,

499
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,632
a medium amount of good pizza,

500
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:30,321
or all you can eat
of pretty good pizza?

501
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:32,159
A medium amount of good pizza.

502
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:35,801
Oh, no, it's bad.

503
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:38,991
It's real bad.

504
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:42,509
It's like eating
a hot circle of garbage.

505
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:47,515
You can pick one of these things.

506
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,628
It's unreasonable for you
to ask me to do all of this.

507
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:55,055
It should take you no time if you put
the care into it that you normally do.

508
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:01,727
That seemed to shut her up.

509
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:08,401
You looking for dinner and a movie?
You're not gonna find it in that box.

510
00:24:10,874 --> 00:24:13,155
It just so happens
I know where you can find it,

511
00:24:13,315 --> 00:24:14,416
but again...

512
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,536
Not in the box.

513
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:23,183
Angela, are you hearing
words that I'm saying?

514
00:24:23,343 --> 00:24:24,144
What?

515
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:25,475
Hello.

516
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:29,273
I worked on a party for 3 weeks
that just got thrown out the window.

517
00:24:29,496 --> 00:24:31,304
So now I've to organize
a whole new party.

518
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,321
And my useless number two quit,

519
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:35,729
so now there's no one in charge
of orchids, chocolates,

520
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:37,025
or the ice made thing.

521
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,561
And my upper back itched all day,
and I can't reach it.

522
00:24:40,054 --> 00:24:42,393
And Kevin had
greek food for lunch again.

523
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:48,917
They say you should never mix
business with pleasure.

524
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:50,042
Really?

525
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:53,652
Well then explain to me
how a putt-putt golf company operates.

526
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,429
- Yep.
- <i>The</i> Pizza by Alfredo <i>guy is here.</i>

527
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:04,152
- You don't have to say it like that.
- <i>I said it normal.</i>

528
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,798
- Hey.
- Hey.

529
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,020
Uh, $63.50,
and that's not including tip.

530
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,387
Right, I've a coupon, so half of $63.50,
and half the tip on $63.50...

531
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:20,425
Half-off coupons only apply
to orders of two pizzas.

532
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,893
No, I told them on phone
I was ordering eight pizzas.

533
00:25:23,372 --> 00:25:26,097
I don't care what you told them
on the phone. That's our policy.

534
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:29,148
You didn't think that I was gonna
spend 60 bucks on pizza?

535
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:30,330
It's not pizza.

536
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:33,202
It doesn't say it
anywhere on the coupon,

537
00:25:33,362 --> 00:25:35,708
and if it's your policy,
it should say it on the coupon.

538
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,666
What do you mean?

539
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:41,114
- Not my problem.
- It is your problem.

540
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,662
That's no way to do business, okay?

541
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:48,256
I ordered
eight pizzas with a half-off coupon,

542
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:51,380
so I would like eight pizzas
for half off, end of story.

543
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:53,194
Great story.

544
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:56,693
- $63.50, and that's not including tip.
- I'm not giving that to you.

545
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:58,695
Then, you're not getting your pizzas.

546
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:00,348
No, no, you're not--

547
00:26:00,997 --> 00:26:02,849
You are not going anywhere.

548
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:05,691
You're going to stay here
until we figure this out.

549
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:07,636
- What?
- You know what?

550
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,927
This young man needs to learn
that that's not how you treat people.

551
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:14,168
I don't care if it's pizza.

552
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:17,492
Good business is
about respect and accountability

553
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:20,464
and follow-through.
You don't just make promises

554
00:26:20,624 --> 00:26:23,525
and pull the rug out
from under somebody, do you?

555
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:26,384
Dwight, please escort this young man
into the conference room.

556
00:26:26,556 --> 00:26:27,589
Right now.

557
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:29,482
- I'm not going in there.
- Yeah, you are.

558
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:32,239
And you'll come out
when you decide to give me a discount.

559
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:33,606
Please.
Thank you.

560
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,468
This is stupid.

561
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:38,438
No, you don't even know what stupid is!

562
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:42,197
It's about to get all stupid up in here!

563
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:54,282
You find anything?

564
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,393
We think
it's a straight forward kidnapping.

565
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,398
Stanley,
could you look up "accomplices?"

566
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:00,863
Why can't you guys do it?

567
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:02,896
Because we're looking up "jail time."

568
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:04,312
Fine.

569
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:08,335
I've seen this kid, he sneaks
onto my farm and steals my hemp.

570
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:09,686
Yeah, I know that guy.

571
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:12,009
He's that farmer
that grows really crappy weed.

572
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:22,398
- You ready to give me my discount now?
- No.

573
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:25,066
What have you done in here
this whole time?

574
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,409
- What kind of business is this?
- A paper company.

575
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,561
The best paper company
in the whole wide world!

576
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:31,152
Dwight, knock it off.

577
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,358
You'd better think
about what you're doing.

578
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:35,877
Think about what you're doing.

579
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:36,942
No.

580
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:40,537
I'm an adult.
I don't have to think or do anything.

581
00:27:40,697 --> 00:27:43,625
You're a kid.
You're a little snot-nose punk kid

582
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:45,559
who thinks he's better
than everybody else.

583
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:47,252
Because he's some hotshot.

584
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:49,539
And you don't know anything about sales.

585
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:51,660
So stop being
a disrespectful little jerk, okay?

586
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,945
- Sales?
- Yeah, sales. You sell pizza.

587
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,143
- That's called sales.
- You're such a loser.

588
00:27:56,322 --> 00:27:57,985
- What did you call him?
- A loser.

589
00:27:58,145 --> 00:27:59,954
- What did you say?!
- A loser.

590
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:01,644
Okay, stop it.
Stop it!

591
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:03,381
Stop getting him to say it!

592
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:06,623
- You just made this worse. A lot worse.
- I can make him talk.

593
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:09,195
We are accomplices.

594
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,068
Stop talking all at once!

595
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:14,254
- You need to let him go.
- Let go of little jerk boy?

596
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:15,879
Before he has learned his lesson?

597
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,508
- Yes.
- You know what, Jim?

598
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:21,378
World would be a better place if people
were held accountable for their actions.

599
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:23,098
Yes, but not by kidnapping them.

600
00:28:23,317 --> 00:28:26,494
I'm not kidnapping him.
I'm keeping him until I get what I want.

601
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:27,824
As a hostage.

602
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,238
- You over-think it.
- You under-think it.

603
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:31,857
Yes, is Alfredo there?

604
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:34,815
May I speak to manager then?

605
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:39,504
Okay, could you tell the manager
that I am keeping his delivery kid

606
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:42,417
until I get my discount
on the eight pizzas I ordered?

607
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,786
Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.

608
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:48,505
Also, I would like him to throw in...

609
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:51,898
two--
three pizzas

610
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,656
just for our...

611
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,089
- Ransom.
- trouble.

612
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:57,801
Okay.

613
00:28:58,345 --> 00:28:59,346
All right.

614
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:02,600
- What'd he say?
- He said no.

615
00:29:02,786 --> 00:29:04,969
- So we should let him go.
- No, no.

616
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,636
Listen up, kid.

617
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:10,642
I don't like you,

618
00:29:10,802 --> 00:29:14,764
but because some town in Switzerland
says so, you have rights.

619
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:21,237
I have to hang these.

620
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,769
Why are you looking at her like that?

621
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:31,943
Hey!

622
00:29:42,692 --> 00:29:43,785
What's going on?

623
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:45,847
Michael called the pizza place
with demands.

624
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:47,597
Mr. Overdramatic.
What's up, Kev?

625
00:29:47,757 --> 00:29:49,563
We're getting hungry out there.

626
00:29:50,593 --> 00:29:54,592
We're all accomplices now anyway,
so we figured we might as well eat.

627
00:29:55,293 --> 00:30:00,134
We would like to order some good pizza
from <i>Alfredo's pizza cafe</i>

628
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:04,232
while we wait for the hostage situation
with the bad pizza to end.

629
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:08,845
I needed another hour.

630
00:30:09,052 --> 00:30:10,832
It could have been done in another hour.

631
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,442
I think it looks good.

632
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:14,540
That's why
you're not in charge, Meredith.

633
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:23,143
Here you are, my dear.
One thing made of ice.

634
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:26,681
How did you...

635
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,439
Where--
Where did you...

636
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,224
It's just ice.
It'll melt all over the floor.

637
00:30:32,403 --> 00:30:34,591
- Will you help me put it over there?
- Yes, I will.

638
00:30:35,192 --> 00:30:36,350
Excuse me.

639
00:30:37,522 --> 00:30:38,522
I stole it.

640
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:43,899
Thank god.

641
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:47,997
Ryan wants to introduce
the branch managers in a few minutes.

642
00:30:48,157 --> 00:30:50,049
You just have to wave
and introduce yourself.

643
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:51,795
I'll just wave and introduce myself.

644
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,843
- Quick question.
- Yeah.

645
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:56,479
If I take a pizza,

646
00:30:56,879 --> 00:31:00,018
do you think you could take some sodas
and some napkins up to the roof?

647
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:02,415
- I'm all over it.
- Okay.

648
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:04,557
What do we got here?

649
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:06,700
- Good pizza.
- Yeah?

650
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,653
- Cheese, or do we have other flavors?
- Different stuff.

651
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:11,315
Which one's this?
Perfect.

652
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:16,847
Do you remember what you said to me
on my first day at work,

653
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:18,741
just before
you walked me over to my desk?

654
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:23,664
"Enjoy this moment, because you're never
going to go back to this time

655
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:25,441
"before you met your desk-mate Dwight."

656
00:31:26,445 --> 00:31:27,932
And that's when I knew.

657
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:29,536
You?

658
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:31,772
You came up to my desk and you said,

659
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:33,446
"This might sound weird,

660
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,485
"and there's no reason for me
to know this,

661
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:39,474
"but that mixed berry yogurt
you're about to eat has expired."

662
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:41,867
That was the moment
that you knew you liked me?

663
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:42,828
Yep.

664
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,512
- Can we make it a different moment?
- Nope.

665
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:51,990
Can I start talking?

666
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:56,386
<i>Is this thing on? Give me a signal
when you want me to start.</i>

667
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:02,469
<i>And now, from my old hometown,
Scranton, Pennsylvania,</i>

668
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,204
<i>my former boss,
Michael Scott.</i>

669
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,191
I just think you should know

670
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:10,130
that one of my salesmen
beat your stupid computer.

671
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,813
So take that, asshole.

672
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:15,710
<i>Always a jokester.</i>

673
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,805
<i>How about that image?
Crystal clear.</i>

674
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:25,506
If anyone out there is listening,
I'm being held here against my will.

675
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,023
I'm a minor.

676
00:32:32,002 --> 00:32:33,052
What are you doing?

677
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:35,046
You said your upper back itched.

678
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:37,162
- I didn't ask you to scratch it.
- Angela,

679
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,207
I know this is weird
because we work together,

680
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:42,950
and because up until and possibly
including now, I've repulsed you.

681
00:32:43,614 --> 00:32:45,899
- But I like you.
- I'm not dating you.

682
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:51,456
So Angela is stubborn as a mule.

683
00:32:53,064 --> 00:32:57,133
She's giving off fairly strong vibes
that she's not interested.

684
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:02,638
But do I like her or not?

685
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:05,156
Because if I like her,

686
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:08,052
then I can't back down.

687
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:13,000
If you're going number one,
you've got ten more seconds!

688
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:16,938
Hey, have you seen Jim?

689
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:19,535
I guess he wanted get out of here
before the cops find out.

690
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:25,714
What are you doing?

691
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:28,998
Scaring him. The trick is to make him
think you're gonna do something to him.

692
00:33:29,158 --> 00:33:31,788
- I can hear you, man.
- Shut up! Or I punch you in the throat!

693
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:33,237
Stop it!
Stop it!

694
00:33:33,397 --> 00:33:35,775
No. God.
Oh, my god.

695
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:38,023
Oh, my god.

696
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:43,136
I kidnapped a kid.

697
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:45,542
You had to.
What other choice did you have?

698
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,542
I've gotta pay for the pizza.

699
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:49,266
Well...

700
00:33:50,182 --> 00:33:51,087
Yeah.

701
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:54,524
Oh, my god.

702
00:33:57,316 --> 00:33:59,389
- This is Michael.
- <i>Hello, Michael, this is Ryan.</i>

703
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:02,721
- <i>First off, thanks for the shout-out.</i>
- You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

704
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:06,686
<i>Why's there a kid on your web cam saying
that he's being held against his...</i>

705
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:12,228
I want you to go in there

706
00:34:12,543 --> 00:34:16,354
and pay him for the pizzas,
and give him a generous tip.

707
00:34:17,364 --> 00:34:18,358
No more than 10%.

708
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:20,631
- What will you do?
- I...

709
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,505
will open the door.

710
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:24,814
- Yeah?
- And hopefully,

711
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,595
he will walk out.

712
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:30,762
And the rest is out of our hands.

713
00:34:32,147 --> 00:34:34,497
So I'm paying full price?

714
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:35,605
Yes.

715
00:34:36,754 --> 00:34:37,802
Here we go.

716
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:39,236
$65.

717
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:40,764
You know what?

718
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,490
Here's two more.

719
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:49,167
See ya.
Drive safely.

720
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,930
Okay.

721
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,795
Now what?

722
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,127
Now we wait
and hope that nothing happens.

723
00:34:59,151 --> 00:35:00,019
All right.

724
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:01,860
I assume I'm going to be reimbursed?

725
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,021
Not now, Dwight, please.
Not the time.

726
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:07,475
A toast.

727
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,970
Better make it good.

728
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:13,410
To avoiding a class 2 felony charge.

729
00:35:20,396 --> 00:35:21,380
Hello?

730
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,084
Hey.
Hang on a second.

731
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:31,831
Hello?
Hang on.

732
00:35:42,521 --> 00:35:45,941
If you change your mind

733
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,200
I'll be first in line

734
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,424
Honey, I'm still free

735
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:52,250
Take a chance on me

736
00:35:53,057 --> 00:35:57,084
If you need me let me know
Gonna be around

737
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:01,518
If you got no place to go
If you're feeling down

738
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:03,695
If you're all alone

739
00:36:04,177 --> 00:36:06,334
When the pretty birds have flown

740
00:36:06,494 --> 00:36:08,146
Honey, I'm still free

741
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,491
Take a chance on me

742
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:13,137
Gonna do my very best

743
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:15,126
And that ain't no lie

744
00:36:15,462 --> 00:36:17,619
If you put me to the test

745
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,374
If you let me try

746
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:23,852
Take a chance on me

747
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,926
That's all I ask of you, Angela.

748
00:36:52,304 --> 00:36:54,089
- <i>Hey, how'd it go?</i>
- <i>Yeah, what'd she say?</i>

749
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:55,287
I don't know yet.

750
00:36:55,828 --> 00:36:56,964
I've to call you back.

751
00:36:57,124 --> 00:36:59,077
- <i>You gotta give us--</i>
- I'll call you back!

752
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:03,368
I have to go clean up after the party.

753
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:22,674
What a horrible day.

754
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:31,228
Well, I need to get the horrible taste
of this pizza out of my mouth.

755
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:34,289
I'd really like some sushi.

756
00:37:34,663 --> 00:37:37,721
I was hoping that I would have
New York-style sushi today.

757
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,227
And you know what?

758
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:41,471
- What?
- I'm gonna get it.

759
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:43,757
Cooper says calamari.

760
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,346
There's only one place
to get New York-style sushi.

761
00:37:47,506 --> 00:37:48,741
- Tokyo?
- New York.

762
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:50,663
You wanna go?

763
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:52,230
- Yes!
- All right, you drive.

764
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,391
Okay!

765
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,285
- Nice!
- Here we go.

766
00:37:58,573 --> 00:38:01,275
I'm sorry--
You guys are gonna have to leave.

767
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:03,815
Hey, you know what?

768
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,040
Come on. Come on.
Let's go!

769
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:18,901
Hey, you're the Scranton guy.

770
00:38:19,774 --> 00:38:21,855
- Guilty.
- I liked your statement tonight.

771
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:24,007
Okay.
Thanks.

772
00:38:25,446 --> 00:38:27,721
This is the guy that beat the computer.

773
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:30,849
Oh, very cool. It was funny
to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.

774
00:38:31,863 --> 00:38:32,864
Yeah.

775
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:34,230
See you later.

776
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:36,322
Later on.

777
00:38:38,102 --> 00:38:39,888
I'm Ryan, and...

778
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:42,914
tonight didn't go the way
that I thought it would.

779
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:45,631
Because...
it didn't work out for me.

780
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:47,425
I'm very embarrassed.

781
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:49,098
I have egg all over my face.

782
00:38:49,258 --> 00:38:50,712
And...
I'm 12 years old.

783
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:53,785
I spent so much time in Scranton,
but I never sold any paper.

784
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:56,495
I never sold any paper,
because I'm an idiot.

785
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:58,541
I started a fire with my cheese peeler.

786
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:01,207
And dated an indian girl.

787
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,750
I started a fire.

788
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,419
Now I got a beard.

789
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,963
And I have new shoes
and I'm your boss.

790
