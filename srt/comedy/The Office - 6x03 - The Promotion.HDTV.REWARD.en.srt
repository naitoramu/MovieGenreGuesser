1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,691
I'm sorry, you guys
have probably noticed

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:05,397
my stomach's a little
more sensitive lately.

3
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:08,737
So, if you wouldn't mind
wearing a little less perfume.

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,776
And if your lunch
is especially pungent,

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,607
maybe have it
in the break room.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,078
We would really
appreciate it.

7
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:17,173
Pam is constantly throwing up
because of the pregnancy.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,084
<i>If she eats something the fetus
doesn't like, she is screwed.</i>

9
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:25,250
It's amazing, a three-ounce
fetus is calling the shots.

10
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,722
It's so badass.

11
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,286
Phyllis, if you could
switch to a different soap,

12
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,458
just for a month or two.
Yours is kind of perfumey.

13
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,263
Now this is getting
ridiculous.

14
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,100
Oh, gee. I'm sorry. I
guess I missed the meeting

15
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,572
where we all voted
for you to get pregnant.

16
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:47,235
No. I reserve the right to peel
my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.

17
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,941
All morning I look forward
to my afternoon cigars.

18
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,143
And I am not stopping
for anybody.

19
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,576
I don't think I'm asking for too much.

20
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:58,055

of courtesy in the workplace.

do you think?

26

I spent all morning doing it.

27
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,762
It is really
special.

28
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:19,061
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to
do that to our... No. It's great.

29
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,267
Well, it's just a really
important day for me.

Well, congrats.
Thanks.

be closed today and Friday

32
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,078
for a company wedding
in Niagara Falls.

33
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,450
So please leave a message and we'll
get back to you as soon as possible.

34

Have a great day.

35
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,952
Believe it or not, Kevin,
firecrackers are in the "Don't" column.

36
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,085
So, you're going to
provide them, then?

37
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,754
No, this is a firecracker-free wedding.

38
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,695
What the hell? You've
got to be kidding me.

39
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,824
Okay, all of these things
are important to remember,

40
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,232
but the most
important thing

41
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,564
is that no one
say anything

42
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,161
about my pregnancy
at the wedding.

43
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,933
Absolutely. Because not everyone knows

44
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,304
and some people
might be offended.

45
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,536
Decent people everywhere
will get offended.

46
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,238
Well, we're thinking of my
grandmother, who we haven't told

47
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,610
and who is very
old-fashioned.

48
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,774
Well, you're lucky
to have a grandmother.

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,841
Some of us have to be
our own grandmother.

50
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,218
You know, Angela, you don't
have to come to the wedding.

51
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,756
Really, Pam? Yes, she
does. Yes, she does.

52
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,415
We're all going to go and
we're going to have a good time.

Ow! He pinched me.
No.

54
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,429
Next time we're all in this
room, Jim and I will be married.

55
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,521
We'll see.

56
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,587
Thank you,
Dwight.

57
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,826
Goodbye.
See you later.

58

OSCAR: Bye.
Bye.

59

Hey, and don't embarrass me
when we go to Niagara.

my joke. Don't steal my joke.

00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,214
No, I didn't
steal your joke.

64
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,647
Yes, I said
that yesterday.

65
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,048
But you can say that
about anything.

No, no, no, no. Please,
please. Dwight, that's my joke.

69
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,516
Yeah, but it's so easy. That's
what I'm saying. You can say...

70
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,255
No, okay. This is what
I am talking about.

71
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,459
When we leave here and
go up to Niagara Falls,

72
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,832
we are representing
Dunder Mifflin, everyone.

73
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,064
This is a very important
wedding for this branch.

74
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,765
The most important wedding
until I get married.

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,899
So I want you all
on your best behavior,

76
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,170
or so help me God...

77
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:10,071
So I will see you
up there in Viagra Falls.

78
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,718
Pam and Jim's wedding will be
the single best pickup destination

in the history
of the universe.

from Jim's desk,

on both sides of the family.

82

Yes.

For instance, Pam's
cousin, Jocelyn Webster.

85
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,336
There's a name.

(LAUGHING)

87

Two years ago, she was
selling a mountain bike.

88

Oh! Well, tell me
about Jocelyn.

89

Yes.

90

What's she like?
I will, I will.

91
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,608
Well, she's really into mountain
biking. But not so much lately.

92
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,710
Okay.

93
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,381
She had a couple
hundred dollars to spend.

94
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,425
I mean, if she was able
to sell her bike.

Is that all
you have on her?

96

Well, if this is in fact her,
because it's a very common name.

Okay,

and then tomorrow night
is the honeymoon suite.

157
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,640
Great.

158
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,345
I know, we're pretty excited, too.

159
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,047
Can we take a look
at the suite now?

160
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,022
I'm sorry.
Somebody just checked in.

161
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,456
Is there another wedding
at the hotel this weekend?

162
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,359
Oh, no. Just an
individual. That man there.

163
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,421
Hey, I got the room
the night before you guys.

164
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,727
I'll break in the bed.

165
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,131
(CHUCKLES)

166
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,699
I don't like that.

167
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,205
I'm going to need the
name and cell phone number

168
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,071
of the housekeeper responsible
for changing the sheets, please.

169
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,913
Hello, reservation
for Michael Scott.

170
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,174
One moment
while I check.

171
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,081
Their proximity to the falls makes
everything smell like a basement.

172
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,140
Mmm-hmm.

173
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,414
I'm sorry, sir. I'm
not seeing you in here.

174
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,115
When did you make
your reservation?

175
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,588
I don't have
a reservation,

176
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,683
but I want a room in the
Beesly-Halpert block of rooms.

177
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,491
Oh! Okay. Unfortunately, sir, the
block only applies to the rate.

178
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,191
I'm afraid
we're all sold out.

179
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,894
Dwight Schrute.
I have a reservation.

180
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:29,335
Confirmation number,
Romeo-Tango-G-seven- seven-four-five.

181
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,602
Yes. Schrute.

182
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,271
And I had spoken to Teresa
about a room with two safes.

183
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,076
Sure, no problem.
DWIGHT: Okay.

184
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,376
There's your key, Mr.
Schrute. Well, good.

185
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,439
Thank you.

186
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,951
Dwight. Dwight,
Dwight, Dwight.

187
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,043
I need to stay
in your room.

188
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,109
No way. What if
I meet someone?

189
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,553
I'm staying in your...
Come on, Dwight.

190
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,749
No. Michael. I would
do the same for you.

191
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,848
You would?
Yes.

192
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,859
Really?
Yes. Let's just go.

193
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,795
Wait a second. No, no, no. This
must be some kind of mistake.

194
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,798
This reservation
is under an M. Scott.

195
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,163
Oh!
This must be yours.

196
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,565
Thank God.

197
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,434
Oh, no. Now that I don't have
a room, can I stay with you?

198
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,597
Um...

199
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,704
No. You know what, I would
say yes, but you can't.

200
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,836
And I'll tell you why.

201
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:07,902
Please.

202
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,174
If I have
a woman up there

203
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,545
and things are
getting amorous,

204
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,050
she's going to get turned off
if she looks in the bathroom

205
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,088
and she sees you brushing your
teeth with butter and clay, okay?

206
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,318
Okay, okay. Ah, ha-ha! That
was a test and you have failed

207
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,622
for this is
my room, okay?

208
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,628
You would not share with
me. I don't have a room?

209
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,254
No, you do not.
Okay.

210
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,367
(MOCKINGLY) Ooh! You must
pass the dungeon wisdom test.

211
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,526
Jerk.
It worked.

212
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:34,232
When Mary was denied a room
at the inn, Jesus was born.

213
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,504
When Michael was denied
a room at the inn,

214
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,139
we don't know what happens because
that story hasn't been told yet.

215
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,244
Mr. And Mrs. Stanley Hudson.

216
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,913
Hey, Stanley, favor. Could
I stay in your room tonight?

217
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,390
Are you out of your mind?
I brought Cynthia with me.

218
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,188
Not in the same bed.
In the other bed.

219
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,161
I got one queen-sized bed.

220
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,322
You are kidding me.

221
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,031
A queen-sized bed
is five feet wide.

222
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,261
I am not five feet
wide, Michael.

223
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,567
I'm not a physics major, Stanley.
I'm just saying, be careful.

224
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,904
Hey, guys. Hey, could I
stay in your room tonight?

225
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,603
Oh, gross.
Blow my brains out.

226
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,110
That's rude.

227
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,246
Michael, I have an extra
twin bed if you want.

228
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,148
You are going to be sleeping by
yourself for the rest of your life,

229
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,686
so you should
just get used to it.

230
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,748
So, which one
is Pam's grandma?

231
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:29,159
Oh, Meemaw? She's the
one in the teal suit.

232
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,856
She's the only 80-year-old
with no smile wrinkles.

233
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,695
Dad, remember, no mention
of the baby, right?

234
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,756
No.

235
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,359
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
she's very conservative.

236
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,300
So, mum's the word.

237
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,340
Mom, Dad, this is Michael
Scott. How you doing?

238
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,431
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

239
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,203
Nice to meet you.
Who's doing a toast?

240
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,141
I would like to go third,
sort of bat cleanup if...

241
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,009
Michael, I thought
we discussed

242
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,708
that we'd rather you
not speak, like, at all.

243
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,217
Because it's just going to
be blood relatives, I think.

244
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,276
That is seriously going
to impede my ability

245
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,618
to hook up with
your female relatives.

246
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,120
Pretty sure
everybody heard that.

247
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,659

Hey, Meemaw.

250
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,930
I wasn't sure about
your branch of the family

251
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,235
after I heard about
your parents' divorce.

252
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,737
But you and Jim
are just perfect.

253
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,003
God bless you.

254
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,913
Thank you,
but nobody's perfect.

255
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,944
Well, I wouldn't care to
live if I thought that.

257
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,215
Mr. Beesly,
how are you?

258
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,259
I'd like you to meet Kristy Kelly.

259

your niece?

No, no. She's my girlfriend. Hey,
can you make room at the head table?

262

From quarter three
to quarter four, up 17%.

While his sales, down 2%.
It's all there in the report.

264
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,137
Why would they make
the bad man your boss

265
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,269
if you're
so much smarter?

266
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,337
Excellent question.
Because while I was busy

267
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:00,078
trying to improve the company
and make it a success, Jim...

268
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,347
The bad man was busy
kissing the boss man's butt.

That's right. It is ew. It's very ew.

I'm sorry, it's Kevin?
I thought it was Gil.

She thought I was
your boyfriend.

You thought
I was dating this?

What the hell is
wrong with you?

an honest mistake.

I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean...

Are you seeing
anyone right now?

How did Meredith get put
at the young people's table?

She probably switched

What am I supposed
to do with that, Dwight?

303
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,977
That's a very
good record.

304
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,710
All right, so I'll be like, "He
is so sweet, guys, and so kind."

305
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,183
That's when
I'll do the face like...

a little punch to the back.

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,914
Never too married
for a noogie.

310
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,117
Never.

311
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:51,061
They have hilarious material and they're
going to totally deliver it wrong.

312
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,691
I would kill with the brother
stuff. It should be me up there.

313
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,702
It should be me and Pete,
not Pete and Tom.

314
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,106
Pam, you've got
the greatest smile

315
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,005
and your body
is really fine.

00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,100
Smoking.

317
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,771
Hoping it'll make our
wives kick it up a notch.

318

(LAUGHING)
A little more cardio.

319
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,450
That's not appropriate.

(TINKLING GLASS)

321
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,784
Hello. Hi, everybody.

322
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,346
I promised I wasn't going to
make a toast and I'm not going to.

323
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,392
Just going to do a little
freestanding comedy,

324
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,483
and if at the end

325
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,755
everybody wants to raise
their glasses to Pam and Jim,

326
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,353
then so be it.

327
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:30,164
Hey, what is the deal
with the Smart car?

328
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,966
How smart is that?
Those things are tiny.

329
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,733
Can you even drive
them in traffic?

330
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:40,006
(MOCKINGLY) "Oh, I'm so smart. E
equals MC squared. I drive a Smart car."

331
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,603
That's not smart
in my book.

332
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,944
The real smart car
is KITT,

333

<i>from Knight Rider.
Knight Rider.</i>

334
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,811
That's a car that can talk.
Can Smart car talk?

335
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,913
Nope. That's not smart.
No.

336
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,150
And also Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

337
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,248
DWIGHT: Very smart.

338
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,419
And everybody
can laugh.

339
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,063
It doesn't have to just be the
idiots. Everybody can laugh.

340
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,724
Nope.
Yeah, go ahead.

341
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,631
JIM: All right. Hey,
everyone. Thanks for coming.

342
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,691
PETE: (COUGHS) Douche!

343
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,101
Aw! Thanks, Pete.
That was really nice.

344
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,639
I just want to say
how happy we are

345
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,140
that all of you
are here tonight.

346
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,336
And I want to especially
thank those of you

347
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,847
who have traveled from far
away to be here with us tonight.

348
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,110
Especially
the Florida cousins,

349
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,878
who obviously
can't take a hint.

350

(ALL LAUGH)

351
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,113
Four years ago,
I was just a guy

352
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,589
who had a crush on a girl
who had a boyfriend.

353
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,323
And I had to do the hardest
thing that I've ever had to do,

354
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,557
which was just to wait.

355
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,400
Don't get me wrong,
I flirted with her.

356
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,527
Pam, I can now admit in
front of friends and family

357
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,196
that I do know how
to make a photocopy.

358
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,261
(ALL LAUGHING)

359
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,308
Didn't need your help
that many times.

360
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,343
And do you remember
how long it took you

361
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,878
to teach me how
to drive stick?

362
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,675
Like a year.

363
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,442
I've been driving stick
since high school.

364
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,505
(ALL LAUGHING)

365
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,246
So, yes, yes. For a really
long time that's all I had.

366
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:59,223
I just had little moments with
a girl who saw me as a friend.

367
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,590
And a lot of people told me
I was crazy to wait this long

368
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,595
for a date with a girl
who I worked with,

369
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,257
but I think
even then I knew that

370
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,566
I was waiting
for my wife.

371
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,625
(ALL SIGH)

372
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,468
So, I would like
to propose a toast.

373
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,001
So, if you'd all raise your glasses,
not Pam, for obvious reasons.

374
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,908
But everyone else, if you
would raise your glasses...

375
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,245
What's obvious?
Why can't Pam drink?

376
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,852
Pam can't drink? Who... I didn't...
I shouldn't have said that.

377
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,548
I don't know why I did. She
can do whatever she wants.

378
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:34,615
Though she shouldn't. She shouldn't
because she's an alcoholic.

379
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,717
Pam is an alcoholic.

That's not true. No.

(STUTTERING) What we
wanted... The real reason

383
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,968
is that Pam's pregnant.

Okay, okay, okay.

Hey, what I think Jim
is trying to say is that

387
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,574
they had an accident.

388
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,747
And you know what? These two
people, they're living together,

389
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,347
they are having
lots of consensual sex.

390
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,120
They were living together?

391
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,423
Yes, yes, they were
living together. Yes.

392
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:16,366
And you know what? You can't expect
them to be careful every time,

393
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,665
because, frankly, it's
just a different sensation.

394
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,329
Michael.
When you come... Well?

395
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,499
Am I wrong? They say
it's not different,

396
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,768
but it's a different
sensation...

JIM: Oh, my God, no, please.

398
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,546
...when you use
something to block...

399

I think everybody knows
what I am talking about.

400
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,873
It's not necessarily
different for the woman.

404
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,821
All right.

405
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,016
My point is, I said
what I wanted to say.

406
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,460
And, Meemaw, I hope
you heard every word.

<i>The hotel's television set had a
movie on called Brüno last night.</i>

413
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,684
The remote control had so
darn many buttons on it,

414
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,152
I couldn't
turn it off.

415
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,281
So, I had to just sit there
while it happened to me.

416
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:16,350
I wondered, "How could
they pick such a hotel?"

417
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,090
Hmm. Now I know.

Meemaw.

419
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,600
(WHISPERING) I think it was a
little touch-and-go at first,

420
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,730
but we saved it,
I believe.

421
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,865
I can't believe
it was me.

422
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,042
I know. I can't believe
it was you, either.

423
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,377
I actually think it takes
a lot of pressure off of me.

424
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,938
Is there something
about being a manager

425
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,108
that makes you say
stupid things?

426
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,412
I have not found
that to be the case.

Hey, smooth guys.

428
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:42,711
I am so sorry.

Can you believe it?
He screwed up, not me.

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,867
Oh! You're that foul man that
kept talking about intercourse.

<i>MICHAEL: I am actually
great with old women.</i>

In fact, for the longest time my
best friend was my grandmother.

440
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,214
And then she met Harriet,

441
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,417
and now she thinks she's
better than everybody.

442

I want to go to bed,
but I can't.

I can't turn that
television off.

Oh! Okay, well.
Hook you up there.

Oh. Isn't he terrible?
May I?

449
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,006
Here's the thing.

450
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,043
Meemaw, I think you
just need to chill out

451
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,883
about this whole "Pam
getting pregnant" thing.

452
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,924
It's not 1890 anymore.
It's modern day.

453
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,926
And women have sex
before marriage.

454
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,518
And I think we need
to celebrate that.

455
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,622
And I know, in your day, she
would be considered a whore.

456
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,864
But now, women go out
and they have sex,

457
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,839
and they get wild, and
they take their tops off.

458
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,205
And they have pictures taken of them.

459
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,437
And we need to encourage
that. That's part of life.

460
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,844
People are like cats
and dogs these days.

461
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,040
Exactly.

(BELL DINGS)

620
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,955
Good morning,
how can I help you?

621
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:18,492
I left a pair of dress shoes in
a bag outside my door last night

622
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,529
to be cleaned and polished, but
they haven't been returned yet.

623
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,405
You must be Mr. Malone.
One moment, please.

624
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,535
Thank you.

625
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,670
(WHISPERING) Sir, this
is the man with the shoes.

626
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,616
Mr. Malone,
your shoes are gone.

627
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,750
They were stolen?

628
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,117
No, destroyed.

629
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,212
What?

630
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:42,385
When the bag was opened by our
shoe-shine, the smell overcame him.

631
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,190
I, too, smelled them
and made the choice

632
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,787
that they must
be thrown away.

633
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,399
Incinerated, actually.

634
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,935
But that was
my only pair of shoes.

635
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,664
It became
a safety issue, sir.

636
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,104
Well... Damn it!

637
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,543
I can offer you
a complimentary breakfast.

638
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,073
Okay.

639
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,451
You have everything?
Cell phone, charger?

640
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,987
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

641
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,587
So, you sure you don't want breakfast?

642
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,419
It's the most important meal of the day.

643
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,288
It really is.
I'm not hungry.

644
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,295
I ate a whole bunch of sunflower
seeds after you went to sleep.

645
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,923
And besides, I wouldn't want
to take you away from Pam

646
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,432
on the morning
of her wedding.

647
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,024
She needs you,
Isabel.

648
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,127
That's really
sweet, Dwight.

649
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,364
So, I'll see you
at the wedding?

650
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,168
You know it.
Okay.

651
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,441
Okay, get out of here.

652
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,999
Bye.
Okay?

653
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,069
Hey, good morning.
Hi.

654
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,135
It's about
damn time.

655
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,705
I haven't gone to the
bathroom in a day and a half.

656
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,650
Oh, my God, Dwight!
This room is a pit.

657
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,917
Really? Hadn't noticed.
Too busy knocking boots.

658
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,120
How can you
eat like that?

659
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,495
I'm ravenous after a
night of lovemaking.

660
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,590
You?

661
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:56,656
Yeah, I'm hungry.

662
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,827
But I'm not going to
make a pig out of myself.

663
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,802
Hey, what was she like?

664
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:04,130
She was cute. You know, she
was hot. She was very hot.

665
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,700
She made love
like a tiger.

666
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,338
Bride's side or groom's side or townie?

667
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,745
She was from Europe.

668
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,009
No kidding.
Uh-huh.

669
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,880
I bet she had hairy armpits. No.

670
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:18,389
Isabel was nice, but I hope she
doesn't think this is going anywhere.

671
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,186
Wait a second. You're not
into her? Are you kidding me?

672
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,058
No. She's Pam's best friend.

673
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,621
You guys could double-date.
Swap, maybe?

674
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,496
Oh, please.
Put a gun in my mouth.

675
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:30,829
No, you're crazy.

676
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,063
Look, she's a dental
hygienist from Carbondale,

677
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,698
and she makes love like one.
She's a bumpkin. Pass.

678
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,607
She's... Okay, do you know how
hard it is to be a hygienist?

679
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,870
You have to take X-rays,

680
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,344
you have to scrape the
plaque off of people's teeth,

681
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,903
you have to tell
kids when to spit

682
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,644
and make sure that they're not
scared when the dentist comes in.

683
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:47,980
It, it...

684
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,952
You should ask her out.

685
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,349
I already have my
European girlfriend.

686
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,856
If your hat hits me in
the face one more time...

687
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:04,925
That's funny. Your wife loved
this hat the last time she saw it.

688
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,273
Oh, my God.

689
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,471
Oh!

690
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,273
Oscar. Angela.

691
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,380
Are you in
a lot of pain?

692
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,979
What, because of last night? No way.

693
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,082
Reports have
been exaggerated.

694
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,651
Weddings make me
very emotional.

695
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,219
I just have
that side to me.

696
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,759
Yeah, people say
you cry all the time.

697
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,961
Well,
that's not...

698
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,536
Crotch injuries
are the worst.

699
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,267
You don't need
to tell me.

700
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,540
I wasn't
telling you.

701
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,009
There's still
something there?

702
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,443
Excuse me?

703
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,238
They didn't
get torn off?

704
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,280
No, they didn't... Nothing got
torn off. Who told you that?

705
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,717
I may have told
some people that.

706
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,985
I'm nervous. I'm about to get married.

707
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,219
If you want
to sit on this.

708
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:08,525
I was thinking the wood might be
too hard on your damaged penis.

709
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,067
Make it softer.

710
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,199
It's my scrotum,
and it was.

711
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,038
Thank you.
Sure.

712
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,608
Oh. Here we go.

713
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:30,051
They asked for cash. But you
know, I give them cash every week.

714
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,646
So, how much cash
does a person need?

715
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,660
I have taken it upon myself to do
something a little more special.

716
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,289
I have painted a portrait of
the two of them from memory.

717
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:48,004
And I have another one of them in
the nude. But that one is for me.

718
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:58,639
I got them a set of turtle boiling
pots, shell hammer and bibs.

719
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,988
Is it zipping over your
belly? Don't squish the baby.

720
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,147
PAM: Thank you,
weirdo.

721
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,488
Everybody see Kristy's
stupid blonde extensions?

722
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,686
It's like they were made
from a plastic broom.

723
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,423
PAM: Okay,
here I come.

724
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,263
HELENE: Oh!
PENNY: Pam!

725
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,392
Darling,
you look beautiful.

726
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,526
Thanks, Mom.

727
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,502
I hope
he deserves you.

728
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,629
He does.

729
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:25,472
Are you sure? Remember, you
don't have to do this. You don't.

730
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,807
Mom, you're totally
projecting and being a drag.

731
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,278
Yes, thank you, Mom.

732
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,009
Hey, I'm going to go outside
and talk to Dwight.

733
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,052
Okay, great. Yeah, I'll
see you in a second.

734
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,177
Wait. What?

Is this allowed?

<i>(CRYING) No, no. But I'm
allowing it. Just come here.</i>

742
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,063
That was
an intelligent comment.

743
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,404
Hello, stranger.
How do I look?

744
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,941
Oh! Fine. Isabel?
Nice to see you.

745
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,275
What do you want?

746
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,317
Nothing. Anymore.

747
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,678
So, tell me again

00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,248
the difference between
Filene's and Filene's Basement.

Hey, hey. He's not
sitting with me, either.

750
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,661
Where are you sitting?
Do you need a seat buddy?

751
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:23,996
I'm standing.
I'm a bridesmaid.

752
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,502
Oh. I wish
I was a bridesmaid.

753
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,262
Where am I gonna go?

754

Hey.

755
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,571
Wow.

756
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,347
You look...
Terrible.

My veil tore.

760
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,651
I knew when we were getting married
and I'm five months pregnant,

761
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:53,925
that I'm not going to be able to
wear the dress that I always wanted,

or high heels.

Hey, you look just
as I imagined you.

Pam, you're
so pretty.

765

Thank you.

And who cares? It's
a stupid veil, right?

767
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,641
No, this is the one thing I was supposed

768
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,208
to be able to control,
was this veil.

769

be our wedding day.

777
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,889
Why did we invite
all these people?

I think Pam ran away
because she knew deep down

780
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,404
she wouldn't be
a good wife.

What are you doing?

784
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,475
I'm trying to decide
if I have time to pee.

785
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,608
How long do you
take to pee?

786
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,710
The peeing is fast, Oscar.

787
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,948
It's getting my tie back on.

788
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:32,089
Hey. Hi. Would you have
a snack in your purse?

789
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,258
You're a mom, I just
figured you might have one.

790
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,357
Yeah.

Oh! Ooh! Apricot.

Do you have any of the Very
Berry or Ocean Splash, or...

No.

Okay. Were you saving it?

No, no. That's okay. I've just...

796

I've had a very
rough weekend.

canceled the wedding?

Relax, you'll get
your shot at Jim.

office like a 1970s key party.

was bad so far.

Oh!

I came here hoping
to meet somebody,

you know,
as you do at weddings.

by the vending machine.

808

It was loud,
but it was warm.

That sounds awful.

810

And the love of my life
is dating somebody else.

Just...

812

It is a terrible year
for love.

a whoopee cushion on you.

take your own back?

want to trade for a toaster?

No.

wait a little more time

for over an hour.

is not going to happen.
