1
00:00:01,431 --> 00:00:02,573
Oh!!!

2
00:00:02,815 --> 00:00:05,132
she's absolutely ????

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:06,635
He!

4
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:08,644
Oh, sorry

5
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:10,284
He's dressing color pink

6
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:11,897
that's paper colour

7
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:18,313
well, look at that

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,595
- cute
- thank you

9
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:21,539
oh, may I ....

10
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:22,970
I am sure

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,584
Hey, look at me

12
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:28,851
I am a baby

13
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:38,534
Hey Mama

14
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:39,851
I'm thirsty

15
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:42,043
I'm thirsty, Mama.

16
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:43,482
<i>I want some milk.</i>

17
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:46,511
<i>And you know where
milk comes from.</i>

18
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:13,100
The catch 22 team vous présente...

Episode 9 Saison 3
"The Convict "

20
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:20,572
http://www.theofficeus.fr/
http://www.forom.com/

21
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:23,741
Hey

22
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:24,893
Hey

23
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:28,653
You almost done?

24
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:31,863
Just about, yeah.

25
00:01:32,598 --> 00:01:33,813
Now.

26
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:36,301
Yes, I've started to see Karen.

27
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:37,632
It's very new,

28
00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:41,452
and I'm not really ready to talk
about it openly yet just because

29
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:43,593
I think once the word
gets out there,

30
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,021
it might affect the way
people behave around us.

31
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:49,262
Or...I don't know.

32
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,773
Just not yet.

33
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:54,572
ah, Jan, it, um,

34
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:56,121
looks like a check.

35
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:57,823
A piece of paper
of some sort.

36
00:01:57,855 --> 00:01:59,191
A receipt.

37
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,890
Jan, this is Angela Martin
from accounting.

38
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:01,993
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

39
00:02:02,027 --> 00:02:03,023
<i>Look, we have a rebate</i>

40
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,691
from the Federal Work
Opportunity Program.

41
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:06,891
And no one knows
what that means.

42
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:09,853
<i>We get that money
for hiring an ex-convict.</i>

43
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:12,382
I didn'tire an ex-convict.

44
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:14,620
Unless they mean Toby.

45
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:16,251
Convicted rapist.

46
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:19,050
I'm just kidding.

47
00:02:20,117 --> 00:02:21,251
<i>When did the check come?</i>

48
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:22,050
Last week.

49
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:23,821
<i>Okay, that's when
the branches merged,</i>

50
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:25,951
<i>so Josh must've been taking
advantage of this program.</i>

51
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:27,352
<i>Smart move.</i>

52
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:29,153
One of the Stamford
people is a criminal?

53
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:31,153
Hey, Jan,
speaking of Stamford,

54
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:32,800
Hannah brought in a baby.

55
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:35,752
Jan, which one of new
employees is a criminal?

56
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,341
<i>A reformed convict.
And I'm not sure.</i>

57
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:41,182
<i>Don't hang on.
Let me email our H. R.</i>

58
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,471
<i>Stay on the line.</i>

59
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:43,821
Who is it?

60
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:45,912
Hannah?

61
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,110
<i>Hmm.</i>

62
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:49,201
Andy?

63
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:50,933
<i>Andy.</i>

64
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,013
Martin?

65
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,461
Oh, you are such a racist.

66
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:59,540
- Wait, why am I a racist?
- Because you think he's black.

67
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:02,570
He is black, right?

68
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:05,210
Stop it.
Stop it right now!

69
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:07,222
<i>Okay, 's someone
named Martin Nash.</i>

70
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:08,522
Yeah!

71
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,340
<i>Michael?</i>

72
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:12,110
Why did the convict
have to be a black guy?

73
00:03:12,578 --> 00:03:15,592
It is such a stereotype.

74
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:19,052
I just wish that Josh had made
a more progressive choice,

75
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:20,590
like a white guy...

76
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,692
who went to prison

77
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:27,710
for polluting
a black guy's lake.

78
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:30,342
I wonder what he did.

79
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:32,430
In our society,

80
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:35,442
a black man can be arrested

81
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,423
for almost anything.

82
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:41,343
He was probably
at a sporting event

83
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:44,280
and saw some people
pushing each other.

84
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:46,411
And he intervened.

85
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:48,810
Why would anyone
go to jail for that?

86
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:50,900
So...

87
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:53,142
what we need to do

88
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:54,932
is to forget

89
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:57,430
about this whole
"Martin in prison" thing.

90
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:59,112
<i>People will draw</i>

91
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:00,710
unfair conclusions about Martin

92
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:02,243
and/or black people.

93
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:04,531
- Cool.
- Okay.

94
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,550
Angela? 

95
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:10,011
Sure.

96
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:12,273
Let's protect the convicts

97
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,142
at the expense
of the general feeling

98
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,581
of safety in the workplace.

99
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:18,972
As a 90-pound female
that sits in an ill-lit,

100
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,310
rarely-visited corner of the office,

101
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,450
naturally I agree with that.

102
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:24,942
Good.

103
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:26,523
All right.

104
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:35,330
-  Jim Halpert.
- I am so horny.

105
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:41,883
Okay, I can't help you
with that.

106
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,981
Oh,  I think you can,
Big Tuna.

107
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:48,562
Tell me about that
Indian chick Kelly.

108
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:50,041
She seems pretty slutty.

109
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,013
Good for a romp in the sack.

110
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:54,840
She is dating Ryan, I think.

111
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,843
Oh, and I care why?

112
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:58,683
She's high maintenance.

113
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:01,113
Next, How about...

114
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:09,043
Blondes are more fun, come on.

115
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:10,110
trust me on that.

116
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:11,122
Yeah, trust me.

117
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:13,003
That would be fun
for no one.

118
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:15,882
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

119
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:17,811
Pam, the receptionist.

120
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:21,790
Pam. Should I go for it?

121
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:30,643
Absolutely you should.

122
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:32,143
Jackpot.

123
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:34,012
Just try to be cool.

124
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:35,091
I am cool.

125
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,571
Are you cool really?

126
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:37,383
I'm so cool.

127
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:38,830
Tell me what is
going on

128
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:43,783
Um, Martin from Stamford

129
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:47,681
was at one time in prison.

130
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:52,972
No, Dwight.
Be cool, be cool.

131
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:54,942
I am greatly concerned

132
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:57,481
about having a convict
in the office.

133
00:05:57,598 --> 00:05:59,882
And I do not care
if that convict is white,

134
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,142
black, Asian, German,

135
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:04,233
or some kind of halfsie.

136
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:07,080
I do not like criminals.

137
00:06:19,318 --> 00:06:21,611
Oh, God.

138
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:25,841
All righty.
Let's get started.

139
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,442
What is she into?

140
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:29,082
I know Pam pretty well.

141
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:30,712
I know the things
that she likes.

142
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:32,313
And just as important,

143
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,240
I know the things
that she hates.

144
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,184
So one of the things
that she likes is pranks.

145
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:40,181
And the things
that she hates...

146
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,384
Frisbee-based competitions.

147
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,043
Are you kidding?

148
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:47,502
I started the main
Frisbee golf club at Cornell

149
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:48,910
where I went to college.

150
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,380
I live to frolf.

151
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:51,880
Lead off with that.

152
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:52,790
Okay.

153
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,372
She loves hunting.

154
00:06:54,785 --> 00:06:58,080
She also loves those ads
for Six Flags

155
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,112
with the old guy.

156
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:02,112
Got it.

157
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:05,583
Also...do you speak
pig Latin?

158
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:06,933
Hey, Martin.

159
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:08,050
How's it going?

160
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:08,901
Good.

161
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:10,252
Getting settled, you know.

162
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:13,070
Ah, good, good.
Good.

163
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:14,640
Just a second.

164
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:17,463
Everybody, may I have
your attention please?

165
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:21,382
I realize that a lot of you
have already heard

166
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,913
that Martin here

167
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:25,062
has had some trouble
with the law.

168
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:27,480
<i>But I just want
to declare publicly</i>

169
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:31,141
that I trust him completely.

170
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:33,642
And that anybody who doesn't

171
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,990
is an ignorant,
dumb person, okay?

172
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:39,181
As a matter of fact,

173
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,382
you show me a white man
you trust,

174
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,712
and I will show you
a black man

175
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:45,643
that I trust even more.

176
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:48,310
<i>Pam, tell me
a white person you trust.</i>

177
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,190
My dad.

178
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:52,450
Danny Glover.

179
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:55,252
<i>- Yeah?
- Jonas Salk.</i>

180
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,242
- Who?
- Justin Timberlake.

181
00:07:57,296 --> 00:07:59,010
Oh, please.
Colin Powell.

182
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,012
<i>Hey, I got one.</i>

183
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:01,642
<i>Yeah?
Jesus.</i>

184
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:04,211
Apollo Creed.

185
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:06,842
Close your eyes.

186
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:09,272
Picture a convict.

187
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:11,360
What's he wearing?

188
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:13,291
Nothing special.

189
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:16,133
Baseball  cap on backward,
baggy pants.

190
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:18,181
He says something
ordinary like,

191
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:20,191
"Yo, that's shizzle."

192
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:23,323
Okay, now slowly
open your eyes again.

193
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,672
Who were you picturing?

194
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:27,273
A black man?

195
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,241
Wrong.

196
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:31,043
That was a white woman.

197
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,022
Surprised?

198
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,510
Well, shame on you.

199
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:42,181
So, you all want to know
what I was in for?

200
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:44,381
No, that's not cool.

201
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:45,732
You don't
have to tell them.

202
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:49,272
I really don't mind. 
It was a stupid mistake.

203
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,810
I was working in finance,

204
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:55,220
and I got involved
in some insider trading.

205
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,410
<i>So I spent a little time in the clink.</i>

206
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:00,851
Oh!

207
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,882
That is awesome.

208
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:08,341
I had Martin explain to me
three times

209
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,283
what he got arrested for,
because...

210
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:14,610
it sounds an awful lot

211
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:19,023
like  I what I do here
every day.

212
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:20,940
What was prison like?

213
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:22,470
Not terrible.

214
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:23,812
Boring.

215
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:25,791
We do the same thing
every day.

216
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:28,070
But at least
we'd get outdoors time.

217
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:29,541
You got outdoors time?

218
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:31,233
Two hours every day.

219
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,670
Sometimes we'd play
pickup football games.

220
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:36,112
Michael, why don't we get
outdoors time?

221
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:37,970
Yeah, some days
I never go outside.

222
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:39,673
Well, we are
running a business.

223
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:40,872
What was your like?

224
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,073
Not good.

225
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:45,630
It was a little bit bigger
than Michael's office.

226
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,800
But you know,
I really only slept there.

227
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:52,261
You know, during the day
our time was our own.

228
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:54,163
They had classes.

229
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,181
I took some
watercolor classes.

230
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:58,212
- They have art classes?
- Yeah.

231
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:00,083
They have business
classes there?

232
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:02,930
They did, taught by some
Harvard Business School guys.

233
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:05,581
A lot of the guys also that
were in the class

234
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,903
he inmates a lot of them
have gone on to do

235
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,911
extraordinary things in
business. Terrible things.

236
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:12,743
Kind of sounds like prison's
better than Dunder-Mifflin.

237
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,971
Okay, well,
that's not true.

238
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:16,711
I would so
rather be in prison.

239
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:18,372
<i>Prison sounds great.</i>

240
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,643
No, you would not.

241
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,112
This place is not prison.

242
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:24,753
It's way better than prison.

243
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:26,921
Baby!

244
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:28,073
Hello, baby!

245
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:29,342
Here, you want to play
with this?

246
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,743
You can't give
paperclips to a baby.

247
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,110
He could swallow.

248
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:33,942
Oh, it's okay.
I've got tons of 'em.

249
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:36,670
You like that?
Goo goo goo goo?

250
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:39,860
Pam-a-lama-ding-dong.

251
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,893
Listen, you're cute.

252
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:45,191
There's no getting
around it.

253
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:47,813
So I don't know
if I like country music,

254
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:49,641
<i>but I was thinking
maybe one of these days</i>

255
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:50,871
<i>we could drive out
to the fields,</i>

256
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,680
crank up some tunes.

257
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,883
Smoke a few Macanudos.

258
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,590
Maybe even toss
a disc around.

259
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:01,053
Utway ooday ooyay
inkthay, Ampay?

260
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,010
Wow. I--

261
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,200
Shh!

262
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,520
Think about it.

263
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,511
I'll hit you back.

264
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:21,970
Wow.

265
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,610
That was...

266
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:27,452
W ow.

267
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:31,861
Okay, listen up,
everybody.

268
00:11:31,977 --> 00:11:36,961
Um, you guys said that prison
was better than this place.

269
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:38,863
<i>And I heard you
loud and clear.</i>

270
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,570
So I am instituting
some changes

271
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,440
to make this
more like prison.

272
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,140
<i>We are going to start</i>

273
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,300
with an hour of outdoor time.

274
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,613
So let's go!

275
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:58,371
Michael,
it's freezing out.

276
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:00,611
I can't feel my toes.

277
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,711
Why don't we
pump some iron?

278
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:06,343
Anybody want to pump up?

279
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:07,950
What is that,
like, five pounds?

280
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:09,550
It's two and half.

281
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,860
I'm not going for bulk.
I'm going for tone.

282
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:12,993
I'm going back inside.
It's freezing.

283
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:15,023
Yeah, it is freaking
cold out here.

284
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:16,393
Anybody wants to stay out,

285
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:18,753
you got about 27 minutes
of rec time.

286
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,980
<i>Oh, hey, Martin!</i>

287
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,701
You have TV in the joint?

288
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:27,982
Yeah, in the rec room.

289
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:29,790
Ah, got a ten-inch
black and white?

290
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:32,490
Actually, our TV was
bigger than that one.

291
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:37,120
These people do realize
how lucky they are.

292
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,243
This office is
the American Dream.

293
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,882
And they would rather
be in the hole.

294
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:48,203
Oh, Andy.

295
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:51,303
I thought of one last tack
you can take with Pam.

296
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,671
- Yeah, what?
- Quick question.

297
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:53,690
Do you play the guitar?

298
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:54,842
I play the banjo.

299
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:56,270
Hold on.
Let me think about that.

300
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:57,543
Yes, that'll work.

301
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:01,073
<i>But can you sing in a sexy
high falsetto voice?</i>

302
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:05,691
* You know I can, my man *

303
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:07,070
Yep, that's perfect.

304
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:09,542
Hey.
Hey.

305
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:11,072
I'm gonna go get
my banjo out of my car.

306
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:12,103
Perfect.

307
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:14,320
What is going on?

308
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:16,463
I'm messing with Andy.

309
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,170
I'm sending him to all
the women in the office

310
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,703
with just
terrible information

311
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,171
on how to get them
to go out with him.

312
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,702
I love it.
I want in.

313
00:13:23,747 --> 00:13:25,062
Who's the target?

314
00:13:26,678 --> 00:13:28,280
Oh, you know what?

315
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:31,041
<i>- It was gonna be Pam, but--
- Perfect.</i>

316
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,741
What do I do?
Just give me an assignment.

317
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,282
Oh, you know what though?

318
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,603
I feel like I already
sicced him on Pam.

319
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:38,903
We'll give her a break.

320
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:41,142
Let's think
of someone else.

321
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:42,370
All right, everybody.

322
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,373
There has been
a lot of name-calling

323
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,103
against our office today.

324
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,902
Corporate maligning, slurring.

325
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:51,821
Much of it coming
from one of you

326
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:56,140
who claims that 
prison is better

327
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:57,901
than here.

328
00:13:57,908 --> 00:13:59,893
<i>And none of us
can say "boo"</i>

329
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:02,840
because none of us
have ever been to prison.

330
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:06,741
Well, here's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

331
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:10,070
Somebody else who has
been to prison

332
00:14:10,106 --> 00:14:11,570
who can tell you what

333
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:14,490
it is really like.

334
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:17,162
I'm  Prison Mike.

335
00:14:18,477 --> 00:14:20,223
You know why they call me
Prison Mike?

336
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:22,772
Do you really expect us to
believe you're somebody else?

337
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:24,342
Do you really expect me

338
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,841
to not push you up against
the wall, beeyotch?

339
00:14:26,905 --> 00:14:28,572
Hey!
Whoa, whoa!

340
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:31,370
Hey, that's just the way
we talk in the clink.

341
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:34,271
<i>Been a lot of fun talk
about prison today.</i>

342
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:36,743
But I am here
to scare you straight.

343
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:41,073
I am here
to scare you straight!

344
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:44,672
In prison, you are
somebody's bitch.

345
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:45,873
Oh, and you.

346
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:48,271
<i>You, my friend, would be</i>

347
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:50,171
da belle of da ball.

348
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,672
<i>Don't drop the soap.
Don't drop the soap.</i>

349
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:53,741
Michael, please.

350
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:58,593
Where did you learn
all of this?

351
00:14:58,806 --> 00:14:59,642
Internet.

352
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,270
So not prison.

353
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:03,012
And prison.
It's 50/50.

354
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:04,642
Both.

355
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:06,642
<i>Look, prison stinks</i>

356
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:07,551
is what I'm saying.

357
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,191
It's not like
you can go home

358
00:15:09,437 --> 00:15:10,933
and recharge your batteries

359
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,443
and come back in the morning

360
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:15,641
and be with your friends
having fun in the office.

361
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:18,740
What did you do,
Prison Mike?

362
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:20,551
I stole.

363
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:23,143
And I robbed.

364
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:27,513
And I kidnapped
the President's son

365
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:29,450
and held him for ransom.

366
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:32,271
That is quite
the rap sheet, Prison Mike.

367
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:33,843
An I never got caught neither.

368
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:36,102
Well, you're in prison,
but, mm-hmm.

369
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:38,671
Prison Mike, what was
the food like in prison?

370
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,782
Gruel sandwiches.

371
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:42,973
Gruel omelets.

372
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:44,251
Nothing but gruel.

373
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:46,341
Plus, you can eat
your own hair.

374
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,700
Wow.

375
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,073
Prison sounds horrible.

376
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:51,223
Yeah, yeah.

377
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:53,490
Well, thank you, Andy.
Thanks.

378
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:55,803
Prison Mike,
what's the very, very

379
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:57,302
worst thing about prison?

380
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:59,371
Don't encourage him,
Dwight.

381
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:02,701
The worst thing about prison
was-- was the Dementors.

382
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:04,972
They were flying
all over the place,

383
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,500
<i>and they were scary.</i>

384
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,773
<i>And then they'd come down
and they'd suck the soul</i>

385
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:09,171
<i>out of your body,
and it hurt.</i>

386
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:10,943
<i>Dementors like
in Harry Potter?</i>

387
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:13,470
<i>No, not Harry Potter.</i>

388
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:15,641
There were no movies
in prison.

389
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:16,703
<i>This is my point.</i>

390
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:19,140
You guys got it soft
and cushy.

391
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:21,163
This place is
freaking awesome.

392
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:22,700
<i>The people are awesome.</i>

393
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:23,701
Your boss is nice.

394
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:25,542
<i>Everybody seems
to get along.</i>

395
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:27,202
<i>People are tolerant.</i>

396
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:29,443
People who would jump
to conclusions

397
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:31,230
<i>can redeem themselves.</i>

398
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,402
Nobody's nobody's bitch.

399
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:35,242
I hope that this scared you.

400
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,743
And from me, Prison Mike,
to you,

401
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:40,800
I just want to thank you
for listening to me.

402
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:43,871
And letting me be a part
of your life today.

403
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,063
'Cause you got
a good life!

404
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,071
You got a good life.

405
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:50,622
<i>A good life.</i>

406
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:58,661
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

407
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:01,740
It doesn't sound so great,
does it?

408
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:03,850
Wow.

409
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:05,743
Thank you.

410
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:08,642
Um, that must have been hard
for you to relive that.

411
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:09,973
Both of you.

412
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:12,970
Yeah, that wasn't really

413
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:15,421
at all my experience.

414
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:16,940
<i>There were
certain elements</i>

415
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,641
of what you performed

416
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:20,840
I've seen on television,

417
00:17:21,227 --> 00:17:24,251
but it didn't remind me
of my time in prison.

418
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,941
Okay, okay.
Fine.

419
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:31,683
You guys think prison
is so great?

420
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,093
All right.

421
00:17:33,306 --> 00:17:36,240
Well, here you go.

422
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:38,371
<i>Okay, Michael.
Come on, let us out.</i>

423
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:40,860
No, if you think prison
is so wonderful,

424
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,171
then enjoy prison.

425
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:45,300
- Are we locked in here?
- They are such babies.

426
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,372
I am going to
leave them in there

427
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:49,601
until they can
appreciate what it's like

428
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:51,170
to have freedom.

429
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:53,272
And if this doesn't
bother them,

430
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,003
then I am out of ideas.

431
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:02,002
Hey!
Let us out of here!

432
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:08,101
Hey, I have--
Shh!

433
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:13,883
This is Toby.

434
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:15,652
Hey, Pam.

435
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:17,971
Where are you
calling from?

436
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,143
Michael, why is everyone
locked in the conference room?

437
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:26,442
They were very disreectful
to me and to the office.

438
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:29,740
And Martin has had
a bad influence.

439
00:18:29,778 --> 00:18:32,502
To think that I gave him
the benefit of a doubt.

440
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:33,873
It's--

441
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:37,341
Well, you're gonna have to
let them out or I will.

442
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:39,740
Okay, you know what, Toby?

443
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:42,771
I am teaching them
a lesson, so...

444
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:45,462
You know
they're teasing you.

445
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:48,943
I mean, obviously this is

446
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:52,143
a much nicer place
than an actual prison.

447
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:54,571
We get paid to be here.

448
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:57,103
We go home afterward
and have social lives.

449
00:18:57,147 --> 00:19:00,273
And we have parties here.

450
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:04,161
They're teasing you.

451
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:06,000
To be funny.

452
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:17,230
Okay, nutcases,
get out of there.

453
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,491
Good work.

454
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:20,950
Long day.
Really long.

455
00:19:20,956 --> 00:19:23,310
Why don't you guys
head home early?

456
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:26,740
Time off
for good behavior!

457
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:30,231
Good job.

458
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:32,653
Enjoy your freedoms.

459
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:42,553
Martin went from being
a new guy from Stamford

460
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:44,681
to a convict,

461
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:46,841
to my friend,

462
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:49,082
back to a convict,

463
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:52,400
then to kind of
a nuisance, actually,

464
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,430
if we can be
completely honest.

465
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:57,923
And finally to a quitter.

466
00:19:58,605 --> 00:20:00,721
And I will not miss him.

467
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:06,680
And that is not
because he is black.
