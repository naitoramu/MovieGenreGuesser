How was your gay-cation?

75
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,086
That's very funny.

76
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:13,208
Yeah, I thought of that

What're you doing later?
You wanna hang out?

87
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,697
Ah- I don't know. Maybe.

88
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:49,774
I'll take that as a "Maybe"

Oh, I'm about to go to kitchen. 
I'll walk with you.

Things are going pretty good.

00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,404
I have a question.

96
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:24,176
Would you like to join 
the party planning committee?

97
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:25,768
The committee 
with all the women?

98
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:26,730
Yeah

99
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,706
Because I'm gay.

100
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,987
No- no-

101
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:33,990
Certain events 
have transpired,

102
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,871
and I've thought about 
certain things.

103
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:41,229
And I'm sorry for the way
those certain events transpired.

104
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:46,759
And I would just like to make 
some changes about certain things,

105
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,045
- and certain situations,
- Okay, Okay

106
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:50,260
- and certain accountants... 
- Alright, Alright

107
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,802
I'll join.

108
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:51,845
I'd love to.

109

111
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:00,701

Never

113
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:06,578
You sold those two printers

114
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:07,477

116
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:10,239

00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,554
Wow, what is wrong 
with this thing?

118
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:16,664
Looks terrible!

119
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,314
Do you want me to ask 
the night cleaning crew

120
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:19,587
if they stop watering it?

121
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,463
Yeah. Oh- you know what?

122
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:23,490
Ask them about 
the toys on my desk, too.

123
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:26,102
<i>They always used to 
arrange the toys on my desk

in a very pleasing way.

125
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:29,896
<i>Used to brighten my morning.

126
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,421
Oh, that wasn't the night crew.

127
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:32,669
That was Dwight.

128
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,126
Really?

129
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:37,745
It was very nice of him.

130
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,658
We need more attitude like that 
around this office.

131
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:42,792
Feel ya, dawg.

132
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:44,062
Yeah, do you?

133
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:45,690
Absolutely.

134
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,943
What did I say?

135
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,431
You said...

136
00:05:53,783 --> 00:05:54,617
Which is like...

137
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:55,790
"right on!"

138
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,574

00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:57,993
You are like...

Nailed it.

141
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:13,177
Love that Andy, right?

142
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:14,648
Solid fellow.

143
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:16,150
Seems smart enough.

144
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,411
<i>Likes me a lot.

145
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:19,257

146
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:20,531
<i>Too much.

147
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:24,737
<i>Like a crazy person, a little.

148
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,616
<i>Not super crazy, just...

149
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:29,998
<i>There's something about him 
that creeps me out.

150
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:31,493
<i>I can't really explain it.

151
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,686
<i>He's always up in my bid-ness,

152
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,713

153
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,275
<i>"being in my face and annoying 
the bejesus out of me."

154
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,438
I don't understand

155
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:45,660
how someone could have 
so little self-awareness.

156
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,223
I really have no preference.

157
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,743
We don't even 
have to have a party.

158
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,373
No, hey- hey-

159
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:58,290
Don't be ridiculous.

160
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,357
Of course 
we are going to have a party.

161
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,452
A celebration of Oscar.

162

Oscar night.

163
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:06,015
And I want it to be 
Oscar-specific?

164
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:07,956
- Michael, I...
- No, no. I mean, not...

165
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,219
not because you are gay.

166
00:07:09,402 --> 00:07:11,995
Your gayness 
does not define you.

167
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:14,936
Your Mexicanness is 
what defines you, to me,

168
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:18,336
and I think we should celebrate 
Oscar's Mexicanity.

169
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,294
So, Phyllis?

170
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:25,849
I want you to go find 
firecrackers and a chihuahua.

171
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,004
Pam, in the frozen food section,

172
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:31,023
Swanson makes 
a delightul chimichanga

173
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,947
Why don't you have me 
riding in on a donkey,

174
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,783
into the office, like Pepe?

175
00:07:34,783 --> 00:07:36,318
Ah, a burro, of course.

176
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:38,278
If Oscar wants a donkey, 
let's get him one.

177
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:43,426
Need any help?

178
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:45,898
Oh, no thank you.

179
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,109
- I'm just looking.
- Great.

180
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:55,454
I will literally be standing 
right here

181
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:56,970
if you need anything at all.

182
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,007
Okay

183
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,675
I think I could go for 
some tuna fish right about now.

184
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:10,063
Got my rod here.

185
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,762
Hey

186
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:31,530
Hey

187
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,418
So, Andy is in rare form today?

188
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:38,688
Yeah, you should not 
encourage him.

189
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:40,367
Encourage him?

190
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,622
I'm the victim, okay?

191
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,773
He's fishing for me.

192
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:45,258
We gotta do something.

193
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:48,330
Look, I got like 15 new clients

194
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,380
that I've inherited from Dwight.

195
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,996
And, each file 
is password-protected

196
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,690
with a different 
mythical creature, so...

197
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:55,936
Sorry, I can't.

198
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:57,830
Fine.

199
00:08:59,196 --> 00:08:59,991
Party pooper.

200
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,636
Who's that sportscaster 
that bit that lady?

201
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:12,905
Marv something?

202
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,509
Andy is like Marv something.

203
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:16,645
Great sportscaster,

204
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,839
Big weirdo creep.

205
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:22,015
180 pounder. check it out.

206
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:31,557
- Hey Ryan 
- What?

207
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:34,030
Do you want to 
pull a prank on Andy?

208
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:35,859
Not right now.

209
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,251
But ask me again 
ten years ago.

210
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:42,994
I liked you better as the temp.

211
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,107
Me too.

212
00:09:46,234 --> 00:09:47,225
Hey guys.

213
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,803
How's the workload.

214
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:52,072
All of Dwight's old accounts.

215
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:53,775
Handling that okay?

216
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:54,696
Sorta

217
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,086
He had a lot of clients.

218
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,081
Yes, he did.

219
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:01,071
Have any of you 
talked Dwight?

220
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:03,695
Oh sure. We talk all the time.

221
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,220
- Really? 
- No

222
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,550
Don't- Don't do that. 
That's not nice.

223
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:09,781
What about you Phyllis?

224
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:11,320
You and Dwight were close?

225
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,415
No.

226
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:13,641
Sorry.

227
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:15,470
Dwight had a big personality

228
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,439
and I have a big personality,

229
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:18,455
and a lot of times,

230
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:20,474
when two people like that get together,

231
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:21,912
it can be explosive.

232
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,441
Really comin' down out there.

233
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:26,481
The commute going to be hell.

234
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:29,520
I have snow tires and chains.

235
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:32,553
Plus exceptional 
hand-eye coordination.

236
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,383
So- uh- where were you 
working before this?

237
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:39,086
Dunder-Mifflin.

238
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:40,816
What kinda company is that?

239
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,890
Paper company.

240
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:47,403
They're only one of 
Staples' top competitors in the area.

241
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:50,354
I never heard of them.

242
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:51,732
Oh, really.

243
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:53,149
Have you heard of paper?

244
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:56,228
It's gonna be like that, huh?

245
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:57,757
I don't like him,

246
00:10:58,165 --> 00:10:59,367
his giant head,

247
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,948
or his beady little eyes.

248
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,777
That's all I got to say 
on the matter.

249
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:08,397
(Cranberries - Zombie)
In your head!

250
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:11,548
In your head!

251
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:15,974
Zombie! zombie! zombie!

252
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:22,030
In your head!

253
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,943
In your head!

254
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,663
Would you like to pull 
a prank on Andy?

255
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,124
I'm kind of in the middle of ...

256
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:27,038
yes, please.

257
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:28,746
Okay, good. 
Stay right here.

258
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,414
- Sorry about that.
- Yo- tuna.

259
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,208
- Are there any messages?
- No

260
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,956
- So weird. 
- Thanks

261
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:57,507
Nice to have Oscar back.

262
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:00,633
Yeah

263
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:56,876
Large Tuna, have you seen 
my cell phone device?

264
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:58,595
No.

265
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:00,389
'Cause someone is 
calling right now.

266
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:02,265
There is a call.

267
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:23,207
Angela.

268
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:28,585
Is everything okay?

269
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:31,148
No.

270
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:42,862
What's going on?

271
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:44,618
What're you talking about?

272
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:47,478
Where is my freaking phone?

273
00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:51,805
You know what? 
Maybe it's in the ceiling.

274
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:53,735
You know what? 
Maybe you're in the ceiling!

275
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,189
Okay.

276
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,363
<i>I don't trust you, Phyllis.

277
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:05,124
I just wanted to 
tell you that

278
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:06,032
Dwight was 
late that morning

279
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:07,171
because he had to 
drive to New York

280
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:08,709
to drop off 
the quarterly tax forms

281
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:10,022
that I forgot to send.

282
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:13,427
Though to be fair,

283
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:15,037
Kevin never reminded me.

284
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:16,573
Dwight loves this company.

285
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:19,601
Do you think that anyone else

286
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:21,968
out there would've driven to 
corporate for you?

287
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:23,911
None of them.

288
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:26,852
Especially, not Andy.

289
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:44,928
Pam.

290
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:46,455
I have a mission to accomplish.

291
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:47,787
Make sure this party gets rolling

292
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,238
And I will be back shortly.

293
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:51,647
Where're you going?
Do you want me to come with you?

294
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:55,837
Just listen. I forgot to tell you 
the plan for this Saturday.

295
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:59,204
you, me, bar, beers, buzzed.

296
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,320
Wings, shots, drunk.

297
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,746
Waitresses, hot.

298
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,918
Football, Cornell/Hofstra,

299
00:15:04,918 --> 00:15:05,813
slaughter.

300
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:07,986
Then quick nap at my place,

301
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:09,034
and we hit the tiz-own.

302
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,542
No. I don't want to do any of that.

303
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,815
Duh. Which is why 
I was joking about doing it.

304
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:16,942
Just stop, stop.

305
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:18,218
Just stop doing it.

306
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,728
You're going to drive me crazy.

307
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:24,255
Fine. I will just go 
and sit my desk, and be quiet.

308
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:26,659
Sorry I annoyed you 
with my friendship.

309
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:32,732
Excuse me.

310
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:36,758
And I'm also sorry

311
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:38,815
that a lot of people here

312
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,670
for some reason think it's funny

313
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,995
<i>to steal someone's personal property 
and hide it from him.

314
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:47,033
<i>Here's a little newsflash.

315
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,635
It's not funny.

316
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:52,440
In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny.

317
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:07,352
That was an overreaction.

318
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:09,952
Gonna hit the break room.

319
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:10,928
Did anybody want anything?

320
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:13,274
Pam, you good?

321
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:15,201
- Yeah 
- Sure? Okay.

322
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:38,787
<i>That question is meaningless.

323
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:40,542
<i>Just go with the copy paper.

324
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,416
It's your funeral.

325
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,261
See how that works out for you.

326
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:47,633
Hey

327
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:50,295
Hey

328
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:51,365
What's up?

329
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,182
Same old

330
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,489
It takes a big man 
to admit his mistake.

331
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,625
And I am that big man.

332
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:13,383
Angela from accounting told me 
what you did.

333
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:15,124
Oh my god. She told you?

334
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:16,382
Yes, she did.

335
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:21,973
And, Dwight, if you are willing to 
do something like that

336
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,938
With some of the random co-worker,

337
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:28,263
then, clearly, I've misjudged you 
from the beginning.

338
00:17:30,554 --> 00:17:32,071
And, I apologize.

339
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:36,768
Accepted.

340
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,497
How's this place treating you?

341
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:46,562
The boss isn't funny.

342
00:17:46,854 --> 00:17:47,062
Oh, well...

343
00:17:47,062 --> 00:17:48,716
I don't get to wear my ties.

344
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:50,791
No, I'm sure.

345
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,438
So...

346
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,423
So maybe you should come back.

347
00:17:55,162 --> 00:17:56,122
You should come back.

348
00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:57,573
Please.

349
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:01,844
I don't want to do 
your laundry anymore.

350
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:04,686
We can talk about that.

351
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:27,291
Oh my god. 
That's half-inch drywall.

352
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:29,912
I think we broke his brain.

353
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,794
<i>It's not freaking funny.

354
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:38,311
Are you enjoying this fiesta?

355
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:39,557
Actually, yeah.

356
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:41,481
I didn't think I would...

357
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,385
... but it turned out great.

358
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:44,841
Ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:47,425
May I present Mr. Dwight Shurut!

360
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:54,676
Welcome back.

361
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:56,012
Thank you.

362
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:02,607
Okay, Dwight, 
you can let go of her hand.

363
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:03,826
You're going to break it.

364
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:06,037
Not bad, huh?

365
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:08,985
You did this for me?

366
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,822
Guilty

367
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:19,805
Hey

368
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:28,849
Do you still have feelings for her?

369
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:36,768
Yes.

370
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,313
And now, ladies and gentlemen.

371
00:19:54,313 --> 00:19:56,639
The big finale!

372
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:59,116
Sir, would you do the honor.

373
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:01,670
Oh, man.

374
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,390
No, no, no, no- 
I don't need it.

375
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:15,799
<i>It takes a big man 
to admit his mistake,

376
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,935
<i>and that's what I did.

377
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:19,770
The important thing is,

378
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:21,537
I learned something.

379
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:25,724
I don't want somebody 
sucking up to me

380
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,628
because they think 
I am going to help their career.

381
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,303
I want them 
sucking up to me

382
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,701
because they 
genuinely love me.

383
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:39,701
