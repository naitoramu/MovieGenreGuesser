1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,200
Six dollars, please.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,830
Six? I just had it for one night.
It's three.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,520
Eight o'clock's the cutoff.
And, oh, it's 8:02.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,720
You know, in a weird way,
you have too much power.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,200
You have to help me
because I only have three.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,800
I can help with that.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,840
Oh, my God. Richard?

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,840
Your lip went bald.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,070
Thanks.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,680
You look great!

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,000
Right.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,840
No, you do. You. . . .

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,600
What?

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,870
You got panties stuck to your leg.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,880
I was just grabbing some things
out of the dryer, and static cling.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,120
Or maybe God knew I'd be running into
you and saw an opportunity.

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,200
It's good to see you.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
It's good to see you too.

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,840
The One Where
Monica and Rich are Just Friends

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,150
Czech Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,840
See that guy?
He's in "Classics" now. . .

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,360
. . .but as soon as we leave,
he's going straight to the porn.

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,120
He'll go to the counter with Citizen
Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,590
This is nice.

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
-I miss this.
-Me too.

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
You want to get a hamburger
or something?

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,280
I don't know if that's a good idea.

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,950
Just friends.
I won't grope you. I promise.

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,680
I think it's too soon.

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,320
No, it's not too soon.
I had lunch at 1 1 .

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,400
Yeah, baby!

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,080
-What are you making?
-Chocolate milk. Want some?

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,720
No, thanks. I'm 29.

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,960
Oh, my God! I gotta go to work!

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,480
What time will you get off tonight?

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,950
It could be really late.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,430
Not again!

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,960
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,960
Every night that you're asleep
before I get home. . .

40
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,080
. . .I will wake you up in a way
that has proved popular in the past.

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,910
Well, if you need to stay late,
I want to be supportive of that.

42
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,950
Look at you.
Since when do you rollerblade?

43
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,960
Since tomorrow.

44
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,240
I met a cute guy in the park.

45
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,640
And he jogs and blades and swims
and so we made a deal.

46
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,240
He's gonna teach me how
to do jock stuff.

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,720
-And what are you gonna do for him?
-I'm gonna let him.

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,870
Cool.

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,440
Good morning.

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,320
Somebody got in late last night.

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,320
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,000
When did this happen?

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,720
Around 8:02.

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,680
We talked for a while, and then
we went out for an innocent burger.

55
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,310
There's no such thing as
an "innocent burger. "

56
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,160
-Gonna see him again?
-Tomorrow night.

57
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,080
Monica, what are you doing?

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,550
She spent six months
getting over him. . .

59
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,120
. . .and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,000
It's not a date, okay?

61
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,680
I'm teaching him how to make a
lasagna for a potluck dinner.

62
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,800
You might want to make extra, because
you'll be hungry after the sex.

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,720
We're not gonna have sex.

64
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,040
Nothing's changed here. He still
doesn't want children, and I still do.

65
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,120
So we're just gonna be friends.

66
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,960
Naked friends.

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,880
-Do you have any ice?
-Check the freezer.

68
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,510
If there's none in there,
we're probably out.

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,760
Are you just getting home?
It's late.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,150
I know.
I had the greatest day, though.

71
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,870
I went to a meeting
with reps from Calvin Klein.

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,600
I liked a line of lingerie, so my boss
ordered a ton of it. And you?

73
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,120
I discovered I'm able to count all my
teeth using just my tongue.

74
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,950
Why do you have a copy of
The Shining in your freezer?

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,200
I was reading it last night
and I got scared, so. . . .

76
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,680
But you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

77
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,760
Well, safer.

78
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,760
I never start reading it. . .

79
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,840
. . .without making sure
we got room in the freezer.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
How often do you read it?

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,720
Haven't you ever read a book
over and over again?

82
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,360
I read Little Women more than once.

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,670
It's a classic.
What's so great about The Shining?

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,400
The question should be, what is
not so great about The Shining?

85
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,160
And the answer would be,
"nothing. " All right?

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,200
This is the scariest book ever.

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,960
I bet it's better than that
classic of yours.

88
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
We'll just see about that, okay?

89
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,350
I will read The Shining,
and you will read Little Women.

90
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
All right, you got it.

91
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,440
Now, Rach, these little women. . . .

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
How little are they?

93
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,600
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

94
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,320
Chandler, Ross? This is Robert.

95
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,680
You have lipstick right here.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,520
That's okay, it's mine.
We just kissed.

97
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,720
Isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

98
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,320
Well, I'm from California.

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,840
Right. Sometimes you guys
just burst into flame.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,920
I'm up. I'm up. I've gotten up now.
Anybody want anything?

101
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,760
-I'll have coffee.
-Me too.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,880
Make that three.

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,510
Ross, why don't you come with me?

104
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
What's the matter?
What's going on?

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,440
Robert's coming out.

106
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,760
What do you mean?
ls he gay?

107
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,750
He's coming out of his shorts.

108
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,720
What?

109
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,510
The man is showing brain.

110
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,990
Are you sure? Hold on.

111
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
I'm sorry.
That was a coffee and a. . . .

112
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,560
Coffee. We could write it down.

113
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
No, no. That won't be necessary.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Well?

115
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,640
What do we do? What do we do?

116
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,800
Well, I suppose we just
try to not look directly at it.

117
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,520
Like an eclipse.

118
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,040
When people compliment my
cooking tonight, what do I say?

119
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,040
You say, "Thank you. "
Then you buy me something pretty.

120
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,750
Come on, we're gonna
put our hands in this bowl. . .

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,720
. . .and we're gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.

122
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,720
This feels very weird.

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,680
You touch people's eyeballs
and this feels weird?

124
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,600
Sure, I touch them. But I spent years
learning not to squish them.

125
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,920
That's my hand.

126
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,920
-Keep squishing.
-The tomatoes are squishing.

127
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,760
You got some on your shirt.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,120
Hold on a second.

129
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,880
Just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

130
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,920
It should do. . .

131
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,790
. . .the trick.

132
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,440
What?

133
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
You've got some on your pants.

134
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
I'll just throw them out.

135
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,320
These little women!

136
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,550
You're liking it?

137
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,040
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

138
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,400
I don't see how he could forgive her.

139
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,520
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

141
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,750
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,680
That is the one thing missing
from The Shining.

143
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,560
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

144
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,880
No wonder Rachel had to read this so
many times.

145
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,630
How'd the basketball go?

146
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,320
I learned how to shoot a lay-up,
a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

147
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,920
You mean a 3-pointer?

148
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,520
I get more because I'm dainty.

149
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,440
Is there a phone here
to check my messages?

150
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,600
-In back. Do you want a quarter?
-I always carry one in my sock.

151
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,040
What are you doing?
Get back on your side--

152
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,560
Hello!

153
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,120
I'm Joey. We haven't met.

154
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,720
Good to meet you. Robert.

155
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,800
What?

156
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,800
What? You guys, what is going on?

157
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,720
Do you not like Robert?

158
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,080
Why are you laughing?

159
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,200
Calm down.
No reason to get testy.

160
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,160
-You guys! Come on!
-We're sorry.

161
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,600
It just seems that Robert isn't as
concealed in the shorts area. . .

162
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,480
. . .as one may have hoped.

163
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,320
What do you mean?

164
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,600
Could you pass me those cookies?

165
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,600
Sure.

166
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,480
So how'd the lasagna go over?

167
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,920
Really? Good. So you owe me three
pretty things.

168
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,720
I've been thinking about you too.

169
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,110
Well, no. It's hard,
this "platonomy" thing.

170
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,960
It's a word.

171
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,960
I do think it's better this way.
We're being smart.

172
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,120
Yes, I'm sure.

173
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,120
You really sure?

174
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,240
I'll call you back.

175
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,720
So we can be friends
who sleep together.

176
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,120
Absolutely.
This'll just be something we do.

177
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,920
Like racquetball.

178
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,110
Sounds smart and healthy to me.

179
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,240
So just out of curiosity. . .

180
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,920
. . .do you currently have
any other "racquetball" buddies?

181
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,950
Just your dad.

182
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,030
Although that's actually racquetball.

183
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,560
You know, I do have a blind date. . .

184
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,880
. . .with my sister's neighbor
next Tuesday.

185
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,320
Do you want me to cancel it?

186
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,240
No!

187
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,910
Because if you did,
that means you'd be canceling for me.

188
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,400
-And we're just friends.
-Exactly.

189
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,160
Oh, don't sit down.

190
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
-Ready to go?
-You bet.

191
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,310
And first, here's a gift.

192
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,710
Stretchy pants?!

193
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,480
The greatest things in the world!
lf I were you, I'd wear them every day.

194
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,440
Gee, thank you.
Really, that's so nice.

195
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,920
But, to be honest,
I don't think I can wear these.

196
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,280
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.

197
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,720
That's all right. I'll figure. . . .

199
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,390
How's it going?

200
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,920
Good.

201
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,800
How's The Shining?

202
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,360
Danny just went into Room 21 7.

203
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,080
The next part's the best!
That dead lady in the bathtub--

204
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,640
You're gonna ruin it!

205
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
I'll talk in code.

206
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,440
Remember when the kid sees
those two "blanks" in the hallway?

207
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,880
Yeah, that's very cool.

208
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
All "blank" and no "blank" makes
"blank" a "blank-blank. "

209
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,920
No, the end!

210
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,480
Jack almost kills them
with the "blank" . . .

211
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,120
. . .but in the last second,
they get away.

212
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I can't believe you just did that.

213
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,920
I can't believe she cracked your code.

214
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,950
Okay. Laurie proposes to Jo
and she says no. . .

215
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,400
. . .even though she's in love with him.
Then he ends up marrying Amy.

216
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,600
Mine was by accident!

217
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,440
The boiler explodes and destroys the
hotel and kills the dad.

218
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,510
Beth dies.

219
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,550
Beth dies?

220
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,560
Is that true?
lf I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

221
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,960
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

222
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,320
He's asking if you've ruined. . .

223
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,800
. . .the first book he's ever loved
that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

224
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,320
No. She doesn't die.

225
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,320
Then why would you say that?

226
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,720
Because I wanted to hurt you.

227
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,120
Oh, there they are.
I dropped my keys.

228
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,080
Got them.

229
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,960
Sorry. I'm sorry.

230
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,240
You would not believe my day.

231
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,040
I had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off. . .

232
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,240
. . .I lost one of my fake boobs
in a grill fire.

233
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,960
What are you smiling at?

234
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,320
I was thinking your day
could still pick up.

235
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,240
I love this "friend" thing!

236
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,000
Robert's gonna be here any second,
so could one of you just tell him?

237
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,630
Please, right now.

238
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,640
Every time I see him, it's "Is it
on the loose? ls it watching me?"

239
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,350
We can't tell him.

240
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,520
You can't go up to a guy you barely
know and talk about his "stuff. "

241
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,720
He's right. Even if it's
to say something complimentary.

242
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,870
You ready for the gym?

243
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,960
There's a new rock-climbing
wall. We can spot each other.

244
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,110
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

245
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,150
What?

246
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,840
Listen, Robert. . . .

247
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,400
Hey, don't we have to. . .?

248
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,120
Yeah, we got. . . .

249
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,720
I think you're really, really great.

250
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,120
Oh, God. Here we go again.

251
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,680
Why does this keep happening?
ls it something I'm putting out there?

252
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,320
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

253
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,750
I don't know what to say.

254
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,560
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.

255
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,510
Really? It's just like
everyone else's apartment.

256
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,840
It's got rooms and walls
and ceilings.

257
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,160
I just wanted to see where you live.
Now give me the tour.

258
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, my God!

259
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,600
-This is the living room.
-That's nice.

260
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,120
-And this is the kitchen.
-That's real pretty.

261
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,430
Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?

262
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,200
Well, it's pretty much your typical. . .

263
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,800
. . .bedroom.

264
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,430
We're still on this side of the door.
I didn't get to see it.

265
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,160
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.
Thanks for a lovely evening.

266
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,000
So who is she?

267
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,240
That was the blind date
I told you about.

268
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
She called
and switched it from Tuesday.

269
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,920
Did you like her?

270
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm just asking as a friend,
because I am totally fine with this.

271
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,840
Well, you seem fine.

272
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,520
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine. I'm not.

273
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,310
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.

274
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,910
She wants to see your bedroom.

275
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,440
You know what?

276
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,720
What if we're friends. . .

277
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,360
. . .who don't see other people?

278
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,120
You mean "exclusive" friends?

279
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,280
Why not?

280
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,520
I mean, this has been
the most amazing week.

281
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,600
Would it be so terrible?

282
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,320
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

283
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,920
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends. . .

284
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
. . .and vowed to be friends forever.

285
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,480
You know, we're back where we were.

286
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,040
Honey, I would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

287
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,840
That's not true.
You don't have a moustache.

288
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,390
Okay, one thing's changed.

289
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,110
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

290
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,720
You know what?

291
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,920
I gotta walk out of here right now.

292
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,910
Because getting over you is the
hardest thing I have ever had to do.

293
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,680
I don't think I could do it again.

294
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,160
I know I couldn't.

295
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,710
How about one last
game of racquetball?

296
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Watch the thorns!

297
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,200
What?

298
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,200
Beth is really, really sick.

299
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,320
Jo's there, but I don't think
there's anything she can do.

300
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,600
You wanna put the book
in the freezer?
