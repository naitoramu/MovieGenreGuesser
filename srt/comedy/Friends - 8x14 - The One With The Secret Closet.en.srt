1
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,968
- What's up?
- I left my guitar here.

2
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,596
Okay. No problem.

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,935
Okay. Here you go.

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,734
- What?
- You want to hang out or something?

5
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,695
You caught me at a bad time.

6
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,615
- Are you and Chandler...?
- Exactly.

7
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,700
- Can I play for you?
- No.

8
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,415
Hey, Pheebs, what's up?

9
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:46,172
You ask an intriguing question,
Chandler Bing.

10
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:55,264
Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
You never let me massage you.

11
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:59,560
- Phoebe, I can explain.
- You said you hate massages.

12
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,981
Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.
Don't let Phoebe in.

13
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,152
How long has this been going on?

14
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,114
- Well, Alexandra has...
- It has a name?

15
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,534
Phoebe, don't get upset.

16
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:20,997
Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.
Come on, Chandler, let's go.

17
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,042
Well, I thought I'd...

18
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,086
Yeah, what the hell.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,924

22
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,548
One more push.
Come on, we're almost there.

23
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:16,511
I'm happy things worked out for us and
we're having this baby. I love you.

24
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,806
I love you too.

25
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,183
I hope it's not
an inappropriate time to say...

26
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,020
...you're the best sex I've ever had.

27
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,148
That's always appropriate.

28
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,027
Okay, come on, one more push.
One more push.

29
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,657
There we go.

30
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:43,163
Here is your beautiful baby.
Congratulations.

31
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:55,300
I hope you're a better father
than you are a friend!

32
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,140
Joey!

33
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,476
- What's going on?
- Come feel my belly.

34
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,647
- The baby's kicking for the first time.
- Really?

35
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,399
Yes.

36
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,194
You know what? Maybe you...

37
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:18,615
Maybe you should come to me.
I'm not wearing any bottoms.

38
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,036
Oh, my God.

39
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,121
It's unbelievable!

40
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,876
Wow, she is kicking so much.
She's like...

41
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:32,171
Who's that annoying
girl soccer player?

42
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,299
- Mia Hamm?
- Mia Hamm!

43
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,887
- It's amazing.
- One hand on the sheet, Joe.

44
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,181
Sorry.

45
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,437
Hey, babe.

46
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:53,817
We got a wedding gift from Bob and
Faye Bing. They don't like us, do they?

47
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:58,488
Who says you can't get
a nice punch bowl for under $6?

48
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,409
- Maybe we can take it back.
- Where would we return it?

49
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,745
How about to the street,
from the balcony?

50
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,208
Why don't we just find a place for it?

51
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,546
In that cabinet?

52
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:19,343
That's for canned goods. Have you
forgotten everything from orientation?

53
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,098
How about the closet by the bathroom?

54
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,685
- Okay. Let me do it.
- No, I'll do it.

55
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:32,898
You have to relax and let me
take care of things once in a while.

56
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:37,403
It's locked. You have to help me.
Why is it locked?

57
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,989
No reason.
I keep private things in there.

58
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:45,452
I've been here a while,
and I've never seen what's in there.

59
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,621
What is in there?

60
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,664
Feminine stuff.

61
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,335
Don't try to make me uncomfortable
with feminine stuff!

62
00:04:53,585 --> 00:05:00,175
Nothing in there concerns you.
If you love me, you'll just let it go.

63
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,138
- Fine.
- Thank you.

64
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,227
Love you.

65
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:17,026
Hello, Chandler.
Lovely day, huh? You.

66
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:24,366
If it helps, Alexandra's only
been massaging her for three years.

67
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,371
Lf! I said, if it helps.

68
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,668
Why won't you let me massage you?

69
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,423
I'd be self-conscious.
You're my friend. I'd be naked.

70
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:43,510
We lived together for years.
I've seen you naked.

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,222
That's different. We were roommates.
And when?

72
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,019
I'm curious about the human body.

73
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,190
You can understand
why this would be weird.

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,109
I'm a professional
and I'm really good.

75
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:04,030
If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
Give me a chance. Please?

76
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,909
If it means that much to you.

77
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:11,122
It does. How would you feel
if you couldn't share your cooking?

78
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,709
Or how Ross would feel
if he couldn't teach us about dragons.

79
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,922
- Dinosaurs.
- Potato, potahtoe.

80
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,095
Ross, the baby's kicking.

81
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,388
What? It is?

82
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,688
It's not kicking now.

83
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:40,317
Although we would love
to see you do that again.

84
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,486
When? What happened?

85
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,406
Last night. I went into Joey's room,
and he was sleeping.

86
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,243
A dreamless sleep.

87
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,663
My God, the baby's kicking.
That's great.

88
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:59,545
I wish I would have been there to feel
the kicking for the first time.

89
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,465
I got some stuff going on
if you want to feel.

90
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:08,637
I don't want to miss any more baby
stuff. Here's my pager number.

91
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,432
Anytime anything pregnancy-related
happens, use it.

92
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,810
I don't care if it's 3 a.m.
And you want ice cream.

93
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,647
Can I get a copy of that?

94
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,154
- Are you under the sheet?
- Yes.

95
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,785
Great, let's begin.

96
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,544
How's the pressure?

97
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,631
It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.

98
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,676
Stating the obvious, but thank you.

99
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:52,014
- And it's not weird, is it?
- No.

100
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,269
That's right, you just enjoy.

101
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,815
Oh, yeah!

102
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,199
- Oh, yeah!
- Okay.

103
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,953
Oh, God, Phoebe!

104
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,374
That's it! That's it, right there!

105
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,806
I wasn't trying to open
your closet, I swear.

106
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:41,730
Monica runs a pretty tight ship here,
doesn't she? What are you doing?

107
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,192
Monica has a secret closet.
She won't let me see it.

108
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,821
- Why not?
- I don't know! What's she hiding?

109
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,240
I don't know.

110
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,952
I'll bet it's Richard.

111
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,622
Why would she keep Richard in here?

112
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,083
Off the top of my head...

113
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,712
...maybe she's having her cake
and eating it too.

114
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:08,340
You being the "cake,"
Richard being the "too."

115
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,177
- Or...
- And here we go.

116
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,973
I saw a movie where there was a door.
Nobody knew what was behind it.

117
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:21,895
When they finally got it open,
millions of bugs came pouring out...

118
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,649
...and they feasted on human flesh!

119
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:30,445
It wouldn't kill you
to respect your wife's privacy!

120
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,328
Stupid closet full of bugs!

121
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:44,125
Joey, something feels weird
and not good weird. I don't...

122
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,587
When my sisters were pregnant...

123
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,173
...they got weird feelings
and it was always nothing.

124
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,134
- Really?
- Absolutely.

125
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,721
But we'll stop by the hospital
just to be sure. I'll page Ross.

126
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:03,187
Rach, look at me. Everything's fine.
Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.

127
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,481
Crushing bones!

128
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,026
Good thing we're going to a hospital.

129
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,994
- So?
- She's fine.

130
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:24,249
She had Braxton Hicks contractions.
Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.

131
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:29,462
Mild discomfort? I take it you've had
one of these Braxton thingies?

132
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,506
- Everything's normal?
- Yes.

133
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,884
- There's no danger?
- No.

134
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,304
Contractions can be unnerving,
but she's fine.

135
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:42,309
Thank you, doctor.
And thank you for being nice and calm.

136
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,605
I wasn't calm! I've never been
more scared in my life.

137
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:51,777
- You said everything was okay.
- What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

138
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,947
- But everything is okay. I'm fine.
- You sure?

139
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,993
Yes. I got half a mind
to contract that doctor's uterus.

140
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:03,330
Mild discomfort!
What's he talking about?

141
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,207
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

142
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,543
Your page said, "Come to
the hospital. " What happened?

143
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:12,631
Something called
Braxton Hicks contraction.

144
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,967
That's no big deal.
Most women don't feel them.

145
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,345
No uterus, no opinion.

146
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,057
What's with the candy?

147
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,602
I was at the concession stand
at the movies.

148
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:29,607
- You went to the movies by yourself?
- Mona!

149
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,652
- I gotta go back in there.
- What's wrong?

150
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:38,281
- I just gotta...
- No, really, tell me. What's up?

151
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:42,036
Look, I forgot my underwear.

152
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,708
Thanks for bringing her
to the hospital.

153
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,794
Don't worry about it. No big deal.

154
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:54,757
But still, it should have been me.
I'm the dad.

155
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:59,136
- Here's information on Braxton Hicks.
- Thanks.

156
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,348
You did the right thing
by bringing her in.

157
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,975
You'll make a wonderful father.

158
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:11,648
Hey, not as good as this guy.
He brought Twizzlers.

159
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:20,824
- There has got to be a way.
- Easy there, Captain Kirk.

160
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,328
- Do you have a bobby pin?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:29,667
Oh, no, wait.
I'm not a 9-year-old girl.

162
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,044
Then why do you throw like one?

163
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:36,632
- Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
- Oh, sure, "Monica."

164
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,636
So how's the inappropriate
crush on Rachel coming?

165
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:46,350
Really good. I should be ready
to kill myself any day now.

166
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,811
Well, you sure found that quick.

167
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:58,153
I wish I didn't feel this way about
Rachel. I wish things could be normal.

168
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:03,366
I love living with her, and
helping out with the baby is amazing.

169
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,745
But now I think Ross feels left out.

170
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:12,251
When I took Rachel to the hospital,
the doctor thought I was the father.

171
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,796
You should have seen
the look on Ross' face.

172
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:20,717
I have no idea what I'm doing.
For all I know, I'm locking it more.

173
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:25,556
- You try opening it with a credit card?
- That's a good idea.

174
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,393
So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?

175
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,563
- I feel terrible.
- It's not your fault.

176
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:37,026
What are you gonna do, not take her?
You're doing nothing wrong.

177
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:41,655
Except for harboring love
for the woman carrying his baby.

178
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:50,914
Richard, if you're in there,
could you pass me my credit card?

179
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:59,255
I gotta tell you, yesterday was
amazing. That massage felt so good.

180
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,800
No, I got that.

181
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,720
- Can we make it a weekly appointment?
- Okay.

182
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:11,060
You should know though,
I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.

183
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,187
- Okay.
- I mean 500.

184
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,191
- What?
- 600.

185
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,901
What's going on?

186
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,279
You make sex noises
when you get massaged.

187
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:27,868
It freaked me out. After a while,
I tried to hurt you. It spurred you on.

188
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:32,247
You're crazy. There's nothing sexual
about the noises I make.

189
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,333
There's nothing sexual about this?

190
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,003
Oh, God!

191
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:44,009
What are you looking at?

192
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,844
I mean, hi.

193
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,183
This is embarrassing.
I'm never getting a massage again.

194
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,436
Don't let this stop you
from getting massages.

195
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:58,231
I have lots of clients
that make those noises.

196
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,026
- Really?
- Well, not clients. Lovers.

197
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:07,575
We'll try it again. Come back,
and we'll work through it.

198
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,619
- You sure?
- Yes.

199
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:15,040
- I guess.
- Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.

200
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,919
So did you hear something you liked?

201
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,635
Hey, Ross, check it out!
I learned a new trick.

202
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:30,389
Hey, I bought you some lunch.

203
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,810
Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.

204
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,026
- Did you put pickles on this?
- Well, yeah.

205
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,280
What? What? Rach, what?

206
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:49,575
- What's going on?
- I made her tuna with pickle.

207
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,452
Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.

208
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:56,707
Giving her pickle is
like giving me salad.

209
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,793
I'm sorry, I didn't know. You okay?

210
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,922
I'm fine, but someone make sure
it's gone when I get out?

211
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:06,258
I'm on it!

212
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,471
I shouldn't be the one
making her throw up.

213
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:16,018
- It could happen to anyone.
- Not to you. You know this stuff.

214
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:19,021
I don't know any of it
and I'm the father.

215
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:23,150
I wish I could be
more involved, you know?

216
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:32,785
Well, if anyone is keeping score,
I no longer eat tuna.

217
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,331
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

218
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,042
- Yeah.
- What's up?

219
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,462
Sit down.
I wanna talk about our situation.

220
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,549
Are you breaking up with us?

221
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,094
The thing is...

222
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:58,435
...because I live with Rachel,
I'm here for a lot of stuff.

223
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:03,106
And Ross is missing everything. So...

224
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,817
Yeah?

225
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,695
You two should live together.

226
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,907
Are you asking me to move?
You don't want me here?

227
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:16,578
No, I love living with you.
It just seems that...

228
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:21,124
...if you're gonna have a roommate,
it may as well be the father.

229
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:27,381
But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me
to move in and disrupt his life.

230
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,343
Or he does.

231
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:36,140
I would love to be around
for you and the baby.

232
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,727
We can just try it,
like on a temporary basis.

233
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,856
- But it's you and me.
- It wouldn't be anything romantic.

234
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:48,027
I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!

235
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:53,198
I was supposed to meet her
an hour ago. What is wrong with me?

236
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,702
So, what do you think?

237
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,872
- I don't know. Is it crazy?
- No.

238
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,082
Joey, this is a smart idea.

239
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,753
Well, I was due.

240
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,506
- Let's do it.
- Really?

241
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,967
Rach, that's great. That's great.

242
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,981
Not too shabby.
I got this all off myself...

243
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,900
...using my wife's tools.

244
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,326
Oh, my God.

245
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,290
How did you get in there?

246
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,794
You're messy.

247
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:54,135
- No! You weren't supposed to see this!
- I married Fred Sanford.

248
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,096
Chandler, you don't understand.

249
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:05,020
Okay, okay, fine! Now you know.
I'm sick.

250
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:10,400
No, honey, you're not sick. I don't
love you because you're organized.

251
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,737
I love you in spite of that.

252
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,864
Really?

253
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,660
- Promise you won't tell anyone?
- Yes.

254
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:25,666
Now that I know, if I've got extra
stuff, can we share the closet?

255
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,960
Well... It's just...

256
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:32,089
I'm afraid you might mess it up.

257
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:44,643
So Rachel's all moved out?
How you taking it?

258
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,771
I wanted to have a few beers...

259
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:52,192
...but I got rid of those because
Rachel couldn't stand the smell.

260
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,071
I have thrown back a lot
of orange juice with calcium.

261
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:02,119
It's a couple weeks past its expiration
date, so it's got a bit of a kick.

262
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,209
- Are you okay?
- You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.

263
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:12,671
I'm better than great. I am good.

264
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:20,887
Now that she's gone, I can do stuff
around here that I couldn't do before.

265
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,973
Like...

266
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,684
I can walk around naked again.

267
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,811
I can...

268
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,523
I can watch porn in the living room.

269
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,151
This is good for me.

270
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:39,490
I like being on my own.
I'm better off this way.

271
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,159
I'm a lone wolf.

272
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,330
A loner. Alone.

273
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:51,335
All alone. Forever.

274
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,883
What's a wolf gotta do
to get a hug around here?

275
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,685
That's it, just relax.

276
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,190
- Come on, more.
- Oh, God!

277
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,984
You like that, don't you?

278
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:20,739
- Yeah, right there.
- Want it there? Take it there, baby.

279
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:26,579
- Phoebe?
- Yeah, say my name. Say it.

280
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:38,465
And now I'm going
to cover you back up.

281
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:44,722
And I won't be speaking with you
for several weeks.

282
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:51,395
