1
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:03,560
Good morning Pam.

2
00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:05,454
Welcome back, Andy.

3
00:00:05,802 --> 00:00:07,790
Drew.
I'm Drew now.

4
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:10,710
Drew...
Sorry.

5
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:13,308
Apology not accepted.

6
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,782
Because it wasn't even necessary,
in the first place.

7
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:19,713
Several weeks ago,

8
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,247
Andy Bernard had an incident.

9
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:27,927
But after five weeks
in anger management,

10
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:30,687
I'm back.
And I've got a new attitude.

11
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:32,034
And a new name.

12
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,125
And...

13
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,979
a bunch of new techniques
for dealing with the grumpies.

14
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:38,392
Morning, Jim.

15
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:40,788
Hey, Andy.
How are you, man?

16
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:42,333
Good.
Drew.

17
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:43,736
What's that?

18
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:45,055
You can call me Drew.

19
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:46,826
No, I'm not gonna call you that.

20
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:49,002
Cool.

21
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:52,827
I can't control what you do.
I can only control what I do.

22
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,145
Andy.

23
00:00:54,324 --> 00:00:55,332
Drew.

24
00:00:57,603 --> 00:00:58,611
Dwight.

25
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,474
How's it going, man?

26
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:06,908
Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard
for the next three years.

27
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:08,716
Which I'm looking forward to.

28
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:10,563
It's an Amish technique.

29
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,058
It's like slapping someone with silence.

30
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:15,941
I was shunned from the age of four
until my sixth birthday

31
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:18,823
for not saving the excess oil
from a can of tuna.

32
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:23,919
Jim, could you please inform
Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.

33
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,833
Andy, Dwight says welcome back,
and he could use a hug.

34
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:29,943
Okay, tell him that that's not true.

35
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:33,428
Dwight says that he actually doesn't
know one single fact about bear attacks.

36
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:34,935
- Okay, no, Jim...
- You guys.

37
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,743
tell him bears can climb faster
than they can run.

38
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:40,511
Tell him!

39
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:42,465
And...
Nah, that's too far.

40
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,631
Damn you.

The Office US - 3x20
Safety Training

76
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,075
Today is safety training day.

77
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,441
Toby is leading ours upstairs.

78
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:15,962
But I am giving everyone
a little bit of a treat.

79
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:19,424
We are going to listen in on
Darryl's presentation to the warehouse.

80
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:22,756
And if I know Darryl,
it gonna be zoppity.

81
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,310
Now...

82
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:28,702
this is the forklift.
You need... you need

83
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:31,516
a license to operate this machine.

84
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:34,672
That means the upstairs office workers
can't drive it.

85
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:35,849
Quiz.
Mike.

86
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:39,005
- Should you drive the forklift?
- I can, and I have.

87
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:42,608
I said should you?
You should not drive it.

88
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,456
You should not drive the forklift.

89
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:45,865
You're not allowed to drive it.

90
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:47,711
It's not safe.
You don't have a license.

91
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:50,301
Guys, I'm not the only one
who's driven the forklift.

92
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,757
- Pudge has driven the forklift.
- Madge.

93
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,712
I thought your name was Pudge.

94
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:56,525
No, it's always been Madge.

95
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,666
Okay.

96
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:01,929
- Her.
- Her, yes, "her" is qualified

97
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,883
to work a dangerous machine.
You are not.

98
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,284
- Okay?
- Ah...

99
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,815
- fine.
- Do you understand that?

100
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:08,922
Yesh.

101
00:03:09,028 --> 00:03:10,593
We do safety traing every year.

102
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,583
Or after an accident.

103
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,267
We've never made it a full year.

104
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:20,118
This particular time, I was reaching
for a supply box on the top shelf,

105
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:24,345
when one office worker
who shall remain nameless

106
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:27,289
kicked the ladder off
from under me and yelled...

107
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,408
"Hey, Darryl, how's it hangin'?"

108
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,270
And I fell and busted my ankle and...

109
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,272
I'm legitimately scared for my workers.

110
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:38,673
The bailer can flatten

111
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:40,216
a car engine.

112
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:43,500
It can cut off your arm
and crush your entire body

113
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:44,630
without skipping a beat.

114
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,138
Yeah!

115
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,291
It's on.

116
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,199
How many people a year do you think

117
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:51,118
get their arms cut off in a bailer?

118
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:53,082
Bail 'er?
I hardly know her.

119
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:54,728
Damn it, Michael, pay attention, man.

120
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:56,620
Anybody wanna take a guess?

121
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,055
Five bucks says it's over 50.

122
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,891
- You really wanna bet?
- Anybody?

123
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:02,613
Ever since March Madness ended,
I am so bored.

124
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:04,139
- How many?
- Okay, you're on.

125
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,760
Ten people, Michael.

126
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:07,276
Ten people.

127
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:08,925
Would you like to be one of them?

128
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,157
Don't worry about it.
We'll go double or nothing.

129
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:12,279
On what?

130
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:14,511
I don't know.
We'll figure something out.

131
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:17,666
These are
very dangerous machines down here.

132
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,049
And the upstairs workers, Michael...

133
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:22,837
should not go anywhere near them.

134
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:24,183
Yes, yes.

135
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:25,945
But it wouldn't be the worst th...

136
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:28,045
It would be
the worst thing in the world!

137
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,618
What the hell is wrong with this man?

138
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,049
It's a big, red trash compactor.

139
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:34,148
It's not a trash compactor!
It's a bailer.

140
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:35,599
Okay, I got it! I got it!

141
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,180
Only on the rarest of occasions...

142
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:39,527
No, do not touch it!

143
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,098
There's no occasion
for you to go near this stuff, okay?

144
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,028
Toby now has the floor.

145
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,759
And he is going to try
not to screw this up.

146
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,444
Like everything else in his life.

147
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:52,025
Let me rephrase that.

148
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:54,508
I believe
that you can do safety training

149
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:56,787
and make it sound
just as good as Darryl.

150
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:58,700
Here we go!

151
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:03,089
Okay, um... one thing
you're gonna wanna look out for

152
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:04,248
is carpal tunnel syndrome.

153
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:05,500
It's recommended you take

154
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:07,591
a ten-minute break
from typing every hour.

155
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:09,589
For your circulation,

156
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,188
you're gonna wanna
get up out of your chairs, and, uh,

157
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:14,544
and move around
about ten minutes every hour.

158
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:15,890
Yes, good, fine.

159
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,180
- Like stretching and...
- Um...

160
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,060
Yeah. Your computer screen
can be a big strain on your eyes.

161
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:25,630
So it's also recommended
that you step away for about...

162
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:27,306
about ten minutes every hour.

163
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:29,746
Wow, that is...
that time really adds up.

164
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,949
That's like a half an hour every hour.

165
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,285
Take them at the same time.

166
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:36,753
Okay, you know what?
You're making it sound kind of lame.

167
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:40,012
So skip ahead
to the really dangerous stuff.

168
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:44,036
Like sometimes, computers can explode.
Can they not?

169
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,807
No, no.

170
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:49,762
Um, you always want
to keep a sweater or cardigan

171
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:51,571
of some sort in case it gets drafty.

172
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,849
- What about a long-sleeved T?
- Well, that'll work.

173
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:55,601
Long johns? A shawl?

174
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:57,466
You know, anything that warms you.

175
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,142
You know what? I think that everybody
is going to vomit due to boredom.

176
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,538
Sorry, he is very lame.

177
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:06,740
Let's see.

178
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:09,029
Seasonal affective disorder.

179
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,843
"A depression that includes weight gain,
"fatigue, irritability,

180
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,903
"brought on by the low light of winter."

181
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:17,041
Thank God
we only had the bailer to deal with.

182
00:06:17,248 --> 00:06:19,161
Yeah,
that dim light is a bitch, ain't it?

183
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:20,282
Okay, guys, you know what?

184
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:23,108
I didn't interrupt
when you were having your presentation.

185
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:24,544
Actually, you did.

186
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,039
Yes.

187
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:29,831
Okay, let's do another one.
This is a good one.

188
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:32,621
"A particular concern for office workers

189
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:36,271
"is a sedimentary lifestyle,
"which can contribute..."

190
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:37,436
Sedentary.

191
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:41,934
Yes, "which can contribute
"to heart disease."

192
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:45,149
Heart disease
kills more people than bailers.

193
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:47,398
That's called having a fat butt,
Michael.

194
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:51,273
- It's...
- Yeah, yeah. That's fat butt disease.

195
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,886
That's what you're suffering from?
Fat butt disease, Michael?

196
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:56,488
Excuse me, Sea Monster,
you weigh, like, 1,000 pounds.

197
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,353
Yeah, I bet you'd like to swim
with this sea monster, wouldn't you?

198
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:02,139
Dude, please, tell your girl to shut up.

199
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,459
- What?
- Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.

200
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:06,331
- Please, apologize.
- Are you kidding me?

201
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:07,520
All right, we out of here.

202
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:09,698
Darryl, I didn't walk out
in the middle of yours.

203
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:11,935
- So I...
- Yeah, but ours was real, Michael.

204
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:14,126
- Yes.
- That's what we're trying to tell you.

205
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:15,747
It's serious down there.

206
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:19,445
We do dangerous stuff, man.
This is shenanigans, foolishness.

207
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,011
NERF ball.

208
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,271
You live a sweet little

209
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,190
NERF-y life.
Sittin' on your biscuit.

210
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,122
Never havin' to risk it.

211
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:31,713
Okay...

212
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:38,130
What, NERF isn't cool anymore?

213
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:41,945
Darryl thinks he's such a man
because he works in a warehouse.

214
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,204
Well, big deal.

215
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:46,407
I worked in a warehouse...
Men's Wearhouse.

216
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,173
I was a greeter.

217
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:52,141
I'd like to see Darryl greet people.
Probably make 'em feel like wimps.

218
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:53,789
Not me. I...

219
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:59,582
Hello, I'm Michael.
Welcome to Men's Wearhouse.

220
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:02,054
We have a special on khaki pants today.

221
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:05,669
This is one example.

222
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,488
Ten.

223
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:11,551
Really, ten?
That's your guess?

224
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:13,434
You're a professional accountant.

225
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:14,885
There's, like, ten green ones.

226
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:16,297
42.

227
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:18,124
- I'm gonna say 50.
- 51.

228
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:19,603
Oh, don't be that person.

229
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,714
It's a strategy.

230
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:22,466
- It's called being smart.
- Thank you.

231
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:28,521
I don't know how the whole
betting thing started, but it's fun.

232
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:29,764
- Ten.
- Kev's out.

233
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:33,287
47, 48, 49!
Jim wins!

234
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,086
That is not fair.

235
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:38,326
He has spent hours up here
at reception with you.

236
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:40,605
Hours and hours.

237
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,755
Okay...
okay, guys.

238
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,723
No, constantly...
like, for years.

239
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:44,919
- Okay.
- Pam,

240
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,170
depression is
as scary as a bailer, right?

241
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:49,578
I... don't understand the question.

242
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,018
"Working in a office
"can lead to depression

243
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,052
"which can lead to suicide."

244
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:57,707
I mean this is really serious stuff.

245
00:08:58,074 --> 00:08:59,374
- Yeah.
- I... I...

246
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:00,806
Nobody commits suicide

247
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,388
because they work with a bailer.

248
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,597
And yet those guys are making fun of me.

249
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:06,830
Calling me a NERF.
That...

250
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,721
It's really hard
to demonstrate depression.

251
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:11,841
Their safety training had visuals.

252
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:13,885
Yeah...

253
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:15,269
You are...

254
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:17,426
so right.

255
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,574
They have visual aids.
And all we had

256
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:21,646
were the facts.
You don't go

257
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:25,732
to the science museum and
get handed a pamphlet on electricity.

258
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:30,987
You go to the science museum
and you put your hand on a metal ball.

259
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:32,862
Your hair sticks up straight.

260
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:34,190
And you know science.

261
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:36,092
So you're okay?

262
00:09:36,894 --> 00:09:37,996
Indubitably.

263
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:40,991
They use props.

264
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,841
They use visual aids.
And they just made us look like dopes.

265
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:46,972
Idiots!

266
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:48,639
God, what are we gonna do!

267
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,033
I don't know.
I don't know.

268
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,049
Because you know what our killer is?

269
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:54,384
- Depression.
- Wolves.

270
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,118
Depression.

271
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:58,096
- Visual aids.
- Yes.

272
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:00,611
A quilt...
depression quilt?

273
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,426
No time to sew a quilt.

274
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:06,621
I got it.

275
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:10,162
Give me the number
for the Giant Big Box toy store.

276
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:15,738
You may be asking yourself,

277
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:18,036
"What am I doing on a trampoline?"

278
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:20,843
Well,
I thought I'd bounce here for a while,

279
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:23,424
relieve some stress,
and then move on with my day.

280
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:25,035
Not!

281
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:26,353
Here's the plan.

282
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,284
Dwight is going to gather

283
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:31,204
all of the office workers
and all of the warehouse guys

284
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:33,666
and we're going to have
another safety seminar.

285
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:36,407
Only this time, where's Michael?
Oh, my God!

286
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:37,876
He is on the roof!

287
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:39,788
Now I've got their attention.

288
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:44,027
I tell them about
the cold hard facts of depression.

289
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:45,949
And then I say,
"Hey...

290
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:48,096
"you ever seen a suicide?"

291
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:50,140
And I jump.

292
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:52,881
And they freak out.
And they get to see

293
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,848
the dangers of depression
with their own eyes.

294
00:10:56,592 --> 00:10:57,599
Nice side note...

295
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:00,397
they might think,
hey, I should've been nicer to Michael.

296
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:01,555
But that's...

297
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:04,287
not why I'm doing this.
Then I land on the trampoline,

298
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,888
take a couple extra bounces for fun.

299
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,885
I climb off, walk around the corner.

300
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,599
Ta-freakin'-da!

301
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:12,142
So the next movie
moves to the top of the queue.

302
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:13,442
So number 5 becomes number 4.

303
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,263
Number 6 becomes number 5.
Number 3 becomes number 2.

304
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:17,394
Etcetera, etcetera.

305
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,908
And let's just say
that I just sent back <i>Love Actually</i>,

306
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,254
which was awesome.
And they sent me <i>Uptown Girls</i>,

307
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:24,335
which is also awesome.
But guess what?

308
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:26,167
Now I want to see <i>Love Actually</i> again.

309
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:29,181
But it's at the bottom of the queue.
Oh no! What do I do?

310
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:30,313
What I do is this:

311
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:33,836
I go online, I go "click, click, click,"
and I change the order of the queue

312
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:36,152
so that I can see <i>Love Actually</i>
as soon as I want to.

313
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:37,942
It's so easy, Ryan.

314
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:40,886
Do you really not know
how Netflix works?

315
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:42,987
I guess I forgot.

316
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,029
You're such a ditz.

317
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:49,825
Ryan, well done.
2 minutes, 42 seconds.

318
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:54,106
Additionally, Pam, you win ten
because she said "awesome" 12 times.

319
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:57,963
And Jim, you win five because
she mentioned six romantic comedies.

320
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:01,298
Okay, let's do this thing!
I'll go summon the troops.

321
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:02,992
Maybe we should test this first,

322
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:06,468
Letterman-style.
Throw a TV over.

323
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:08,079
We measured it once.

324
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,480
Go buy some watermelons.

325
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,968
Seedless?

326
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:15,012
Just...

327
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,971
Creed is eating an apple.

328
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,269
I found a potato.

329
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,879
Hey, Creed.

330
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:29,084
Hey!

331
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,917
- Yes!
- Here you go.

332
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:45,964
I don't know this place
as well as I thought I did.

333
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,782
I'm getting cleaned out.

334
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,327
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

335
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:50,476
Drop that sucker.

336
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,378
Crap!

337
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,343
Deactivate the car alarm,
clean up the mess.

338
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,415
- Okay.
- Find out whose car that is.

339
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,646
If it's Stanley's,
call the offices of James P. Albini.

340
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:06,847
See if he does hate crimes.

341
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:09,493
Also, take apart the trampoline,
stick it in the bailer.

342
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,100
We're not allowed to use the bailer.

343
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,586
Have Patch do it...
or the sea monster.

344
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:14,660
I'm on it!

345
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:20,970
I'm temporarily lifting the shun.

346
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:22,609
- Thank you.
- It means nothing.

347
00:13:22,713 --> 00:13:24,305
I need you to do something for me.

348
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,189
- Anything.
- Okay, calm down.

349
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,785
I need you to acquire
an inflatable house and/or castle.

350
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:32,179
You mean a moon bounce?

351
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,094
What do you think?
You've got an hour.

352
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:35,506
I'm gonna need petty cash.

353
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,891
Shunning resumed.

354
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:40,329
Do you...
do you want a drawbridge?

355
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:41,469
Un-shun.

356
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:44,388
Yeah, that sounds good.
Re-shun.

357
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,843
Oh, yeah, this is much better.

358
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:50,143
Safer.

359
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,600
- An excellent decision.
- Yes. Thank you for seeing that.

360
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,215
When you land,
try and land like an eight-year-old.

361
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:58,335
These bouncy castles
are not designed for adults.

362
00:13:58,448 --> 00:13:59,832
I don't know if I want to do this.

363
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:02,536
Do you want to do another test?
I got plenty of watermelons.

364
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,333
No more;
the tests are going terrible.

365
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:07,481
If we keep doing them,
I'm not gonna want to jump.

366
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:10,664
This is about doing, not thinking.

367
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,898
Right, doing!

368
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,970
Totally doing! It's rock and roll!

369
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,185
- Rock and roll!
- Yeah!

370
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:16,494
You're right; I'm not thinking.

371
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:19,688
Yes, yeah!

372
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,582
- Michael is awesome
- Whoo!

373
00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:23,239
- Jumpin' of the roof
- Whoo!

374
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,151
- Bouncin' on a bouncy bounce
- Whoo!

375
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:26,758
- Show 'em who's boss
- Whoo!

376
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,802
- Rip a hole in the sun
- Whoo!

377
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:30,243
I am ready to do this!

378
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:32,871
I'm ready to make a point!

379
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,317
Hey, guys, listen up.

380
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:38,952
Michael is up on the roof
and acting strange.

381
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:41,364
What's the situation?

382
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,584
Un-shun.
I think he's suffering from depression.

383
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:46,715
Re-shun.

384
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:49,201
- When's the shunning thing gonna end?
- Un-shun...

385
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,690
Never! Re-shun.

386
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:54,467
I think he wants you all to come out
to the parking lot and watch him die.

387
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:56,209
Is it nice outside?

388
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:57,603
It's gorgeous.
Let's go!

389
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:00,052
- Do I need my jacket?
- No, really, it's very nice.

390
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:02,576
- Come on!
- Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?

391
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,072
Everyone's gonna be fine
in exactly what they're wearing!

392
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:06,183
Let's go!

393
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:09,725
Let's go!

394
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:16,470
- Come on, hurry up, you guys!
- My life...

395
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:19,682
Oh, my life...

396
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:21,980
Michael, what's wrong?

397
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:23,788
Everything's wrong.

398
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,294
The stress of my modern office

399
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:29,016
has caused me to go into a depression.

400
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:30,919
Depression?

401
00:15:31,144 --> 00:15:34,431
Isn't that just a fancy word
for feeling bummed out?

402
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:35,966
Dwight, you ignorant slut.

403
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:39,292
Depression is a very serious illness.

404
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:44,481
Over 32,000 people
commit suicide every year,

405
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,883
according to a 2004 study.

406
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:49,012
Is that the last year to date
it was available?

407
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:50,095
Yes.

408
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,712
My head is in such pain and turmoil!

409
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:55,672
Don't do anything rash.

410
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,537
Dwight, where are the warehouse guys?

411
00:15:58,601 --> 00:15:59,609
I didn't...

412
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,813
I didn't think
you needed them for this part.

413
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,669
Okay... that's...

414
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:09,052
- You said to just...
- That's the whole point, dummy.

415
00:16:09,146 --> 00:16:10,154
Okay, I'm on it.

416
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:11,303
Okay.

417
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,212
Attention blue collar workers!

418
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:17,792
What are the odds that this is

419
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:18,932
in any way real?

420
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:22,276
I'd say, like, 10,000 to 1.

421
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,886
Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.

422
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:29,200
If someone
gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything,

423
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,632
you take it.

424
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,240
If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar,

425
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:38,422
I am going to be a very rich dude.

426
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:40,937
Michael's up on the roof

427
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:42,924
and he's acting strange!

428
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:44,892
Oh, my life!

429
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,663
Michael, what's wrong?

430
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:48,820
Everything's wrong, Dwight!

431
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:51,156
The stress of my modern office

432
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,729
has made me depressed.

433
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,808
Depressed? Isn't that just
a fancy word for feeling bummed out?

434
00:16:57,072 --> 00:16:58,428
Dwight, you ignorant slut.

435
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,549
Well, you know,

436
00:16:59,662 --> 00:17:01,254
the first performance was a little off.

437
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:04,532
But I really think they hit their stride
in the second show.

438
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:08,346
Might even bring my parents tomorrow
to the matinee.

439
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:09,826
And that is why...

440
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:12,849
Oh, excuse me.
It's my favorite part.

441
00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:14,865
This is just offensive.

442
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:16,173
At least we're outside.

443
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:18,867
Hey, check it out.
There's a castle over there.

444
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,061
Oh, my God.
There is a castle.

445
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:24,631
No, there's nothing
to see over there, people.

446
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:26,213
There's nothing to see.

447
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,000
They found the castle, Michael.

448
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:31,282
Damn it.

449
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,068
Oh, God.

450
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:37,187
Oh, my God!
He's gonna jump.

451
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:43,668
He's going to kill himself
pretending to kill himself.

452
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:44,874
Yeah.

453
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,540
Don't jump on the bouncy castle.

454
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:58,853
You can't do that 'cause you are going
to get horribly, horribly injured.

455
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:00,821
Hey, Michael.

456
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:05,015
I have a present for you
but you have to come down and get it.

457
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:07,656
What is it?

458
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,888
Come down and open it and you'll see.

459
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:11,602
Dwight, find out what the present is.

460
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,530
Okay, uh... I don't see anything.
She might be bluffing.

461
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:17,235
Dwight.
What are you...

462
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:21,436
It's, uh...

463
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:26,974
A Repliee Q1 Expo female robot.

464
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:28,802
They're only available in Japan.

465
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:31,609
Dwight, you are such a liar.
Pam, really, what is it?

466
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:36,507
This's the opposite of safety. You jump,
you're gonna seriously hurt yourself.

467
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,824
You told me that I lead a...

468
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:41,047
a cushy,

469
00:18:41,716 --> 00:18:43,176
wimpy, NERF life.

470
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,767
Yeah,

471
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:47,225
but I never said
you had nothing to live for.

472
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,987
What do I have to live for?

473
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:51,276
A lot... of things.

474
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:55,637
Uh, you, uh...

475
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:03,333
What about Jan?

476
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:06,403
Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.

477
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:08,833
It's going good, right?

478
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:11,366
It's complicated with Jan.

479
00:19:12,544 --> 00:19:15,643
And I don't know
where I stand or what I want.

480
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:18,845
The sex isn't nearly
as good as it used to be.

481
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,434
You're a very brave man.

482
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:25,345
I mean, it takes courage just to be you.

483
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:28,831
To get out of bed every single day

484
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,930
knowing full well you gotta be you.

485
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:34,623
Do you really mean that?

486
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:36,224
I couldn't do it.

487
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:39,031
I ain't that strong
and I ain't that brave.

488
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,527
- I'm braver than you?
- Way braver!

489
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:43,788
You Braveheart, man.

490
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:48,337
I Braveheart.

491
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:51,652
I am.

492
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:53,649
Come on down, okay?

493
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:55,326
Okay.

494
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,604
Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.

495
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:01,222
An office

496
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:03,926
is as safe as the people in it.

497
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:08,108
And sometimes those people
can drive you to do crazy things

498
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:12,091
to show the dangers of the office.

499
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:14,672
That's the danger
I found myself in today.

500
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,206
I saved a life...

501
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,184
my own.

502
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,209
Am I a hero?

503
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:28,236
I really can't say.
But, yes.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
