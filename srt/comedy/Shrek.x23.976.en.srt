'Evening.

322
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:00,199
Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,

323
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:03,661
is this not the most
perfect kingdom of them all?

324
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:06,414
Well, technically, you're not a king.

325
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:08,290
Thelonious.

326
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,546
- You were saying?
- What I mean is, you're not a king yet.

327
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:17,341
But you can become one.
All you have to do is marry a princess.

328
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:19,260
Go on.

<font color="#ff8000">[CHUCKLING]</font>

330
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:24,014
So, just sit back and relax, my lord,

331
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:28,394
because it's time for you to meet
today's eligible bachelorettes.

332
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:31,021
And here they are!

333
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:33,107
Bachelorette number one

334
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:37,194
is a mentally abused shut-in
from a kingdom far, far away.

335
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:39,530
She likes sushi and hot-tubbing anytime.

336
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:42,992
Her hobbies include cooking
and cleaning for her two evil sisters.

337
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:45,536
Please welcome Cinderella.

338
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:48,038
Bachelorette number two
is a cape-wearing girl

339
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:49,582
from the land of fancy.

340
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:52,376
Although she lives with
seven other men, she's not easy.

341
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,005
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips
and find out what a live wire she is.

342
00:18:56,172 --> 00:19:00,217
Come on. Give it up for Snow White!

343
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:02,553
And last, but certainly not least,

344
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,513
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead

345
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,349
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot, boiling lava!

346
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:09,935
But don't let that cool you off.
She's a loaded pistol

347
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:12,646
who likes piña coladas
and getting caught in the rain.

348
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:16,901
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

349
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,403
So, will it be bachelorette number one,

350
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,907
bachelorette number two
or bachelorette number three?

351
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:25,242
- Two! Two!
- Three! Three!

352
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:26,577
- Two! Two!
- Three!

353

All I have to do is
just find someone who can go...

the little thing that happens at night.

- I'll do it.
- Yes, but after sunset...

362

this Princess Fiona my queen,

363
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:04,740

have the perfect king!

running away from his stench.

Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do
when we get our swamp anyway?

Our swamp?

There's just me and my swamp.

a ten-foot wall around my land.

is just a way to keep somebody out.
