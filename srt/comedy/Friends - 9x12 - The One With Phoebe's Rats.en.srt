1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,466
- Where's Mon?
- She's at home...

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:10,469
...putting up decorations
for Rachel's birthday party tonight.

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,846
- You're not helping?
- I tried...

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,934
...but apparently singing "I Will Survive"
in a helium voice, not helping.

5
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,397
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,651
Don't say that loud.
Gunther's gonna want to hug me.

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,531
Good news, everyone.
We finally found a nanny.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,703
- This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey.
- Hi.

9
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,373
Somebody's getting a little fussy.

10
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,001
You're damn right I am. I've been
waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,547
Okay. You know what,
I'm just gonna take her outside.

12
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,049
- No, you stay. I'll do it.
- Okay. Thank you.

13
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,636
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Yeah, you too.

14
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,473
- Wow, Molly's just great.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,684
Yes, bravo on the hot nanny.

16
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,187
- What? You really think she's hot?
- Are you kidding?

17
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,691
If I wasn't married,
she'd be rejecting me right now.

18
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,111
Joey?

19
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,112
How do you think she's doing?

20
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,743
Am I the only one that doesn't think
she's hot? Ross?

21
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,539
- I mean, she's not unattractive, but...
- Right.

22
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,083
...but hot?

23
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,377
Thank you.

24
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,880
Now that Rachel's gone?

25
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,675
So hot, I cried myself to sleep
last night.

26
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,638

29
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,438
Hey, Mike,
what's the capital of Peru?

30
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,233
- Lima.
- No.

31
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:34,196
It starts with a V
and ends with an X.

32
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:38,200
And hopefully with a T-O
in the middle.

33
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,121
You know, come to think of it,
the capital of Peru is "Vtox."

34
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,833
- Oh, God!
- What?

35
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,293
Okay. I don't want to freak you out
or anything...

36
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,337
...but I just saw a rat
in your cupboard.

37
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,007
Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.

38
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,677
Well, he's your pet rat?

39
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,513
Well, not so much a pet as, you know,
an occasional visitor...

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,144
...who I put food out for.
Kind of like Santa.

41
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,564
Except Santa doesn't poop
on the plate of cookies.

42
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,860
You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
They're unsanitary.

43
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,029
I mean, they transmit leptospirosis
and hantavirus.

44
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,781
- What are those?
- I don't know...

45
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,409
...but they don't sound
like spa treatments.

46
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,120
- You have to get rid of it.
- Okay, fine.

47
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,581
If it means that much to you,
I'll get rid of Bob.

48
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,457
Thank you.

49
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,378
It's so weird you think he's so gross,
yet you're willing to eat his crackers.

50
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,804
- Hello.
- Hello.

51
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,682
Gavin, I just want to say
thank you again...

52
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,894
...for watching Emma yesterday
during the presentation.

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,937
I really owe you an apology.

54
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,982
- For what?
- When we first met, you know...

55
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,653
...I thought you were pompous
and arrogant and obnoxious.

56
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,531
Is this your first apology?

57
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,950
No, I just mean, you know,
first impressions don't mean anything.

58
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:06,997
And I think you're a really good guy.
And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.

59
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,583
- Morning.
- Hello.

60
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,920
But you know what?
Hey, new day, new leaf.

61
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,007
I am just really, really happy...

62
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,053
I'm sorry. Obviously, Heather's ass
has something more important to say...

63
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,014
...so I'll just wait till it's finished.

64
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,433
- What?
- I was giving you an apology...

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,602
...and you were totally
checking her out.

66
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,731
I wasn't. I'm in fashion.
I was looking at her skirt.

67
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,903
Or was it pants? I didn't really see
what happened below the ass area.

68
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,031
Wow, you are really...
You're really a creep.

69
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,325
What do you care
if I was looking at her?

70
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,827
Are you jealous?

71
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,703
Oh, yeah. I'm jealous.

72
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,207
"Oh, Gavin. Please,
please look at my ass."

73
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,961
Stop looking at my ass!

74
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,922
I mean, I just think
you are totally inappropriate. Okay?

75
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,467
This is a work environment.
She's your subordinate.

76
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:04,180
But it was okay when you
slept with your old assistant, Tag?

77
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,599
That is totally different
for two reasons.

78
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,228
One: I didn't know
that you knew that.

79
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,150
And two: I wasn't some creep
staring at his ass.

80
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,779
We had a... We had a deep,
meaningful relationship.

81
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,283
What was Tag's last name?

82
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,201
It was...

83
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,872
Oh, my God.

84
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,583
He didn't... He didn't...
He didn't have a last name.

85
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,422
It was just Tag, you know,
like Cher or...

86
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,259
...you know, Moses.

87
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,096
But it was a deep,
meaningful relationship.

88
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,349
You know what? My first impression
of you was absolutely right.

89
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,310
You are arrogant. You are pompous.
Morgan! Morgan!

90
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,271
- Tag's last name was Morgan!
- It was Jones.

91
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,108
What are you, his boyfriend?

92
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:06,117
- Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
- You mean when you were a baby?

93
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,702
Sure.

94
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,748
Would you stop staring at her?

95
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,458
I wasn't staring.

96
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,003
I was leering.

97
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,464
What's the big deal with her?

98
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,717
Maybe she's attractive
in an obvious kind of way.

99
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:27,221
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.

100
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,015
You know, when it's right there
in your face.

101
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,976
Me, I like to have to work
to find someone attractive.

102
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,978
Makes me feel like I earned it.

103
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,273
Looks like Joey's doing all right
with her.

104
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,901
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys
to back off...

105
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,196
...and let Joey get the girl for once.

106
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,993
- I'm gonna take her to the apartment.
- Okay. I'll be home right after work.

107
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,704
- Okay.
- Okay, bye, Emma.

108
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:55,124
I love you.

109
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,875
- Bye.
- Bye.

110
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,503
They've elected me to talk to you
about the baby talk.

111
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,047
It's not so good.

112
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,424
I think it's sweet.

113
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,802
Bye, Emma!

114
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:13,600
Hey, listen, Joey. About Molly, I would
really prefer if you didn't go after her.

115
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,896
- Why not?
- It took months to find a good nanny.

116
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,899
And I wouldn't want anything to,
you know, drive her away.

117
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,152
So you think I'm just
gonna sleep with her...

118
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,613
...and never call her again, and
things are gonna get uncomfortable?

119
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,907
Yeah, that sounds about right.

120
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,119
Come on, there are plenty
of other women out there.

121
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:37,249
Just forget about her, okay?
She's off-limits.

122
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,585
Oh, man! What'd you have to go
and say that for?

123
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,422
Now that you told me I can't have her,
makes me want her even more!

124
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,885
- What are you, a child?
- Yes!

125
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,470
Look, Joey, come on now.
For me, please.

126
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:55,559
Just try to focus your sexual energy
on someone else.

127
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,228
Fine.

128
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,653
Take me home.

129
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,327
- Hey, Mikey.
- Hey, Pheeb.

130
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,955
- What are you doing?
- Setting rattraps.

131
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:21,794
- To kill Bob?
- No. No, to test his neck strength.

132
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,255
No, I don't want to kill him.
I thought we were gonna capture him...

133
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,050
...and, you know, set him free
in the countryside...

134
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,136
...where he could meet
a friendly possum...

135
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,222
...and a wisecracking owl.

136
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:37,268
- Okay, okay. I'll throw away the traps.
- All right, I'll find Bob. I'll get him.

137
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:41,563
Bob? Bob?

138
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,107
Robert?

139
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,611
Wait, I think I hear him.

140
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:54,451
Oh, my God! Bob had babies!
Bob's a mom!

141
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,203
We'll have to think of a new name.

142
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,831
I don't know,
I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.

143
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,334
No, no. I mean, I'm not sure that we...

144
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,840
Oh, my God. We killed Bob?

145
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,675
Well, maybe it wasn't Bob.
Maybe it was a mouse.

146
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,220
Susie?

147
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,476
What's up?

148
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,813
Seriously, dude. Three years ago.

149
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,609
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm gonna be out today.

150
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,194
Can you keep an eye on Joey...

151
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,905
...make sure nothing happens
between him and Molly?

152
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,282
- You don't trust him?
- Well, no.

153
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,202
Some woman who sounded
a lot like Joey called earlier...

154
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:41,206
...and asked for her daughter,
the "hot nanny."

155
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,710
Is this your long-term plan,
for me to run interference?

156
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:48,547
Because I could get a job any day now.

157
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,301
You do appear right on the cusp
of something.

158
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,679
Look, come on, man. I'm sure
he'll lose interest in a week or two...

159
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,349
...but for now, could you please
just do this for me?

160
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,434
Fine, but don't blame me
if it doesn't work.

161
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,229
Because you know once Joey
sets his mind on something...

162
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,857
...more often than not,
he's going to have sex with it.

163
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,986
Well, I mean,
we've gotta do something. Okay?

164
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,990
Nannies like her don't grow on trees.

165
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,537
- Picturing that tree?
- I am, yes.

166
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,379
Where you going, Joe?

167
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,511
For a walk.

168
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,638
You mind if I join you?

169
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:43,185
Actually, I'd rather be alone. You know,
I really need to organize my thoughts.

170
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,647
Your thoughts?

171
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,690
Plural?

172
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,404
All right, fine.
I only have one thought.

173
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,239
It's about the hot nanny!
I gotta see her!

174
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,745
- I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
- Now you're saying I can't see her?

175
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:05,458
You're killing me! She's forbidden fruit!
It's like, like...

176
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,378
...like she's the princess
and I'm the stable boy.

177
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,881
Why are you doing this, huh?

178
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,425
Did Ross tell you not to let me
go over there?

179
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,345
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
So I can't let you go.

180
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,391
Interesting. Now there are obstacles.

181
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,062
Hot nanny and me against the world!

182
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,356
This is the stuff great novels
are made of.

183
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,109
- Great novels?
- Fine. Mediocre porn.

184
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,157
- Gavin Mitchell's office.
- Rachel Greene's office.

185
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,867
Give me that phone.

186
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,997
Hello, this is Rachel Greene.
How can I help you?

187
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:51,045
Okay then.
I'll pass you back to your son.

188
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:55,090
Hey, Mom.
No, that's just my secretary.

189
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:01,180
Excuse me, Gavin.
I have a question I need to ask you.

190
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,391
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.

191
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:08,061
- Yes?
- Lf you like looking at butts so much...

192
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,648
...why don't you just go
look in a mirror?

193
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,984
Thank God you finally said that.

194
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:17,446
I saw you make a note on your pad
three hours ago.

195
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,867
- Man, I really bug you. Don't I?
- Oh, no. Please...

196
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,870
...I don't care about you
enough to bug me.

197
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:28,541
In fact, from now on,
I'm going to take the high road...

198
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:32,211
...and I'm going to be very, very nice
to you, you mama's boy...

199
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,712
...starting right now.

200
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,424
- Hey, Rach.
- Hi.

201
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,426
- Ready for your birthday lunch?
- I am.

202
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,679
But first, Monica,
I would like to introduce you...

203
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:46,016
...to my very talented colleague
and more importantly...

204
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,019
...my wonderful friend, Gavin Mitchell.

205
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,021
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

206
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,731
Are you coming to Rachel's party?

207
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,318
Oh, no, no, no, no. Gavin can't.
He already has plans...

208
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,946
...most likely with his mother.

209
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:03,867
I don't mind. I'll cancel them. I would
never miss my secretary's birthday.

210
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:10,124
Why did you invite him?
I can't stand that guy!

211
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,793
- You were being so nice to him.
- I was faking it.

212
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,795
Can't you tell when I'm being fake?

213
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,423
Hey, Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.

214
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,551
Right there.
That was so fake!

215
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,314
I still can't believe you invited Gavin.

216
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,359
He is just the last person
I want to see.

217
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:41,072
You're welcome for the party.
I'm glad you're having a good time.

218
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,991
I hope he doesn't show up.
Of course he won't, the guy hates me.

219
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,202
- Does he?
- What?

220
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,706
Maybe he keeps bothering you
so much because he likes you.

221
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,584
It's like in first grade
when Skippy Lange would push me...

222
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,211
...because he secretly
had a crush on me.

223
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,632
Monica, you think Skippy liked you?

224
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:03,093
Honey, all those boys had a bet
to see if he could knock you over.

225
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,223
- She's out. I'm gonna take her home.
- Okay. Thank you.

226
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,851
Bye, sweetheart.

227
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,148
Do you see what all the guys
see in her?

228
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,859
Wouldn't kick her out of bed.

229
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,819
No more vodka for me.

230
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,157
Hey, Rach. So can I sing
"Happy Birthday" to you now?

231
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:28,828
- Yeah, sure.
- All right.

232
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,622
See you later.

233
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,375
Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.

234
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,710
Give me!

235
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:43,342
- Wow. Wow. Oh, my God!
- Careful! Careful!

236
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,886
These are my rat babies!

237
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,059
Yeah. We have rat babies now.

238
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:57,272
You brought rats
to my birthday party?

239
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,401
So this is what a stroke feels like.

240
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,903
Well, I had to bring them.
We killed their mother.

241
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,322
They're our responsibility now.

242
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:09,452
You know, they require constant care.
You should know that, you're a mother.

243
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,206
Are you comparing my daughter
to a rat?

244
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,374
No. Seven rats.

245
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,254
We should take them home.
We need to feed them.

246
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,214
You're gonna leave my party
to take care of a box of rats?

247
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,800
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel,
but I'm not like you. Okay?

248
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,637
Not everyone can afford help.

249
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,980
Hey, where the hell
are Joey and Molly?

250
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,648
I asked you to watch them.

251
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,318
I'm sorry. I got a little preoccupied.

252
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,530
Look, we have to stop them
before something happens.

253
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,533
Right behind you, big guy.

254
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,620
So you see, Molly,
what people don't understand...

255
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,499
...is that acting is a discipline.
It takes a lot of hard work.

256
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,586
- So where'd you study?
- I didn't go to college.

257
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:06,675
- No, where'd you study acting?
- Molly, people don't study acting.

258
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:13,307
Molly, do you mind giving us
just a minute?

259
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,809
- Sure. I'll go check on Emma.
- Thanks.

260
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,814
Will the stable boy
never get the princess?

261
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:25,319
What do you think you were gonna do,
have sex with her here on my couch?

262
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,739
No. The leather sticks to my ass.

263
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,118
This isn't fair. What makes you think
I'm gonna sleep with her...

264
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,870
...and then blow her off, huh?

265
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:39,291
Can't you guys open your minds to
the possibility that I actually like her...

266
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,460
...and might want something real?

267
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:48,008
Look, the truth is, I haven't felt
this way about anyone since Rachel.

268
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:51,554
Okay?
I didn't think I could ever love again.

269
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,015
- Come on!
- Joe!

270
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,690
Hi. Is Molly here?

271
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:04,608
Yeah, yeah. Come on in. Molly?

272
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:10,447
- Hey. Guys, this is Tabitha.
- Hey.

273
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,369
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

274
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:28,924
Well, Joey, I guess
we have no problem.

275
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,845
It's like my favorite fairy tale
come true.

276
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,600
The princess, the stable boy
and the lesbian.

277
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,356
Okay. Okay,
you start preparing the formula...

278
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,233
...and I'll start changing the box.

279
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,528
And then we gotta put them
straight to bed.

280
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,613
When did we become
one of those couples...

281
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,241
...whose lives revolve around
their rats?

282
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,620
Well, you know what?
They're our responsibility now.

283
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:02,333
Okay, fine.
These rats are our responsibility.

284
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,918
What happens when they mate
and there are hundreds?

285
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:08,088
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.

286
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,883
Yeah, not such a problem with rats.

287
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,469
No, they're more of a "love the one
you're with" kind of animal.

288
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,347
No. Really?

289
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,934
Oh, my... Get off your sister!

290
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,188
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

291
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,483
The... We have seven rats.

292
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,278
So, what if each of them
has seven rats...

293
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:35,366
...and then each of those
has seven rats? That's like...

294
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,621
That's math I can't even do!

295
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,583
What are we gonna do?

296
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,168
Well, I know this is gonna
sound crazy...

297
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:53,967
...but we could
not let the box of rats ruin our lives.

298
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,598
Yeah, okay. I guess you're right.

299
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:03,102
All right, so we should just
give them away.

300
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:09,233
But to nice families with children
and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.

301
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,776
Those were Bob's favorites.

302
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,863
It's gonna be okay.

303
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,909
- You must think I'm crazy.
- No, I think you're sweet.

304
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:25,540
Good. This is just so hard.
It's hard for me to let them go.

305
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:29,670
I guess it just brings back memories,
you know...

306
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:35,134
...from when I gave birth to my brother's
triplets and I had to give them up.

307
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,516
I haven't told you about that yet,
have I?

308
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,324
Thanks for the party, honey.
Should I help you clean up?

309
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:03,829
No way. You had your party.
Now I have mine.

310
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,043
- Is everything all right?
- I just get bummed...

311
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,711
...when my birthday's over.

312
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:14,131
Well, at least you have one thing
to be happy about.

313
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:17,343
That jerk, Gavin, from your office
didn't show up.

314
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,178
Yeah, I hate him.

315
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,517
We weren't talking about you.
We were...

316
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:29,521
No. No way to recover. No. Okay.

317
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,651
- Fun party.
- Well, it was.

318
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,654
And you would have seen it
if you didn't show up at...

319
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:43,327
9:30?! God! This party was lame.

320
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,413
Again, you're welcome!

321
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,293
- Look, I'll just give you this and go.
- You bought me a present. Why?

322
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:56,131
Let me explain how birthday parties
usually work. There are presents...

323
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,176
...and a cake,
perhaps a fourth or fifth person.

324
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,472
Okay, I...

325
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,601
I got you the present to make up
for being such a jerk to you.

326
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:12,773
Well, okay. Well, that's very nice.
And you wrote a card.

327
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,151
- "From Gavin."
- I really mean it.

328
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:24,951
It's beautiful.

329
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,371
If you don't mind...?
Let me.

330
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:32,918
Well, what do you know, it fits.

331
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,341
See, Gavin. You're capable of being
a nice guy.

332
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,593
Why do you give me such a hard time?

333
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,388
I'm not sure.

334
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,560
Well, Monica seems to think
it's because you have feelings for me.

335
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,895
I do have feelings for you.

336
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,942
- You do?
- Yes. I feel that you're a little annoying.

337
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,737
See, why? Gavin, why?

338
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:04,033
Right when I'm about to change
my opinion of you, you go and you...

339
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,122
And you do that.

340
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,693
Hey. Listen, I think I left something
here.

341
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,905
Well, somebody left this.
Is this yours?

342
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,574
No, but I like it.

343
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,744
No, I think I left one of my rat babies.

344
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:54,374
Well, no. I haven't seen it,
but if I do, I'll let you know.

345
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,836
Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Rat baby!

346
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,422
Maybe that's him.

347
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,430
