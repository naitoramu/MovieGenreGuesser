I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,464
Man, this is weird.

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,343
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's
eyebrows are on his hat?

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:10,677
That's what's weird?

6
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:15,391
The man's been captain
of a cereal for 40 years.

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,144
What?

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:23,565
The spoon!
You licked and you put.

9
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,610
You licked and you put.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,320
Yeah, so?

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,283
Don't you see how gross that is?
It's like you using my toothbrush!

12
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,412
You used my toothbrush?

13
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:41,166
Only because I used the red one
to unclog the drain.

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,919
Mine is the red one!

15
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:49,383
Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

16
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,010
Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

17
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,221
...but we can use the same soap?

18
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,976
Because soap is soap.
It's self-cleaning.

19
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,853
The next time you shower...

20
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:06,525
...think about the last thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

23
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,620
Look at you fancy lads!

24
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,914
What's the occasion?

25
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,793
You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

26
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,754
He's having a brunch.

27
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,465
Ready when you are.

28
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,259
I can't believe you're
actually getting tattoos.

29
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,512
You guys are getting tattoos?

30
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:20,099
But you cannot tell Ross
because I wanna surprise him.

31
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,143
Wow, this is wild!
What are you gonna get?

32
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,354
I'm getting a lily.

33
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:30,109
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

34
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:35,155
That's lucky. What if
her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

35
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,449
- Where you getting it?
- On my shoulder.

36
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,825
What?

37
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,161
What's on your shoulder?

38
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,914
A chip.

39
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,001
- A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
- A tattoo?

40
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:52,047
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

41
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,258
You don't think
they're kind of cool?

42
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,343
No. Sorry, I don't.

43
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,888
Why would anyone pay someone
to scar their body for life?

44
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,182
What if it doesn't come out right?

45
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:07,062
It's like having
a bad haircut all the time.

46
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,690
Why is everyone staring at me?

47
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,401
Sign this card for Dad.
Richard will be here soon.

48
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,486
Richard's going to the party too?

49
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,072
He's my parents' best friend.
He has to go.

50
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,575
So is today the day
you'll tell them about you two?

51
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:25,539
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

52
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,083
No, I think you should tell them.

53
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,711
I don't know how serious he is.
Until I do, I won't say anything.

54
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,256
I don't think
Mom and Dad would mind.

55
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,467
Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said...

56
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,096
..."God, I hope they get together."

57
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:45,851
Shall we?

58
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,894
Okay, wait.

59
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,563
You know what?

60
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,983
Ross, let's switch places.
You get in the middle.

61
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,486
This looks like we're trying
to cover something up.

62
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:01,909
You could come in straddling him,
they still wouldn't believe it.

63
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,202
We're here!

64
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,289
- Hi, kids!
- The children!

65
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,542
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you.

66
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,626
Happy birthday!

67
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,338
So you kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

68
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:20,052
Actually, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,220
So you kids take the train in?

70
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,932
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

71
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,475
Speaking of whom...

72
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:32,147
...I hear he's got some
20-year-old twinkie in the city.

73
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,484
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

74
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,614
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

75
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:44,785
So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

76
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,495
Are we still on that?

77
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:50,624
You just know she's got
the IQ of a napkin.

78
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,292
She's probably not even pretty.

79
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:57,798
Just young enough so that
everything is still pointing up.

80
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,680
<i>Can you believe this place?</i>

81
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,766
I know. This is a great apartment.

82
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,894
In the bathroom there's mirrors
on both sides of you.

83
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,773
When you're in there, it's like
peeing with the Rockettes.

84
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,859
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

85
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,487
Seriously.

86
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,365
We were just saying, great apartment!

87
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,534
Thanks. You want it?

88
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,244
I'm moving to a bigger place.

89
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,579
You should take this one.

90
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,957
Can you see me in a place like this?

91
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,293
Why not? You hate park views
and high ceilings?

92
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,089
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

93
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,759
That's all right,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

94
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,010
On TV.

95
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,638
Stop talking. Okay!

96
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,392
- Come on, tell us!
- Is she really 20?

97
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,518
I am not telling you guys anything.

98
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,063
Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me live vicariously!

99
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,399
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

100
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,318
What's a little midlife crisis
between friends?

101
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,029
Would you let it go?

102
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,657
I know what you're going through.
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

103
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,744
You got your own little speedster.

104
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,872
- Seriously, it's not like that.
- Tell you what.

105
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:16,084
Maybe one of these weekends
you can borrow the car and I could...

106
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,838
Dad, I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

107
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,797
What? I'm kidding!

108
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:25,386
You know I'd never let him
touch the Porsche.

109
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,477
Okay, Rach.

110
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,563
Which lily?
This lily or that lily?

111
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,107
- Well, I...
- I like this lily.

112
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,777
It's more open
and that's like my mom.

113
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,738
She had a more open, giving spirit.

114
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,533
Foghorn Leghorn!

115
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,911
Blonde girl?
You're in room two.

116
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,122
Not-so-blonde girl, you're with me.

117
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,750
Here we go!

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,628
You're not going.

119
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,465
Is this because of what Ross said?

120
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,302
- Well, yeah, maybe.
- I don't believe this.

121
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:12,308
Is this how this relationship works?
Ross equals boss?

122
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,061
Come on, what is this, 1922?

123
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,270
What's 1922?

124
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:21,025
Just, you know, a long time ago.

125
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,611
When men used to tell women
what to do a lot.

126
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:29,950
Then there was suffrage, which was
a good thing. But it sounds horrible.

127
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,245
Do you want this tattoo?

128
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,331
Yes, I do.
It's just that Ross...

129
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:40,044
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

130
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,839
Who is the boss of you?

131
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,551
You?

132
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,595
You are the boss of you!

133
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:53,140
You march in there and
get that tattoo on your hip!

134
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,310
Go!

135
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,066
How you doing?

136
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,777
I'm a twinkie!

137
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,822
Really? I'm a hero.

138
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,700
This is so hard.

139
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,036
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

140
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,956
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

141
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,168
Maybe we should just tell
your parents first.

142
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,921
My parents are dead.

143
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:28,008
God, you are so lucky!

144
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,970
I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

145
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,597
Just hang in there, okay?

146
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:38,018
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

147
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:46,735
Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

148
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:53,658
Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

149
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,872
Honey.

150
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,124
Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

151
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,210
I have no idea.

152
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,381
Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

153
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,760
I know. He's a new man.
It's like a scene from "Cocoon".

154
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,222
I just never would have
pictured Richard with a bimbo.

155
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,308
He told Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girl.

156
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,104
He told Johnny that he thinks
he's falling in love with her.

157
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,857
- Really?
- I've never seen him this happy.

158
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,734
So, Jack...

159
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,612
...ever think about trading me in
for a younger model?

160
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,947
Of course not.

161
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,284
With you, it's like
I've got two 25-year-olds.

162
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,914
Oh, Jack, stop!

163
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,458
Come on!

164
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,671
It's my birthday!

165
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,550
Can we drop this?

166
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,052
I am not interested
in the guy's apartment.

167
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:58,557
Oh, please. I saw the way
you were checking out his moldings.

168
00:09:58,807 --> 00:09:59,641
You want it.

169
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,977
Why would I want another apartment?

170
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,396
I've already got
an apartment that I love.

171
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,316
It wouldn't kill you
to say it once in a while.

172
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:15,365
All right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

173
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,201
- What?
- I'm sorry.

174
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,287
I'm 28. I've never lived alone...

175
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,457
...and I'm at a place
where I got enough money...

176
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,418
...that I don't need a roommate.

177
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,670
I don't need a roommate either.

178
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,465
I can afford to live here by myself.

179
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:36,220
I may have to bring in somebody
once a week to lick the silverware.

180
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,639
Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

181
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,183
We didn't agree to live
together forever.

182
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,603
We're not Bert and Ernie.

183
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,230
You know what?

184
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,273
If this is the way you feel...

185
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,027
...then maybe you should take it.

186
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,403
- That's how I feel.
- Then maybe you should take it!

187
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,530
Maybe I will!

188
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,115
- Fine with me!
- Great!

189
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,076
You can spend more quality time
with your real friends...

190
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,787
...the spoons!

191
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,666
Whose drink can I freshen?

192
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,211
Almost time for cake!

193
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,013
Mon, are you okay?

194
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:24,477
You remember that video
I found of Mom and Dad?

195
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,605
Well, I just caught the live show.

196
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,868
- Hey, there.
- What?

197
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:46,915
Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

198
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,709
Really?

199
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,798
- Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
- Not that I know of.

200
00:11:55,048 --> 00:12:00,053
I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a call?

201
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,933
That's an idea.

202
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,269
Well, actually,
I'm already seeing someone.

203
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,313
Oh?

204
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,651
She never tells us anything.

205
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,321
Ross, did you know
Monica's seeing someone?

206
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,200
Mom, there are
so many people in my life.

207
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,119
Some are seeing people
and some aren't.

208
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,622
Is that crystal?

209
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,042
So who's the mystery man?

210
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,670
Well, he's a doctor.

211
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,339
A real doctor?

212
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,217
No, a doctor of meat.

213
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,469
Of course he's a real doctor.

214
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,013
And he's handsome.

215
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,016
And he's sweet,
and I know you'd like him.

216
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,770
Well, that's wonderful.

217
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,318
Mom, it's okay.

218
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,527
It is, Judy.

219
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,781
Jack!

220
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,076
Could you come in here for a moment?

221
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,953
Now!

222
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:10,374
- Found it!
- I'll take that, Dad.

223
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:17,297
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

224
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:22,094
That's impossible.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

225
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,804
I'm the twinkie.

226
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,473
- You're the twinkie?
- She's not a twinkie!

227
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,434
Look, this is the best relationship
I've been in...

228
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,396
Oh, please! A relationship?

229
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,022
Yes, a relationship!

230
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,484
For your information,
I'm crazy about this man.

231
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,236
Really?

232
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:44,325
Am I supposed to stand here
and listen to this on my birthday?

233
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,704
This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

234
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:49,746
When did I say that?

235
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:54,418
Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you felt up Mom!

236
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,004
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

237
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,799
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

238
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,595
<i>Happy birthday, dear Jack</i>

239
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:11,435
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

240
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,938
It looks so good!
Oh, I love it.

241
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,234
I know, so do I!
I'm so glad you made me do this.

242
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,903
Okay, let me see yours.

243
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,449
Let's see yours again.

244
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,871
We just saw mine.
Let me see yours.

245
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,500
Oh, no!

246
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,086
It's gone! That's so weird.

247
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:41,298
I don't know how, where it went.

248
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,718
You didn't get it?

249
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,095
Why not?

250
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,805
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

251
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,558
How could you do this to me?
This was your idea!

252
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,352
I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needle.

253
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:58,232
And did you know
they do this with needles?

254
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,150
Really? You don't say?

255
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,863
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

256
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,201
I'm sorry about what...

257
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,412
- Yeah, me too.
- I know.

258
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,710
Do we need to hug?

259
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:21,130
No, we're all right.

260
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,798
So I got you something.

261
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,885
Plastic spoons!

262
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:31,181
- Great!
- Lick away, my man!

263
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,727
These will go great in my new place
till I get real ones.

264
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,271
What?

265
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:42,109
I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

266
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,445
No, I mean what's this
about your new place?

267
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,448
I'm moving out,
like we talked about.

268
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:51,160
I didn't think that was serious.

269
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,413
You know, I thought
that was just a fight.

270
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,331
Well, it was a fight...

271
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,834
...based on serious stuff, remember?

272
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,211
About how I never
lived alone or anything?

273
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,673
I think it would be good for me.
Help me to grow...

274
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,551
...or whatever.

275
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,473
Well, there you go.

276
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,934
Hey, are you cool with this?

277
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,895
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

278
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,440
I've never been lower or wetter.

279
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,485
I'll be fine.
I'll just turn your...

280
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,278
...bedroom into a game room.

281
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:30,365
Put the foosball table in there.

282
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,327
Why do you get to keep the table?

283
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:39,124
I did pay for half of it.

284
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,168
I paid for the other half.

285
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,756
I'll tell you what.
I'll play you for it.

286
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,174
All right, you're on.

287
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:51,553
I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

288
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,850
Your men will get scored on
more times than your sister.

289
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,984
Which sister?

290
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:10,155
So are you sorry that I told them?

291
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:16,036
No. It's been a long time
since your dad and I went running.

292
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:19,957
Did you get it?

293
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,000
- Is Ross here?
- He went out for pizza.

294
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,212
Okay, really quick.

295
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,422
That's great!

296
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,716
Very tasteful.

297
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,801
Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?

298
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,678
What? You didn't get one.

299
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:37,099
Okay. Well then, what is this?

300
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,144
What are we looking at?

301
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,772
That blue freckle?

302
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,191
That's my tattoo.

303
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,193
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

304
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,778
I got her in the chair...

305
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:53,907
...he barely touched her with the
needle, she screamed and that was it.

306
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,327
Okay, hi!

307
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,083
For your information,
this is exactly what I wanted.

308
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:07,587
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

309
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,675
It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

310
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,762
Oh, what a load of crap!

311
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,389
That is a dot!

312
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:23,812
Your mother's in heaven going,
"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

313
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:28,901
That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

314
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,698
You got a tattoo?

315
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,117
Maybe.

316
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:41,746
But just a little one.
Phoebe got the whole world!

317
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,501
Well, let me see.

318
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,671
Well?

319
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,966
Well, it's really...

320
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,592
...sexy.

321
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,887
I wouldn't have thought
it would be, but...

322
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,765
...wow!

323
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,602
Really?

324
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:09,149
So is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

325
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,027
I guess.

326
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,988
Save us some pizza.

327
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,247
Get it out of the corner!

328
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,956
Pass it! Pass it!

329
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,669
Stop talking to your men!

330
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:33,132
And the table is mine.

331
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,888
Congratulations.

332
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,401
You guys will still
come visit me, right?

333
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,361
Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.

334
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,280
We'll be over there all the time.

335
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:01,160
Except when we are here.

336
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,332
I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'll really miss you.

337
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,669
How can you not be
across the hall anymore?

338
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,090
Who's gonna eat all of our food
and tie up our phone lines...

339
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,718
Is that my bra?

340
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,139
- What are you doing with my bra?
- It's not what you think.

341
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,436
We used it to fling
water balloons off the roof.

342
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:31,815
Remember? Those kids couldn't
even get theirs across the street.

343
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,734
Yeah, I remember.

344
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:40,616
Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

345
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,086
You want me to...

346
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:57,091
...give you a hand
with the foosball table?

347
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:01,595
You keep it.
You need the practice.

348
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,264
Thanks.

349
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:06,183
So...

350
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,893
...I guess this is it.

351
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,144
Yeah, right.

352
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,230
I guess so.

353
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,695
When am I gonna see you?

354
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,030
I'm guessing tonight
at the coffeehouse.

355
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,408
Right. Yeah. Okay.

356
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,704
Take care.
