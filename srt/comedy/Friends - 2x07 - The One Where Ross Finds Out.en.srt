2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,674
What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:10,886
Is there something
repellent about me?

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,054
How was the party?

6
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:16,433
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,019
What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,063
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

9
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,941
I go through the same thing.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:28,904
When I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

11
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,118
I've put on weight?

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,830
Did you want to...?

13
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:43,293
No, not weight.
More like insulation.

14
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,130
I'm unemployed,
in dire need of a project.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,215
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.

16
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:52,594
I would, but that might get
in the way of my lying-around time.

17
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:53,721
Please?

18
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,056
Come on, let her do it!

19
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,098
All right.

20
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:01,895
If we put on spandex and my boobs
are bigger than yours, I'm going home.

21
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,188
Your boobs are fine.

22
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,898
I shouldn't have said anything.

23
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,693
Come here. Come here!

24
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,406
Can't make hands meet!

25
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,703

27
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,920
Let's do it!

28
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,549
What?

29
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:17,762
Nothing. Just never seen
your little stretchy pants before.

30
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,475
And we're changing.

31
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,865
Come on, give me five more!

32
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,492
Five more!

33
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,995
Five more and I'll flash you.

34
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,874
One...

35
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,375
...two...

36
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,879
...two and a half.

37
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,675
Just show me one of them.

38
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:10,983
She's insane!

39
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,317
The woman is insane.

40
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,154
It's before work, after work,
and during work.

41
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,616
She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

42
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:23,037
And now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

43
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,206
Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?

44
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,667
It was nice. Took him
to a romantic restaurant...

45
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,253
...ordered champagne. Nice.

46
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,754
He still won't put out?

47
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,382
Nope. Zilch. Nothing.

48
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,717
Sorry, Pheebs.

49
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,845
Look, I don't mind taking it slow.

50
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,305
I like him a lot.

51
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,558
He's really interesting,
and he's really sweet.

52
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,686
Why won't he give it up?

53
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,106
Maybe he drives his car
on the other side of the road.

54
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,150
If you know what I mean.

55
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:58,655
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

56
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,285
Maybe he's gay.

57
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,288
I don't think that's the problem.

58
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,331
We went dancing
the other night...

59
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,795
...and just the way he held me so close
and looked into my eyes...

60
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,506
I just definitely felt something.

61
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,092
But how much can you
tell from a look?

62
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,804
I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.

63
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,350
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

64
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,648
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand
and smack her with it.

65
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,775
Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

66
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,528
What?

67
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,156
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.

68
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,282
You have a date?

69
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,077
Monica's setting me up.

70
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,287
What about Ross and...

71
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,832
What? My whole
insane jealousy thing?

72
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,626
Well, you know,
as much fun as that was...

73
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,545
...I've decided to opt for sanity.

74
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,298
You're okay about all this?

75
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,925
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.

76
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,595
He can press her up against
that window as much as he wants.

77
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:09,143
For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

78
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,561
Hi, guys.

79
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:15,149
Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and
pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

80
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,651
If you say his full name.

81
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:24,282
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

82
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,284
All right.

83
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:29,830
- You're getting a cat?
- Actually, we're getting a cat.

84
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,415
Together?

85
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,667
Both of you? Together?

86
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,671
It'll live with Ross half the time
and with me half the time.

87
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,591
Well, isn't that just lovely?

88
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,886
That's something you'll enjoy...

89
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,597
...for a really, really,
really long time.

90
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,474
Hopefully.

91
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,936
Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

92
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,522
With a man.

93
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,023
You guys have a really good night...

94
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:02,738
...and you two have a really good cat.

95
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,536
We're not supposed to
take these when we leave.

96
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:20,172
I don't know if Monica told you, but
this my first date since my divorce.

97
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,299
If I seem a little nervous...

98
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,384
...I am.

99
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,555
How long do cats live?

100
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,805
I'm sorry?

101
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,058
Cats. How long do they live?

102
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,729
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus or something?

103
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,482
Maybe 15, 16 years.

104
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,818
Well, that's just great.

105
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,946
Cheers!

106
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,366
Right. Clink.

107
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:56,792
Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

108
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,297
No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just...

109
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:02,923
It's this thing.

110
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,925
It's not as bad as it sounds...

111
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,887
...but this friend of mine is
getting a cat with his girlfriend.

112
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,599
Oh, that does sound...

113
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,354
He just started going out with her.

114
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:21,817
Is this guy an old boyfriend?

115
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,904
Yeah, he wishes.

116
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,449
I'm sorry. Look at me.

117
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,662
Michael, let's talk about you.

118
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,250
So...

119
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:43,672
Did you ever get a pet
with a girlfriend?

120
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,717
- So I figured it out.
- What?

121
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,136
Why Scott doesn't want
to sleep with me.

122
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,722
I'm not sexy enough.

123
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,224
Phoebe, that's crazy.

124
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,143
When I first met you,
you know what I said?

125
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:02,024
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

126
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,820
Really? That's so sweet.

127
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:12,451
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

128
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:17,080
If you wanna know what the deal is,
you're gonna have to ask him.

129
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,416
You're right. You're right.

130
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,669
You are so "yum"!

131
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:46,860
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

132
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,155
Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.

133
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,532
Those things that live for a day.

134
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,411
What are they called?

135
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:58,038
Fruit flies?

136
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,331
Thank you.

137
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,125
Would you like dessert?

138
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,210
No dessert.

139
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,421
Just the check. Please.

140
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,550
Oh, no. You're not
having fun, are you?

141
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,385
No, no, I am.

142
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:17,933
But only because I've been playing
the movie "Diner" in my head.

143
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,726
Oh, look at me.

144
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,061
Look at me.

145
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,898
I'm on a date
with a really great guy.

146
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,359
All I can think about is Ross...

147
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,486
...and his cat...

148
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,072
...and his Julie.

149
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:37,410
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?

150
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,581
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

151
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,627
You can't see it because
you haven't had closure...

152
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,671
Closure!

153
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,965
That's what it is!
That's what I need!

154
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,593
God, you're brilliant!

155
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:57,973
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

156
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,269
Well, there's no one way
really, it's just...

157
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,564
Whatever it takes so that
you can finally say to him:

158
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,150
"I'm over you."

159
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,818
Over you.

160
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,487
That's what it is.

161
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,240
Closure.

162
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,826
Hello? Excuse me?

163
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,412
Excuse me. Hel...

164
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,830
- Hang on.
- Excuse me?

165
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,707
- What?
- Hi. I'm sorry.

166
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:28,044
I need to borrow your phone
for just one minute.

167
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,630
- I'm talking.
- I see that.

168
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,719
One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.

169
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:40,015
You're being a little weird
about your phone.

170
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,977
All right. Fine.

171
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,815
I'll call you back.

172
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,360
Thank you.

173
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,535
Machine.

174
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:03,497
- Just waiting for the beep.
- Good.

175
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,167
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

176
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,961
I'm just calling to say that...

177
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,755
...everything's fine.

178
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,049
And I'm really happy for you...

179
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,551
...and your cat.

180
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:22,391
Who, by the way, I think
you should name Michael.

181
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,061
You see there,
I'm thinking of names...

182
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,689
...so obviously I am over you.

183
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,026
I am over you.

184
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:39,950
And that, my friend,
is what they call "closure".

185
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,466
It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

186
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,595
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!

187
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:03,307
It's God's day.

188
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:07,144
If you say stop, then we stop.

189
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,145
Stop.

190
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,314
No, come on! We can't stop!

191
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,441
We got three more pounds to go!

192
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:17,279
I am the energy train
and you are on board!

193
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,508
And how was the date?

194
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,594
I think there was a restaurant.

195
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,014
I know there was wine.

196
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,684
Actually, Julie's getting a cab.

197
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:51,105
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say...

198
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,275
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

199
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:56,861
I'm sorry. I don't know, I...

200
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,446
I feel like I dreamed
about you last night...

201
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,532
...but I don't remember.

202
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,330
There they are.

203
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,832
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?

204
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:15,004
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

205
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:19,008
I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?

206
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:22,553
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

207
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:28,434
Rach, I got a message from you!

208
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:32,980
Who's Michael?

209
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,398
Oh, my God!

210
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:39,236
Ross, no! Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

211
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,990
Give me the...

212
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,204
You're over me?

213
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,706
Oh, God!

214
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,917
- You're...
- Oh, God.

215
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,587
You're over me?

216
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,761
When were you...

217
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,181
...under me?

218
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,354
Rachel, do you...?

219
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,606
I mean, were you?

220
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,650
What?

221
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,486
Basically...

222
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:25,241
...lately, I've...

223
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,120
I've sort of had feelings for you.

224
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,292
You've had feelings for me?

225
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,129
So? You had feelings for me first!

226
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,926
You know about my...
You know I had...

227
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,638
You know?

228
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,805
Chandler told me.

229
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:53,060
When did he? When did he?
When did he?

230
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,896
When you were in China.

231
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,023
Meeting Julie.

232
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:02,652
Julie. That's...
Oh, God!

233
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,156
I need to lie down.

234
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,699
No, I'm gonna stand.

235
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,577
I'm gonna stand...

236
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:15,165
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.

237
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,295
Now you're over me?

238
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,549
Are you over me?

239
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,437
That's Julie.

240
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,440
- Hi, Julie.
<i>- I've got a cab waiting.</i>

241
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,110
I'll be right down!

242
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,031
Wait, so you're going?

243
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,910
Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

244
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,370
I mean, I've...
You know, I've got a cab.

245
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,416
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.

246
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,797
Cat!

247
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,858
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

248
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,446
How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

249
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:31,283
I can't find the remote.

250
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,704
Thank you.

251
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,498
Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

252
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,502
- And?
- And we did.

253
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,462
All right! Way to go!

254
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,422
Yea, me!

255
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,674
So how did it happen?

256
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,678
I took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

257
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,179
What did he say?

258
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:56,683
He understands how sex can be
a very emotional thing for a woman.

259
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,895
And he was just afraid
that I was going to get all:

260
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:04,691
"Is he gonna call me the next day?"
and "Where is this going?"

261
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:11,240
So he said he wanted to hold off
until he was prepared to be serious.

262
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:16,995
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please."

263
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:21,292
Sex can be just about two people
right there in the moment.

264
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:25,296
If he wants to see me again, he can
call. If not, that's fine too.

265
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:30,509
So after a lot of talking...

266
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:34,680
...I convinced him.

267
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,517
Let me get this straight.

268
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,728
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

269
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:46,150
He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

270
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:51,029
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

271
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:57,202
This man is my god!

272
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,597
I didn't get a cat.

273
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:20,059
That's interesting.

274
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:24,188
No, it's not "interesting".
It's very, very not interesting.

275
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,399
It's actually 100%
the opposite of interesting.

276
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,817
I got it, Ross.

277
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,821
You had no right to say
you had feelings for me.

278
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,657
I was doing great with Julie
before I knew!

279
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,743
I was doing great
before I knew about you!

280
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,370
You think it's easy
to see you with Julie?

281
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,665
You should've said something before!

282
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,168
I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?

283
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,961
There was never a good time.

284
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,716
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

285
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,675
Not...

286
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,512
...every night.

287
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:59,682
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.

288
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,600
You know, like Italian guys...

289
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:09,358
...or Italian guys.

290
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,153
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?

291
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,156
The point is, I don't need
this right now!

292
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,074
Okay? It's too late.

293
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,245
I'm with somebody else. I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!

294
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,623
You're just gonna put away
your feelings for me?

295
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,501
I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.

296
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,170
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.

297
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,713
I don't need your ship!

298
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,341
- Good.
- Good!

299
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,971
And you know what?
Now I got closure!

300
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,192
Try the bottom one.

301
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,973
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

302
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:07,101
We're not working out.
It's over.

303
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,770
No way! With one pound to go?
Come on!

304
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,733
<i>We're workin', we're movin'</i>
<i>We're in the zone, we're groovin'</i>

305
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,818
I don't mind the last pound.

306
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:20,823
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

307
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:24,201
So don't make me do anything
that I'll regret.

308
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,996
What you gonna do, fat boy?

309
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,749
What?

310
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:35,796
Nothing. Except tell you it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

311
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,673
Well, thanks.

312
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:42,970
Especially considering how tough
it's been for you to find work.

313
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:50,769
You can't tell your parents you were
fired, because they'd be disappointed.

314
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:58,277
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

315
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,612
Well, no. But I...

316
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:05,910
If it were me, I'd have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

317
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,626
You know, I try to stay positive.

318
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,544
So you...

319
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:19,756
You feel like going for a run?

320
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,551
All right.

321
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:29,433
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.

322
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,771
For a little while.
