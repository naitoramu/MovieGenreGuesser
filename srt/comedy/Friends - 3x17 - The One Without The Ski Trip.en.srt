1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,620
Can I see the comics?

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,670
This is the New York Times.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,860
Okay, may I see the comics?

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,870
I thought you were
taking Ross to the game.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,220
-We are. He's meeting us here.
-No, Rachel's meeting us here!

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,180
Come on!
They can be in the same room.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,230
-You should've been there last night.
-What happened?

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,020
Ross was hanging out at our place.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,580
Rachel comes over to borrow
some moisturizer from Chandler--

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,420
How hard is it to say "something"?

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,790
Rachel came over to borrow "something. "

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,300
Anyway, her and Ross just started
yelling at each other.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,820
Why was he yelling at her?
He slept with someone else.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,230
He says they were on a break
when it happened. . .

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,180
. . .so she should've
forgiven him by now.

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,310
He is so unreasonable! God!

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,540
Although I understand what he means.

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,300
Oh, my God!
This is like 60 Minutes...

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,190
. . .when at first you're mad that
pharmaceutical company made the drug.

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,190
And then, you just feel bad
for the people, because. . .

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,860
. . .they needed
to make their hair grow.

22
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,580
You know, this is like
when my parents got divorced.

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,830
I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me
after Cub Scouts.

24
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,630
I dreamed that Ross and Rachel
were still together.

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,700
And we were all
hanging out and happy.

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,070
I had the same dream.

27
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,790
-And nobody slept with the xerox girl.
-Oh, I had the opposite dream.

28
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,780
Maybe it's gonna be okay.
I mean, it's been a week.

29
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,550
It never takes me more than a week
to get over a relationship.

30
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,740
It never takes you more than a shower
to get over a relationship.

31
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,990
Let's go! Let's hit the road.
Let's get the show on it.

32
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,110
Let me get coffee.

33
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,340
I know the best coffeehouse.
And it's close.

34
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,980
Closer than here?

35
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,820
Oh, look! I found coffee!

36
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,390
Okay, let's skedaddle.

37
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,980
I'm not gonna drink
somebody's old coffee.

38
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,750
Okay, Your Highness.

39
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,390
"Rachel, I'm really sorry. "
"Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"

40
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,470
"Yeah, okay. "

41
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,990
Did anyone else hear that?

42
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,030
The One Without the Ski Trip

43
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,260
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

44
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,310
Is he here?

45
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,230
Here's your moisturizer.

46
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,580
You guys are gonna love me!
Okay, check it out.

47
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,590
Thursday night, five tickets.

48
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,990
Calvin Klein lingerie show,
and you guys are coming with me.

49
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,190
I said that out loud, right?

50
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,820
Yes, it's just that
we kind of already. . .

51
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,980
. . .made plans with Ross.

52
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,190
Well, okay.

53
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,700
Well, there you go.

54
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,180
It's just, he got this new
home-theater dealy. . .

55
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,220
. . .and he wants us to check it out.

56
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,030
He's excited about it too.

57
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,180
He even recorded showtimes
on his answering machine.

58
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,620
-We're sorry, honey.
-Oh, it's okay.

59
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,180
Rach, it's not that
we don't want to. Really.

60
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,660
Are we talking models
in their underwear?

61
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,310
And heels.

62
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,190
Ross did ask us first,
and we set that night aside.

63
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,630
Come on. If he asked you first,
it's only fair.

64
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,390
Oh, boy, do I feel bad!

65
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,180
very bad.

66
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,150
Chandler, what are you doing?

67
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,790
Oh, my God!

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,980
You're smoking again?

69
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,790
Well, actually,
yesterday, I was smoking again.

70
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,260
Today I'm smoking, still.

71
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,830
Why would you start again
after chewing all that quitting gum?

72
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,630
This is just like
my parents' divorce. . .

73
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,030
. . .which is when
I first started smoking.

74
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,630
Weren't you 9?

75
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,780
I'm telling you something,
that first smoke after naptime. . . .

76
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,980
That's great.
With my luck, that's him.

77
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,550
Him? Ross?

78
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,270
No, "Hymn" 253:
"His Eyes Are on the Sparrow. "

79
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,390
When my parents got divorced, I started
using humor as a defense mechanism.

80
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,870
Hi. Do you guys have weekend plans?

81
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,990
Because my sister says we can spend
the weekend at her cabin, skiing.

82
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,430
I'm asking you first, right?
I'm playing by the rules.

83
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,790
Absolutely.

84
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,830
Chandler! You're smoking?
What are you doing?

85
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,220
Shut up!
You're not my real mom!

86
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,180
Could you close that window?
My nipples could cut glass!

87
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,740
Really? Because mine
get me out of tickets.

88
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,190
Look, I just wanna say I really
appreciate you spending time with me.

89
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,350
It's been a hard time right now,
so I just want to say thanks.

90
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,590
Somebody else hug him.
I have to stay by the window.

91
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,620
How about this weekend, we have
a laser-disc marathon, okay?

92
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,780
And maybe a tournament
on my new: : :

93
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,260
. . .dart board! What do you think?

94
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,780
Two days of darts! It'll be great!

95
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,030
It'll be great for next weekend.

96
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,820
This weekend, guys.

97
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,020
It'll be great for next weekend.

98
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,790
I mean, "It'll be great. "

99
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,780
What's going on?

100
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,820
We're sort of invited to go skiing.
You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?

101
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,790
So, for the whole weekend?

102
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,550
We're really sorry,
but she did ask us first.

103
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,830
That's okay. If you
all have to go away. . .

104
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,790
. . .for the first weekend I'm
alone by myself. . .

105
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,740
. . .then I totally understand.

106
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,430
I can stay. I'm gonna stay.

107
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,980
The last time I went,
I was afraid to leave the chair lift.

108
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,780
I just went round and round.

109
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,110
We need you to drive us there
in your grandmother's cab.

110
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,830
-But you know what? I'll stay.
-No, I'll stay. He's my brother.

111
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,990
What, a "pity stay"?

112
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,990
We're gonna have fun!

113
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,220
We can make fudge.

114
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,620
Pity food?

115
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,390
You know what?
I don't need any of you to stay.

116
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,950
Nobody stays.

117
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,670
Well, then, I might as well
offer to stay.

118
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,100
Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?

119
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,500
You think he's still mad?

120
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,750
He's probably more mad since
you called him to borrow his goggles.

121
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,510
What? Mine aren't tinted.

122
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,980
What?

123
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,190
What does the sign say?

124
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,780
"Beam me up, Jesus. "

125
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,990
The "No Smoking" sign.

126
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,790
There's no smoking
in my grandmother's cab.

127
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,190
Well, then, I have to go
to the bathroom.

128
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,990
Oh, please!

129
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,990
No unscheduled stops.
You can go when we stop for gas.

130
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,630
There's a rest stop right up there.
Come on, I really have to go!

131
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,590
Oh, now I have to go!

132
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,630
Here we go.

133
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,390
-Brace yourself!
-What?

134
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,550
-Aren't you gonna go?
-No, thanks.

135
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,350
Rachel never pees in public restrooms.

136
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,980
They never have any paper in there.

137
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,950
So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy. "

138
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,380
Well, if everybody's going. . . .

139
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,750
Don't close it!
The keys are in there!

140
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,220
-What's going on?
-My lighter's in there!

141
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,870
Damn! The tailpipe's
not hot enough to light this.

142
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,190
I can open this.
Anybody got a coat hanger?

143
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,230
Oh, I do.

144
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,820
No, I took it out of my shirt
when I put it on this morning.

145
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,420
So if your parents hadn't divorced. . .

146
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,780
. . .you'd be able to answer a question
like a normal person?

147
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,830
Look, I just need a wire something
to jimmy it.

148
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,020
One of you give me
your bra underwire.

149
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,590
Come on!
Who has the biggest boobs?

150
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,510
Whoever has the biggest boobs,
has the biggest bra and wire.

151
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,310
-No!
-It's too expensive!

152
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,830
To get back in the car,
we need that wire.

153
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,220
Your call.

154
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,190
Monica's are the biggest.

155
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,590
These tiny little non-breasts?
Please! It's gotta be Rachel.

156
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,630
No, mine are deceptively small.

157
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,470
I mean, I actually sometimes
stuff my bra.

158
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,380
Well, then, your bra would
still be big.

159
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,950
No, I stuff outside the bra.

160
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,110
Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?

161
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,580
Phoebe, Rachel,
take off Monica's bra.

162
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,380
All right, forget it, never mind.

163
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,430
-You can have mine.
-Thank you.

164
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,180
What are you doing?
There's a trash can right there.

165
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,790
I thought if I littered, that crying
lndian might come by and save us.

166
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,630
There.

167
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,430
Thank you, Phoebe.
That's very, very generous.

168
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,390
Now, let's decide
who has the nicest ass.

169
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,470
And there you go!

170
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,380
Well, at least let me smoke it
to the good part!

171
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,230
-What's going on?
-What?

172
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,780
Yeah, this has happened before.

173
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,780
-So you know how to fix it?
-Yep. Put more gas in.

174
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,190
Hi. What are you doing here?

175
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,630
I was wondering,
when you and I split up. . .

176
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,790
. . .did you get the tape that was
half the last episode of M.A. S.H...

177
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,110
. . .and half the hostages coming home?

178
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,990
But now it's Susan and me in Mexico
and the hostages coming home.

179
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,430
Where's Ben?

180
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,830
He's sleeping.

181
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,780
Is this a bad time?

182
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,710
Yeah, actually.
Susan's gonna be here any minute.

183
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,500
It's kind of an anniversary.

184
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,510
I thought you guys
got married in January.

185
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,350
A different kind of anniversary.

186
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,630
So anyway--

187
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,700
Candles, champagne. . . .

188
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,380
Yeah, anniversaries are great. . .

189
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,260
. . .because love lasts forever,
you know?

190
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,190
There's nothing like it
in this life. Money in the bank.

191
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,100
So Rachel and I broke up.

192
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,030
God, Ross, I am so sorry!

193
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,430
You know what?

194
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,630
I wanna talk about this so much. . .

195
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,030
. . .but when we can really get into it.

196
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,420
-You free for dinner tomorrow?
-I'd love that.

197
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,540
Me too.

198
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,220
I guess it all started
when Rachel got this new job.

199
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,430
Triple A can pick us up.

200
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,500
What town are we near?

201
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,550
Freemont.

202
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,070
Westmont.

203
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,350
Westberg?

204
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,380
Why are you answering?

205
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,190
Do you know
what route we're on?

206
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,310
We are definitely on Route 27.

207
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,390
We are at a rest stop on Route 27--

208
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,260
There is no Route 27.

209
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,910
-Either 93 or 76.
-I don't know.

210
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,550
I always slept in the back
when we drove here.

211
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,220
Can you just send someone up and down
76 and check every rest stop?

212
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,190
And also 93?

213
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,100
No, they don't do that.

214
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,380
Somebody will come and save us.

215
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,830
Who? Have you seen a car
in the last hour and a half?

216
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,030
We should call Ross.
Maybe he can get a car to get us.

217
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,420
I am not getting in a car with Ross!

218
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,390
We will just have to. . .

219
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,420
. . .Iive here!

220
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,310
-But it's so cold.
-No!

221
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,820
I won't get in a car with him.
Think of something else.

222
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,510
Joey and Chandler are back!

223
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,820
So the "going for help" went well?

224
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,980
Smokey Joe here got halfway
to the highway and collapsed.

225
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,390
I have the lung capacity
of a 2-year-old.

226
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,430
Then why are you smoking?

227
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,950
It's very unsettling.

228
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,790
Right? I mean,
it's pretty unbelievable.

229
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,470
They just took off,
without even looking back.

230
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,500
I don't need them.
I've got you guys now as friends.

231
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,790
You and Susan.

232
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,580
Susan will be so pleased.

233
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,150
Seven-one-seven?

234
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,790
Where's 71 7?

235
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,420
You have more of these
for Susan, right?

236
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,070
No, but that's okay.

237
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,790
I'll just put out pickles
or something.

238
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,630
-Ross, thank God!
-Pheebs?

239
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,270
Why are you whispering?

240
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,620
I ate a bug.

241
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,390
Hey, Rach! The tampons here
are only a penny.

242
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,180
Let's stock up.

243
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,350
We're out of gas and don't know where
we are so we can't get a tow truck.

244
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,140
Now you want a favor?

245
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,150
Yes, please.

246
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,790
I'm sorry your
car broke down, Pheebs. . .

247
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,100
. . .but I'm too busy with some of
my real friends right now.

248
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,990
But please call to let me know
you got home safely.

249
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,980
Phoebe, hang on a second.

250
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,860
Take my car.
Get your friends.

251
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,630
No, I won't pick them up.

252
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,710
We both know you'll do it,
because you're not a jerk.

253
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,790
So you can sulk here for half an hour,
then go get them. . .

254
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,830
-. . .or save time and sulk in the car.
-Rachel doesn't--

255
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,140
I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark. . .

256
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,790
. . .and you're the innocent victim
in this.

257
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,710
But don't punish your friends
for what Rachel did.

258
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,190
Yeah, you're right.

259
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,390
Phoebe, hang on.
Ross wants to say something.

260
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,390
What?

261
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,190
You slept with someone else?

262
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,670
We were on a break!

263
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,060
We were--

264
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,180
Where are you? I'll find you.

265
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,830
You slept with another woman?

266
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,550
Oh, you're one to talk.

267
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,390
Okay, done!

268
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,550
What's "pleh"?

269
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,790
That's "help" spelled backwards. . .

270
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,980
. . .so that the helicopters can read it
from the air.

271
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,380
What's "dufus" spelled backwards?

272
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,900
Car! Car!

273
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,940
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!

274
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,550
What is he doing here?

275
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,580
He is saving your butt.

276
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,870
Unless I'm stepping on
some toes here. . .

277
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,820
. . .in which case
I could just mosey on.

278
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,430
I have plenty of people to help
on the interstate.

279
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,910
-Come on!
-We need your help, please!

280
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,990
Fine! Fine!

281
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,180
Oh, no! Now it's
not gonna make any sense.

282
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,030
You guys. . .

283
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,390
. . .what do we do about Ross?
He drove all the way up here.

284
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,780
Just send him back,
then we'll go skiing?

285
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,790
This is horrible.
It's just horrible.

286
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,460
Should we ask Ross to come along?

287
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,630
But what about Rachel?
How are we gonna even ask her?

288
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,390
Ask me what?

289
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,750
If it might be okay if
Ross came skiing?

290
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,580
No, I wasn't gonna ask that.

291
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,500
You guys are unbelievable.
No, he cannot come!

292
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,790
-Excuse me?
-It's horrible!

293
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:33,030
Oh, please? Can't I come
to your special, magical cabin?

294
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,790
Why would you even want to come?
You're a horrible skier.

295
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,710
Hitting me where it hurts!
My ski skills!

296
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,820
Here we go again.

297
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,590
I can't handle this, you guys.

298
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,910
I can handle it.
"Handle" is my middle name.

299
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,590
Actually, it's the middle part
of my first name.

300
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,220
All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.

301
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,390
Let's go.

302
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,030
You're welcome.

303
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,790
I'm sorry. Were you speaking to me,
or sleeping with someone else?

304
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,270
We were on a break!

305
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,910
Why don't you just put that
on your answering machine?

306
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,790
It's valid, and I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

307
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,140
Monica agrees with me.

308
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,860
What?

309
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,070
I don't know.

310
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,670
You said it last night.

311
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,180
What I said
was that I understood.

312
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,070
Joey is the one who agreed with you.

313
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,900
Really, Joey?

314
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,390
What?

315
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,430
You know what?
There is no right or wrong here.

316
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,020
I think it's very obvious
who's wrong here.

317
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,190
Obviously not to Joey.

318
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,780
What?

319
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,670
-Joey and Monica feel the way I do!
-You and this innocent puppy act!

320
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,580
Hey, guess who I am?

321
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,780
Look what you're doing to Chandler!

322
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,780
Look. We know that this is
really, really hard for you guys.

323
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,660
You don't have to love each other.

324
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,390
You don't even have to like
each other much right now.

325
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,310
But please, find a way
to be around each other.

326
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,030
And not put us in the middle.

327
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,020
Otherwise, I mean, that's just it
for us hanging out together.

328
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,180
Is that what you want?

329
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,590
Can you be civil?

330
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,790
I can.

331
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,790
Good, let's get back in the car.
It's freezing. . .

332
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,750
. . .and my chest is unsupported.

333
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,820
Wait a second!

334
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,750
I mean, what are we doing?
Who's going with who?

335
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,230
Look, you guys should go.

336
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,580
You know,
you planned this all out. . .

337
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,620
. . .and I don't wanna ruin it.
So just go.

338
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,830
You drove all the way up here.

339
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,220
I've got to take
the car back anyway.

340
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,590
I'm spending all day
tomorrow with Ben.

341
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,790
It's fine, okay? Just go.
No guilt, I promise.

342
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,590
Thank you.

343
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,630
We'll call you when we get back.

344
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,340
Maybe we can, like,
go to a movie or something.

345
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,990
Or the rodeo!

346
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,990
That would be great.

347
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,950
I was being Shelley Winters
from The Poseidon Adventure.

348
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:32,910
I know.

349
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,220
Bye!

350
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,990
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

351
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,420
Were you sleeping?

352
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,070
Oh, great.

353
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,340
I had to get you a new battery.
I got the best I could.

354
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,300
You don't want to skimp there.

355
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,580
You're a genius.

356
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,230
It came to about $1 1 2.

357
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,750
But what the hell,
call it an even 1 1 0?

358
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,070
I'll pay you tomorrow. Bye!

359
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,630
So they all took off.

360
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,830
It was pretty hard
watching them go, you know?

361
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,590
Yeah, okay.
Bye.

362
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,620
So I'm gonna take off then.
