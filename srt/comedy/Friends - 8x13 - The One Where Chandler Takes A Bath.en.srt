00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,677
"All right", "it's a new day."
<i>That stuff about Rachel?</i>

2
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:16,517
<i>You don 't feel that now. It was crazy.</i>
<i>You're fine. You're better than fine.</i>

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:21,981
"You are", "as your friend Tony"
"would say", "Great!"

4
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:28,195
<i>Everything's normal.</i>
"She's just your friend", "Rachel."

5
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:34,076
"Your friend", "Rachel."
<i>Your friend. Rachel.</i>

6
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:41,125
- Hi, sweetie.
"- Hey", "it's your girlfriend", "Rachel!"

10
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,213
Are you...? Are you high?

11
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,550
I had the most amazing bath.

12
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,136
- Really? I don't like baths.
- You like them with me.

13
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:39,474
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
It's the wet, naked lady.

14
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:44,230
- Baths are so relaxing.
- Really? What do you do?

15
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,359
You just sit in there,
stewing in your own filth.

16
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,029
How dirty do you think I am?

17
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,867
If you had some candles and bubbles
and music, you'd love it.

18
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,202
It'd take all your stress away.

19
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:05,125
It's 2:00 on Wednesday, I'm watching
"Road Rules." How stressed am I?

20
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:11,215
Hey, Chandler.
I really need to talk to you.

21
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,844
Is this a cold pizza
or a leftover-meat loaf talk?

22
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:20,975
- Well, neither.
- Oh, my God, what's up?

23
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:28,273
I don't know. It's just...
Lately, I've been feeling...

24
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,402
Okay, here's what it is.

25
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:41,203
- I feel a lot better. Thanks.
- Wait a minute. Just come back.

26
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,794
You and Monica,
friends for a long time.

27
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:53,507
And sure, there are rules.
But then you went to London.

28
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:58,303
But that's different. There are rules
there too, know what I mean?

29
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,847
Do you?

30
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:07,563
It was different for you guys.
You were both in the same place.

31
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:12,818
Yes, when Monica and I were
in London, we were both in London.

32
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,655
This is a bad idea.
Forget all about it.

33
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,117
This conversation between you and me.

34
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,869
If that.

35
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,086
Ross, don't forget
that doctor's appointment.

36
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,839
- Right.
- To find out the sex of the baby?

37
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:38,177
We don't wanna know
as long as it's happy and healthy.

38
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,596
Yep, healthy. And cute.

39
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,598
- Smart. With an aptitude for science.
- Popular.

40
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,227
Are you two talking
about the same baby?

41
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,023
- Have you thought of names?
- I've come up with a bunch.

42
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,818
- Really? Me too.
- Me too.

43
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,695
Really?

44
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:01,826
If it's a girl, Phoebe.
And if it's a boy, Pheebo.

45
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:08,707
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt
to have a backup, you know?

46
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,168
Rach, what were you thinking?

47
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,337
I was thinking if it's a girl...

48
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,925
...how about Sandrene? It's French.

49
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:23,931
That's a really pretty name
for an industrial solvent.

50
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,020
- Fine. What do you have?
- It's for a boy.

51
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,107
I know it's a little out there, but...

52
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,568
...Darwin.

53
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,448
Our child will be beaten
in the schoolyard.

54
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,159
Yeah, by Sandrene.

55
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,202
You're saying that
because I said no to you.

56
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,663
I'm really, really not.

57
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,291
How about you each get five vetoes?

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,879
- That sounds fair.
- I don't think you'll need it.

59
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,549
If it's a girl, Rain.

60
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,595
- Veto.
- Why?

61
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,224
Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.

62
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:12,521
I have my own kiln,
and my dress is made out of wheat."

63
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,857
I know her!

64
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:20,029
I bought a homemade soap
from her at a Dead show!

65
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:26,827
- Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
- Why do you hate our child?

66
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,664
- Fine, you go.
- Okay. James.

67
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,626
- But only if it's a girl.
- Veto.

68
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,379
I like Ruth. What about Ruth?

69
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:40,466
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we having an 89-year-old?

70
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,803
- How about Dayton?
- Veto. Stewart.

71
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,639
Veto. Sawyer.

72
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,183
- Veto. Helen.
- Veto.

73
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,812
Is it me, or is Veto starting
to sound really good?

74
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,069
Boy, do I have a surprise for you.

75
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,155
Sex on the balcony?

76
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,409
No. But someone's not gonna
get over that idea.

77
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,828
- What?
- I drew you a bath.

78
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:14,875
I don't like baths. Could you draw me
a picture of sex on the balcony?

79
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,003
Try it for me.
I used all my best stuff.

80
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:23,550
I lit candles, I put on music.
I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.

81
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,014
And got you this little plastic
Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.

82
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:35,396
- This does butch it up a bit.
- I swear, you will love it.

83
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,690
If I do this,
can we discuss balcony sex?

84
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,192
Absolutely.

85
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,905
But I know how
that discussion's gonna go.

86
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:59,503
"All right", "this isn 't so bad."
<i>I like the flowery smell.</i>

87
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:04,091
"Which is okay",
<i>because I've got my boat.</i>

88
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,804
- So?
- Oh, my God.

89
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:15,269
I told you you were a bath person.
Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.

90
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,563
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.

91
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,492
I don't think you had
an open mind about Ruth.

92
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,746
Little Ruthie Geller?
How cute is that?

93
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:39,042
Oh, my God, I can practically
hear the mahjong tiles.

94
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:44,798
All your tests look fine. Are you
interested in the sex of the baby?

95
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:49,053
- No, we're not.
- You have it right there?

96
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:55,017
You know if it's a boy or a girl?
Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?

97
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,602
But if you don't wanna know...

98
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,773
- No, we wanna wait. Right?
- Right. Right.

99
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,528
Oh, I'll be right back.

100
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,488
I know it's really not my place...

101
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,409
...but please don't name
your child Pheebo.

102
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,543
So, which of these babies
is the ugliest?

103
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,712
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.

104
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,798
They're babies.
They're all beautiful.

105
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,053
- Third one from the left?
- Yeah. Why is it staring at me?

106
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:37,518
I think it knows I'm talking about it.
Don't you...? You're looking!

107
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,186
- I didn't!
- I saw you!

108
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,938
Fine, I did,
but I didn't see anything.

109
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,734
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

110
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:50,448
- But I didn't...
- Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!

111
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,117
I couldn't, because I don't know!

112
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:58,038
I swear I didn't see anything!
It was just a momentary lapse.

113
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,500
Don't you have any self-control?

114
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:06,171
Okay. A couple months late
on the lecture, Ross.

115
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,968
Hello?

116
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:15,180
Can you come in here?
There's something wrong.

117
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,475
You know what?
I think I'll wait out here.

118
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,020
I'm in the bathtub.

119
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,652
- What's wrong?
- I drew a bath, but I did it wrong.

120
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:34,533
The water's tepid, the salt didn't
dissolve and is now lodged places.

121
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:40,581
And the scents I used don't compliment
each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile?

122
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,500
- What?
- Bath salts.

123
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,503
They're starting to effervesce.

124
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:52,468
It's different. It's interesting.

125
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,428
Let's talk about something else.

126
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,975
Yeah. Sure. So, what was
going on with you today?

127
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,563
I actually had the weirdest
conversation with Joey.

128
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,317
He was talking about rules
and right and wrong.

129
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,612
- I had the same conversation.
- What was he talking about?

130
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:18,327
He hasn't had this much trouble getting
out words since he was in "Macbeth."

131
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:25,251
- That was a long night.
- What exactly did he say to you?

132
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:30,547
He was talking about rules
and looking at people differently.

133
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,091
- Not to me.
- What'd he tell you?

134
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,386
He asked about you, me and London.

135
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:40,766
And the glue that holds
this all together, the rules.

136
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:44,937
Okay. So you, me and London.

137
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,856
Looking at people differently.

138
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,776
Maybe he wants to do
what you and I did in London.

139
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,237
But what'd he mean by "rules"?

140
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:58,325
Wait. He stopped talking
the minute Phoebe came in.

141
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,580
- He's looking at her differently.
- Phoebe is his friend.

142
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,998
That'd be breaking the rules.

143
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,460
My God, he wants to do it
with Phoebe in London!

144
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,964
- You guys?
- Just a minute!

145
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,510
- That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
- You don't say anything.

146
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,349
Why would I? That two of our friends
could start a great love affair?

147
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:27,187
They'd have me to thank.
Then we could all start having babies!

148
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,690
- I won't let you say anything.
- Stay here.

149
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,068
Oh, God!

150
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,991
I brought back your iron.

151
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,702
I thought I lost it.
I got a new one a month ago.

152
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,331
Oh, just as well. I broke this one.

153
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,755
- What?
- Nothing.

154
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,885
I really shouldn't say.
I'm really not supposed to.

155
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,387
Fine.

156
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:06,477
- It's a humdinger.
- Too bad you can't tell me.

157
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,271
Somebody likes you!

158
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,944
- Is it Chandler?
- No!

159
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:20,366
- Then tell him to stop staring.
- It's Joey.

160
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:25,245
Really? Joey? You don't say.

161
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:30,125
- Would you be interested?
- I don't know, I don't know.

162
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:35,548
You know, I mean, on the one hand,
"Mother, may I?"

163
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,301
But, you know, on the other hand...

164
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,931
No. No, I can't. We're friends.

165
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,850
Oh, no. I don't wanna risk
what we have.

166
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:52,314
I guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?

167
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:57,028
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
I don't want him to get hurt.

168
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:02,032
Well, I must say, I am on fire!
First Chandler, now Joey.

169
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:06,161
- Not Chandler. Just Joey.
- Sure.

170
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,132
You know what?
I'm coming around on the name Ruth.

171
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,094
I'd consider naming our child that.

172
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:27,224
Rach, I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

173
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,522
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

174
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,777
You hated the name Ruth.
Why would you change your mind?

175
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,697
Unless you know we're never
gonna have to use it.

176
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,784
You did see. You know it's a boy!

177
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,287
I didn't see anything.
I changed my mind.

178
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,374
I don't think so.
You're giving me Ruth...

179
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,836
...so you get to name him
when it's a boy.

180
00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:01,967
That's when you'll swoop in and
name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.

181
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,470
I would... Sequoia!

182
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,681
- Veto.
- Fine.

183
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:16,815
Unless you anticipated that
I would figure all this out...

184
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:20,402
...and you know that
it actually is a girl.

185
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:24,115
And you really do want her
to be named Ruth.

186
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:29,995
Well, I'm not falling for that!
Okay? Ruth is off the table!

187
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:35,625
- But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
- Not like this!

188
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,381
Hey. What's up?

189
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:45,760
- Joey, I know.
- What?

190
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:51,350
- I know.
- What?

191
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:56,188
- I know about your feelings.
- Oh, my God, you do?

192
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:01,610
I'm sorry. Things worked out for
Chandler and Monica, but that's rare.

193
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,032
I know. And this is so much more
complicated than it was for them.

194
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,744
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.

195
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,123
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!

196
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:20,254
I know! She's not only my friend,
she's my pregnant friend.

197
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:23,257
She's my pregnant friend
who's Ross' ex!

198
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:28,887
Yeah, that's Rachel.
Beat me over the head with it.

199
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:34,727
What am I gonna do? I keep trying
to get rid of these feelings.

200
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:38,522
I made a list of everything
I don't like about her.

201
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,774
- You wanna hear it?
- Yeah.

202
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:49,324
"She made me switch to light mayo."
That's it! That's all I got!

203
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:53,704
You know what? Tastes the same
and my pants fit better.

204
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,002
- Joey, this is probably just a crush.
- You think?

205
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:04,465
Absolutely. You get this rush
of feelings, but it goes away.

206
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:09,178
Yeah, just a crush.
That's all this is. It's a crush!

207
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,264
I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.

208
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,392
There you go.
Crushes happen all the time.

209
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:20,814
I've had them for all you guys.
Except for Ross and Chandler.

210
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:26,028
- And I'm sure you've had them for us.
- Not really.

211
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,364
Throw me a bone here.

212
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,834
So I called the doctor.

213
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:45,589
- Now we both know the sex of the baby.
- What?

214
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,926
That's right.
The student has become the master.

215
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:56,099
- Ross, I swear. I don't know.
- Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.

216
00:16:56,308 --> 00:17:00,270
- A what?
- You really didn't know?

217
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,107
- We're having a girl?
- No.

218
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,192
- That's what you said.
- No.

219
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:09,529
- You said girl.
- Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

220
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,115
I'm not! We're having a girl!

221
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:17,705
Sometimes I can't believe it's with
you, but still, we're having a girl!

222
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:22,918
I know! You know what?
I'm putting Ruth back on the table.

223
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:27,297
Yes, we'll have ourselves
a little baby Ruth.

224
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:33,387
- Permission to veto.
- Yes, please.

225
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,896
Do I smell essential oils?

226
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:47,109
I'm gonna take a bath.
I was gonna get a magazine.

227
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,669
What do you think you're doing?

228
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,547
Leaving my troubles behind?

229
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:13,802
You're new at this,
but this is unacceptable bath decorum.

230
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,681
It's so hard to care
when you're this relaxed.

231
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,894
You can have the bath,
but I am taking your boat.

232
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:25,147
Now you're just a girl in a tub.

233
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,903
Hi, bubbles. Manly.

234
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,780
I thought I'd let you know
how it went.

235
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:37,659
- You told her?
- She pulled it out of me!

236
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:41,747
She's like a conversational wizard!
How did it go?

237
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,666
You were wrong. He doesn't like me.

238
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:49,880
How would you like it if I told you
that Lee Majors liked you...

239
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,259
...and you found out
that he didn't like you?

240
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:01,559
- I don't think I'd care.
- Really? Lee Majors is hot.

241
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:06,563
- Hello?
- We're in the bathroom!

242
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:11,610
- Why?
- Because it's a relaxing time!

243
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,990
- What are you guys doing in here?
- Oh, my God.

244
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:21,829
A friend he's looking at differently,
but it's wrong.

245
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,456
- It's Rachel!
- You like Rachel?

246
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:29,545
It's no big deal. Phoebe and I talked.
It's a crush. It'll go away.

247
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:33,048
Dude, you gotta rearrange
your bubbles.

248
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,010
Mazel tov.

249
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:42,015
Ross and I were looking for you.

250
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:46,520
What are we all doing in here?
Oh, my.

251
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,483
Honey, cover it up with the boat.

252
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,235
Hello?

253
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:57,364
We're all in here,
and we'd love for you to join us!

254
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:05,331
Well, hey! What's going on?
Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.

255
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,044
- Did you tell them?
- I waited for you.

256
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,796
- Tell us what?
- We're having a girl.

257
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:16,425
Oh, wow! Really?

258
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:22,264
I'll get you later.

259
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:31,690
<i>All right. It's a new day.</i>
<i>And it's just a crush.</i>

260
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,609
<i>That's all. Just a little crush.</i>

261
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,655
<i>All that worrying I was doing?</i>
<i>That was crazy.</i>

262
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:43,536
<i>Like my friend the bird here</i>
"would say", "It was cuckoo!"

263
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:51,460
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.</i>
<i>It's just a crush.</i>

264
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:56,047
- Hi, sweetie.
<i>- I love you.</i>

265
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,225
It's nice to do this together,
isn't it?

266
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,522
Yeah. And what you're doing
feels so good.

267
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,609
- I'm not touching you.
- You're not?

268
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:20,780
- It's the salts.
- Sweet Lord, new realms of pleasure.

269
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,244
Whatever keeps you
off the balcony, big guy.

270
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,502
