00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:07,591
There's this woman that I like a lot.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,010
But it's complicated.

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,597
She was with this other guy
for a long time.

5
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:17,142
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:21,522
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he a good guy?

7
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,399
The best.

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,152
- Then talk to him.
- I don't know.

9
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,697
It's worth finding out,
if you like her.

10
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,574
I do, so much.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,577
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't...

12
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,247
You know what?
You have to go for it.

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:44,294
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

14
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,423
It's Rachel.

15
00:00:56,849 --> 00:01:00,478
I'm sorry, did you just say
it's Rachel?

16
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,605
Yes.

17
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,443
You like Rachel?

18
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,615
Yes. I like Rachel.

19
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,332
Rachel?!

20
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,878
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...

21
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,464
You know who else I like? You.

22
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:32,468
And it doesn't get said enough.
I like you, Ross.

23
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,180
- Rachel Rachel?
- It's not a big deal.

24
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,851
It's not a big deal?
I'm sorry, I just...

25
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,313
What about the stuff you said?

26
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:49,234
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?

27
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,278
I'm an actor, you know?

28
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,407
As a group, we tend to be
overdramatic.

29
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,869
Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

30
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,455
I know it's bad.
And I know it's wrong, okay?

31
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,792
It's not like anything's
ever gonna happen.

32
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,004
These are just feelings.
They'll go away.

33
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,756
You know, I gotta go.

34
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,300
Hey, Ross...

35
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:17,471
You know, I just have one...
Rachel?!

40
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,984
Okay, she's kicking.

41
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,446
She's growing inside you.

42
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:22,452
- That was a big one.
- That's the youngest girl to reject me.

43
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,872
- You guys!
- Hey there.

44
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,375
Let me ask you.
Do you believe in soul mates?

45
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,876
Oh, yes, I do.

46
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,879
There's one person out there
for everyone.

47
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,091
You know how you find him?
Stop looking.

48
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,344
I've stopped looking
for Russell Crowe.

49
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,388
He'll find me.

50
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:42,723
And you?

51
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:48,187
No. I believe that certain people are
more suited for each other, but...

52
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,023
- Soul mates? I don't think they exist.
- Good.

53
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,025
- Why?
- Well, last night, I met Monica's.

54
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,115
What?

55
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,244
I had a date with this guy.
I swear he's her other half.

56
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:09,625
You don't think there's somebody
better suited for Monica than me?

57
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,797
Well, what's he like?

58
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,426
- He's tall. He has brown hair.
- Of course.

59
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:23,097
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!

60
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,350
- He works with food.
- Oh, sure. Older?

61
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,103
- Obviously. And he's British.
- I was just gonna ask!

62
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:34,775
And he's so centered,
and mature and confident.

63
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,444
It's so sad they never met.

64
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:42,199
Luckily, the guy she settled for
can't hear you.

65
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,244
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I'm wrong.

66
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,414
We're going out again.
I'll find out more.

67
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,583
He's meant for her,
and you're gonna date him?

68
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,045
He may not be my soul mate,
but a girl's gotta eat.

69
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,680
I talked to Joey.
I wanted to see you.

70
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,976
I still can't believe it.
Joey and Rachel?

71
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,313
It's like you and me going out,
only weirder.

72
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,399
I know you're hurting...

73
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,610
...but don't say that again.

74
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,533
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.

75
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,868
You don't need to worry.

76
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,580
He'll never tell her how he feels.

77
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,708
If he did, you don't know
how she'd react.

78
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,920
Sure, women never like Joey.
I think he's a virgin.

79
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,926
- He isn't thinking about going for her.
- He's not?

80
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,846
All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.

81
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:50,017
It's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.

82
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,563
- Why?
- He wants to leave the country.

83
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,028
He thinks you hate him.

84
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,780
Hate him?

85
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,951
No, I don't hate him.

86
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,374
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?

87
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,711
I can't even imagine how hard
this must be for you...

88
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,924
...but I don't want you
to lose Joey over it.

89
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:26,553
Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.

90
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,850
Okay, I'll talk to him.

91
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,767
I'd do it soon.

92
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:37,898
He just asked me how to convert
his dollars into Vermont money.

93
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,239
- Hi!
- Hi.

94
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,826
- Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
- Hello.

95
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,831
Soul mate.

96
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,379
- What are you guys doing?
- We had lunch at Adriatica.

97
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,259
- What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?
- I know! Is this 1985?

98
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,179
- That's what I said! Isn't it strange?
- Not really.

99
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,058
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

100
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,771
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?

101
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,439
No?

102
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,487
- What restaurants do you like?
- Octavio. 27-and-7.

103
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:29,033
- There's this place, Alessandro's.
- Oh, my God! I'm the chef!

104
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,077
You're kidding!
Your food is fantastic!

105
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:36,414
I want to talk about your menu.
Anyone want coffee?

106
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,876
If you're talking about me,
I'll go with you.

107
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,297
What are you doing?

108
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,301
I swear, I didn't know you guys
would be here.

109
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,971
You don't believe in soul mates, so...

110
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,142
I believe in handsome strangers
who hit on my wife.

111
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,564
Just because I think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.

112
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,108
Phoebe? Good work.

113
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,986
He's great. I love him.

114
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,616
Don't worry, we'll find you
someone else.

115
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,466
I understand if you came by to hit me.
I deserve it.

116
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,969
No, I don't want to hit you.

117
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,681
What, then? Kick me?

118
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,265
No.

119
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,977
Bite me?

120
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,229
I don't want to do anything to you.

121
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,692
I just want to say I'm not
mad at you...

122
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,446
...and that I certainly
do not hate you.

123
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,284
I just came here to say that.

124
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,828
Hey, wait, Ross?

125
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,957
You wanna come in
for a beer or something?

126
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,171
Yeah, sure.

127
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,594
You got any beer?

128
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,682
All I got is melon stuff
that Rachel left.

129
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,476
Okay.

130
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,278
You need to understand something.

131
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,537
I am never gonna act
on this Rachel thing, okay?

132
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:43,583
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
my friendship with you.

133
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,420
Thank you.

134
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:07,274
Anyway, it'll just...

135
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,861
It'll take me a while to get over her.

136
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:15,240
I'm not sure how to do that.
I've never been in love, so...

137
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,992
What?

138
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,122
You're in love with her?

139
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:27,043
- Yeah. I thought you knew that.
- No.

140
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:33,384
Look, if it helps, I don't want
to feel this way, honest.

141
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:37,971
I just keep thinking,
"I'll get over this," you know?

142
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:42,143
But it just keeps getting harder.

143
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,813
I don't know what to do, you know?

144
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,441
What do I do?

145
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,453
- You need to tell her how you feel.
- That's the green stuff talking.

146
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,959
I'm serious.
You need to find out where she is.

147
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,088
If she's not where you are,
you can start to move on.

148
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,508
But what if,
and I'm not saying she will be...

149
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,053
If she is where you are...

150
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:24,810
...then my feeling weird
shouldn't stand in the way.

151
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,896
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

152
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,025
If she ends up with somebody else...

153
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:36,113
...the truth is,
she couldn't find a better guy.

154
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,698
Hey, thanks.

155
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:45,289
- So when are you gonna talk to her?
- Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

156
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,877
I haven't thought about it.
What should I say?

157
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:53,922
I'm understanding,
but let's not get carried away.

158
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,469
What am I gonna say?

159
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,850
Yeah, tell me about it.

160
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:24,495
I'm phasing out the wine importing
and focusing more on the cheese.

161
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,622
Cheese, you say?

162
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:30,167
That's some
pretty smelly work, huh, Don?

163
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:34,421
- Excuse me?
- Cheese. It's smelly.

164
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,801
You must smell a lot of the time too.

165
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:45,224
Not really. But with cheese,
I think the smellier, the better.

166
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:50,145
Me too! Chandler hates it.
I can't have blue cheese in the house.

167
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,440
And you're still married to him?

168
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:03,325
I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese.

169
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,827
Not even bread. Just cheese.

170
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,955
No, I want the bread.

171
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,582
And pastries.

172
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,918
And pate.

173
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,963
I'm really not high.
I just used to be fat.

174
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,301
I have a villa in the Loire Valley
you can stay in.

175
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,637
Is it made of cheese?

176
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:30,185
No. A house made of cheese,
wouldn't that be great?

177
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:33,230
- I'd move in tomorrow!
- Oh, come on!

178
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,234
- Listen to this!
- I'm so sorry.

179
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,780
- What do we do?
- They both want a house of cheese.

180
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,367
I don't know how you fight that.

181
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:56,128
Okay, okay. I can do this.
I can tell her how I feel.

182
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,714
Okay, stand up straight.

183
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,842
Take a couple deep breaths.

184
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,345
Look confident.

185
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,184
Joey? What's up?

186
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:15,814
I came by because
I want to talk to you about something.

187
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,107
What's up?

188
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,485
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?

189
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,156
I'm late for a meeting.
Could you make it quick?

190
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,993
I just came by to tell you that...

191
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:32,247
...I want to have dinner with you.

192
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,209
Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.

193
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,547
Okay. That's good.

194
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,092
That gives you a couple of hours
to prepare.

195
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,638
Don't you people ever knock?

196
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,975
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.

197
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,644
Sure. Set it up.

198
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:57,105
I'll just be browsing
through the personals.

199
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,609
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

200
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:01,860
Yeah. Fine.

201
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,445
Not perfect.

202
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,573
But good enough.

203
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,657
Jeez, what's with you?

204
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,911
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?

205
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,583
- What's going on?
- Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

206
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,045
I don't believe in that,
but you two get along.

207
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:25,550
I'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.

208
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:30,889
- You don't believe in soul mates?
- No, but I'm sure "tomatoes" does.

209
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,310
I don't believe in soul mates, either.

210
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,812
- You don't?
- Nope.

211
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,648
We weren't destined
to end up together.

212
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,485
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.

213
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,404
Some days we work really hard.

214
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,243
So you don't want to live with Don
in a cheese house?

215
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:57,457
No, I've had second thoughts.
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

216
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,169
- I love you.
- I know.

217
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

218
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:07,551
I found this place that makes
the greatest jalapeno poppers.

219
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,305
No? They taste so good.

220
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:21,106
It happens whenever Chandler
touches my stomach.

221
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,193
I'm worried the baby won't like him.

222
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,491
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure.

223
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,996
Look, the reason...

224
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,083
Is it hot in here?

225
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,545
Why don't you take off your sweater?

226
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,506
This is a nice place...

227
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:51,553
...and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.

228
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:55,557
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

229
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,017
Yeah, sure.

230
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,523
I wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.

231
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,407
How long have we known each other?

232
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,493
Seven, eight...

233
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,329
Eight years. Wow.

234
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,081
A long time.

235
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,418
But over the past few weeks, l...

236
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:28,174
Okay! Sorry about the wait,
but it is mega-jammed in here.

237
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,134
Our specials tonight...

238
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,970
- Could you give us a second?
- Sure.

239
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,513
Second's up!

240
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,353
Not that kind of table.

241
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,192
So you were saying?

242
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,278
I'm not sure.

243
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:54,241
You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.

244
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:58,912
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half...

245
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,666
...and now here we are.

246
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,086
Yeah. Here we are.

247
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,723
I think I'm falling in love with you.

248
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,477
What?

249
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,483
I'm falling in love with you.

250
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:37,826
Who are you talking to?

251
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:42,205
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

252
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,167
Funny. It's funny!

253
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,502
I don't get it.

254
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,430
Okay.

255
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,768
Wow.

256
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,315
Are you...?

257
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,486
How did...?

258
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,822
When?

259
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,661
Does it really matter?

260
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,165
Wow. Wow.

261
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,584
It is hot in here.

262
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,545
I know this is a lot.

263
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:33,048
You don't have to say anything.

264
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:37,511
You take as much time as you need.

265
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,812
Okay, you gotta say something.

266
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:52,276
Joey, I love you so much.

267
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,569
- But...
- But.

268
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,864
Joey?

269
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,742
Right. Hey, that's...

270
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,285
That's okay. That's fine.

271
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:07,416
It's pretty much what I was expecting.

272
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,378
It's no big deal, all right?

273
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:18,343
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Please don't leave like this.

274
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:22,306
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

275
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,808
Don't start doing that.

276
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,603
You can't do that,
because you're gonna make me...

277
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,814
Oh, there we go!

278
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,403
- Can I?
- Sure.

279
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,866
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...

280
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,201
Hey, hey.

281
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,748
You can't, okay? Ever.

282
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,461
I'm so sorry.

283
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,755
Please don't be sorry.

284
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,217
Okay? Don't be sorry.

285
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,436
You know, I was only kidding.

286
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,023
Yeah, that was a real good one.

287
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,578
- Is this your table?
- Yeah.

288
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,289
- You'll be here all night.
- I know.

289
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,125
I haven't even read the specials.

290
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,085
What's the matter?

291
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:38,089
I don't know.
I think maybe one of them is dying.

292
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,428
I kind of hope it's the girl.

293
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:47,516
The guy is really cute!

294
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,273
