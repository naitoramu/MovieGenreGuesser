00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,547
All right, no peeking.

4
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:05,630
No peeking.

5
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,716
No peeking. No peeking!

6
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:13,388
All right, but you better be
wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

7
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,851
All right. Open your eyes!

8
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:25,359
Sweet mother of all
that is good and pure!

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,319
<i>Days of our Lives</i>
picked up my option!

10
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,447
- Congratulations!
- I know!

11
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:35,911
Now we can watch "Green Acres"
the way it was meant to be seen.

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,330
So which one is mine?

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,376
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

14
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,755
Not that one.

15
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,593
Oh, yes!

16
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:56,140
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

17
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,309
Do we dare?

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,021
We dare.

19
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,987
The One Where Ross and Rachel...
You Know

20
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,823
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

21
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,785
I can't believe two cows
made the ultimate sacrifice...

22
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,372
...so you could watch TV
with your feet up.

23
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,375
No, they were chair-shaped cows.

24
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,586
They never would have survived
in the wild.

25
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:13,633
This screen is amazing.
Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.

26
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,471
Rose Marie belongs on
a smaller screen, doesn't she?

27
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,266
Hi, you guys.

28
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,478
Hey, you.

29
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,942
How was your day?

30
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,612
You know, pretty much the usual.

31
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,614
Sun shining, birds chirping.

32
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,990
Really? Mine too.

33
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,828
Hey, cool! Mine too!

34
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,249
I gotta get to the museum.

35
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,752
So I'll see you tonight?

36
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,843
Bye, guys!

37
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,639
Tonight?

38
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,351
- What's tonight?
- Our first official date.

39
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,979
Our first date.

40
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,982
Hello?

41
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,901
Hi.

42
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,988
You're supposed to waitress for me?
My catering thing?

43
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,783
- Any of that trigger anything?
- Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!

44
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,535
This is our first date.

45
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,788
- Yes, but my mom got me this job.
- I can be a waitress!

46
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,166
Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

47
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,462
Really, Pheebs?
You'd have to be an actual waitress.

48
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,715
This can't be like your
"I can be a bear cub" thing.

49
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,468
I can be a waitress.
Okay, watch this.

50
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,970
Give me two number ones,
86 the bacon...

51
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,433
...one Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

52
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,782
It's James Bond!

53
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,744
- Sorry we're late.
- That's okay. Come on in.

54
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,788
Is Monica Geller coming?
I was told she was.

55
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,874
Dr. Burke, it's me.

56
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,459
Monica?

57
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,711
My God! You used to be so...

58
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:17,883
I mean, you've...
You must have lost like...

59
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,427
You look great.

60
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,469
Thank you.

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,889
This is Phoebe.
She'll be helping me.

62
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,142
Nice to meet you.

63
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,774
- So how you been?
- Great. How have you been?

64
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,109
Obviously you know
Barbara and I split up...

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,279
...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

66
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,822
The head tilt?

67
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,366
Since the divorce,
everybody asks how I am...

68
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,829
...with a sympathetic head tilt.
"How you doing? You okay?"

69
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,622
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,083
It's fine.
Believe me, I do it too.

71
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,587
I always answer with the
"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."

72
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:56,630
"You're sure?"

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,757
"Yeah, I'm fine."

74
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,551
I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

75
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,723
Of course, the divorce only left
me with four CDs to change.

76
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,683
That's too bad.

77
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,186
I'll survive.

78
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,859
Two larges, extra cheese on both.

79
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,527
But listen...

80
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,363
...don't ring the buzzer for 19.

81
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,282
Ring 20. Geller/Greene.

82
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,704
They'll let you in, okay?

83
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,458
If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

84
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,629
Okay, thanks.

85
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:41,676
Pizza's on the way.
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

86
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,387
What if we have to pee?

87
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,809
I'll cancel the sodas.

88
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,314
Get back out there.
It's your party!

89
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,901
But they're so dull!
They're all ophthalmologists.

90
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,444
You're an ophthalmologist.

91
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:05,532
Because my parents wanted me to be.
I wanted to be a sheriff.

92
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,286
That's funny.
Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

93
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,456
But you stay out there!

94
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,416
- You see?
- I tell you what.

95
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:20,797
I'll come get you in five minutes
with some sort of kebob emergency.

96
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,007
Better.

97
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,259
Oh, God, here we go.

98
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,554
Hey, want to see them go nuts?

99
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,930
Watch this.

100
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,351
Who needs glasses?

101
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,983
You are so smitten.

102
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,610
I am not!

103
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,739
Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

104
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,325
- You should ask him out.
- Dr. Burke?

105
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,121
I don't think so.
I mean, like, he's a grownup.

106
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,792
So? You two are
totally into each other.

107
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,504
He's a friend of my parents.
He's like 20 years older than me.

108
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,465
So you're never gonna see him again?

109
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,634
Not never.

110
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,679
I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

111
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,559
- Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
- Yeah, but you know...

112
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,769
...27 is...

113
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,606
...a dangerous eye age.

114
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:27,281
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm just saying it was a little...

115
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,116
...hard to follow.

116
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,285
I told you there'd be subtitles.

117
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,079
I know.

118
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:39,251
I just didn't want to wear
my glasses on our first date.

119
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,510
Monica?

120
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:55,267
It would help when I'm kissing
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

121
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,978
Honey, I'm just checking.

122
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,189
- Monica?
- Mon?

123
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,222
What?

124
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,640
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,935
It's just, when you moved
your hands down to my butt...

126
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:42,648
...it was, like, "Whoa!
Ross' hands are on my butt!"

127
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,776
And that's funny. Why?

128
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,654
Well, it's not.

129
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,115
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just nervous.

130
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,325
I mean, it's you.

131
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,118
You know, it's us.

132
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:59,039
We're crossing that line.
It's sort of a big thing.

133
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:05,170
Well, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

134
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:18,017
Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

135
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,685
I know, I know, I know!

136
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:23,063
I was thinking about when
they were there the last time.

137
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,816
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, look! I promise.

138
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,069
I won't laugh anymore.
Put your hands back there.

139
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,739
No, see, now I can't.

140
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,744
- I feel self-conscious.
- Just one cheek.

141
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:37,744
The moment's gone.

142
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:41,165
- I'll back up into your hands.
- That's romantic.

143
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,249
<i>- Touch it.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

144
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,334
<i>- Oh, come on, squeeze it.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

145
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,503
<i>Rub it?</i>

146
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:50,006
<i>Oh, come on!</i>
<i>Would you just grab my ass?</i>

147
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,975
Wow! Look at that!
The car is on fire...

148
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,270
...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

149
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,358
...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

150
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:12,738
You've got a Cheeto
on your face, man.

151
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,167
Aren't you supposed
to be out with Rachel?

152
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,670
That was 14 hours ago.

153
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,798
So how'd it go?

154
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:35,636
Have you ever been, you know,
fooling around with a girl...

155
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,223
...and she started laughing?

156
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,433
But it was 1982...

157
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:46,938
...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut
was tickling her chin.

158
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,275
She laughed at you?

159
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,487
I've been wanting this
since ninth grade typing.

160
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,907
And I just want it to be perfect...

161
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,035
...and right and...

162
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,497
Why isn't that laser beam
cutting through the paint?

163
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,000
- It's the Miracle Wax!
- It certainly is a miracle.

164
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,545
Hi, you guys.

165
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,340
Listen, I was thinking about...

166
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,966
Can you guys speak up?

167
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:19,888
It's harder for us to hear you
when you lower your voice.

168
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:25,853
I'm sorry about last night.
I really want to make it up to you.

169
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,355
There's no need to make it up...

170
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,149
How?

171
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:35,278
Well, I was thinking
maybe a romantic dinner...

172
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,324
...with candles and wine.

173
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:43,996
And then maybe going
back to my place...

174
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,124
...for dessert.

175
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,792
That sounds...

176
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,795
...perfect?

177
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,428
What's this?

178
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:03,473
Would you get us a couple of beers?

179
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,855
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

180
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,982
Really?

181
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,735
That's my job.

182
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:15,819
All right.

183
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,446
Look up.

184
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,656
Look down.

185
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,743
Now, open your eyes and look down.

186
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,161
That's right.

187
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,122
Look into the light.

188
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,584
Now look at me.

189
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,431
Your eyes look good.
Those are good eyes.

190
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,099
Good. They feel good.

191
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,936
In my head.

192
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:56,360
- It was great to see you.
- You too.

193
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,987
You too.

194
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,035
Goodbye.

195
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,955
Drops!

196
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,291
Here, they're free.

197
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,295
Thanks.

198
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,006
I better be going.

199
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,924
Yeah, I'll see you later.

200
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,094
Thanks again.

201
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:39,028
We have to get you lazy boys
out of these chairs.

202
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:45,492
You should go outside and be with
the three-dimensional people.

203
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:49,287
No. Inside good.

204
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,374
Outside bad.

205
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,751
You guys are so pathetic.

206
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,005
Oh, "Xanadu"!

207
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:04,219
She's one of us now.

208
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,808
We just wanted to stop by
and say good night.

209
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,185
Good night.

210
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,313
They won't even turn their heads.

211
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:19,026
All right, you guys.
I'm taking off my shirt.

212
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,700
She's lying.

213
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:32,373
Stop sending food to our apartment!

214
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,665
Why are you dressed up?

215
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,751
You're not the only one
with a date.

216
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,378
- What? You have a date? Who with?
- No one.

217
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,297
Come on, what's his name?

218
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,923
Nothing.

219
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,926
Come on, tell me.

220
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,012
All right, but I'm very excited
about this, okay?

221
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,265
So promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmental.

222
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:51,851
I promise. What?

223
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,519
- It's Richard Burke.
- Who's Richard Burke?

224
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,064
Dr. Burke?

225
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,484
You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

226
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,153
...should that bother me?

227
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,196
I love that man.
He's like a...

228
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,283
...a brother to Dad.

229
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:13,456
He is the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

230
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,873
Dr. Burke is sexy?

231
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:19,336
Oh, God! Absolutely!

232
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:20,921
Damn!

233
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,800
It's the museum again.
Can I...?

234
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,136
- Dr. Burke kissed me once.
- When?

235
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:31,515
When I was 7, I crashed my bike
right out in front of his house...

236
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,477
...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

237
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,730
- Oh, you are so lucky!
- I know.

238
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:44,320
Australopithecus isn't supposed
to be in that display.

239
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:49,032
No, Homo habilis was erect.
Australopithecus was never fully erect.

240
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,870
Well, maybe he was nervous.

241
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,961
Oh, look!
I can't believe this!

242
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:05,340
Homo habilis can't use tools yet,
and they've got him with clay pots?

243
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:09,178
Why don't they just
give him a microwave?

244
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,555
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

245
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,808
It's longer than I expected.
We will have dinner.

246
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:15,976
That's okay.

247
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,229
Karl!

248
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,108
Oh, God.

249
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,997
- Wow! Is that Michelle?
- Yep.

250
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,833
I've not seen her since
high-school graduation.

251
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:44,588
Oh, my God, that night
she got so dru...

252
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,799
Emotional.

253
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,468
You know, she's having another baby.

254
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:53,680
- I thought she just had one.
- No, no. Henry's almost 2.

255
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,893
And he's talking
and everything. Here.

256
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,980
The other day he told me he liked me
better than his other grandpa.

257
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:07,111
In all fairness, his other
grandpa's a drunk, but still...

258
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,698
You're a grandpa.

259
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,667
Are we nuts here?

260
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,711
I don't know. Maybe.

261
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:28,966
I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pool I once peed in.

262
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,177
I didn't need to know that.

263
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,013
I guess 21 years is a lot.

264
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:41,520
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person
who can drink older than you.

265
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:54,450
So maybe we should just...

266
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,329
Maybe...

267
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,625
Wow.

268
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,170
This really sucks.

269
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,299
Yeah, it sure does.

270
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,610
We don't really have to decide
anything right now, do we?

271
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,364
No, there's no rush or anything.

272
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:38,661
- Pizza delivery!
- Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

273
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,707
I'm done.

274
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,085
Yeah, well, you know what?
So is Sorentino's.

275
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:50,589
I'm sorry.
Why don't we find someplace else?

276
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,259
It's late. Everything will be closed.
We'll do it another night.

277
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,886
No, no, we won't.

278
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,929
We won't?

279
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,807
Come on.

280
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:03,519
Okay, that's dead, right?

281
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,896
What are we doing?

282
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:11,193
- Do you want Cranapple or Cran-Grape?
- Grape.

283
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,446
Okay, now...

284
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,406
...sit.

285
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,621
Oh, my God!

286
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:27,876
<i>Billions of years ago,</i>
<i>Earth was only...</i>

287
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,879
Sorry.

288
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,719
So what are we looking at?

289
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:41,265
Well, you see that little cluster
of stars next to the big one?

290
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,309
That is Ursa Major.

291
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,148
- Really?
- No idea. It could be.

292
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,444
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

293
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,571
Oh, that's okay.

294
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:58,490
You were worth the wait.

295
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,494
And I don't just mean tonight.

296
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,671
You're not laughing.

297
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:16,675
This time it's not so funny.

298
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,668
Oh, God!

299
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,002
Honey?

300
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,546
That's okay.

301
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,548
What?

302
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,344
Oh, no. You just rolled
over the juice bo x.

303
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:11,396
Thank God!

304
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:42,594
Hey, you.

305
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,436
I can't believe I'm waking up
next to you.

306
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:54,398
I know. It is pretty unbel...

307
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,860
We're not alone.

308
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:27,848
Is that the fire alarm?

309
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:35,105
It's not warm yet.
We still have time.

310
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:39,359
- Cool.
<i>- Yeah, yeah. Cool!</i>
