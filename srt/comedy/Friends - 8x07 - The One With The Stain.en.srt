1
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:12,555
Oh, my God, you cleaned!
Look at these floors!

2
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:16,641
You did the windows!
I have been begging for months!

3
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:21,939
- And nagging works!
- No, I didn't actually do this.

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,901
Oh, no. Was I cleaning
in my sleep again?

5
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,611
No, it wasn't you.

6
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,531
- Well, then, who?
- I got a maid. Yay!

7
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:37,662
I hope you mean "mistress," because
if some other woman was cleaning...

8
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,416
I know you don't like
to relinquish control.

9
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,087
"Relinquish" is just a fancy word
for "lose."

10
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:51,760
She's nice, and she mentioned that she
adored how you arranged the sponges.

11
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,095
Did she really say that?

12
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:58,016
Yes, I distinctly remember.
I thought it was a joke.

13
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:02,396
- Now, just give her a chance, okay?
- Fine, I can do it.

14
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:09,278
- What's the matter?
- Usually when I'm anxious, I clean.

15
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,322

18
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:55,616
Whose cell phone is that?
It's so annoying.

19
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,702
I think it's coming from your bag.

20
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,498
I never get calls!

21
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,376
Hello?

22
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:11,757
Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween
party. Ursula's fiance.

23
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,552
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
How'd you get this number?

24
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,973
I have a friend who's a cop,
and he got it.

25
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:24,269
Wow. What an incredible violation
and wonderful surprise!

26
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,564
You should know
I broke up with Ursula.

27
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,526
Oh, you did?
He did it, he did it!

28
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:34,154
- What did he do?
- Shh! I'm talking!

29
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:41,369
Anyway, I was wondering if you were
the sort of person who eats lunch?

30
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,164
Are you asking me out?

31
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:48,877
Because it'd be weird since you
just broke up with my sister.

32
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:53,799
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. Bye.

33
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,928
Wait! I said that so you'd think
I was a good person!

34
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,056
Fight for me!

35
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:05,019
I won't take "no" for an answer.

36
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,771
Not great, we can work on it.

37
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,275
<i>I can be at your apartment</i>
<i>in two hours.</i>

38
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,902
How do you know where I live?

39
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,697
I've got friends too.

40
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,156
Okay, bye.

41
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,451
Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!

42
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,331
This day is gonna be much better
than I thought it was gonna be.

43
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,418
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.

44
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,965
So apparently I'm available
for lunch.

45
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,802
I can't. I'm apartment hunting.

46
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,512
You're moving?

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,765
I can't live with Joey
once the baby comes.

48
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:47,728
I don't want my child's first words
to be, "How you doin'?"

49
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,606
Does Joey know you're moving?

50
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,734
We haven't discussed it,
but he'll be relieved.

51
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,864
He brought this girl over,
and I talked about morning sickness.

52
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,450
I showed her my pregnancy book.

53
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,287
- That's not really porn?
- Not so much.

54
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:11,626
I heard in the elevator this morning
that a woman in my building died.

55
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:17,799
Oh, my God. Was she old?
Does she have a view?

56
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,596
How great would that be?
You living in my building?

57
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,850
I could take care of the baby,
come over whenever I want...

58
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,602
...with your permission.

59
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,814
That really would be great.
Well, can we see it?

60
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,610
Maybe we shouldn't.
If she just died this morning.

61
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,155
Yeah. No. No, you're right.

62
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,370
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

63
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,463
Yes?

64
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,674
Hi. I'm Ross Geller.
I live in the building.

65
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:03,470
And I'm Rachel,
an admirer of the building.

66
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:09,935
I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing
away, and I am so sorry for your loss.

67
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,395
- She didn't pass away.
- What?

68
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:17,234
- My mother's still alive.
- Oh, thank God!

69
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:23,907
It looked like we were gonna lose her
this morning, but she's tough.

70
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,784
Are you close with her?

71
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:30,580
Of course. She and I would
talk all the time...

72
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,001
...in the laundry room.

73
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,837
You speak Dutch?

74
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:47,056
I would, but it's just too painful.

75
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,018
So she's really not dead.

76
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,563
No. She's hanging in there.

77
00:05:54,771 --> 00:06:00,694
Could you tell me, is she hanging in
in a one-bedroom or a two?

78
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,326
This tile cleaner is incredible.
Where did you get it?

79
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,705
Oh, well...
I make it myself.

80
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:17,128
It's two parts ammonia and one part
lemon juice. The secret ingredient...

81
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,422
You know what? We just met.

82
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:24,635
Okay. I'm gonna get the clothes
from the laundry room...

83
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,429
...then I'll clean behind the fridge.

84
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,306
I love her!

85
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,560
I'll be back in a minute.

86
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,354
Okay.

87
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:41,068
- See? I told you.
- She stole my jeans!

88
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,404
What?

89
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,741
I've been looking
for them all week!

90
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,538
So she stole your pants,
and then came back and wore them?

91
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,708
Don't you see?
It's the perfect crime!

92
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,004
She must have been
planning this for years!

93
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,505
I'll prove it.

94
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:06,843
I dropped a pen in my lap, and it left
an ink stain on the crotch.

95
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:11,723
When she comes back, I will find it
and show you that stain!

96
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:19,648
Is it possible the company that sold
the jeans made more than one pair?

97
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,067
I guess.

98
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:27,364
Shouldn't we give her the benefit of
the doubt before we search her crotch?

99
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:32,203
Fine. I'm glad I didn't give
her my secret ingredient.

100
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,206
By the way,
what is your secret ingredient?

101
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,716
- Hi.
- Come in. I'm so glad you're here.

102
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:46,967
Yeah. Me too.

103
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:50,554
Not in the shaky, angry way
you are, though.

104
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:55,017
Sorry. I just saw Ursula.
I got the engagement ring back.

105
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,520
Just seeing her brought it all back.

106
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,107
All the lies, the way she used me.

107
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:06,611
I just... I get so angry,
just looking at her...

108
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:14,495
- Face.
- Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:19,917
I'm sorry. It's just,
when I look at you...

110
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,211
...I see her.

111
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:28,050
And when I see her,
I get a little bit angry.

112
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,596
- Maybe this is too weird.
- Wait.

113
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:37,434
There's only a problem
when I look at you.

114
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,562
I got it. I got it.

115
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,857
No, don't tear out your eyes!

116
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:48,737
- I was just gonna take out my lenses.
- Oh, yeah. Try that.

117
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,491
So, is that better?

118
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,785
Not really.

119
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:03,502
You're blurry, but you still
look like Ursula. You're "Blursula."

120
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:09,342
Okay, wait. Maybe...

121
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,928
If I just don't look at you
for a while.

122
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:21,645
See? It works. I'm not angry at
all anymore. This is a great date!

123
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,399
Look, Eric, turn around.

124
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,363
I like you, but it shouldn't be
this hard. It's our first date.

125
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,991
It's supposed to be
about excitement and...

126
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,747
..."He touched my hand,
did he mean to?" and first kisses...

127
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,210
Second kisses...

128
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,466
Thanks for the coffee, or:

129
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,396
Yeah, we're done.

130
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:16,283
Hey, Ross. You wanna go see
that new IMAX movie on tide pools?

131
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,576
- Really?
- No.

132
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,373
But I got Knicks tickets for us.

133
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,085
- Sweet!
- All right, let's go.

134
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,212
I have to stop by my place.

135
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,800
To tape the game? You do this every
time. You're not gonna be on TV!

136
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,929
I have to see if this apartment
is available.

137
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,557
- You're switching apartments?
- It's for Rachel.

138
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:43,852
- She has an apartment.
- She's gonna move.

139
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,063
- She is?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,775
You didn't expect her
to live there with the baby?

141
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,611
I didn't really think about it.

142
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:01,203
Hey, Gunther, you're an "ezel"!

143
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,750
Damn it!

144
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,131
- Nice jeans.
- Oh, thanks.

145
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,803
- I like your top.
- Oh. You're not getting it.

146
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:29,273
- What happened?
- Oh. I fell asleep!

147
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,985
I was thinking about taking
my lunch break.

148
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:38,073
Will you do the top of the cabinets?
That'll work up your appetite.

149
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,116
All right.

150
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,142
Hello.

151
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,310
What's going on?

152
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,441
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid
before. Is this not okay?

153
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:25,328
- How was the game?
- It was okay. I ate way too much.

154
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,169
Ross said you were looking
for a new place.

155
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:37,966
Yeah. Hopefully across the street.
If certain Dutch people would let go.

156
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,471
I was kind of hoping you'd stay.

157
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:46,433
Joey, I have to go.
There's no room for a baby.

158
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:51,229
No room? It's a baby.
It's, like, this big.

159
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,484
You could put it over here.

160
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,820
Or we could put it right here.
Cute, right?

161
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:02,491
Or over here.
You wouldn't even notice it.

162
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,036
"Where's the baby?"
"Oh, it's right over..."

163
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,540
Honey, it's not just a matter
of where you put it.

164
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,169
A baby changes things.
They cry all the time.

165
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:19,174
Imagine bringing home a girl,
trying to score with a screaming baby.

166
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,928
I could use a challenge.
It's getting pretty easy.

167
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,890
It's so sweet that you want me
to stay, but I can't.

168
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:30,227
It would disrupt your entire life.

169
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:35,857
It's just...
I love living with you so much.

170
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:40,195
- I wish things didn't have to change.
- I know.

171
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:43,365
You know, I blame Ross for this.

172
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,910
I do too, a little bit.

173
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,497
I'm gonna miss you.

174
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,333
You're the hottest roommate
I ever had.

175
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:03,051
Oh, no, I have to go.
I have a massage appointment.

176
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,181
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
I'll pay you.

177
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,684
No, I've gotten in trouble
for that before.

178
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:14,438
- See you later?
- Absolutely.

179
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,900
I love the way you kiss.

180
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:22,779
Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!
You'll see.

181
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,624
- Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise.
- How come?

182
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,626
Because I put my head
between her legs.

183
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,755
- To see her pants?
- They're my pants!

184
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,840
Did you see the stain?

185
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:46,262
No. I was getting into position,
and everything went dark.

186
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:50,349
She is not stealing from us.
Will you let this go?

187
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,392
Fine.

188
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,234
- She's wearing my bra!
- Oh, dear God!

189
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,196
My pink flowered bra!
I recognize the strap!

190
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,657
Yet you don't recognize
that you're crazy?

191
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:11,495
I'm leaving, and you're gonna look
at Brenda's bra.

192
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,497
Here's another plan. No.

193
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,959
I would, but she thinks
I'm attracted to her.

194
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,797
- Why?
- Did you not hear where my head was?

195
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,426
We're a team.
We're in this together.

196
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:29,513
I fear a jury will see it
the same way.

197
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:34,059
I catch you looking
at women's breasts all the time.

198
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,437
You see that?

199
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,189
Do you see this?

200
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,110
All right.
Okay. I get your point.

201
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,154
If it's not her bra,
will you let her clean?

202
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:52,786
Yes. You'll know it's mine because on
the right, there's a noticeable rip.

203
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,832
You need new clothes.

204
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:04,631
- Hi. How is she?
- It's not looking good.

205
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:13,265
Well, I brought her some "bloemen."

206
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:19,145
Would you like to say goodbye?
I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.

207
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,691
Oh, I don't know that it would.

208
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,488
- Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
- All right, then.

209
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,540
- Hey!
- Welcome back.

210
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:44,671
- Shall we continue?
- I'm still tired from this afternoon.

211
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,132
- Why?
- The sex.

212
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,218
- What sex?
- Our sex.

213
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,761
We didn't have sex.

214
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:55,640
If it wasn't with you, I had sex
with somebody that looked like...

215
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:06,276
- You had sex with Ursula?
- A little bit.

216
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,530
I thought she was you
and I kissed her and...

217
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:15,035
- You didn't notice different clothes?
- I was just so excited to see you.

218
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,667
- This is too weird.
- I don't wanna lose you.

219
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,838
It's like I was saying to Ursula
when I was making love...

220
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,216
Yeah. It's too weird.

221
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,345
So I guess this is it.

222
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,598
Yeah.

223
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:39,018
Maybe it's for the best.

224
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:43,063
- You smell just like her.
- Yeah, so do you.

225
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:06,086
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaning.

226
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,839
This is where I lean.

227
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,467
Okay.

228
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,347
- Brenda, a bee!
- What?

229
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:22,186
It flew into your blouse! Better
undo your buttons lest it sting you.

230
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:27,733
- I think I know what's going on here.
- You do?

231
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,987
Look, I know it must be hard
that your wife is a lesbian...

232
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,575
...but it's wrong. You're married.

233
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,036
- I totally understand.
- Okay, good.

234
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,956
Could I just see your bra?

235
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,799
- Where'd you get those jeans?
- You gave them to me.

236
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,803
- No, I didn't!
- All right, I took them.

237
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,724
I figured it was okay,
you've got an ink stain on it.

238
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:04,728
- Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
- What bra?

239
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:09,733
- The pink one with the flowers.
- You mean the one you're wearing?

240
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,030
I quit!

241
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,200
Sounds about right.

242
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:26,459
What is this?

243
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,211
This is just to give you an idea.

244
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:36,134
We can put screens so the baby has
privacy, and a mobile over the crib...

245
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:42,266
...and here's a baby monitor which,
for now, we can use as walkie-talkies.

246
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,520
You're so sweet!

247
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,441
Oh, my God!
And you gave the baby Hugsy!

248
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,242
That's really just to show
where the baby would go.

249
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,037
Why don't I hold on to him
so there's no confusion?

250
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:11,336
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.
It's gonna be loud.

251
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,131
- I'm loud.
- It'll be up all night.

252
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,591
- I'm up all night.
- It'll poop.

253
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,177
Hello!

254
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,306
What about all the women?

255
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:26,268
If I'm bringing home a woman
who can't stand a baby...

256
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,646
...then maybe I don't wanna
be with that woman.

257
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:33,567
Or maybe we'll do it
in the bathroom of the club!

258
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,861
Joey, are you sure?

259
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,906
Yeah. Look, I know sometimes
it'll be hard, okay...

260
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:45,537
...but it'll also be really,
really great.

261
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:50,041
Please, Rachel,
I really want you to stay.

262
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:55,881
I want me to stay too. Thank you.

263
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:02,638
- Look at this crib! It's so cute!
- I know. I found it on the street.

264
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:06,933
Are you...? Really?
This is in such good condition.

265
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,436
Whoa! What's under the cover?

266
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:12,022
- I don't know.
- It's moving.

267
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:14,483
It's got a tail! Get it out!

268
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,318
Okay!

269
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,663
Well, the old lady died.
And how do I know?

270
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,958
Because her dying wish
was for one last kiss.

271
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:37,339
But I don't care because
you got the apartment. Yes!

272
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:43,596
Yeah. I think I'm gonna stay here.

273
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,848
Isn't that great?

274
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,443
