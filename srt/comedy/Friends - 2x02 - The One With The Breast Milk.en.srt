00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,178
These were expensive
and he'll grow out of them...

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,724
...in 20 minutes,
but I couldn't resist!

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,103
Look at these.

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,313
Hey, Ben.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,733
"Just do it"!

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,610
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,447
Was that too much
pressure for him?

10
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:34,701
- Is he hungry already?
- I guess so.

11
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,122
You know, it's...

12
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,627
Something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.

13
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,130
I gotta get one too.

14
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,134
Hey, what are you guys doing?

15
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,262
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.

16
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,888
Ladle?

17
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,306
Will you guys grow up?

18
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,310
This is the most beautiful
thing in the world.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,106
Yeah, we know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.

20
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:10,070
This is my son having lunch, okay?
It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,740
If you're uncomfortable,
just ask questions.

22
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,161
Carol's fine with it.

23
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,039
Carol?

24
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:27,630
I'm wondering, could Joey ask you
a question about breast-feeding?

25
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,050
Sure.

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,511
Does it hurt?

27
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,430
It did at first, but not anymore.

28
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,225
Chandler?

29
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,979
So, how often can you do it?

30
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,189
As much as he needs.

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,444
Okay, I got one, I got one.

32
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,948
If he blows into one,
does the other one get bigger?

33
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,327
The One With the Breast Milk

00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,127
- Any muffins left?
- Yeah, I forget which ones.

36
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,254
You're busy, I'll get it.

37
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,132
- Anyone else want one?
- No, thanks.

38
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,635
You're losing your apron.
Let me get it.

39
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,305
- There you go.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,893
What a bitch!

41
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,813
I have a friend at
Bloomingdale's who's quitting...

42
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,275
...and he wants to abuse his discount.

43
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,819
Anyone want to come
take advantage of it?

44
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,198
I have to take
my grandmother to the vet.

45
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,663
- I'll go with you.
- Great.

46
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,667
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, sweetums.

47
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,671
And hello to the rest.

48
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:38,177
You can't go shopping with her.
What about Rachel?

49
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,678
Will it be a problem?

50
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,972
You're going to
Bloomingdale's with Julie.

51
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,977
It's like cheating on Rachel
in her house of worship.

52
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,397
Monica, she will kill you.

53
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,735
She will kill you
like a dog in the street!

54
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,783
So Jules tells me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.

55
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,620
It's actually not that big a deal.

56
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,955
It's a big deal to me.
This is great.

57
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,208
I really appreciate this.

58
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,461
You're welcome.

59
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,185
Bijan for men?

60
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,271
Bijan for men?

61
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,108
- Hey, Annabel.
- Hey, Joey.

62
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,486
Did you hear about the new guy?

63
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:43,659
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girls call him "The Hombre Man".

64
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,545
Hombre?

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,134
What's he doing in my section?

66
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,094
I guess he doesn't know.

67
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,763
Well, he's gonna.

68
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,600
I'll see you a little later, okay?

69
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,188
Hey, how you doing?

70
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,939
Mornin'.

71
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,109
Listen, I know you're new...

72
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,611
...but it's understood
that everything...

73
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:24,825
...from young men's to
the escalator is my territory.

74
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,162
"Your territory"?

75
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,039
- Bijan for men?
- No, thanks.

76
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,707
Hombre?

77
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:35,711
Yeah, all right.

78
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,552
You were saying?

79
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:50,643
Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping all day.

80
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,520
We shopped and we had lunch.

81
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,437
What did I have?

82
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,901
- You had a salad.
- No wonder I don't feel full.

83
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,277
Hi. What's up?

84
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,990
I went shopping with Monica
and I had a salad.

85
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:09,495
Good, Pheebs.
What'd you buy?

86
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,163
We went shopping for...

87
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,624
For...

88
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,211
For fur.

89
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,673
You went shopping for fur?

90
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,678
And then I realized
that I'm against that.

91
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:29,348
So then we bought some...

92
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,226
Boobs.

93
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,024
You bought boobs?

94
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,945
Bras!

95
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,030
We bought bras!

96
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,034
We bought bras.

97
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,162
Bijan for men?

98
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,080
Bijan for men?

99
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,251
Bijan for...

100
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,877
Hey, Annabel.

101
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:03,423
I was wondering if after work
we could grab a cup of coffee?

102
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:07,178
Actually, I sort of have plans.

103
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,642
You ready, Annabel?

104
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,895
You bet.

105
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,898
Maybe some other time.

106
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:33,161
It's not the first time I lost a girl
to a cowboy spraying cologne.

107
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,122
Bijan for men?

108
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,542
Bijan for men!

109
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,377
And this is Funny Clown.

110
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,089
It's only for after his naps,
not before, or he won't sleep.

111
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,759
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.

112
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,806
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.

113
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,185
Honey, relax.
Ross is great with him.

114
00:07:56,435 --> 00:08:01,857
Don't look so surprised.
I'm a lovely person.

115
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,109
This is so cute!

116
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,986
I got that for him!

117
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,322
"My Mommies Love Me."

118
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,786
That's clever.

119
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,707
Oh, hi, Jul...

120
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,960
Hi, Jew!

121
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,756
Okay, sure.

122
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,885
That'd be great.
See you then. Bye.

123
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,805
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?

124
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,769
Yes, I did.

125
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,689
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

126
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,696
Yeah, he likes it.
Reaffirms his faith.

127
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,495
Ben, dinner!

128
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,163
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

129
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,875
Did you microwave that?
You can't do that to breast milk.

130
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,504
I think I know
how to heat breast milk.

131
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,842
What did you just do?

132
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,803
I licked my arm, what?

133
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,264
It's breast milk!

134
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,765
So?

135
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:21,728
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.

136
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,524
What is the big deal?

137
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,403
What did you just do?

138
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:34,867
Can people stop
drinking the breast milk?

139
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,786
You won't even taste it?

140
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,372
Not even if you just
pretend it's milk?

141
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:46,211
Not even if Carol's breast had
a picture of a missing child on it.

142
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:56,138
- Where is everybody?
- At the park. Where have you been?

143
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,347
Just out.

144
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:02,937
Had some lunch. Just me.
A little quality time with me.

145
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,481
- Thanks for your jacket.
- No problem.

146
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,984
You can borrow it, by the way.

147
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,654
Here are your keys, honey.

148
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:20,453
If you were at lunch alone,
how come it cost you $53?

149
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,500
You know what probably happened?

150
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,003
Someone stole my credit card.

151
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:32,258
And put the receipt
back in your pocket?

152
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,469
That is an excellent,
excellent question.

153
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,222
That is excellent.

154
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,350
What's with you?
Who did you have lunch with?

155
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,851
- Judy.
- Who?

156
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,102
- Julie.
- What?

157
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,273
Jody.

158
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,858
You were with Julie?

159
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,695
When it started, I was just
trying to be nice to her...

160
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,699
...because she was
my brother's girlfriend.

161
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:00,578
And then one thing
led to another...

162
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,496
...and before I knew it, we were...

163
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,833
...shopping.

164
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,631
Oh, my God!

165
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,677
Wait, we only did it once.

166
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,472
It meant nothing to me!

167
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,895
Really, I was thinking
of you the whole time.

168
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:32,484
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I never meant for you to find out.

169
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:36,655
Oh, please! Please!
You wanted to get caught!

170
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,115
That is not true!

171
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,618
So you just happened
to leave it in here?

172
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:47,083
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?

173
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:51,336
Okay, I just have to know one thing.

174
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,176
Did you go to Bloomingdale's?

175
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:15,235
Okay, I just really need
to not be with you right now.

176
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,037
Hi, who's this?

177
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:29,166
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica.

178
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,919
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

179
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:36,006
Joanne, it's not
as simple as all that.

180
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:41,720
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.

181
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,725
How did we do?

182
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,145
I tasted Ben's milk
and Ross freaked out.

183
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,605
I did not freak out.

184
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,901
- Why'd you freak out?
- Because it's breast milk.

185
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,778
It's gross!

186
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,031
My breast milk is gross?

187
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:04,869
This should be fun.

188
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,079
There's nothing wrong with it.

189
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,999
I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.

190
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,046
Of course, the packaging does
appeal to grownups and kids.

191
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,675
Don't be silly. I've tried it.
It's no big deal.

192
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,386
Just taste it.

193
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,097
That would be no.

194
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,306
- Come on.
- Try it.

195
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,475
It's natural.

196
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,059
It doesn't taste bad.

197
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,145
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of like...

198
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,188
Like what?

199
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,439
Cantaloupe juice.

200
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,610
Exactly.

201
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:45,242
You've tasted it.

202
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,495
You've tasted it.

203
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:52,625
Oh, you've tasted it.

204
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,713
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.

205
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,014
Give me the bottle.

206
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,313
Get me the towel.

207
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,380
Howdy.

208
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:44,802
Give me a bo x of juice.

209
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:48,097
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

210
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:52,393
Maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.

211
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:56,605
Or this guy's doing so good
they want to put more people on it.

212
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:01,318
This guy goes through
two bottles a day now.

213
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,154
What do you care?

214
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,616
You're an actor.
This is your day job. It's nothing!

215
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,327
I know, but I was the best.

216
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:15,207
You know? I liked being the best.

217
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,546
Maybe I should get
out of the game.

218
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:24,049
They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.

219
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,383
Say you do that.

220
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:31,306
Sooner or later, somebody will come
along that slices a better cheddar.

221
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,350
Then where you gonna run?

222
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,476
You're right.

223
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:38,146
I say you show him what you're made of.
Stand your ground.

224
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:43,485
Show him that you're the baddest
Hombre west of the lingerie!

225
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,571
- I'm gonna do it!
- All right!

226
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:52,119
Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

227
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,413
I don't know what to say.

228
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,457
That's good because I'm not listening.

229
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,460
I feel terrible. I really do.

230
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,464
I'm sorry.
Did my back hurt your knife?

231
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:09,845
Say that I'm friends with her.
Is that so terrible?

232
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,639
- It's that terrible?
- You don't get it!

233
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,600
It's bad enough
she stole the guy...

234
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,561
...who may be the person
I'm supposed to be with.

235
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,980
But now...

236
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,357
...she's actually...

237
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:26,821
But now she's actually stealing you!

238
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,908
What are you talking about?

239
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,494
Nobody could steal me from you.

240
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:39,333
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any less friends with you.

241
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,503
You're my...

242
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,631
And we're...

243
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:51,595
- Oh, I love you!
- I love you too!

244
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:59,478
You guys, I know that this really
doesn't have anything to do with me.

245
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,814
But I love you guys too!

246
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:10,990
I really needed that.

247
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,241
I know that right now...

248
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,036
...you really need
to hate Julie's guts.

249
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:19,498
But she didn't do anything wrong.

250
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:24,169
She's just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out.

251
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,882
I think that if you gave her
a chance, you'd like her.

252
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,219
Will you give it a chance?

253
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,222
For me?

254
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,433
I'd do anything for you,
you know that.

255
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,896
I'd do anything for you!

256
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,398
Wait, wait, wait!

257
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,834
Mornin'.

258
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:09,840
I said, mornin'!

259
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,801
I heard you.

260
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:16,013
All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.

261
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,016
You boys ready?

262
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,354
Ready.

263
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,525
Yeah, I'm ready.

264
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,155
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

265
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,365
You've blinded me! I'm suing!

266
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:21,453
Oh, my God! Todd!
What the hell did you do?

267
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,330
Sorry. I'm such a doofus!

268
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,792
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

269
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,503
My God, what happened?

270
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,130
These new kids, they never last.

271
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,175
Sooner or later they all...

272
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,178
...stop lasting.

273
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:42,098
What do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?

274
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,893
Sure.

275
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,871
I just thought we should hang out.

276
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:08,000
I mean, you know,
we've never really talked.

277
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,295
I guess you'd know that,
being one of the two of us.

278
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,547
I know.

279
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:17,050
I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...

280
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:21,222
...but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.

281
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,555
Really?

282
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:23,807
Me?

283
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,934
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

284
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,895
Ross is so crazy about you...

285
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:31,315
...and I really wanted you
to like me, and I...

286
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,359
It's probably me just
being totally paranoid...

287
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,657
...but I kind of got the feeling
that maybe you don't.

288
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,834
Well, you're not totally paranoid.

289
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:05,349
When you and Ross
first started going out...

290
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,353
...it was really hard for me...

291
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:15,651
...for many reasons of which
I'm not gonna bore you with now.

292
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:24,410
I see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.

293
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,664
And Monica's always
saying how nice you are...

294
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:32,668
...and God, I hate it when she's right!

295
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,045
Thanks.

296
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:39,007
Would you like to go to
a movie sometime or something?

297
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:42,011
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love it.

298
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:44,764
I'd love it too.

299
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,306
Shoot, I gotta go.

300
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:51,020
- So I'll talk to you later.
- All right, Julie.

301
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:02,280
What a manipulative bitch.

302
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,021
It's not bad.
