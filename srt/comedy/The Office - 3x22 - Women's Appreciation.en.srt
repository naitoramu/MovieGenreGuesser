1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,333
Hey

2
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:08,232
Oh, what's this?

3
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:10,227
That is a demerit.

4
00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:13,115
"Jim Halpert, tardiness."

5
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:15,376
Oh, I love it already.

6
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:16,396
You've got to learn, Jim,

7
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:18,894
you're second in command,
but that does not put you above the law.

8
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,133
Oh I understand.

9
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:22,021
And, I also have lots of questions.

10
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,424
Like what does a demerit mean?

11
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:26,072
Let's put it this way.

12
00:00:26,072 --> 00:00:27,904
You do not want to 
receive three of those.

13
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,666
Lay it on me.

14
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,803
Three demerits, 
and you'll receive a citation.

15
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:33,646
- Now that sounds serious.
- Oh it is serious.

16
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:36,330
Five citations, and you're 
looking at a violation.

17
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:39,038
Four of those, and you'll 
receive a verbal warning.

18
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,455
Keep it up, and you're 
looking at a written warning.

19
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:44,473
Two of those, that'll 
land you in a world of hurt.

20
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:47,075
In the form of 
a disciplinary review,

21
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:50,622
written up by me and placed 
on the desk of my immediate superior.

22
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:51,621
Which would be me.

23
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:53,696
That is correct.

24
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:57,015
Okay, I want a copy on my desk, 
by the end of the day,

25
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,961
or you will receive 
a full disadulation.

26
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:03,027
What's a dis- 
what's that?

27
00:01:04,823 --> 00:01:06,254
Oh, you don't want to know.

32
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:50,384
Hey Phillis. You alright?

33
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,342
I think I just got flashed.

34
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:55,242
What?

35
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:56,105
Really?

36
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,112
- In the parking lot.
- Oh my God!

37
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:01,136
Move!

38
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:04,622
Okay, I'll call the real police.

39
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:06,276
What happened?

40
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:07,441
What can I do to help?

41
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:11,639
I'll check the web.

42
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,633
Thank you.

43
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,984
The police are on this. They said 
they already have received 3 calls.

44
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:21,621
Can you tell us what happened?

45
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,901
I was walking to the building and 
this man asked me for directions.

46
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:29,946
And he was holding a map.

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,608
And when I walked over, he had it out-

48
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:36,869
on the map.

49
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:39,350
Phyllis, you're a married woman.

50
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,654
The guy was just hanging brain.
I mean, what's all the fuss?

51
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,392
If that's flashing, then lock me up.

52
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,874
That's just like so creepy.

53
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:50,984
What's happening?

54
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,694
Some guy exposed himself 
to Phyllis in the parking lot.

55
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,189
Really? Is she okay?

56
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:59,708
Yeah, Bob Vance took her 
for a walk to calm down.

57
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:01,474
Okay.

58
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:05,872
Phyllis, you say?

59
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:11,465
What is so funny?

60
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,360
I mean, did he even see Pam?

61
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:17,277
Or, uh, Karen from behind?

62
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,143
I'm guessing not.

63
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:24,815
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:30,403
Pretty funny 
when you think about it.

65
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:31,846
It really doesn't.

66
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:33,543
It's disgusting in the meaning.

67
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:37,955
Okay, masters of comedy. 
A guy dropped his pants.

68
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:39,389
Have you ever been to the circus?

69
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:41,935
Okay.

70
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:48,396
He's back!

71
00:03:56,964 --> 00:03:58,988
Hey, what's going on? 
there's a police car is in the...

72
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:00,471
What?

73
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:04,453
What's going on?

74
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,054
Oh, Phyllis' got flashed.

75
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:07,332
It's um-

76
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,886
I don't think laughing about it 
is an appropriate response.

77
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:14,877
Come on. We're laughing at Phyllis 
and she's even not here.

78
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:16,054
So, no harm, no foul

79
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:17,798
I don't think 
the woman in this office...

80
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,450
Incidentally, where're you 
during all of this.

81
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,497
Maybe you're the flash.

82
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,491
I was at the parent-teacher conference.

83
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:24,412
Aha, Prove it.

84
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:25,564
Let's see your penis.

85
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:35,657
You know, as that was 
coming out of my mouth,

86
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:37,903
I knew that it was wrong.

87
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:42,926
In all the excitement,

88
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:47,968
I forgot that my primary goal 
is to keep people safe.

89
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,851
Women can't have fun 
if they don't feel safe.

90
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:59,386
For example, Jan and I have a 
safe word in case things go too far.

91
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:01,037
Foliage.

92
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:04,499
And if one of us says that word,

93
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:06,624
the other one has to stop.

94
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:11,094
Although last time,

95
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:14,840
she pretended she didn't hear me.

96
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,688
Michael, come over after work tonight, okay?

97
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:19,151
And, I miss your body.

98
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:23,842
I don't know. 
I feel... I drive a lot.

99
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,587
Spending unfortune gas...

100
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:29,450
-

101
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:33,484
That- I don't know. 
That makes me kind of uncomfortable.

102
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:34,429
$300?

103
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,343
I don't know...

104
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:39,903
you know, whatever, Just let 
my assistant know if you're coming over

105
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:41,173
so he can get more vodka, okay?

106
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:42,818
- Hunter, are you on? 
- You got it, Jan.

107
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,770
Employees of this office are 
very small and delicate.

108
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:52,172
Deserve protection from local pervs.

109
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:54,818
Better a thousand 
innocent men are locked up

110
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:56,875
than one guilty man roam free.

111
00:05:58,186 --> 00:05:59,751
I'm sick over these things,

112
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:01,974
those people out there are clearly afraid.

113
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:04,329
And, that can't happen. 
Not in my house.

114
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,143
Agreed. Let me show you 
what I've been working on.

115
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:11,204
There are several penises there
I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over.

116
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:13,037
You know, see if we can 
catches the pervert.

117
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:17,005
This is the last thing 
that Phyllis need to see right now, Dwight.

118
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:17,951
Think of that one

119
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:21,800
Dwight, are those your pants?

120
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:23,749
That's a Polaroid.

121
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:27,222
Attention everybody.

122
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:29,086
Dwight has something 
he'd like to say.

123
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:33,041
Due to a recent incident 
involving Phyllis,

124
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,919
a man, a map, and his penis,

125
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,665
I think you know 
what I'm referring to,

126
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:42,863
Michael has authorized me to form 
an emergency, anti-flashing, task force.

127
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:47,635
Question: Won't that interfere 
with your other task forces?

128
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:50,205
Answer: No, because this is 
being given primary one.

129
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,496
This is petition for the business 
park to upgrade security cameras

130
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:58,213
As well as install two floodlights
in the parking lot.

131
00:06:58,213 --> 00:06:59,852
And I know what you're thinking.

132
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:03,620
Won't that just shed 
more light on the penises.

133
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,368
But that is a risk we have to take.

134
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:07,552
Pam, you can draw, kind of,

135
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,933
why don't you work with Phallus 
on drawing a picture of the exposer

136
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,513
that I can post around the community.

137
00:07:12,596 --> 00:07:13,432
Phallus?

138
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,751
Phyllis, sorry.

139
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:16,681
I've got penises on the brain.

140
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,408
Back to work everybody.

141
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,999
I don't often miss Roy.

142
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:28,772
But I can tell you one thing.

143
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:31,475
I wish someone had flashed me 
when I was with Roy.

144
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:34,376
Because that would have been 
the ass-kicking of the year.

145
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:37,215
Especially if it had been Jim.

146
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,218
He would not have wanted me 
to have seen Jim's ...

147
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,503
I am, I am saying a lot of things.

148
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:51,847
I didn't really get a good look.

149
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:53,154
That's okay.

150
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,339
I don't feel like answering phones.

151
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,818
Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out?

152
00:07:58,474 --> 00:07:59,981
"Women will be sent home"

153
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:03,335
"if they wear makeup or heels 
exceeding one-quarter inch."

154
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,396
"Females are not allowed 
to speak to strangers"

155
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:08,157
"unless given written 
authorization by Dwight Schrute."

156
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:09,699
This is ridiculous.

157
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,322
Attention, I am removing 
all bananas from the kitchen.

158
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:18,529
Dwight, this memo 
that you distributed, is insulting.

159
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:20,296
Desperate times call for 
desperate measures.

160
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:22,019
"Sleeves down to the wrists,"

161
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,388
"button-up collars, 
and muted colors."

162
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,668
Nobody dresses like that.

163
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:27,267
Okay, you know what 
something, Dwight?

164
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:29,457
We are not the terrorist.

165
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:31,499
Why don't you just 
take these women,

166
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:34,047
Put'em in the burlap sack,
hit'em with stick.

167
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,202
Because, that's what you're doing.

168
00:08:35,202 --> 00:08:37,219
I celebrate these women.

169
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,439
They deserve the right 
to dress as they please.

170
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:41,968
If Pam wants to show 
more cleavage,

171
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:44,320
she should be able to. 
I encourage that.

172
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,539
Look, it's really simple.

173
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:48,649
We just want you guys 
treat us as those respect.

174
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,738
See? That's 
what we're talking about.

175
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,848
Did you hear that, Dwight?

176
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,092
Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?

177
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:56,025
No, Dwight, Respect!

178
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:57,821
R-E-S-P-@-$-T!

179
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,732
Find out what it means to me!

180
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:02,798
Alright, you know what? That's it.

181
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,864
Conference room in 5 minutes, 
women's appreciation.

182
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,634
Wait a sec, how are you 
qualified for that?

183
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:10,502
Oh, I don't know, James.

184
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,252
Did I come from a woman?

185
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,551
Have I slept with a woman?

186
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:14,494
More than one?

187
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:15,501
Less than three.

188
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,164
That is not current.

189
00:09:17,164 --> 00:09:19,322
You know what? 
Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting?

190
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:20,348
He's a homosexual.

191
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:21,394
Why don't you run the meeting?

192
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,227
You play with dolls.

193
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,960
Those are collectible action figures.

194
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,352
And they're worth more than your car.

195
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:26,913
You know what? 
I am the expert.

196
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,494
I will conduct it.

197
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:29,911
I know the crap out of women.

198
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:34,733
I- um- would like to 
apologize for all the men

199
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,359
who thought that 
this was a laughing matter.

200
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:38,025
Are we still discussing this?

201
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:40,445
I say again, what is the big deal?

202
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:43,379
Nobody likes to be flashed.

203
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:46,206
When Meredith flashed me 
at that Christmas party,

204
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:47,625
I nearly vomited.

205
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,101
I don't remember doing that.

206
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:51,362
- What a surprise.
- Okay, no cat fights, please.

207
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:52,889
Let's- my point is-

208
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,815
My point is-

209
00:09:57,654 --> 00:09:58,603
A penis.

210
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:02,001
when seen in the right context,

211
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:05,268
is the most wonderful 
sight for a woman.

212
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:07,855
But in the wrong context, 
it is like a monster movie.

213
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:08,433
Alien.

214
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,331
What are- Shut it. Shut up.

215
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:15,129
Okay, so what I want to 
engage us in today,

216
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:18,784
is a hardcore discussion 
about women's problems.

217
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,875
And it's use and situation.

218
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:25,221
Magazines and TV shows and movies

219
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:29,839
portray women as skinny tall goddesses.

220
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,115
Well, look around.

221
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:34,027
Are women like that?

222
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,670
No, no, they are not.

223
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,149
Even the hot ones aren't 
really that skinny.

224
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,860
So what does that say?

225
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,907
That says that you women 
are up against it.

226
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:50,773
And it is criminal.

227
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:52,161
Society doesn't care.

228
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:53,397
Society sucks.

229
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:56,340
I don't even consider 
myself a part of society.

230
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,566
F.Y.I. because I'm so angry 
over all of this.

231
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:02,165
If it were up to me,

232
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,432
you ladies would be 
the fashion models.

233
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,470
Yes, Andy.

234
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:10,410
Then the fashion models 
could come here and work with me.

235
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,045
What you're saying is 
extremely misogynistic.

236
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:15,805
Yes. Thank you.

237
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,580
That was not necessary, 
but I appreciated it.

238
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,939
And it proves my point. 
Women can do anything.

239
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,509
I'm saying that you're being sexist.

240
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:27,021
No, I'm being misogynistic.

241
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:29,425
That is insane, 
I am not being sexist.

242
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:30,438
- That- it's the same thing.
- Michael.

243
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:31,027
Yes.

244
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,305
When I got my hair cut short, 
you asked me if I was a lesbian.

245
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:38,955
Because- uh- that was 
one possible explanation.

246
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:40,389
That's the why 
you got that hair cut.

247
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:41,760
And, when we get mad,

248
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,708
you always us 
if we're in a period.

249
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,274
I have to know whether you're serious or not.

250
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,020
I wish I could menstruate.

251
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:49,972
If I could menstruate,

252
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:52,263
I wouldn't have to deal with 
idiotic calendars anymore.

253
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:55,106
I'd just be able to count down 
from my previous cycle.

254
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,114
Plus, I'd be more in tune 
with the moon and the tides.

255
00:11:58,298 --> 00:11:59,744
Can't we just get back to work?

256
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:01,266
Yeah- okay- yes- well-

257
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,807
- This is not work talk. 
- You're right!

258
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:04,640
And you know why?

259
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,366
It's because of where we are.

260
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,392
This is a masculine environment.

261
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,438
We need to find a place where you feel comfortable.

262
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:13,992
You know where we're gonna go?

263
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,147
Steamtown mall.

264
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:20,662
Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But,

265
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:22,887
I have a bunch of stuff 
I need to return in my car.

266
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,911
So, I can do that.

267
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:28,469
Malls are just awful and humiliating.

268
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:31,762
They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople

269
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:34,738
making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section.

270
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:37,960
There are petite adults who are sort of ...

271
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:41,220
smaller, who need to wear...

272
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,734
maybe a kids' size 10.

273
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,589
Okay, let's go. 
Ladies of Dunder-Mifflin.

274
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,031
Hey, we should have 
a calendar printed up.

275
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,300
Pam, put that in 
my good idea folder.

276
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:54,292
Let's go!

277
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:56,580
- Have you finished with the sketch? 
- Yeah

278
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,603
Doesn't seem like the type.

279
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:01,328
Phyllis got a good look.

280
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,488
I plan on plastering 
this pervert's face everywhere.

281
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:12,407
You can run, 
but you cannot hide.

282
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:17,431
Meredith! Slow down!

283
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,687
We're not gonna get there 
any faster for death.

284
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:21,459
Thanks. I know how to drive.

285
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:29,521
You really shouldn't litter.

286
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:31,872
My car, my rules.

287
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:37,781
Hey, Jim.

288
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,258
You wanna go in 
the women's bathroom?

289
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,342
No. Thank you, though.

290
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,112
You aren't curious?

291
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,896
Not really, I've seen 
a bathroom before.

292
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:51,535
Yeah, but- 
it's every guy's fantasy.

293
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:53,763
I think you mean 
a girl's locker room.

294
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:56,250
And in the fantasy, 
there's usually girls in it.

295
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:00,598
I'm going in.

296
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:01,607
Go crazy.

297
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:09,789
Oh my God.

298
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:13,114
I really appreciate your 
letting me work alongside you so closely today.

299
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:14,299
Of course you do, moonface.

300
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:15,893
That's because 
you're a preppy freak,

301
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,000
you're the office pariah, 
and nobody likes you.

302
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:20,533
So, start hanging these 
all around the building.

303
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,218
This guy looks like a real deviant.

304
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:29,962
No duh! That's why 
we gotta catch him.

305
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:31,104
Start hanging those!

306
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,128
Aye aye, Captain.

307
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:34,289
More like, "Aye aye, General."

308
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:36,852
I don't think she's gonna make it.

309
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:39,043
Don't think she's gonna make it!

310
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:44,049
It's a little too tight!

311
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:45,894
I'm gonna find another spot.

312
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,333
Many women are competent drivers.

313
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:52,936
Okay, come on.

314
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,870
This is what we know.

315
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:08,882
Well, I stand correctly. 
This is pretty cool.

316
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,121
Yes

317
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,284
Hey- uh-

318
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,818
where did you 
decide to take Karen tonight?

319
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:15,203
Anna Maria's

320
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:16,165
What's the occasion?

321
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:17,560
6 month anniversary

322
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,738
What?

323
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:22,824
Nothing. I think-

324
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:24,848
we all kinda thought 
you guys were just like hookin' up

325
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,933
No, even dating for six months.

326
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,995
She might mention an email

327
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,338
that I wrote awhile back...

328
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:37,329
Oh, right. I remember that one. 
She read it to me.

329
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:41,219
She said she's not really ready 
to date somebody in the office, but,

330
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:42,739
she really likes you as a friend.

331
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:46,489
I figured. It's cool. I don't-

332
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,619
I wouldn't want to be 
in an office relationship anyway.

333
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:56,128
- I hope nobody's on a diet. 
- Thanks Michael.

334
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:58,525
- Thank you Michael. 
- Welcome, welcome.

335
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:03,821
Okay. So- let's dish.

336
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,596
What do you wanna dish about?

337
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:08,064
Anything you guys want. 
This is your time.

338
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:24,351
What is a Pap smear?

339
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,034
Or is it "schmear"?

340
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:27,828
Like...the cream cheese.

341
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:29,644
Okay, new topic.

342
00:16:29,644 --> 00:16:31,989
Kelly, how are things with Ryan?

343
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:32,563
Awesome.

344
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:34,540
Um, awful, I mean.

345
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,793
But uh- sometimes awesome.

346
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,861
what do you think about role play?

347
00:16:41,204 --> 00:16:43,081
- That can be fun. 
- Yeah?

348
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:46,686
Jan has this school girl fantasy-

349
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:48,245
That's pretty common one.

350
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:48,969
I just-

351
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:51,727
I feel uncomfortable 
wearing the dress.

352
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,365
Okay, I'm going to be 
at the doll store.

353
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,385
Sometimes the clothes at 
Gap Kids are just too flashy.

354
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,712
So I'm forced to go to 
the American Girl store.

355
00:17:00,712 --> 00:17:02,956
And order clothes for 
large colonial dolls.

356
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:07,359
Michael, you shouldn't do anything 
that you're uncomfortable with.

357
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:10,967
Jan says anything that doesn't 
scare us is not worth doing.

358
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,964
I don't know, maybe 
we're different people.

359
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,706
I like cuddling 
and spooning, and

360
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:17,681
she likes videotaping us 
during sex.

361
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:18,459
Oh my God.

362
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:22,858
And then watching it back 
right afterward to improve my form.

363
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,938
That is not healthy behavior.

364
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:26,415
No, it's not that bad.

365
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,452
The worst part is,

366
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:30,445
that she shows it to 
her therapist and they discuss it.

367
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:32,941
Michael, you need to get out of this.

368
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:35,659
Nah- she's- 
she's- fooling around.

369
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:37,066
That's a woman thing.

370
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:39,881
No. none of woman do stuff like that.

371
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:41,307
This is bad.

372
00:17:51,492 --> 00:17:54,657
Oh, that's alright. 
I'm okay. I'm okay.

373
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,443
You guys-

374
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:01,321
what am I going to do about Jan?

375
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:06,711
Done.

376
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:09,342
Read the pros first.

377
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:12,686
Okay. Jan is smart.

378
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:14,731
Successful.

379
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,085
Good clothes.

380
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:17,339
Hot

381
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,430
Perfect skin. Nice butt.

382
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:22,251
She does have very nice clothes.

383
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:24,191
Okay, okay, cons.

384
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:25,429
Cons.

385
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,398
Wears too much makeup.

386
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,110
Breast.

387
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,691
not anything to write home about.

388
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:32,441
Insecure about body.

389
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:34,217
I'm unhappy when I'm with her.

390
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,898
- Flat-chested.
- What was the last one?

391
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,091
She's totally flat. 
Shrunken chesticles.

392
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,646
No, the one before that.

393
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:41,936
I'm unhappy when I'm with her.

394
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:46,813
Michael, you shouldn't be with 
someone who doesn't make you happy.

395
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,018
I'm happy sometimes.

396
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:52,814
When we scrapbook,

397
00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:56,333
Or, right towards the end of having sex.

398
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,910
Look, most relationships 
have their rough patches.

399
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,897
You just have to push 
through it sometimes.

400
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:02,250
Yeah, that's smart.

401
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:02,964
Maybe.

402
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,486
But it sounds like you're 
just wrong for each other.

403
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:06,932
That sounds good, too.

404
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:11,598
I don't know who's right.

405
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,857
I just don't- I don't know.

406
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:14,811
I bet you know.

407
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:17,486
Don't think just answers. 
What do you wanna do about Jan?

408
00:19:17,486 --> 00:19:18,713
I wanna break up with Jan.

409
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,866
Wow- I wanna break up with Jan.

410
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:27,255
My mom taught me that.

411
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:32,878
Wow, I cannot believe 
this yogurt has no calorie.

412
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:34,931
No one said it has no calorie.

413
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:37,014
Oh, hey guys.

414
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,021
I wanna do something nice for you.

415
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:43,640
Because you did something 
so nice for me earlier.

416
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:45,071
I want you to go in there.

417
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:46,901
I want you to find one item

418
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,517
on me as a thank you.

419
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:50,702
Come on, get in here!

420
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,057
Let's face it.
Most guys are from dark ages.

421
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:54,020
They're cave man.

422
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,199
And they like woman 
to be showing her cleavage,

423
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,685
And to be wearing 
8-inch hills,

424
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:03,266
And to be wearing- 
um- see-through...

425
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:05,106
underpants,

426
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:08,536
But, for me,

427
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:13,095
A woman looks best when 
she is just absolutely naked.

428
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,190
This is so great, huh?

429
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,235
We should do this much more often.

430
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:27,635
I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.

431
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,333
What're you doing in here? 
This is the women's room.

432
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:34,326
You're in here.

433
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:36,056
I pay for that privilege.

434
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:44,250
Okay.

435
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,933
I'm a pretty normal guy.

436
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,706
I do one weird thing.

437
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,871
I like to go in 
the women's room for no. 2.

438
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,918
I've been caught several times,

439
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,527
and I have paid dearly.

440
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:58,599
You don't want anything?

441
00:20:58,805 --> 00:20:59,725
My treat.

442
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:02,002
Some panties, or-

443
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:06,004
Got thong or G-string,

444
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:07,291
T-back,

445
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:09,308
Get a nice bra-

446
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:10,925
Padded bra.

447
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:13,518
See-through, push-up, lace?

448
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:15,435
Thigh-high? Bustier? Anything.

449
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:20,369
It just, you know what, I would 
love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.

450
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:22,819
Phyllis,

451
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:24,667
what do you think? Too much?

452
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,406
Jim's gonna love it.

453
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:35,327
I'm kind of in between boyfriends right now.

454
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,732
So I don't need anything sexy.

455
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:40,211
But I do need some new hand towels,

456
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,621
I figure I could cut up this robe.

457
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,257
Slower!

458
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,496
Slower!

459
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:48,599
Meredith!

460
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,814
Slow it up!

461
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:53,867
Oh- oh, no.

462
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:56,505
It's Jan.

463
00:21:56,836 --> 00:21:57,605
what do I do?

464
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:58,293
Answer it.

465
00:21:58,293 --> 00:21:59,430
Don't answer it.

466
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:04,964
Okay, it stopped.

467
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:07,316
Crap!

468
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:23,333
That is pretty cool.

469
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,316
Michael, you know how to 
change a wheel, right?

470
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,156
Uh- yeah. Yeap.

471
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:41,315
Can somebody grab me 
the rubber, and I will...

472
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:44,173
Here- uh- Meredith, 
why don't you put your hazard on?

473
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:46,385
Yeah, get your 
hazard on for safety.

474
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,743
Let me see.

475
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:52,596
Here you go!

476
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:56,591
Good, yes. We have the...

477
00:22:57,898 --> 00:22:58,921
lever it

478
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:01,323
Alright- Here I got it.

479
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:08,108
Do you have a crescent? 
A crescent Allan?

480
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:09,956
I don't think that 
we really need that, Michael.

481
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:12,307
You know what? I'm going to-

482
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,217
You take care of that. 
I'm gonna do traffic.

483
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:16,688
Detail.

484
00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:20,527
<i>You know?
I changed a tire today.

485
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:21,667
All by myself.

486
00:23:22,587 --> 00:23:24,727
This bathrobe's already 
coming in handy.

487
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:26,495
Coming!

488
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,750
Think we'll find him?

489
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,961
Yeah, I do. 
'Cause justice never rest

490
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:37,533
Halfsies?

491
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:39,460
No. Wholesies.

492
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:44,599
Listen, man. I really appreciate 
you let me shadow you today.

493
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,482
I feel like I learned a lot.

494
00:23:45,482 --> 00:23:46,261
Natch

495
00:23:47,488 --> 00:23:48,817
Yeap.

496
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:50,209
If you don't mind,

497
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:52,683
I think I'll hang up some of 
these posters around my neighborhood.

498
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:55,943
Schools, post offices, etc.

499
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:59,957
You know, I may have 
underestimated you.

500
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,667
You're not a total ass.

501
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:13,621
Okay, I am really going to do this.

502
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:15,650
- Good luck, Michael. 
- You know what?

503
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,912
I need my girls with me.

504
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:19,715
Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. 
Come on, let's do this.

505
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:22,261
Let's do it.

506
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:27,046
Okay, remember be strong.

507
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,350
I love you guys.

508
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:38,215
I can hear voice mail.

509
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:41,380
- Don't leave a message- 
- Hey, Jan. it's me. Michael.

510
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,969
I'm just calling to say 
that I think we need a little break.

511
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:46,269
Permanently.

512
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:49,942
And, uh, I know 
everybody says this, but

513
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:53,331
I wanna remain friends.

514
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:58,299
Or at least, business 
associates who get along.

515
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,980
Oh just so you know, 
it's not me, it's you.

516
00:25:04,741 --> 00:25:08,177
Okay, buddy. Somebody 
just walked in, I have to go.

517
00:25:08,177 --> 00:25:10,287
Um, so I'll talk to you later.

518
00:25:12,768 --> 00:25:13,576
Michael,

519
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:15,448
I was um-

520
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,759
I was really unhappy with 
our conversation earlier.

521
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,299
And, I-

522
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:23,721
I just- I couldn't 
stop thinking about it.

523
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:25,905
So, I decided that 
I would drive down here

524
00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:28,757
and apologize to you in person.

525
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:31,019
So-

526
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:38,526
I'm sorry.

527
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,092
Thank you.

528
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,236
So, we're good?

529
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:48,551
Absofruitly.

530
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:50,417
Hold on, sorry.

531
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,010
- No, no-
- Just wait a second.

532
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:57,886
Oh, it's from you.

533
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,390
- Do you wanna grab some dinner? 
<i>- Hey, Jan. it's me. Michael.

534
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:08,374
<i>I'm just calling to say that I think 
we need a little break. Permanently.

535
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:12,239
<i>And, uh, I know 
everybody says this, but

536
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:15,385
<i>- I wanna remain friends.</i> 
- Maybe some Italian, or ?

537
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:17,946
<i>Or, at least, business associates

538
00:26:17,946 --> 00:26:19,721
- <i>who get along.</i>
- Chinese.

539
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:23,723
<i>Oh just so you know, 
it's not me, it's you.

540
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:25,003
<i>- Okay, buddy...

541
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:37,174
Any man who says he totally 
understands women is a fool.

542
00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:39,848
beause they are un-understandable.

543
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:43,189
There's a wishing fountain at the mall.

544
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,301
And I threw a coin in for 
every woman in the world and made a wish.

545
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,838
I wished for Jan to get over me,

546
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:54,408
I wished for Phyllis a plasma TV,

547
00:26:54,408 --> 00:26:58,165
I wished for Pam to gain courage,

548
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,562
I wished for Angela a heart,

549
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:03,099
and for Kelly a brain.

550
00:27:03,892 --> 00:27:06,158
"Michael, how can you 
appreciate women so much,"

551
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,817
"but also dump one of them?"

552
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:13,910
You mean, how can I be 
so illogical and flighty

553
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,513
and unpredictable and emotional?

554
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:22,025
Well maybe I learned something 
from women after all.

555
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:29,534
Dunder Mifflin Paper slash Sex 
Predator Hotline. This is Dwight Schrute.

556
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:30,667
Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.

557
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:32,654
Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.

558
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:35,457
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.

559
00:27:36,694 --> 00:27:38,069
- I'm hanging up. 
- Don't.

560
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,340
I have information 
about the sex predator.

561
00:27:42,842 --> 00:27:44,804
You have information 
about the sex predator?

562
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,693
I saw him two minutes ago.

563
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,786
Where?

564
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,006
In the women's bathroom, 
above the sink.

565
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:00,406
Anti Flashing Task Force!

566
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,725
Above the sink-

567
00:28:14,603 --> 00:28:16,151
Pam!
