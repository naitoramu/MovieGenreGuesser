1
00:00:07,478 --> 00:00:09,415
Hello? Hello? Radio Tower?

2
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:14,136
Lisbon plane taking off
in 10 minutes. East runway. Thank you.

3
00:00:26,256 --> 00:00:29,226
Louis, have your man go with Mr Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

4
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:31,311
Certainly, Rick. Anything you say.

5
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:33,605
Find Mr Laszlo's luggage
and put it on the plane.

6
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:34,699
Yes, sir.

7
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:36,151
This way, please.

8
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:40,353
If you don't mind, you fill in the names.
That'll make it even more official.

9
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:42,209
You think of everything, don't you?

10
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:45,952
And the names are
Mr and Mrs Victor Laszlo.

11
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:49,508
- But... why my name, Richard?
- 'Cause you're getting on that plane.

12
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:53,157
- I don't understand. What about you?
- I'm staying here with him till the plane gets safely away.

13
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,918
- No, Richard! No, what's happened to you?
Last night you said...

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,461
Last night we said a great many things.

15
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,465
You said I was to do the
thinking for both of us.

16
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:02,362
Well, I've done a lot of it since then and
it all adds up to one thing:

17
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:04,218
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,764
- But Rick, no I, I...
- Now, you've got to listen to me.

19
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:10,234
You have any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

20
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,331
9 chances out of 10 we'd both wind up in a
concentration camp, isn't that true Louis?

21
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,183
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

22
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:19,588
You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

23
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:22,141
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

24
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:24,278
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,523
If that plane leaves the ground
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

26
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:31,423
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon for the rest of your life.

27
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:33,998
But what about us?

28
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,750
We'll always have Paris.

29
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:39,149
We didn't have we... we'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

30
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,586
We got it back last night.

31
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,863
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

32
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,563
Look I'm no good at being noble.

33
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:50,543
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

34
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:53,896
don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

35
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,975
Someday you'll understand that.

36
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,230
Now, now.

37
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:03,857
Here's looking at you, kid.

38
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:18,497
There's something you should
know before you leave.

39
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:20,686
- Mr. Blaine, I don't ask
you to explain anything.

40
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:23,647
I'm going to anyway because it may make
a difference to you later on.

41
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:26,171
You said you know about Ilsa and me.
- Yes.

42
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:29,132
She didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

43
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:32,366
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

44
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,137
Yes.

45
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,954
She tried everything to get them
but nothing worked.

46
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:40,395
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

47
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:43,187
But that was all over long ago.

48
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:47,282
For your sake she pretended it wasn't
and I let her pretend.

49
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,994
- I understand.
- Here it is.

50
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,112
Thanks.

51
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,043
Are you ready, Ilsa?

52
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:11,053
Yes, I'm ready.

53
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,677
Bye, Rick.

54
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:18,018
God bless you.

55
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:21,566
You better hurry,
you'll miss that plane.

56
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:55,152
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

57
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:59,896
There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville.
I could be induced to arrange a passage.

58
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:03,065
My letter of transit? I could use a trip.

59
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:06,571
It doesn't make a difference about our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 Francs.

60
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:09,854
Ah that 10,000 Francs
should pay our expenses.

61
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,887
"Our" expenses?
- Uh huh.

62
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,825
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

63
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:02,820
Who am I kidding? I'm not like that.

64
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:05,577
I never was, I never will be.

65
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,375
That's strictly the movies.

66
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,456
I'm so depressed.

67
00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:18,756
Maybe if I took
two more aspirin it would help.

68
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:23,015
That would make...
two, four, six aspirin.

69
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:26,550
I'm turning into an aspirin junkie.

70
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:31,348
Soon I'll be boiling the cotton
at the top of the bottle to get the extra.

71
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,280
I shouldn't have signed those papers.

72
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:45,533
Let her take me to court.

73
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,497
Two years of marriage down the drain.

74
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,210
I couldn't believe what she said to me.

75
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,454
She was like a total stranger,
not like my wife.

76
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:57,956
I don't want any alimony.
I just want out.

77
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:01,840
- Can't we discuss it?
- We discussed it 50 times.

78
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:04,342
- Why?
- I don't know.

79
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,465
I can't stand the marriage.

80
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,722
You're no fun, you suffocate me.

81
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:12,054
There's no rapport
and I don't dig you physically.

82
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,390
For God's sake, Allan,
don't take it personal.

83
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,892
I won't take it personal,
I'll just kill myself.

84
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,194
If only I knew where my analyst
was vacationing.

85
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,534
Where do they go every August?
They leave the city.

86
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:31,789
Every summer the city is full of people
who are crazy till Labour Day.

87
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:34,916
What if I reach him?
What's he gonna tell me?

88
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,329
Whatever I say
he tells me it's a sexual problem.

89
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,749
Isn't that ridiculous?
How can it be sexual?

90
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,421
We weren't even having relations.

91
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:46,545
Maybe once in a while.

92
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:49,087
She used to watch TV during it.

93
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,425
Change channels
with the remote control.

94
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:55,561
Why should a divorce bother me so?

95
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:58,142
Maybe I'm better off without her.

96
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,274
Why not?
I'm young, healthy, got a good job.

97
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:04,604
This could be my chance
to step out a little bit.

98
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,731
If she can swing, so can l.

99
00:07:06,782 --> 00:07:09,189
I could turn this place into a nightclub.

100
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:12,243
Get broads here
like you wouldn't believe.

101
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:14,825
Swingers, freaks, nymphomaniacs,

102
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:17,198
dental hygienists.

103
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,204
If she didn't want me,
I won't push myself on her.

104
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:23,538
I couldn't believe
what she said when she left.

105
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,463
I want a new life.

106
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:28,295
I want to go skiing,
go dancing, go to the beach,

107
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:30,882
ride through Europe on a motorcycle.

108
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,133
- All we ever do is see movies.
- I write for a film magazine.

109
00:07:34,183 --> 00:07:36,259
Besides, I happen to like movies.

110
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,058
That's because
you're one of life's great watchers.

111
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:44,814
I'm a doer. I want to participate.
We never laugh together.

112
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,692
How can you say that?
I'm constantly laughing.

113
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:53,863
I chuckle, I giggle, I guffaw. Why didn't
this come up when we were dating?

114
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,235
You were more aggressive then.

115
00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:59,621
Everybody is during courtship.
It's natural.

116
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:04,742
You can't expect me to keep up that
level of charm, I'd have a heart attack.

117
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:07,369
Goodbye, Allan.

118
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,581
My lawyer will call your lawyer.

119
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:13,127
I don't have a lawyer.

120
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:15,254
Have him call my doctor.

121
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:23,512
What's the matter with me?
Why can't I be cool?

122
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:26,019
What's the secret?

123
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:30,526
There's no secret, kid.
Dames are simple.

124
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,817
I never met one that didn't understand
a slap in the mouth

125
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:37,238
or a slug from a .45.

126
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:39,408
Yeah, cos you're Bogart.

127
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:42,953
I could never hit Nancy.
It's not that type of relationship.

128
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:46,248
Where'd you learn that word,
the shrink?

129
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:51,251
I'm not like you. In Casablanca, when
you lost lngrid, weren't you crushed?

130
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,003
Nothing a little bourbon and soda
wouldn't fix.

131
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:57,217
I can't drink.
My body won't tolerate alcohol.

132
00:08:57,262 --> 00:09:01,639
Take my advice and forget
all this fancy relationship stuff.

133
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:03,925
The world is full of dames.

134
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,468
All you got to do is whistle.

135
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:14,902
He's right.

136
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:17,817
You give them an inch
and they step all over you.

137
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:21,237
Why can't I develop that attitude?

138
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:25,070
Nothing a little bourbon and soda
couldn't fix.

139
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:56,564
- Are you all right?
- You poor thing!

140
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:59,648
- Why didn't you call us?
- I didn't want to bother you.

141
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:03,446
Not bother us?
For God's sake, what are friends for?

142
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:05,865
Why did she say
she wanted a divorce?

143
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:08,070
She doesn't laugh enough.

144
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:11,076
Insufficient laughter -
grounds for divorce.

145
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,201
She wants to go skiing.

146
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:15,743
She wants to ski
down a mountain laughing.

147
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:19,960
Let me call my office.
I ran out of a meeting when you called.

148
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:22,297
They must think I'm crazy.

149
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:25,879
- Have you heard from her?
- I heard from Schulman and Weiss.

150
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:29,097
I signed some papers
and Nancy went to Mexico.

151
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:31,301
We went there on our honeymoon.

152
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:33,891
Spent the entire two weeks in bed.

153
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:36,014
I had dysentery.

154
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:39,648
Hello, George?
Did they agree to the terms?

155
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:44,230
Oh, hell. Well, if we blow it, we blow it.

156
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:47,318
God! Can't you cook anything
but TV dinners?

157
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:50,903
Who bothers to cook them?
I suck them frozen.

158
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:57,242
I'll tell you where you can reach me,
I'll be at 362-9296 for a while.

159
00:10:57,294 --> 00:11:02,122
Then I'll be at 648-0024
for about 15 minutes.

160
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:05,377
Then I'll be at 752-0420

161
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:08,344
and then I'll be home at 621 -4598.

162
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:10,971
Right, George. Bye-bye.

163
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:15,060
There's a phone booth on the corner,
shall I get the number?

164
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:17,558
You'll be passing it.

165
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,976
- I'm sorry, Allan.
- She wants to be a swinger.

166
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:26,727
- Married life is no good for her.
- Don't get worked up.

167
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:29,568
I gave her a home, affection, security.

168
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:33,448
This was a girl I found
waiting on tables at the Hip Bagel.

169
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:36,366
I used to go there every night
and over-tip her.

170
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:38,703
$1 .50 on a 35-cent check.

171
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,420
Nancy was impulsive.
We all knew that.

172
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:45,790
She didn't leave impulsively.
She talked about it for months.

173
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,790
- I didn't believe she'd do it.
- It's good you find out now.

174
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:53,213
- You're young. Make a new life.
- I'm 29.

175
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:56,847
The height of my sexual potency
was ten years ago.

176
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:59,810
Look at the bright side. You're free.

177
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:01,930
You'll go out, there'll be girls.

178
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:05,266
You'll go to parties,
have affairs with married women.

179
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:09,445
Sexual relations with girls
of every race, creed and colour.

180
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,903
You get tired of that.

181
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,034
Besides, those kinds of things
never happen to me.

182
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,992
I managed to fool one girl into
loving me and now she's gone.

183
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,198
See how he downgrades himself?

184
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,200
Don't you think plenty of women
would find him attractive?

185
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:30,417
- Yes, of course.
- The world's full of eligible women.

186
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:33,752
Yeah, but not like Nancy.
She was a lovely thing.

187
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:36,341
I used to lay in bed
and watch her sleep.

188
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,926
Once in a while she'd wake up
and catch me.

189
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:41,050
She'd let out a scream.

190
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:44,268
He really loved her. I feel like crying.

191
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:46,389
Why do you feel like crying?

192
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,606
A man makes an investment,
it doesn't pay off.

193
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:52,356
Could I get an aspirin?
I have a headache.

194
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,942
He's having a breakdown
and you're sick.

195
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,153
- Don't get upset.
- I'm not, I just had a rough day.

196
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:02,203
You want an aspirin too?

197
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,951
I ate all the aspirin,
what about Darvon?

198
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:08,783
Yes, my analyst suggested that
when I have migraines.

199
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:12,668
I used to get migraines but my analyst
cured me. Now I get cold sores.

200
00:13:12,715 --> 00:13:15,336
I still do. Big, ugly ones from tension.

201
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:19,678
- I may need a lobotomy.
- With mine away I feel paralysed.

202
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:22,259
You should move to hospital together.

203
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:25,807
- You want a Fresca with the Darvon?
- Do you have apple juice?

204
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:27,762
They're fantastic together.

205
00:13:27,813 --> 00:13:31,016
Have you ever had lithium
and tomato juice?

206
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:34,481
No, but another neurotic tells me
it's unbelievable.

207
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:37,445
Can I get a Coke with nothing in it?

208
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:41,191
I'll get the pills.

209
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:47,995
Poor guy.
If there's anything we can do...

210
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,370
He never should have married Nancy.

211
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:58,831
I thought they were getting along.

212
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:02,928
You're so busy all the time
you never see what's going on.

213
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:05,676
Didn't you think it strange
that he was married

214
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:08,428
but still couldn't get a date
on New Year's Eve?

215
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:10,765
Darling, don't get overwrought.

216
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:14,975
This is Mr Christie,
I'm no longer at 752-0420,

217
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:17,978
I'm gonna be home at 621 -4598.

218
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,146
What? Yes, I'll hold on.

219
00:14:21,197 --> 00:14:23,735
Honey, these things upset me.

220
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:26,902
I'm experiencing a wave of insecurity.

221
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:30,368
You are? Did I tell you
what happened to me today?

222
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:32,786
I bought 100 acres of land in Florida

223
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,750
and it turns out that
98 of them have quicksand.

224
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:38,795
My syndicate wanted to build
a golf course.

225
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,792
All we can do is build
a three-hole golf course

226
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:44,130
with the biggest sand trap
in the world.

227
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:48,211
What are you taking a pill for?

228
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:51,550
- I'm tense.
- Why?

229
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:56,476
The whole subject of divorce
is traumatic for me.

230
00:14:56,522 --> 00:15:00,733
- He's getting divorced, not us.
- It's the idea of it.

231
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:05,353
I guess I've never gotten over
my parents' divorce.

232
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,778
Well, it's about time. Come here.

233
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:14,660
You're so insecure.
I wish I could...

234
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:17,578
Milt? Dick. That deal is unacceptable.
The figures are lousy.

235
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:19,418
No, I can't take it.

236
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,389
Marjorie, did Mr Hardy call?

237
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:41,439
I'm at 922-3299.

238
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,686
Yeah, I'll be here...
I'm picking my wife up.

239
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,609
What? Who? Oh, Allan Felix.

240
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,407
All right, I'll call him later. Bye-bye.

241
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,282
Allan's calling again.
We got to find him a girl.

242
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,406
Somebody he can be with.

243
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,450
Well, find him a nice girl.

244
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,751
- There must be somebody here.
- Not single ones.

245
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,500
- What about Carol?
- Engaged.

246
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,877
- What about her?
- She's living with a priest.

247
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,719
The tall one with the blonde hair?

248
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:19,810
She'd eat him alive.
There'd be nothing left but his glasses.

249
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,390
This is going to be a bit of a problem.

250
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:25,356
Mr Christie, there's a call for you.

251
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:31,686
Listen, Linda and I
are going out for dinner tonight.

252
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:34,693
We'll invite some nice girl
and we'll all go.

253
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:37,030
You've got to start meeting girls.

254
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:40,446
I haven't done that in two years.
I'm out of practice.

255
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:43,498
When I was in practice,
I was out of practice.

256
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:46,412
You invested your emotions
in a losing stock.

257
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:48,537
It was wiped out.

258
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:52,123
What do you do?
You reinvest in a more stable stock.

259
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:55,295
Something with long-term
growth possibilities.

260
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:57,302
Like who, General Motors?

261
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:59,423
Come on, shape up.

262
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:03,637
She'd have to be damn good
to do anything for my morale at all.

263
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:06,971
- Who can we get?
- You don't have anybody in mind?

264
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:10,023
- We have several in mind.
- What kind do you like?

265
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:12,854
- He likes neurotics.
- I like blondes.

266
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:15,572
Blondes with long hair and short skirts

267
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,698
and boots and big chests
and bright and witty.

268
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:20,948
Don't set yourself silly standards.

269
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:23,829
She must be beautiful with a big bust?

270
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:27,038
And a good behind.
Something I can sink my teeth into.

271
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,250
- He was always fussy.
- But look at the result.

272
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:32,620
You never went out.

273
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:35,459
Sally has long hair
and a good size chest.

274
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:38,841
- What's good size?
- Like this I guess.

275
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:41,673
- She's not very bright.
- What does she do?

276
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:44,509
- She works for an astrologer.
- Forget it.

277
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:46,634
You might get her into bed.

278
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:49,686
With my luck
I won't get her into a chair.

279
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,850
These girls
often don't have great minds.

280
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,984
Why all this fuss over
a dinner companion?

281
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:59,776
Look, I can't go out,
I'm still attached to Nancy.

282
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:02,907
Will you forget about Nancy?
She's gone.

283
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:08,034
That's true. She wanted to be free
so she could swing.

284
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:10,204
Darling, think of somebody.

285
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:12,740
I can just picture what she's up to.

286
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,125
Baby, this is wonderful.

287
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:24,592
My ex-husband would never take me
on a motorcycle.

288
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:28,089
He fell off a scooter
and broke his collar bone.

289
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:31,427
And I mean the kind of scooter
you push.

290
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,348
Movies. That's his whole life,
he's a watcher.

291
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:36,271
I'm a doer.

292
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:40,064
It's been so long
since I've been made love to

293
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,187
by a handsome blond man.

294
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:46,281
We're divorced two weeks
and she's dating a Nazi.

295
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,492
- What about Sharon?
- I like the name.

296
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:52,870
She works as
a photographer's assistant.

297
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:55,121
- She's bright and cute.
- Let's go.

298
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,076
- Call her.
- Perfect.

299
00:18:57,127 --> 00:19:00,710
- What will you say?
- I'll ask if she's free for dinner.

300
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:03,757
Don't mention the divorce.
Say my wife's dead.

301
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,593
I don't know if we should do this.
The old tension's beginning to set in.

302
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:11,556
Sharon Lake, please. Linda Christie.

303
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,888
I don't want to hear this.

304
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:16,473
It's Linda, how are you?

305
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:21,431
Fine. We're going to dinner tonight
with an old friend,

306
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:24,769
we thought you might want to join us.

307
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:28,984
No, it's nothing.
We just have the radio on.

308
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:34,236
- You don't know him.
- A widower.

309
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:37,538
Tell her my wife died
in a mine shaft explosion.

310
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,824
He's lots of fun. You'll like him.

311
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:44,419
If she doesn't want to, forget it.
I don't need this aggravation.

312
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:47,299
We'll pick you up at eight o'clock.

313
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:49,381
Simple dress.

314
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:51,716
Sure, flats are OK.

315
00:19:51,763 --> 00:19:55,096
Let her wear heels.
What am l? Toulouse-Lautrec?

316
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:59,341
Bye-bye. You're set.

317
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:02,230
I really have mixed feelings about this.

318
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:05,357
What if I have this chick in bed
and Nancy comes back?

319
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:08,188
Let's not hope for too much
this first night.

320
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:11,819
- Did she say anything about me?
- She doesn't know you!

321
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:14,024
You never said I was a widower.

322
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:17,908
I got you the date,
you tell her about your wife's death.

323
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:19,947
I'm excited about this.

324
00:20:19,998 --> 00:20:23,201
We'll pick Sharon up
and then you after eight.

325
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:26,169
I can't stay out late,
I have an early meeting.

326
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:29,166
We can eat at the Pier in Sausalito.

327
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:31,338
Wonderful. It's so romantic.

328
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:35,132
The food is terrible
and I think it's going to rain.

329
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,630
I'm going to shower
and douse my body with Canoe.

330
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:43,638
I'm going home.
I'm going to brush all my teeth.

331
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:47,393
I think he and Sharon should hit it off.

332
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:49,896
- Yeah?
- You don't think so?

333
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:51,383
He'll probably calm down by tonight.

334
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:55,730
I wish she'd seen me before.

335
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:59,994
I hate to be there on a blind date
when the girl first sees me.

336
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:05,031
What if she's disappointed
and she laughs or screams?

337
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:14,418
Ridiculous.

338
00:21:14,468 --> 00:21:17,919
Has a girl ever once reacted
by laughing or screaming?

339
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:20,723
Once. A co-ed from Brooklyn College.

340
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:23,552
Came to the door,
saw me and passed out.

341
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:26,057
She was weak from dieting, though.

342
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,829
What the hell?

343
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:54,661
Bogart was short.
That never seemed to bother anybody.

344
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:57,288
You're starting off on the wrong foot.

345
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,418
- Yeah, negative.
- Sure.

346
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:02,968
She's getting the best of you
before the game starts.

347
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:05,719
What's that stuff you put on your face?

348
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:10,428
- Canoe. It's an aftershave lotion.
- What about that other stuff?

349
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:14,144
Lavoris, Mennen spray deodorant
and baby powder.

350
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:17,192
You're gonna smell like
a French cathouse.

351
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:20,356
- I need them.
- Why? Are you ashamed of sweat?

352
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,481
I want to make an impression.

353
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:26,696
You know, kid, somewhere in life
you got turned around.

354
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,318
It's her job to smell nice for you.

355
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:33,785
Don't tell her you don't drink,
she'll think you're a boy scout.

356
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,709
And don't get nervous.

357
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:39,418
The only bad thing is
if she turns out to be a virgin

358
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:41,541
or a cop.

359
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:44,379
With my luck,
she'll turn out to be both.

360
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:46,338
You know he's right.

361
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:50,469
A lot of women are turned on by
a masculine, earthy quality.

362
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:55,349
I shouldn't have put
so much Binoca under my arms.

363
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:59,015
Wouldn't it be great
if we hit it off at first sight?

364
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:03,602
Why not?
They say that dames are simple.

365
00:23:04,614 --> 00:23:08,197
I never met one who didn't understand
a slap in the mouth

366
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:10,319
or a slug from a .45.

367
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:14,619
Come here, Sharon.

368
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:19,124
You are fantastic.

369
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:24,251
Up until tonight, the doctors had told
me that I was frigid.

370
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,834
I want to thank you
for proving them wrong.

371
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:32,347
You got any girl friends with
the same problem, bring them over.

372
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:36,175
When Dick and Linda spoke of you,
they used terms like,

373
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:38,801
"brilliant " and "genius"

374
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:42,307
but they didn't say
that you were also an animal.

375
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:46,277
Sorry I had to slap you around,
sweetheart,

376
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:49,654
but you got hysterical
when I said "No more."

377
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:07,755
It's Linda.

378
00:24:09,676 --> 00:24:13,508
I'm alone. Sharon's with Dick,
they're out parking.

379
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:16,390
He sent me in
to make sure everything's OK.

380
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:18,591
I didn't realise it was so late.

381
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:21,727
Did you break a bottle
of shaving lotion?

382
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:24,855
- I'm wearing too much?
- It's a touch strong.

383
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:28,149
Once we get out into the air,
you won't notice.

384
00:24:28,194 --> 00:24:30,436
I better set this place up quickly.

385
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:33,738
It's fine.
We'll just have a quick drink and go.

386
00:24:33,783 --> 00:24:37,401
A few carefully-placed objects
create the proper impression.

387
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:41,153
You can't leave books lying around
like you're reading them!

388
00:24:41,206 --> 00:24:44,326
- It creates an image.
- You don't need an image.

389
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:50,290
Got just the thing,
my 100-yard-dash medal.

390
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,801
- You can't leave out a track medal.
- Why? I paid $20 for it.

391
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:59,927
I got a big decision to make.
Do I go with Oscar Peterson

392
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:02,133
or Bartók String Quartet No. 5?

393
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:06,134
Play Oscar Peterson and leave Bartók
out so everybody can see it.

394
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:08,062
That's a good idea.

395
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:12,568
I've never seen anybody go to
so much trouble to impress a date.

396
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:16,940
If you devoted so much time to Nancy,
I don't see why she left.

397
00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:21,818
I used to write her poems, take
her to restaurants and order in French.

398
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,361
The waiter would bring
the wrong things.

399
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:27,332
If you just leaned across
and kissed her...

400
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:31,587
I tried. She used to say,
"Not here, everybody's staring."

401
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:34,583
Once, my sleeve caught fire...

402
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:36,839
See, you laughed. It's funny, right?

403
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:39,802
She took it
as a symbol of my clumsiness.

404
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:45,965
Tremendous poise.
I'm an absolute master.

405
00:25:57,738 --> 00:25:59,814
Come on in.

406
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:14,791
Allan, this is Sharon.

407
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:19,789
I've got friends on this block,
right across the street.

408
00:26:19,842 --> 00:26:23,626
Do you know the Gibsons?
They're a fantastic couple.

409
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,056
- He's an interior decorator.
- That's sort of a hobby of mine.

410
00:26:31,395 --> 00:26:35,891
The key to it is to avoid looking
like you used a decorator.

411
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:38,229
I've got to make one quick call.

412
00:26:40,362 --> 00:26:43,777
- Linda, are you wearing Jasmine?
- Me? No.

413
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:47,441
- What are we drinking?
- J&B on the rocks.

414
00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:49,451
A Harveys Bristol Cream.

415
00:26:49,495 --> 00:26:51,571
I'll have the usual.

416
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:55,623
- Bourbon and water.
- A bourbon man.

417
00:26:56,252 --> 00:27:00,914
I got to cut down on my drinking.
I'm putting away a quart a day.

418
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:12,884
This is Mr Christie,
I'm no longer at 431 -5997.

419
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:15,853
I'll be at... What time did that come in?

420
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:22,689
Sharon did a movie.

421
00:27:22,736 --> 00:27:25,310
- Underground.
- Stag film?

422
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:29,148
Underground, you know, arty, 16mm.

423
00:27:29,201 --> 00:27:33,613
- Allan is interested in cinema.
- Really? What do you do?

424
00:27:33,663 --> 00:27:37,412
I'm a writer. Nothing much.
Film Weekly.

425
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:39,535
Articles, essays, criticisms.

426
00:27:39,586 --> 00:27:44,497
This film I did got very good reviews.
I got singled out.

427
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:47,419
Course, I was the only girl in it
with nine men.

428
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:50,042
What's it called? Maybe I saw it.

429
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:52,800
Gang Bang.

430
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:57,309
These films have the raunchiest titles.
Really, it wasn't sexy.

431
00:27:57,353 --> 00:28:01,184
You were all out of bourbon
so I made it straight water.

432
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:04,731
It's so humid out,
I think it's going to rain.

433
00:28:04,776 --> 00:28:08,940
Maybe that's why I have a headache.
I get terrible sinus attacks.

434
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:11,990
You should have them drained.

435
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:14,607
That's why it's silly to go the Pier.

436
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:17,745
Could you turn the music down
a little bit?

437
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:19,865
Of course.

438
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:24,252
Why go to an outdoor restaurant
in the rain?

439
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:28,293
- We used to go walking in the rain.
- I love the rain.

440
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:32,124
It washes memories
off the sidewalk of life.

441
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:42,934
Gee, Allan,
you really have the delicate touch.

442
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,440
He's a trifle tense,
he had some misfortune with his wife.

443
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:50,568
- His wife?
- His ex-wife. She's gone.

444
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:52,651
- She's dead.
- How awful.

445
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,939
She's not really dead.

446
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:58,324
Technically not dead,
but we're not dating.

447
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:02,236
- She left him.
- I'm sorry.

448
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:24,591
- Is he on anything?
- He's been under some strain lately.

449
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:32,267
This is Mr Christie,
I'm at The Hong Fat Noodle Company.

450
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:36,980
That's 824-7996.

451
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:39,569
Yeah, right. OK. Bye-bye.

452
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:46,199
What's interesting is when they eat
rice with chopsticks authentically,

453
00:29:46,248 --> 00:29:50,957
they bring it up to their mouths
in a shovelling move with your arm.

454
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:00,252
What's the matter?

455
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:03,672
Would you excuse me a second?
I'll be right back.

456
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:09,936
- She likes me.
- What?

457
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:13,846
I can read women.
She wants me to come on with her.

458
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,149
She digs me.
She's playing it very coolly.

459
00:30:17,194 --> 00:30:19,946
I'm going to come on with her later.

460
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:27,245
- Good night and thanks for dinner.
- It's only ten o'clock.

461
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:30,122
I have a headache
and I have to get up early.

462
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:32,656
- I'll walk you upstairs.
- It's OK.

463
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:35,378
This city's a jungle, I better go.

464
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,955
If I'm not down in an hour,
sublet my apartment.

465
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:45,670
You know any other girls?

466
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:48,473
I don't know if any of them
are his type.

467
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:51,054
Most of the girls I know are normal.

468
00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:53,178
He's just over-anxious.

469
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:56,763
As soon as she came over
he went into his act.

470
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:02,692
Well, night.

471
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:06,272
You know, Sharon,
a dame like you and a guy like...

472
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,700
How'd it go with Sharon?

473
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,790
Really?

474
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,169
I keep striking out with women
and you keep laughing.

475
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:24,464
Everybody's insecure, Allan,
not just you.

476
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,584
No, you're wrong, Dick is.

477
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,258
Me? Are you kidding? Ask my analyst.

478
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:34,434
- How many times a week do you go?
- Three, but one is group.

479
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:37,347
Anyone in your group
who'd be good for me?

480
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:41,808
Emotionally disturbed women are
interesting. A pervert or something.

481
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,980
Jennifer? What do mean "crazy"?

482
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,106
It'll strictly be sex.

483
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,529
She's too weird for a relationship.

484
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,652
I don't mind just sex.

485
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,988
I'd prefer a girl
that doesn't get hung up on me.

486
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,530
I definitely think we should try it.

487
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,795
I really appreciate this.
I know it must be a drag for you.

488
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,411
You know who's not insecure?
Bogart.

489
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:09,916
That's not real life.
You set too high a standard.

490
00:32:09,968 --> 00:32:13,384
If you're gonna identify,
who am I gonna pick? My rabbi?

491
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,262
- Bogart's a perfect image.
- You don't need to, you're you.

492
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:20,144
I know that you can't believe that.

493
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:22,428
Anyway, onward to Jennifer.

494
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:59,675
Allan, I won't deny it.
I'm a nymphomaniac.

495
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:04,433
I discovered sex very early.
I slept with everybody.

496
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:07,764
My schoolteacher,
my sister's husband,

497
00:33:07,815 --> 00:33:11,019
the string section
of the New York Philharmonic.

498
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:14,403
I want to have sex all the time,
play all the time

499
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:18,030
otherwise you're just down,
and why be down?

500
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:20,993
The best way to get up is sex.

501
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:23,739
I'm not like my sisters.

502
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:27,490
They're so inhibited,
they never want to do anything.

503
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:30,995
I believe in having sex
as often, as freely

504
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:33,882
and as intensely as possible.

505
00:33:36,385 --> 00:33:38,757
What do you take me for?

506
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:43,671
How did I misread those signs?

507
00:33:45,352 --> 00:33:47,843
This stuff just knocks me out.

508
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:51,514
We're in a room that has some
of the highest achievements

509
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:55,434
- of Western civilisation.
- There's no girls.

510
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:58,396
Look at the Rouault. Look.

511
00:33:59,782 --> 00:34:01,858
It's pretty.

512
00:34:03,244 --> 00:34:06,779
If you could have any painting,
what would you pick?

513
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:09,238
- A van Gogh. Any van Gogh.
- Me too.

514
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:14,037
I feel a mystical attraction
for van Gogh. Why is that?

515
00:34:14,088 --> 00:34:18,132
I don't know. I just know
he cut off his ear for a girl he loved.

516
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:21,045
That's the kind of thing
you'd do for a girl.

517
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:23,420
I'd have to like her a lot.

518
00:34:23,472 --> 00:34:26,556
I wonder if Dick
would cut his ear off for me?

519
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,803
I don't think you should ask him.
He's very busy.

520
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:33,138
It must be fantastic
to be loved so intensely.

521
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:38,685
Why don't we split and see if there's
any action at the Berkeley Museum?

522
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:40,943
There's one.

523
00:34:41,948 --> 00:34:45,316
- She's great.
- Go ahead, speak to her.

524
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:48,321
- No, are you kidding?
- Go on.

525
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,446
Go on, give it a try.

526
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:53,332
That's what we're here for. Go on.

527
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,534
Casual.

528
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,172
It's a lovely Jackson Pollock.

529
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:06,295
Yes, it is.

530
00:35:07,514 --> 00:35:09,672
What does it say to you?

531
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:13,425
It restates the negativeness
of the universe.

532
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:18,934
The hideous, lonely emptiness
of existence. Nothingness.

533
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:24,108
The predicament of man forced to live
in a barren, godless eternity

534
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:28,318
Iike a tiny flame
flickering in an immense void

535
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:32,530
with nothing but waste,
horror and degradation

536
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:37,574
forming a useless straightjacket
in a black absurd cosmos.

537
00:35:38,668 --> 00:35:43,045
- What are you doing Saturday?
- Committing suicide.

538
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:45,212
What about Friday night?

539
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:55,139
If they're beautiful, they're crazy.
Beauty drives a woman crazy.

540
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:57,260
What's he ranting about?

541
00:35:57,311 --> 00:36:00,146
Why am I going to the beach?
I hate the beach.

542
00:36:00,189 --> 00:36:02,478
I don't like swimming or the sun.

543
00:36:02,524 --> 00:36:05,940
I'm red-headed, fair-skinned.
I don't tan, I stroke.

544
00:36:05,986 --> 00:36:09,106
A lot of good women go to the beach
at weekends.

545
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:11,444
Secretaries, receptionists.

546
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:14,409
I want a really, really, great woman.

547
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:17,656
Well, Madame Curie's dead,
who else is there?

548
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:20,031
I thought you were too busy
to go away.

549
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:23,617
A few guys from the office are going,
I've got a few meetings.

550
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,207
Do you think we'll get to see you?

551
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:29,541
- I got you pencilled in for dinner.
- Very funny.

552
00:36:29,592 --> 00:36:32,628
- Are there spiders at the beach?
- Come on!

553
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:37,340
Anything with more than two legs
that walks across my chest kills me.

554
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:41,091
- We got to find him a broad.
- That's for sure!

555
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:44,810
- I'm carsick.
- Come on, Allan!

556
00:36:44,856 --> 00:36:47,063
We're gonna drop you in the bay.

557
00:36:48,026 --> 00:36:53,020
This is Mr Christie,
I'm longer at 731 -071 1.

558
00:36:53,073 --> 00:36:58,529
I'll be at 885-0714.
That's good for the whole weekend.

559
00:36:58,578 --> 00:37:02,029
- What a terrific beach house.
- Glad you like it.

560
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:04,655
Let's burn it down for the insurance.

561
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:09,620
There's a single bed in here!
What happens if I get lucky?

562
00:37:09,672 --> 00:37:11,795
You make love on the beach.

563
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:13,880
On the beach?

564
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:18,173
I'll be making love in the sand and
the tide will come in and carry me off.

565
00:37:18,222 --> 00:37:20,843
I'll score and drown at the same time.

566
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,849
Look at that, that is pretty.
Look out there.

567
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:30,765
That's really beautiful.
The fog's gonna creep in.

568
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,857
Look, you can see the seagulls
flying over the cesspool.

569
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:46,455
This is fun. I haven't been
to a place like this in a long time.

570
00:37:46,499 --> 00:37:50,199
I'm getting a heart attack,
I can't believe that girl.

571
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,373
I'm at 392-8098.

572
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:15,147
She's a doll. I'd sell my mother
to the Arabs for her.

573
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:17,730
Why don't you ask her to dance?

574
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:19,854
I can't. I don't know her.

575
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:28,492
I can't stay long. I've gotta get up early
to play tennis with the guys.

576
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,412
You wanna dance?

577
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:34,289
We can't do those dances,
you have to be under 16 to look good.

578
00:38:34,336 --> 00:38:38,250
I love you, miss, whoever you are.
I want to have your child.

579
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:41,667
- All right, get up and do it.
- No, I can't dance.

580
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:45,585
I'm scared. I had measles as a child,
my body won't function.

581
00:38:45,638 --> 00:38:47,714
Come on, go.

582
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:55,262
Now, start dancing. You ready?
Keep count. And it's one, two...

583
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:57,686
One, two.

584
00:38:57,733 --> 00:39:00,485
Right. Go ahead, say something to her.

585
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:05,273
One, two...

586
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:12,236
Try something more meaningful.

587
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:16,958
Three, four...

588
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:24,459
Speak to her.

589
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:30,673
Are you interested in dancing?

590
00:39:30,724 --> 00:39:32,800
Get lost, creep.

591
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,056
- What did she say?
- She'd rather not.

592
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:53,743
Even if we buy two more lots,
we'll have to wait.

593
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:57,619
- It's cheaper to hold on to them.
- The price will move.

594
00:39:57,666 --> 00:40:01,830
It'll require using
our current holdings as collateral.

595
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:04,796
You've got a lot going for you.

596
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,548
You're bright, funny and you're
romantic, if you'd only believe it.

597
00:40:09,594 --> 00:40:12,630
Why put on a mask
every time you meet a girl?

598
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:16,180
Will we be able to build?
Even in the new tax year?

599
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:19,096
Why build if the interest rate
might go down?

600
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:21,221
I keep telling you,

601
00:40:21,272 --> 00:40:24,059
be yourself
and a girl will fall in love with you.

602
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:27,441
You've been great,
spending your time with me.

603
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:32,193
- I'll tell you the truth, I'm having a ball.
- Are you?

604
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:36,238
It'll make a big difference.
If you're gonna pay $600 a lot...

605
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:38,279
It's a great opportunity.

606
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,200
You may have half a per cent
more interest rate.

607
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:45,916
I got you a present
cos I know it's your birthday.

608
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:48,038
How'd you know?

609
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:50,794
You mentioned the date
and I remembered it.

610
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:54,341
It's the same date
my mother had her hysterectomy.

611
00:40:58,516 --> 00:41:02,216
It's lovely. It's beautiful.

612
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:04,143
A plastic skunk.

613
00:41:04,188 --> 00:41:08,565
It's so cute and I heard you say skunks
are your favourite animals.

614
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:12,186
I'm so touched.

615
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,396
- You like it?
- I love it.

616
00:41:14,448 --> 00:41:17,402
It doesn't do anything,
it's just a skunk.

617
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:20,286
She liked your present
better than mine.

618
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:23,744
She's usually so excited
when I get her something

619
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,328
but all she could talk about
was her skunk.

620
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:28,534
It's your imagination.

621
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,958
I don't know. She's moody lately.

622
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:33,543
- Cos you neglect her.
- I know.

623
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,794
- Did she say something?
- She doesn't have to.

624
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:40,592
I see the two of you together.
Plus she said something.

625
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:43,213
It's nothing we haven't been through.

626
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,184
She's very insecure,
she needs attention.

627
00:41:46,228 --> 00:41:50,308
What's she insecure about?
She knows I'm crazy about her.

628
00:41:50,357 --> 00:41:53,856
Why, because I'm too busy now
to always dote on her?

629
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:56,310
Linda's used to being fussed over.

630
00:41:56,363 --> 00:41:59,862
She's always been pretty,
high marks in college.

631
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:04,285
I sometimes think she married me
because I didn't fawn over her.

632
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:06,701
But you must admit you're driven.

633
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:10,081
Do you know what's happening
in the stock market?

634
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:12,961
- Where are we going?
- There she is.

635
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:17,464
She works in my office.
She just broke up with her boyfriend.

636
00:42:17,508 --> 00:42:20,959
- There's too many people at the table.
- Come on!

637
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:23,383
I don't want to. We'll do it later.

638
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,135
- What shall I say?
- Ask her to dinner.

639
00:42:26,183 --> 00:42:29,100
I can't.
Why can't you and Linda come...

640
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:31,220
Cos I have to work late.

641
00:42:31,271 --> 00:42:33,560
Julie, this is Allan Felix.

642
00:42:33,607 --> 00:42:36,358
Would you like to go to dinner tonight?

643
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:40,398
- That's right to the point.
- That was pretty fast!

644
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:43,647
Forgive me, I'm...

645
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:45,526
It needed tossing anyhow.

646
00:42:51,082 --> 00:42:54,285
Let's go in there and get stoned
and watch the freaks.

647
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,668
You sure you don't want to go
to the movies?

648
00:42:57,713 --> 00:42:59,789
Come on!

649
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,887
- You wanna dance?
- No, thanks.

650
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,063
I didn't ask you, I asked her.

651
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:22,682
I don't wanna dance either.

652
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:28,405
- What the hell is this?
- 7 Up.

653
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,858
I'm on the wagon, doctor's orders.

654
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:34,245
My hand shakes.
It's like battle fatigue...

655
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,532
He kills me.

656
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:39,956
What's your name, honey?

657
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:45,252
- It's a nice name.
- Must get her back to the orphanage.

658
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,882
I take her out once a year to the zoo
and the circus. Excuse me.

659
00:43:48,928 --> 00:43:52,593
- Sit down.
- I'd love to stay but I gotta be up early.

660
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,724
Going to a temple,
it's my people's Sabbath.

661
00:43:58,813 --> 00:44:02,098
- Come here.
- Chris is coming over, is he?

662
00:44:02,149 --> 00:44:05,269
I want you to meet
this good-looking broad.

663
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:07,395
Thanks for inviting us over.

664
00:44:07,446 --> 00:44:10,530
- Just get right in here.
- I love parties.

665
00:44:10,574 --> 00:44:13,824
You'd look real good
on the back of my chopper.

666
00:44:14,828 --> 00:44:19,039
Have you fellas seen the new
production of The Trojan Women?

667
00:44:21,835 --> 00:44:23,874
What are you doing?

668
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,996
Financial reports.

669
00:44:26,047 --> 00:44:28,123
Which are not fun.

670
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:32,046
Have you seen Allan around lately?

671
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:36,553
Oh, he was here before.
He's out tonight.

672
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:41,178
- On a date?
- Yes, I fixed him up.

673
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:43,221
You did?

674
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,390
Who with?

675
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:48,564
One of the girls at the office.

676
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,729
Which one?

677
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:56,315
- Which one is she? Do I know her?
- Very sexy.

678
00:44:56,368 --> 00:44:59,487
And bright.
I think they'll like each other.

679
00:44:59,537 --> 00:45:02,372
Is Julie the blonde one with big eyes?

680
00:45:02,415 --> 00:45:04,704
Blonde, big eyes, very earthy,

681
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:07,206
wears those see-through blouses.

682
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:09,329
Every guy in the office likes her.

683
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,623
You think she's right for Allan?

684
00:45:12,426 --> 00:45:15,426
Cos to me,
she doesn't seem like the type.

685
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:18,804
- He liked her.
- Really?

686
00:45:20,558 --> 00:45:22,681
How do you know?

687
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:24,803
I could feel it.

688
00:45:24,854 --> 00:45:28,686
- Did he say anything?
- Hey, I'm trying to work.

689
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:30,809
OK, I'm sorry.

690
00:45:34,238 --> 00:45:38,651
- Those guys are following us.
- Don't worry, I'm a fast runner.

691
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:42,615
- Where're you going with that chick?
- Don't look back.

692
00:45:42,663 --> 00:45:46,032
- I'm scared.
- I'll go into my fake limp.

693
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:48,455
Let's all go on a little party.

694
00:45:48,502 --> 00:45:50,743
Fellas, I'm a veteran.

695
00:45:50,795 --> 00:45:54,129
Get rid of this creep
and I'll take you for a ride.

696
00:45:54,174 --> 00:45:57,128
Take your hands off her!
Did I say that?

697
00:45:57,177 --> 00:45:59,798
All right, shorty, let's go...

698
00:46:01,097 --> 00:46:05,759
- Your tattoo's coming off on my neck.
- I'm gonna start screaming!

699
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:08,265
Don't worry, I can handle this.

700
00:46:12,483 --> 00:46:14,641
Start screaming.

701
00:46:25,203 --> 00:46:28,204
- Allan, is that you?
- Yes.

702
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:31,414
- How'd it go?
- I got into a fight.

703
00:46:33,336 --> 00:46:35,827
What? You got into a fight? With who?

704
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,127
Some guys got tough with Julie.
I had to teach them a lesson.

705
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:42,465
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

706
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:47,588
I snapped my chin onto a guy's fist
and hit one in the knee with my nose.

707
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:51,969
- Where's Julie?
- She ran off with the leader.

708
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,599
They're getting married. It never
would have worked between us.

709
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:01,312
She's Protestant, I'm Catholic,
it's a great religious abyss.

710
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:06,357
- Who were these guys?
- They said they were hairdressers.

711
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:09,908
- Hard to believe.
- You want us to call a doctor?

712
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:13,288
No, I'm fine.
I could use a three-foot Band-Aid

713
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:15,823
until the pain subsides.

714
00:47:15,877 --> 00:47:20,455
She's laughing and my sex life
is turning into the Petrified Forest.

715
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,749
Very funny.

716
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:45,234
Ten million women in the country
and I can't wind up with one.

717
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:50,235
Come on,
you had some laughs with Linda.

718
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:54,364
There's no pressure with Linda,
I'm not trying to make her.

719
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,616
I'm sure if I met her on a date,
we'd have no fun.

720
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,916
The girls I try and score with
I can't get to first base.

721
00:48:28,988 --> 00:48:32,855
I'm turning into the strike-out king
of San Francisco.

722
00:48:32,908 --> 00:48:37,950
What do you expect? I always said
you were not the romantic type.

723
00:48:37,996 --> 00:48:40,369
What's the matter with me, Nancy?

724
00:48:40,415 --> 00:48:44,365
You're a dreamer, you're awkward,
you're clumsy.

725
00:48:44,419 --> 00:48:48,631
They can see how desperate you are.
You've said it yourself.

726
00:48:48,673 --> 00:48:52,753
Don't go by that girl tonight.
I was toying with her.

727
00:48:52,802 --> 00:48:56,966
Face it, you may be very sweet
but you're not sexy.

728
00:48:57,015 --> 00:49:00,846
Don't be so sure. You never said that
when we were married.

729
00:49:01,602 --> 00:49:03,559
I was thinking it.

730
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:07,644
I bet she was.

731
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:11,855
I wonder if she actually had an orgasm
while we were married

732
00:49:11,904 --> 00:49:14,311
or did she fake it that night?

733
00:49:17,242 --> 00:49:19,318
Is this the Perry residence?

734
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:22,571
Can I speak to Marilyn?

735
00:49:24,374 --> 00:49:27,079
An old friend of hers, I dated her once.

736
00:49:28,086 --> 00:49:30,162
Do you remember?

737
00:49:30,213 --> 00:49:32,786
I'm stunned! It was 1 1 years ago.

738
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,218
That's right.
Short with red hair and glasses.

739
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:39,550
No, that's cleared up.

740
00:49:41,932 --> 00:49:44,470
How can I get in touch with her?

741
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:47,684
Really?

742
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,888
She still feels that way?

743
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:52,975
It's been 1 1 years.

744
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:56,774
When did you last speak with her?

745
00:49:59,324 --> 00:50:01,400
Last week.

746
00:50:01,451 --> 00:50:05,912
And she specified that she didn't
want you to give me the number?

747
00:50:06,998 --> 00:50:08,872
I see.

748
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:10,992
OK, thank you.

749
00:50:17,216 --> 00:50:20,501
Excuse me,
could you tell me where Mr Felix is?

750
00:50:20,553 --> 00:50:23,886
- Right through that door.
- Thank you.

751
00:50:29,186 --> 00:50:32,021
- Are you busy?
- What are you doing here?

752
00:50:32,064 --> 00:50:34,601
- I don't feel so hot.
- What's wrong?

753
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:37,354
What do you have
for an anxiety attack?

754
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:39,975
Everything, I'm a drugstore.

755
00:50:40,029 --> 00:50:42,567
I have this throbbing in my stomach.

756
00:50:42,615 --> 00:50:45,153
How do know it's anxiety and not fear?

757
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:48,321
- My stomach's jumpy.
- Is it hard to breathe?

758
00:50:48,371 --> 00:50:50,909
I feel frightened and I don't know why.

759
00:50:50,957 --> 00:50:53,661
- I get that.
- Is it fear or anxiety?

760
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:56,034
Homosexual panic.

761
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:59,835
I always get this way
when Dick goes on a business trip.

762
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:01,839
He had to fly to Cleveland.

763
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:04,172
I got up, drove him to the airport

764
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:06,757
and threw up
in the United Airlines terminal.

765
00:51:06,805 --> 00:51:08,679
I've thrown up there.

766
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:11,298
I don't know what it is that upsets me.

767
00:51:11,352 --> 00:51:15,136
Fear of separation.
I had to go to Washington once,

768
00:51:15,189 --> 00:51:17,514
and although I was leaving, I got sick

769
00:51:17,566 --> 00:51:19,773
and when I returned,
my wife threw up.

770
00:51:19,818 --> 00:51:23,946
My analyst would say I'm feeling guilty
because I want him to go.

771
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:25,863
I can't understand you.

772
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:29,158
You're a knockout,
why are you a mass of symptoms?

773
00:51:29,202 --> 00:51:31,278
Why is anybody screwed up?

774
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:34,081
I guess it happens
when you're a child.

775
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:38,453
You think you're ugly, your parents
divorce, you feel abandoned.

776
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:40,579
You must have the same thing.

777
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,963
My parents never got divorced,
although I begged them to.

778
00:51:44,008 --> 00:51:48,421
I know you think I'm nice,
I appreciate it. It's good for my ego.

779
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:50,677
And I'm hypercritical.

780
00:51:50,723 --> 00:51:54,174
I have a tendency to reject
before I get rejected.

781
00:51:54,226 --> 00:51:56,384
That way I save time and money.

782
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:03,515
- No date tonight?
- I had a date but she called it off.

783
00:52:03,568 --> 00:52:05,644
Some kind of Polish holiday.

784
00:52:06,613 --> 00:52:09,733
Why don't we go out to dinner
and hit a movie?

785
00:52:09,783 --> 00:52:12,570
I have a better idea.
Have dinner at my house.

786
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:14,907
The Big Sleep's on tonight.

787
00:52:14,954 --> 00:52:17,576
Do you have anything for me to cook?

788
00:52:17,623 --> 00:52:20,494
Frozen steaks
and a bottle of champagne.

789
00:52:20,543 --> 00:52:22,950
What are you doing with champagne?

790
00:52:23,004 --> 00:52:27,416
I tried to cook to impress a girl.
Beef stroganoff in the pressure cooker.

791
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:30,586
- How was it?
- I don't know. It's still on the wall.

792
00:52:30,636 --> 00:52:34,254
- I'll buy some stuff and bring it over.
- Fabulous.

793
00:52:34,306 --> 00:52:37,390
I'll get some asparagus,
salad and dessert.

794
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:41,562
I love to cook but I never get a chance.
Dick's always so busy.

795
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:43,728
Get a whole lot of stuff.

796
00:52:43,773 --> 00:52:47,023
You can open the champagne
but not just for me.

797
00:52:47,068 --> 00:52:51,397
I'll have one with you but you
have to put me to bed if I dance naked.

798
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:59,991
This is gonna be great.
I've got a terrific rapport with Linda.

799
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:02,115
I hate to see her depressed.

800
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:07,326
It's gonna be a nice, cosy evening in.
Build a little fire.

801
00:53:07,379 --> 00:53:10,582
I'll get some candles,
set up some atmosphere.

802
00:53:10,632 --> 00:53:12,506
Open the champagne.

803
00:53:12,551 --> 00:53:16,383
Women are suckers for champagne,
it makes them crazy.

804
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:20,593
It makes them crazy?
What the hell am I talking about here?

805
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:22,718
This is Linda, Dick's wife.

806
00:53:23,645 --> 00:53:26,218
So, you finally fell in love with her?

807
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:31,100
- I just got carried away for a minute.
- You don't have to feel guilty.

808
00:53:31,152 --> 00:53:36,394
Over what? Two lonely people with
lots in common have dinner together.

809
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:40,861
- We're platonic friends.
- That's not how she thinks of you.

810
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:44,031
- How can you tell?
- Does she have to attack you?

811
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:47,284
Don't get those candles,
they're for a Jewish holiday!

812
00:53:47,334 --> 00:53:52,209
- She's my friend's wife.
- She'll tell Dick and he'll beat you up.

813
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,256
- She loves you, not him.
- He's not romantic.

814
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,672
- He could be.
- Don't listen to him.

815
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:01,004
- Don't listen to her.
- We're in a supermarket.

816
00:54:02,223 --> 00:54:05,307
Get a grip on yourself, she's married.

817
00:54:05,351 --> 00:54:08,138
And to your best friend.

818
00:54:08,187 --> 00:54:11,307
They're never gonna
get a divorce either.

819
00:54:11,357 --> 00:54:13,848
Why can't I ever get a break?

820
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:16,226
I'd like you to do me a favour.

821
00:54:16,278 --> 00:54:20,323
I've fallen in love with another woman,
it just happened.

822
00:54:20,365 --> 00:54:23,615
We're going to live in Alaska,
she's an Eskimo.

823
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:28,405
I thought perhaps while I'm gone,
you'd look after Linda.

824
00:54:28,457 --> 00:54:31,872
- Of course.
- Well, I'm off to Alaska.

825
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:35,204
If you need me,
I'll be at Frozen Tundra 69290.

826
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:49,224
I'm so tense.
I don't know what's wrong.

827
00:54:50,311 --> 00:54:52,552
She'll be here any second.

828
00:54:52,605 --> 00:54:55,522
She is always complimenting me.

829
00:54:55,566 --> 00:55:00,227
I know she likes me
but does she like me that way?

830
00:55:01,738 --> 00:55:04,027
What the hell? I could test her.

831
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:06,948
I could make an advance.

832
00:55:06,993 --> 00:55:09,318
What could possibly go wrong?

833
00:55:10,413 --> 00:55:12,489
- Don't!
- It was meant to be.

834
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:15,078
Take your hands off me.
Are you crazy?

835
00:55:15,126 --> 00:55:19,289
- Linda, my love.
- I'm a married woman. Rape!

836
00:55:19,338 --> 00:55:21,627
Let's not get carried away.

837
00:55:21,674 --> 00:55:23,750
I'm not an appealing guy.

838
00:55:24,802 --> 00:55:27,719
The thought that
Linda could fall for me,

839
00:55:27,763 --> 00:55:30,052
I'm kidding myself.

840
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:32,672
Where the hell is she anyhow?

841
00:55:32,726 --> 00:55:36,676
By now she could have had her steak
and been out of here.

842
00:55:41,943 --> 00:55:46,272
I feel so light, that lithium
I took today is really working.

843
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:49,608
Maybe you'd better not
have any champagne.

844
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:53,870
No, if I get carried away,
you can always call the police.

845
00:55:53,913 --> 00:55:57,329
- How long is Dick away for?
- He's back tomorrow.

846
00:55:57,375 --> 00:56:00,541
There's a new Truffaut film,
we should go see it.

847
00:56:00,586 --> 00:56:02,744
Come on, we're all set for here.

848
00:56:02,796 --> 00:56:07,838
Besides, it's starting to rain
and that great lda Lupino movie's on.

849
00:56:07,885 --> 00:56:12,760
She's married but gets involved
with her husband's best friend.

850
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:15,723
- How does it end?
- She kills the men.

851
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:19,634
- Let's go out.
- No, I really want to see the movie.

852
00:56:19,688 --> 00:56:25,192
It's a fascinating theme. Do you think it
is possible to love two people at once?

853
00:56:25,234 --> 00:56:28,354
- What do you mean?
- A wife, happily married,

854
00:56:28,404 --> 00:56:31,109
suddenly finds she loves another man.

855
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:35,984
Not that she doesn't love her husband
just that she loves somebody else.

856
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:38,112
Do you think that's possible?

857
00:56:38,163 --> 00:56:40,239
- Do you?
- Very.

858
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:43,244
Very possible
and probably very common.

859
00:56:43,293 --> 00:56:45,701
Love is such a strange phenomenon.

860
00:56:45,754 --> 00:56:47,877
Strange and exquisite.

861
00:56:48,423 --> 00:56:51,424
- Go ahead, make your move.
- No, I can't.

862
00:56:51,468 --> 00:56:53,959
- Take her and kiss her.
- Is anything wrong?

863
00:56:54,012 --> 00:56:57,962
She wants it. Hurry,
before she moves out of position.

864
00:56:58,016 --> 00:57:00,803
- Kiss her, kid.
- I'll do the potatoes.

865
00:57:02,437 --> 00:57:05,224
Well, kid, you blew it.

866
00:57:06,315 --> 00:57:08,391
I can't do it.

867
00:57:08,442 --> 00:57:13,070
How's it look? I invite her over
and come on like a sex degenerate.

868
00:57:13,114 --> 00:57:17,194
You're getting carried away.
You think too much, just do it.

869
00:57:17,243 --> 00:57:19,319
We're platonic friends.

870
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:22,988
I can't spoil that by coming on.
She'll slap my face.

871
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:25,282
I've had my face slapped plenty.

872
00:57:25,334 --> 00:57:27,872
But your glasses
don't go flying across the room.

873
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,960
- You're gonna disappoint her.
- I can't.

874
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:34,920
Here we are, you can start on this.

875
00:57:35,636 --> 00:57:39,135
Did you read that another
Oakland woman was raped?

876
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:41,968
I was nowhere near Oakland!

877
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:47,223
- Do they know who did it?
- No idea. He must be very clever.

878
00:57:47,272 --> 00:57:51,056
You must be on the ball to rape
so many women and get away with it.

879
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:55,438
If anybody tried to rape me,
I'd just pretend to go along with it

880
00:57:55,488 --> 00:57:58,774
and then grab a heavy object
and let him have it.

881
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,198
That is unless I was enjoying it.

882
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,578
They say it's every woman's
secret desire.

883
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:11,710
I guess it depends on
who's doing the raping.

884
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:16,835
Why dwell on morbid subjects?
Odds are you'll never get raped.

885
00:58:16,884 --> 00:58:18,960
Not with my luck.

886
00:58:21,054 --> 00:58:23,260
I feel so light.

887
00:58:23,306 --> 00:58:27,090
That drink is going right to my head.
I'm floating.

888
00:58:27,143 --> 00:58:29,515
- Go ahead, kiss her.
- I can't.

889
00:58:29,562 --> 00:58:32,018
- She's ready.
- How can you be sure?

890
00:58:32,065 --> 00:58:35,065
- Believe me, I'm sure.
- She'll pull back.

891
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:38,560
She's sitting and waiting.
Now, don't screw up.

892
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:42,938
Right, I'll try but I'm gonna go slow.

893
00:58:42,992 --> 00:58:46,158
If she screams,
I'll pretend it was a joke.

894
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:48,279
She'd better laugh.

895
00:58:50,457 --> 00:58:52,533
The phone!

896
00:58:56,671 --> 00:58:58,545
Yes, she's here.

897
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:02,504
She came over before.
I was going out, I had a Polish date.

898
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:05,469
It's for you, it's from Cleveland.

899
00:59:05,513 --> 00:59:07,921
- Are you upset?
- The ring startled me.

900
00:59:07,974 --> 00:59:11,307
I want her out, I'm gonna cause
an international incident!

901
00:59:11,352 --> 00:59:15,101
- Hello, darling.
- She loves him. I'm kidding myself.

902
00:59:15,147 --> 00:59:19,774
Relax. You're as nervous as Elizabeth
Scott was before I blew her brains out.

903
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:22,772
All you got to do is make your move.

904
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:26,866
This is crazy. We'll all wind up
in The National Enquirer.

905
00:59:26,909 --> 00:59:29,115
OK, goodbye.

906
00:59:29,161 --> 00:59:31,118
Yes, I will.

907
00:59:32,122 --> 00:59:36,618
Dick sounded down. I think
he's having trouble in Cleveland.

908
00:59:36,668 --> 00:59:39,871
How come he never takes you
with him on these trips?

909
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:43,705
I'm afraid to fly.
My analyst says it's an excuse.

910
00:59:43,758 --> 00:59:46,000
He never asks me along, though.

911
00:59:46,052 --> 00:59:49,088
Maybe he's got something
going on the side.

912
00:59:49,138 --> 00:59:53,005
- Would that bother you?
- Sure. But not if I didn't know.

913
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:58,053
I know it'd hurt Dick if you ever
had a casual affair with anyone.

914
00:59:58,105 --> 01:00:01,390
I don't think I could
have a casual affair.

915
01:00:01,442 --> 01:00:04,146
No, I don't take those things lightly.

916
01:00:04,194 --> 01:00:08,239
If I fell for another man,
it'd have to be more than just a fling.

917
01:00:08,281 --> 01:00:11,899
I'd have feel something more serious.
Are you shaking?

918
01:00:11,952 --> 01:00:13,825
Just chilly.

919
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:16,361
It's not very cold.

920
01:00:16,414 --> 01:00:19,415
Anyway, I'm not the type for an affair.

921
01:00:19,459 --> 01:00:21,950
I couldn't take the excitement.

922
01:00:22,003 --> 01:00:24,410
Besides, I'm not glamorous enough.

923
01:00:24,464 --> 01:00:26,705
You're uncommonly beautiful.

924
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:30,173
When I go out with you
and all those beautiful girls,

925
01:00:30,219 --> 01:00:32,425
I feel like life has passed me by.

926
01:00:32,471 --> 01:00:35,092
I should be selling chocolate
at Fannie Farmer.

927
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,631
Those girls are not in your league.

928
01:00:37,684 --> 01:00:42,726
Keep talking, you're saving my life.
I have such an inferiority complex.

929
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:45,809
You're doing very well.
Now kiss her.

930
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:48,860
- Please!
- You built up to it beautifully.

931
01:00:48,903 --> 01:00:52,568
- I don't have the nerve.
- Tell her she's beautiful.

932
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,700
- I just told her.
- Again.

933
01:00:55,743 --> 01:00:59,077
You really are
an unusually beautiful person.

934
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:03,617
- I don't know what to say...
- You're exceptionally beautiful.

935
01:01:03,668 --> 01:01:06,752
You're uncommonly beautiful,
unusually beautiful...

936
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,954
All right!

937
01:01:09,006 --> 01:01:11,923
It's been so long since
anybody said that.

938
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:14,884
- Move closer to her.
- How close?

939
01:01:14,928 --> 01:01:17,004
The length of your lips.

940
01:01:17,055 --> 01:01:20,424
- That's very close.
- Come on, move.

941
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,314
Now what?

942
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:34,234
Tell her that she moves something
in you that you can't control.

943
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,569
- You're kidding!
- Go ahead.

944
01:01:36,616 --> 01:01:38,822
- It's corny.
- She'll love it.

945
01:01:38,868 --> 01:01:41,572
Fred Astaire looks great in tails, I don't.

946
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,574
Leave Fred Astaire out of this
and say something.

947
01:01:44,623 --> 01:01:47,743
- I've loved our time together.
- So have l.

948
01:01:47,793 --> 01:01:50,462
All right? I don't want to use your line.

949
01:01:50,504 --> 01:01:52,746
You're doing fine, kid.

950
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:57,506
Now, tell her she has the most
irresistible eyes you've ever seen.

951
01:01:59,888 --> 01:02:04,016
You have the most eyes
I've ever seen on any person.

952
01:02:04,058 --> 01:02:06,430
- Your...
- Your hand is trembling.

953
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:09,147
- That's because you're near.
- Pardon?

954
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:11,264
Tell her that!

955
01:02:12,817 --> 01:02:15,023
That's because you're near.

956
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:17,774
You really know what to say,
don't you?

957
01:02:17,822 --> 01:02:20,822
Now, tell her
that you've met a lot of dames

958
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:24,282
but she is really something special.

959
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:27,115
- That she won't believe.
- Oh, no?

960
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,496
I have met a lot of dames

961
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:36,162
but you are really something special.

962
01:02:36,214 --> 01:02:37,459
Really?

963
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:39,713
She bought it!

964
01:02:42,845 --> 01:02:47,057
Put your right hand around
her shoulders and pull her close.

965
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:49,222
- I can't.
- Go on!

966
01:02:49,268 --> 01:02:51,344
I'll try.

967
01:02:54,648 --> 01:02:59,643
Now, get ready for the big move
and do exactly as I tell you.

968
01:02:59,695 --> 01:03:03,111
I warned you
to leave my ex-husband alone.

969
01:03:11,248 --> 01:03:13,739
I guess I better fix the steaks.

970
01:03:17,129 --> 01:03:19,205
Your eyes...

971
01:03:20,466 --> 01:03:22,624
are like two thick steaks.

972
01:03:22,676 --> 01:03:24,467
Don't!

973
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:27,547
- I'll pay for the lamp.
- I think I love you.

974
01:03:27,597 --> 01:03:30,005
No, I insist on paying for the lamp.

975
01:03:30,058 --> 01:03:33,972
- Forget the lamp.
- I'm so clumsy. Take $10.

976
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,769
Forget the damn lamp.
Give me $5, we'll call it even.

977
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:40,306
- Don't!
- You're making a mistake.

978
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:45,105
I was joking. I was just testing you.
It was a platonic kiss.

979
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:49,023
- I think I'd better go home.
- You're making a mistake.

980
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:51,911
- I should go.
- If you think I would...

981
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:53,993
Allan, I'll be fine.

982
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,619
I attacked her.
I'm a vicious jungle beast.

983
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:03,501
She's panicky. When she gets home,
she'll be hysterical.

984
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:07,676
What am I gonna tell Dick?
She'll probably go to the police.

985
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:10,922
What did I do?
I'm not Bogart, I never will be.

986
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,929
I'm a disgrace to my sex.

987
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:17,102
I should get a job at an Arabian palace
as a eunuch.

988
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:19,267
That's the vice squad.

989
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,520
Did you say you loved me?

990
01:04:53,721 --> 01:04:55,797
I still can't believe it.

991
01:04:56,849 --> 01:04:59,305
I haven't slept that well in years.

992
01:05:00,853 --> 01:05:03,011
Is it noon yet?

993
01:05:03,063 --> 01:05:05,020
No, it's seven.

994
01:05:05,065 --> 01:05:06,939
Seven?

995
01:05:07,818 --> 01:05:10,107
I didn't realise it was so early.

996
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:15,064
- You were fantastic last night in bed.
- Thanks.

997
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,157
- How do you feel now?
- I think the Pepto-Bismol helped.

998
01:05:21,247 --> 01:05:24,996
What were you thinking about
while we were doing it?

999
01:05:25,043 --> 01:05:26,786
Willie Mays.

1000
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:30,169
You always think of baseball players
when you make love?

1001
01:05:30,214 --> 01:05:32,088
It keeps me going.

1002
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:36,082
I couldn't figure out
why you kept yelling "slide".

1003
01:05:40,265 --> 01:05:43,053
It'll probably be best if you told Dick.

1004
01:05:43,102 --> 01:05:45,177
What'll I say?

1005
01:05:46,271 --> 01:05:50,732
It could happen and it happened.
It's not your fault or my fault.

1006
01:05:50,776 --> 01:05:54,275
You felt like a woman last night
and I felt like a man.

1007
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:57,736
And that's what
those kind of people do.

1008
01:05:57,782 --> 01:06:02,942
But we can't sneak around
and have an affair. It's so cheap.

1009
01:06:02,995 --> 01:06:06,411
You know,
you've got to be honest with him.

1010
01:06:06,457 --> 01:06:10,918
You just have to tell him
the two of you have grown apart

1011
01:06:10,961 --> 01:06:13,333
and you and I have fallen in love.

1012
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,622
- That's if you love me.
- I do.

1013
01:06:15,674 --> 01:06:17,916
Then we have to tell him the truth.

1014
01:06:17,968 --> 01:06:19,842
I'm so tense.

1015
01:06:19,887 --> 01:06:23,255
I can tell him.
I've known him longer than you have.

1016
01:06:23,307 --> 01:06:26,889
- No, I'd prefer to do it.
- Maybe you'd better do it.

1017
01:06:26,935 --> 01:06:28,809
Tell him what?

1018
01:06:28,853 --> 01:06:32,436
Tell him that the two of us
are right for each other

1019
01:06:32,482 --> 01:06:37,523
and that may be he ought to think
about getting his stuff and moving out.

1020
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:40,061
Maybe you move
in with me for a while.

1021
01:06:41,532 --> 01:06:44,486
As long as we handle this
in a mature way.

1022
01:06:44,535 --> 01:06:47,951
As long as I'm mature about it,
you're mature about it,

1023
01:06:47,997 --> 01:06:52,160
both of us are mature,
we can achieve a certain maturation

1024
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:54,451
that guarantees maturiosity.

1025
01:06:54,503 --> 01:06:57,539
You're mature, Allan, and very wise.

1026
01:06:57,589 --> 01:07:00,210
The key to wiseness is maturiositude.

1027
01:07:01,802 --> 01:07:04,719
Why is it always so complicated?

1028
01:07:04,763 --> 01:07:06,839
Lean on me, baby.

1029
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,675
Lean on me.

1030
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:31,610
If you want me,
I'll be home having an anxiety attack.

1031
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,827
Well, kid, she loves you.

1032
01:07:37,878 --> 01:07:42,255
Why not?
I was dynamite in bed last night.

1033
01:07:42,298 --> 01:07:46,296
That lucky girl.
I gave her my best moves.

1034
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:07,774
Excuse me, I want to take a look
at the music box in the window.

1035
01:08:07,823 --> 01:08:11,405
There's a nice, brown,
small music box.

1036
01:08:24,505 --> 01:08:29,297
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, didn't you hear?

1037
01:08:29,343 --> 01:08:33,092
No, I was thinking about some stuff.

1038
01:08:33,139 --> 01:08:36,757
- Still daydreaming. How are you?
- OK. How are you?

1039
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:40,142
I just got back from New York.
I'm gonna move back there.

1040
01:08:40,187 --> 01:08:42,061
Is that so?

1041
01:08:42,105 --> 01:08:44,181
I don't know what to say!

1042
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:46,308
So, what are you doing?

1043
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,275
You know, the usual.
Going to the movies and...

1044
01:08:51,323 --> 01:08:53,564
staring off into space.

1045
01:08:53,616 --> 01:08:55,942
Are you seeing someone?

1046
01:08:58,371 --> 01:09:00,494
I mean, I go out but...

1047
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,698
How are Dick and Linda?

1048
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:06,501
She's fine. Just... I wouldn't know.

1049
01:09:07,588 --> 01:09:10,423
You're in better spirits than when I left.

1050
01:09:10,466 --> 01:09:13,088
I am. You got me on an up-day.

1051
01:09:13,136 --> 01:09:15,627
Is this the music box you wanted?

1052
01:09:16,598 --> 01:09:18,471
It's pretty.

1053
01:09:19,601 --> 01:09:24,227
I need to keep my paperclips
in something so... You know?

1054
01:09:24,272 --> 01:09:27,522
I have an appointment
with the diet doctor.

1055
01:09:27,566 --> 01:09:29,855
You don't seem overweight to me.

1056
01:09:29,902 --> 01:09:32,440
Let's not have that argument again.

1057
01:09:32,488 --> 01:09:34,231
Right.

1058
01:09:35,324 --> 01:09:39,024
- Bye.
- So long. It was nice seeing you.

1059
01:09:39,077 --> 01:09:41,153
Thanks. You, too.

1060
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:46,953
I was real cool.

1061
01:09:47,002 --> 01:09:49,409
Why not? She never understood me.

1062
01:09:49,462 --> 01:09:54,207
I'm complicated.
I think Linda understands that.

1063
01:09:54,259 --> 01:09:56,335
Linda finds me exciting.

1064
01:09:56,386 --> 01:09:58,259
Dick'll understand.

1065
01:09:58,304 --> 01:10:01,673
Because of our social encounters
a romance has developed.

1066
01:10:01,724 --> 01:10:04,725
It's natural
among sophisticated people.

1067
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,980
- You sent for me?
- Yes. Drink? Scotch?

1068
01:10:08,022 --> 01:10:10,892
- Fine.
- Soda? Linda and I are in love.

1069
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:14,227
Just as well. My doctor says
I have two months to live.

1070
01:10:14,278 --> 01:10:17,065
- Good. Then you don't mind?
- Not a bit.

1071
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:21,282
Dick and I have been through
a lot together.

1072
01:10:21,326 --> 01:10:26,367
He's my best friend. This is terrible.
This is gonna hurt him, I know it.

1073
01:10:26,414 --> 01:10:30,412
How could they?
My wife and my best friend.

1074
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,785
I loved her. And I loved him.

1075
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,287
Why didn't I see it coming?

1076
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:39,674
Me, who had the foresight
to by Polaroid at 8.5.

1077
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,756
Dick is an emotional guy.

1078
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:48,970
He's liable to... God knows what?
Kill himself or something.

1079
01:10:49,019 --> 01:10:51,771
Kill himself?
What might he do to you?

1080
01:10:51,813 --> 01:10:55,396
You take a guy's wife,
you humiliate him...

1081
01:10:55,442 --> 01:10:59,902
You've seen enough ltalian movies.
And Dick's got a temper.

1082
01:11:42,445 --> 01:11:44,900
You're supposed to be in Cleveland.

1083
01:11:44,947 --> 01:11:47,699
I had to come home.
I got to talk to you.

1084
01:11:49,952 --> 01:11:52,028
I got a problem.

1085
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:56,163
What do you mean?

1086
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,292
I think Linda's having an affair.

1087
01:12:03,382 --> 01:12:05,955
I called her at home, she's not there.

1088
01:12:06,009 --> 01:12:09,176
Recently, she's been distant,
distracted.

1089
01:12:09,221 --> 01:12:12,387
Little things
only a husband would notice.

1090
01:12:12,432 --> 01:12:17,259
I don't understand it. You've seen her
a lot lately, she's changed.

1091
01:12:17,312 --> 01:12:21,808
The other night she spoke
about having an affair in her sleep.

1092
01:12:21,858 --> 01:12:25,061
- Did she mention any names?
- Only yours.

1093
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:28,859
When I woke her,
she said it was just a nightmare.

1094
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:36,079
I keep trying to think
of who it could be.

1095
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:40,582
It's got to be someone I don't know,
someone she met through work.

1096
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:45,964
An agent or ad executive,
a photographer, maybe an actor.

1097
01:12:46,006 --> 01:12:48,247
- Don't get upset.
- I love her.

1098
01:12:48,299 --> 01:12:50,707
If she leaves me, I'll kill myself.

1099
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,132
Since when are you so emotional?

1100
01:12:53,179 --> 01:12:56,346
I've never been in love with
anyone before.

1101
01:12:56,391 --> 01:12:59,925
If I find out who the
guy is, I'll kill him.

1102
01:12:59,977 --> 01:13:04,141
I've neglected her and
now she's involved with some stud.

1103
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:08,768
If I haven't already lost her,
I'm really gonna make it up to her.

1104
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:11,025
I'm gonna change.

1105
01:13:11,071 --> 01:13:14,487
I'm gonna make her life with me
fun and exciting

1106
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:17,617
cos without her,
it wouldn't be worth living.

1107
01:13:17,661 --> 01:13:22,619
I was up all night thinking,
"I'm losing her. Too bad, I'll survive."

1108
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:25,916
Then I panicked and called her.
She was out.

1109
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,498
Where the hell did she stay?

1110
01:13:28,546 --> 01:13:31,500
- Calm yourself.
- I've got to find her.

1111
01:13:31,549 --> 01:13:35,167
I've got to beg her forgiveness
before it's too late.

1112
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:39,299
I want her to get on that plane with me
back to Cleveland.

1113
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:42,017
I want to hear her laugh and speak.

1114
01:13:42,059 --> 01:13:44,764
I want to pamper her,
take care of her.

1115
01:13:46,897 --> 01:13:48,973
Sorry for carrying on like this

1116
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:52,060
but you're the only friend
who'd understand.

1117
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:53,984
I understand.

1118
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:59,236
Look, Allan, if she calls,
will you tell her I've got to talk to her?

1119
01:13:59,284 --> 01:14:01,490
Tell her I'll see her at home.

1120
01:14:01,536 --> 01:14:04,074
- OK, I'll tell her.
- Thanks.

1121
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:06,905
Thanks a lot.

1122
01:14:19,219 --> 01:14:23,383
How can I break up his home?
He's crazy about her.

1123
01:14:23,432 --> 01:14:27,180
I never realised how much.
He never realised how much.

1124
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:37,435
Hello, Linda?

1125
01:14:37,487 --> 01:14:41,021
I'm in the middle of a conversation.
I'll call you back.

1126
01:14:41,991 --> 01:14:43,865
Don't...

1127
01:14:50,499 --> 01:14:52,575
So that's really it?

1128
01:14:54,962 --> 01:14:59,458
Linda, I have to speak to you.
Have you told him anything yet?

1129
01:14:59,508 --> 01:15:02,462
- Who is that? ls that him?
- This is Allan.

1130
01:15:02,511 --> 01:15:06,045
- Allan, I'll speak to you later.
- Don't hang up!

1131
01:15:22,948 --> 01:15:26,945
Listen, this is urgent...
You sound terrible.

1132
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:31,453
Excuse me.

1133
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:35,409
That wasn't her.

1134
01:15:36,961 --> 01:15:39,666
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

1135
01:15:42,842 --> 01:15:46,211
Is it all right? ls the coast clear?
Can I speak?

1136
01:15:47,513 --> 01:15:51,345
- I ought to be in Cleveland.
- No, wait.

1137
01:15:52,434 --> 01:15:54,842
Say... Just answer in...

1138
01:15:55,687 --> 01:15:57,763
I'll speak to you later.

1139
01:16:00,442 --> 01:16:02,684
I don't believe this.

1140
01:16:05,196 --> 01:16:07,070
The airport.

1141
01:16:07,115 --> 01:16:11,278
I've got to speak to her
before she says anything to him.

1142
01:16:16,624 --> 01:16:20,372
- The Christies just left for the airport.
- Together?

1143
01:16:20,419 --> 01:16:22,495
One right after the other.

1144
01:16:22,546 --> 01:16:24,503
Taxi!

1145
01:16:25,966 --> 01:16:31,173
I'll tell her it's over, that's all.
It was fun but we lost our heads.

1146
01:16:32,222 --> 01:16:36,350
What if it's too late?
What if Linda's really hooked on me?

1147
01:16:37,352 --> 01:16:41,930
Once a woman's been made love to
by somebody who can do it great...

1148
01:16:42,649 --> 01:16:45,140
I was incredible last night in bed.

1149
01:16:45,944 --> 01:16:49,478
I never once had to sit up
and consult the manual.

1150
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:53,694
Love is very different for a woman,
it's a complicated phenomenon.

1151
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:56,613
I've never broken off with a girl before.

1152
01:16:56,662 --> 01:16:59,580
- You said you loved me.
- Take it gracefully.

1153
01:16:59,623 --> 01:17:03,324
But the time we've spent together,
the closeness.

1154
01:17:03,377 --> 01:17:06,247
You mean too much to me,
I can't let you go.

1155
01:17:06,296 --> 01:17:10,294
- I 'm sorry.
- Sorry? You think I'm some play-toy?

1156
01:17:10,342 --> 01:17:12,963
- What can I say?
- Give me the letter.

1157
01:17:13,011 --> 01:17:15,087
- What?
- Give me the letter.

1158
01:17:15,138 --> 01:17:17,344
- There is no letter.
- I want it.

1159
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:22,348
You're going crazy.
Don't pull the trigger. I'm a bleeder!

1160
01:17:23,354 --> 01:17:28,016
Pull yourself together, kid.
You should feel encouraged.

1161
01:17:28,067 --> 01:17:31,732
When you weren't being phoney,
you got a good dame to fall for you.

1162
01:17:31,779 --> 01:17:34,531
You thought
you couldn't make it with dames.

1163
01:17:34,573 --> 01:17:39,531
- And now I've got to end it.
- It's not that hard, kid. Watch.

1164
01:17:49,129 --> 01:17:52,165
- Come here, sweetheart.
- Yes, darling?

1165
01:17:53,091 --> 01:17:55,297
- It's over.
- What is?

1166
01:17:55,343 --> 01:17:57,217
- Us.
- Over?

1167
01:17:57,262 --> 01:17:59,468
- Over. Kaput.
- That simple?

1168
01:17:59,514 --> 01:18:02,087
- That's right.
- Supposing I say no?

1169
01:18:02,141 --> 01:18:05,012
- Won't do you any good.
- And will this?

1170
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:08,264
Come off it, sugar.
You never could use a rod.

1171
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:13,352
But why does it have to end
before it can begin?

1172
01:18:13,402 --> 01:18:15,644
Because you play too rough for me.

1173
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:19,610
You killed Johnson.
Parker found out so you killed him too.

1174
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:21,900
Then you wanted to finish me off.

1175
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:26,827
You couldn't do it when I was facing
you so you wanted me to turn around.

1176
01:18:26,873 --> 01:18:30,491
Now, let's go. You're taking the fall.

1177
01:18:38,551 --> 01:18:40,793
That's all there is to it.

1178
01:18:40,845 --> 01:18:43,133
For you because you're Bogart.

1179
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,387
Everybody is at certain times.

1180
01:18:45,433 --> 01:18:48,433
You're doing something
I didn't think you could.

1181
01:18:48,477 --> 01:18:52,225
You're passing up a real tomato
because you don't want to hurt a guy.

1182
01:18:52,272 --> 01:18:55,439
If I did that,
there wouldn't be a dry eye.

1183
01:18:55,484 --> 01:18:57,523
But I'm heartbroken over it.

1184
01:18:57,569 --> 01:19:00,060
All the more reason to feel proud of it.

1185
01:19:00,113 --> 01:19:02,189
- You think so?
- Sure.

1186
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:06,985
Listen, kid, there's other things
in life besides dames.

1187
01:19:07,036 --> 01:19:10,951
One of them is to know
you did the right thing for a pal.

1188
01:19:10,999 --> 01:19:13,074
Think it over.

1189
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:46,861
- What gate is the flight to Cleveland?
- Gate 15.

1190
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,577
- Where's the plane to Cleveland?
- Gate 15.

1191
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,804
- Wait.
- What are you doing here?

1192
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:23,438
- I've something important to tell you.
- So do l.

1193
01:20:23,484 --> 01:20:27,102
Do you realise what a wonderful thing
has happened?

1194
01:20:27,154 --> 01:20:31,448
The most beautiful thing has
happened right under our noses.

1195
01:20:31,492 --> 01:20:35,821
We've had a wonderful experience.
Doesn't that surprise you?

1196
01:20:35,871 --> 01:20:39,489
You didn't have to leave books
lying around,

1197
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:42,246
you didn't have to have on
the proper music.

1198
01:20:42,294 --> 01:20:46,872
I even saw you in your underwear
with the days of the week on them.

1199
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:50,591
- We have to call it quits.
- Yes, I know.

1200
01:20:50,635 --> 01:20:54,134
- Pardon me?
- Suddenly things became very clear.

1201
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:58,842
And when I asked myself if I really
wanted to break off my marriage,

1202
01:20:58,893 --> 01:21:02,476
the answer was no. I love Dick.

1203
01:21:03,522 --> 01:21:07,306
Although someone
as wonderful as you is very tempting,

1204
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:10,526
- I can't imagine life without him.
- You can't?

1205
01:21:10,571 --> 01:21:16,444
He needs me. In some
unexplainable way, I need him.

1206
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:18,570
I know he needs you.

1207
01:21:18,621 --> 01:21:22,950
This is the first time I've been affected
by anyone besides Dick.

1208
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,325
I'm already in love with you.

1209
01:21:25,378 --> 01:21:29,589
Unless we stop now,
I won't be able to go back to him.

1210
01:21:29,632 --> 01:21:32,668
I don't regret a moment
of what's happened

1211
01:21:32,718 --> 01:21:37,214
because it's reaffirmed
my feelings for Dick.

1212
01:21:40,434 --> 01:21:42,510
Linda, I understand, really.

1213
01:21:42,561 --> 01:21:46,261
Sure? You're not just saying that
to make things easy?

1214
01:21:46,314 --> 01:21:48,521
I'm saying it because it's true.

1215
01:21:48,566 --> 01:21:52,481
We both know you belong to Dick.
You're part of his work.

1216
01:21:52,529 --> 01:21:55,778
If that plane leaves and you don't,
you'll regret it.

1217
01:21:55,823 --> 01:22:00,615
Maybe not today or tomorrow
but soon and for the rest of your life.

1218
01:22:00,661 --> 01:22:02,535
That's beautiful.

1219
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,786
It's from Casablanca.

1220
01:22:04,832 --> 01:22:07,405
I waited my whole life to say it.

1221
01:22:18,053 --> 01:22:21,137
I thought I saw you here.
What's going on?

1222
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:24,217
You should know something
before you two leave.

1223
01:22:24,267 --> 01:22:26,972
Us? You're coming with me?

1224
01:22:28,354 --> 01:22:30,976
Nobody owes me any explanations.

1225
01:22:31,024 --> 01:22:34,724
I'm going to anyway because
it may mean something later on.

1226
01:22:34,777 --> 01:22:38,110
You said you thought Linda
was having an affair.

1227
01:22:38,155 --> 01:22:41,192
But she was at my house
when you called.

1228
01:22:41,242 --> 01:22:45,820
She came over to baby-sit with me
because I was lonely. Right?

1229
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:50,706
Over the past weeks
I've fallen in love with her.

1230
01:22:50,751 --> 01:22:55,543
I hoped she felt the same way
but all she could talk about was you.

1231
01:22:55,589 --> 01:22:58,922
- I understand, Allan.
- I hope you do.

1232
01:23:13,356 --> 01:23:15,562
We better be going.

1233
01:23:23,532 --> 01:23:25,608
I'll call you, Allan.

1234
01:23:39,964 --> 01:23:42,040
That was great.

1235
01:23:42,091 --> 01:23:45,507
You've really developed yourself
a little style.

1236
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:48,673
I do have a certain amount of style,
don't l?

1237
01:23:49,765 --> 01:23:52,636
I guess you won't be needing me
any more.

1238
01:23:52,685 --> 01:23:57,181
There's nothing I can tell you now
that you don't already know.

1239
01:23:57,231 --> 01:24:01,857
I guess that's so. I guess the secret's
not being you, it's being me.

1240
01:24:01,902 --> 01:24:04,653
True, you're not too tall and kinda ugly

1241
01:24:04,696 --> 01:24:09,903
but I'm short enough and ugly enough
to succeed on my own.

1242
01:24:12,245 --> 01:24:14,534
Here's looking at you, kid.
