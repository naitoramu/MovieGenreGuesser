1
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,821
He steps on the floor
Without making a sound

2
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,282
And then he starts feeling the beat

3
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,035
You would think the floor was greased

4
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,289
By the way he's moving his feet

5
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,667
He's a champion, he's the best

6
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,295
Impossible to tame

7
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,849
Go back! Stay! Stay!

8
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,228
Don't follow me to school. Stay! Stay!

9
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,818
Some kids have dogs
that follow them to school.

10
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,631
I think it's a head, ma'am.

11
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,799
Shall I throw it in the wastebasket?

12
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,011
Maybe you'd like to see it up close?

13
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,347
I can take it up to your desk, ma'am.

14
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:24,353
It's pretty heavy.
It feels like it's full of lead.

15
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,524
There you are, ma'am.
Now you can get a close look at it.

16
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,784
You missed it, sir.

17
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,453
We've been studying the human head.

18
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,332
Somehow I feel I should get you
for something, Marcie.

19
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,251
But I don't know what.

20
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,591
Put away that history book, Marcie.
Art is next.

21
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,344
I love art class.

22
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,596
How's this, ma'am?

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,558
Twenty-four cows standing in a pasture,

24
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,603
each one rendered in exquisite detail.

25
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,858
Maybe I'll add some sheep
and rabbits and squirrels.

26
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,570
A gorgeous pastoral setting.

27
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,906
Now I'll color the sky blue
and the grass green.

28
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,284
And I'll put in some yellow flowers.

29
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:25,080
Wow. What a picture!
What an artistic triumph.

30
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,625
Marcie, you haven't drawn a thing!

31
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,879
Some of us
are just patrons of the arts, sir.

32
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,092
What did you put down
for the fourth question?

33
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,470
Six times 12 is 72.

34
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,474
Seventy-two? I put down green.

35
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,187
Green? Why did you put down green?

36
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,731
I thought it was a trick question.

37
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,280
Marcie, this is hard work.

38
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,993
Boy, I sure could use
a little break right now.

39
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,509
Sorry, ma'am.
My nose is caught in my binder.

40
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,013
I'm trying not to scream.
It's very painful.

41
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,642
May I have permission
to see the school nurse?

42
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,395
Or maybe the custodian?
We may need a pair of pliers.

43
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,986
Sorry, ma'am.
I'm having trouble seeing where I'm going.

44
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,618
Ouch!

45
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,124
My report? I'm sorry, ma'am.

46
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,045
It's in my binder,
and my binder's caught in my hair.

47
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,215
I've tried whipping it
backward and forward.

48
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,803
But nothing seems to help.

49
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:07,724
Anyway, my report was called:
"Does education have to be painful?"

50
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,476
I think maybe it does.

51
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,315
No, ma'am.
I really can't take it off because--

52
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,525
Yikes!

53
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,361
Because my hair
is still caught in the binder.

54
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,196
Yikes!

55
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,032
She got it off. Marcie got it off.

56
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,243
What a relief.

57
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,624
My report? It's right here in my binder.

58
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,881
Don't sigh like that, ma'am.
It breaks my heart.

59
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,596
Gym is my favorite class.

60
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,807
I'm so dumb I wish all classes were gym.

61
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,934
I sure look forward to gym.

62
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:57,107
You know, Chuck? I may not be
as cute as that little red-haired girl,

63
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:00,736
and I may not have
naturally curly hair like Frieda,

64
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,197
and I may not be as smart as Lucy,

65
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,991
but I've got one thing none of them has.

66
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,784
I'm in shape!

67
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,538
I run five miles every morning

68
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,124
I do a hundred push-ups every day

69
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,586
I pedal every night
Take a swim, take a hike

70
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,422
I'm in shape
I'm in shape, I'm in shape

71
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:24,009
She's practicing
Peppermint Patty's PE program

72
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,762
She's in shape
She's in shape, she's in shape

73
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,015
When other kids
Are fading at the finish

74
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,435
When all the others fail
To break the tape

75
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,563
I saunter 'round the track
And wave to Daddy

76
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,608
I'm in shape
I'm in shape, I'm in shape

77
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,444
She's practicing
Peppermint Patty's PE program

78
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,489
She's in shape
She's in shape, she's in shape

79
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,451
Hey, Linus, get in shape
Pretty soon it'll be too late

80
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,079
Hey, Linus! Hey, Linus!

81
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,749
Hey, Chuck, you know how
Get in shape, do it now

82
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,167
-Hey, Chuck
-Hey, Chuck

83
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,086
-Hey, Chuck
-Hey, Chuck

84
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,546
Everybody get fit

85
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,339
Stop thinking about it, this is it

86
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,175
Lucy, Linus, Schroeder, Sally
Everybody work

87
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,637
So if you want to follow my example

88
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,015
You're gonna have to work
There's no escape

89
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,185
You gotta get
With Peppermint Patty's PE program

90
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,896
Get in shape
Get in shape, get in shape

91
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,400
She's practicing
Peppermint Patty's PE program

92
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,193
-She's in shape
-I'm in shape

93
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,529
-She's in shape
-I'm in shape, I'm in shape

94
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,155
-She's in shape
-I'm in shape

95
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,824
-She's in shape
-I'm in shape

96
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,534
In shape, in shape

97
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,457
Okay, Chuck. Lift those legs.

98
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,834
Lift them higher.

99
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,004
Oh, good grief.

100
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,656
Are you ready for the party tonight,
Sally?

101
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,410
I remember the last time
I went to a party.

102
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:18,415
Linus called up and asked me if I would
like to go to a party.

103
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,918
And I said, "Yes."

104
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:26,006
And then when we got there,
Linus asked me if I would like to dance.

105
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,218
And I said, "Yes."

106
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,933
Then after we danced, Linus said,
"Would you like a glass of punch?"

107
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,852
And I said, "Yes.

108
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,688
That would be very nice.

109
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,942
I would like to have a glass of punch."

110
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,528
I don't believe that ever happened.

111
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,571
Well, it should have!

112
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:01,041
Okay, gang, we're gonna play Simon Says.

113
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,628
I'll start it.
Simon says, "Raise your arms."

114
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,130
Simon says, "Turn around."

115
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,299
Simon says, "Clap your hands."

116
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,260
Simon says--

117
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,887
Okay, it's my turn now.

118
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,682
Lucy is the boss, Lucy is the boss

119
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:21,228
So you got to listen to Lucy
Listen to Lucy

120
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,939
Lucy's the boss, Lucy is the boss

121
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:28,193
So you gotta listen to Lucy
Listen to Lucy

122
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,821
And here's what Lucy says

123
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,409
Lucy says,
"Put your hands on your head"

124
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:39,413
Listen to Lucy, listen to Lucy

125
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,083
Lucy says, "Now turn around"

126
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,336
Listen to Lucy, listen to Lucy

127
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,921
Put your hands by your side

128
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,925
Ah-ah, I didn't say "Lucy says"

129
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:57,431
Lucy's the boss, so listen to Lucy

130
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,267
And here's what Lucy says

131
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,938
Lucy says,
"Take your hands off your head"

132
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,734
Listen to Lucy, listen to Lucy

133
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,362
Lucy says, "Put them on your hips now"

134
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,824
Listen to Lucy, listen to Lucy

135
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:18,118
Now jump up and down

136
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:21,455
Ah-ah, I didn't say "Lucy says"

137
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:29,463
Lucy's the boss, so listen to Lucy
And here's what Lucy says

138
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:36,762
Lucy says, "I wanna be
The queen of the world, yes, I do"

139
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:44,228
Lucy says, "I want everything my way"
Hey-hey-hey

140
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:51,443
Lucy says "I'm gonna be
A beautiful girl, yes, I am"

141
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,990
Lucy says
"I'm gonna marry Schroeder someday"

142
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,743
Oh, good grief!

143
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,664
Lucy says, "Pick up your right foot"

144
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:07,251
Listen to Lucy, listen to Lucy

145
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,921
Lucy says, "Now hop on your left foot"

146
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,174
Listen to Lucy, listen to Lucy

147
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,677
Now start running in place

148
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,680
Ah-ah, I didn't say "Lucy says"

149
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:25,477
Lucy is the boss, so listen to Lucy

150
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,355
And that's what Lucy says

151
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,775
What are you doing, Sally?

152
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,028
I'm waiting for my Sweet Babboo.

153
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,031
I am not your Sweet Babboo!

154
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,158
I'm waiting here because

155
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:45,539
my Sweet Babboo asked me
to have the next dance with him.

156
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,041
I did not!

157
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,377
Well, you should have!

158
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,045
Oh, brother.

159
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,132
I'll have a cup, please.

160
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,473
I'm glad to see
you're not only having a good time,

161
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,934
but you're also
helping out with the party.

162
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,474
I'll have a cup of punch, please.

163
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,147
You know, Charlie Brown,

164
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:55,150
you have to do something about your face.

165
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:02,783
It's impossible to talk to someone
when they're making such sour faces.

166
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:13,085
Okay, everybody, gather 'round
It's time for the Pigpen Hoedown

167
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,087
Kick up your heels, jump up and down

168
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,089
Shut your eyes and whirl around

169
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,091
Reach out your hand
And if no one's there

170
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,218
Grab your own hand
Dance 'round in a square

171
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,847
When you're doing the Pigpen Hoedown
Gotta have a caller you can trust

172
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,101
'Cause when Pigpen does a hoedown
He really kicks up some dust

173
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,312
Hey, Chuck, we're all bumping
into each other.

174
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,106
Let me give it a try.

175
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,109
Bow to your left, bow to your right

176
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,861
And if you find no one in sight

177
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,071
Just bow to your toes
And bow to your knees

178
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,948
And dance around just as you please

179
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,618
When you're doing the Pigpen Hoedown
Gotta have a caller you can trust

180
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:51,123
'Cause when Pigpen does a hoedown
He really kicks up some dust

181
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,711
-I can hardly see.
-It's getting worse.

182
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:16,523
Hey, Patty, we're still bumping
into each other. Let me be the caller.

183
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:20,777
We don't need a caller, Lucy.
We need a vacuum cleaner.

184
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,990
If we really wanna dance
And we stay here we got no chance

185
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,242
So nod to the ceiling
And bow to the floor

186
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,161
Leave Pigpen here
And head for the door

187
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,956
When you're doing the Pigpen Hoedown
Gotta have a caller you can trust

188
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,710
'Cause when Pigpen does a hoedown
He really kicks up some dust

189
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,051
Do you realize what you're becoming?

190
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,720
I don't know what you're becoming,

191
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,097
but I do know what you're not becoming.

192
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:52,684
You don't do any of the things
that a dog is supposed to do.

193
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,020
You don't bark at strangers.

194
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,189
You don't bring in the morning paper.

195
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,858
You don't even bring me
my slippers at night.

196
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,444
In the old days,
dogs used to round up sheep

197
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:05,155
and guard them in case wolves attacked.

198
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,241
I never see you rounding up sheep.

199
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:10,410
I'll bet you don't even know
what one looks like.

200
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:15,040
You don't try to follow me to school,
and you don't meet me when I come home.

201
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,544
There's nothing worse than owning a dog
who isn't a dog.

202
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:29,721
Who can fly a doghouse
Up in the bright blue sky?

203
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,974
It's Snoopy, it's got to be him

204
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:37,729
Who can wind up his ears
Lift up his head and fly?

205
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,900
It's not a Rover, not a Fido
No, no, not him

206
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,236
It's not a Lassie, not a Benji

207
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,737
Not Rin Tin Tin

208
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:46,822
Well, it's Snoopy

209
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,157
Who's in the bathroom? Open up.

210
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,038
He can do anything

211
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:58,667
Snoopy makes everyone smile

212
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:14,850
Who doesn't need a glove
To be the best shortstop around?

213
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,102
It's Snoopy, it's got to be him

214
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:23,275
Who can put on his shades
And be the coolest dog in town?

215
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:27,487
It's not a Rover, not a Fido
No, no, not him

216
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:31,033
It's not a Lassie, not a Benji
Not Rin Tin Tin

217
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,328
Well, it's Snoopy, Snoopy

218
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:38,624
-Talkin' 'bout Snoopy
-Talkin' 'bout Snoopy

219
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,375
He can do anything

220
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,587
Snoopy makes everyone smile

221
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:41,103
He steps on the floor
Without making a sound

222
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,939
Then he starts feeling the beat

223
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:50,362
You would think the floor was greased
By the way he's moving his feet

224
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:54,157
He's a champion, he's the best

225
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:57,870
Impossible to tame

226
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:01,123
People say that he's obsessed

227
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,375
Listen to the sound of his name

228
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:08,213
They call him Flash, Flash
Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle

229
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:15,679
When he moves around
The whole room starts to reel

230
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:21,393
You know he's Flash, Flash
Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle

231
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:30,527
When he jumps up high
He glides like a wild eagle

232
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,915
Lightning flashes when he leaps up

233
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,959
He's got everybody shouting for more

234
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,755
Thunder crashes
When he hits the ground

235
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,799
He's burnin' up the dancin' floor

236
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,178
He's a champion, he's the best

237
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,890
Impossible to tame

238
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,935
People say that he's obsessed

239
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,270
Listen to the sound of his name

240
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:10,108
They call him Flash, Flash
Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle

241
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:17,533
When he moves around
The whole room starts to reel

242
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:23,288
You know he's Flash, Flash
Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle

243
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:32,506
When he jumps up high
He glides like a wild eagle

244
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,279
Flashbeagle?

245
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,490
I can't stand it.

246
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,918
I need something for show-and-tell.

247
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:17,676
I pick you
because you're a first-round draft pick.

248
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:27,978
Yes, sir. You're going to get me an "A"
for show-and-tell.

249
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,190
A real, live dog.

250
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:55,255
For show-and-tell, I brought
my pet chameleon. His name is George.

251
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,384
And George changes colors
with every shirt I wear.

252
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:03,180
George eats flies and bugs. Thank you.

253
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:13,524
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,609
Heel, Snoopy.

255
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:23,534
For show-and-tell today,
I have brought a dog.

256
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,661
What's so great about that?

257
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:29,498
He doesn't do anything.
He just stands there.

258
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,750
He looks like he's asleep.

259
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:35,754
A dog is not only man's best friend,

260
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:40,592
but he's also a protector, a defender,

261
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:45,347
a ferocious friend in need-- indeed.

262
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:03,907
From the fur on his feet
To the tip of his nose

263
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,910
He's got rhythm
Pumping all through his veins

264
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:10,455
Oh, he spins like a top
That'll never stop

265
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,791
With the power of a hurricane

266
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:17,004
He's a champion, he's the best

267
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:20,716
Impossible to tame

268
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,969
People say that he's obsessed

269
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,305
Listen to the sound of his name

270
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:31,143
They call him Flash, Flash
Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle

271
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:39,234
When he moves around
The whole room starts to reel

272
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:44,323
You know he's Flash, Flash
Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle

273
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:53,457
When he jumps up high
He glides like a wild eagle

274
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,757
A wild eagle

275
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,452
I don't know what to do about Snoopy.

276
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,997
I should give him a good lecture,
the way he carries on.

277
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,250
You just leave him alone.

278
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:41,004
That's the first time
I ever got an "A" in show-and-tell.
