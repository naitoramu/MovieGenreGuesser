1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,256
Hey, new wallet?

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:07,591
It was time.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:12,095
The old condom ring in the leather
just doesn't say "cool" anymore.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,933
Rachel, you just put an empty carton
back in the fridge.

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:19,478
I know,
but the garbage was full.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,814
Have you ever taken out the trash?

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:28,070
Well, I thought you liked doing it.

8
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,702
- Third door on the left.
- Right!

9
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,422
Hey, Mr. Treeger.

10
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,650
What are you doing?

11
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,405
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,992
It's a little old but...

13
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,286
You're clogging up the chute
I just unclogged.

14
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:22,416
I'm sorry.
I don't come in here a lot.

15
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:27,004
Of course not.
You're a little princess.

16
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,380
Daddy, buy me a pizza.

17
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,298
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.

18
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:35,345
Daddy, make the cast of "Cats"
sing "Happy Birthday" to me.

19
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,431
You think you can come here...

20
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:41,476
...make a mess and a big man
in coveralls will clean it up?

21
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:46,357
Think of someone else for a change.

22
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,195
Okay, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,747
God, if you're going to cry about it!

24
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,084
The One with Ballroom Dancing

25
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,216
Treeger made you cry?

26
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:59,763
He said really mean things
that were only partly true.

27
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,806
I'll teach him a lesson.

28
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,518
Joey, don't.
Let's forget about it.

29
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,647
That's easy for you to say.
You weren't almost just killed!

30
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:13,735
All right, that's it.
School is in session!

31
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,906
Is this a gym card?

32
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,532
Oh yeah, gym member.

33
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,161
I try to go four times a week,
but I've missed...

34
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,373
...the last 1200 times.

35
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,000
So why don't you quit?

36
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,629
You don't think I've tried?

37
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,509
You think I like having $50 a month
taken from my account?

38
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,012
They make you go
all the way down there.

39
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:45,476
They use all these phrases
and peppiness to confuse you.

40
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,646
And then they bring out Maria.

41
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:49,730
Who is Maria?

42
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,066
Oh, Maria!

43
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,652
You can't say no to her.

44
00:03:54,902 --> 00:04:00,241
She's like this lycra,
spandex-covered, gym treat.

45
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,661
Do you need me to go with you
and hold your hand?

46
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,622
You're strong enough to face her?

47
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,417
Oh, no. You'll have to come.

48
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,422
Tribbiani.

49
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,590
Hold on.

50
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,468
I'll get the plunger.

51
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,097
You hold on.
You made my friend Rachel cry.

52
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,433
So you'll go and apologize to her...

53
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,643
...unless you want me
to call the landlord.

54
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,020
And tell him what?

55
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,814
Maybe you haven't heard of
"not making girls cry".

56
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:37,653
Maybe you haven't heard of the
Rent Stabilization Act of 1968.

57
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:42,074
I have actually not heard of that.

58
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,910
Your friends are violating it.

59
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,622
I've been nice until now,
but I don't need this grief.

60
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,415
I'm telling the landlord...

61
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,878
...Monica's illegally
subletting her grandmother's place.

62
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,672
Your friends are out of here, pal.

63
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:02,344
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

64
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,266
Somebody tell me
I don't have to work today.

65
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,684
What's the matter?

66
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,062
My first massage is
this incredibly gorgeous guy.

67
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,022
Every time I see him,
I want to...

68
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:18,152
...do things to him
I can't charge for.

69
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,615
So do them for free.

70
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,993
No, it is forbidden.

71
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:30,706
Mrs. Potter fires people
for messing around with clients.

72
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,876
And it's against my oath
as a masseuse.

73
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,252
They make you take one?

74
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,295
No, I made myself take one.

75
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,715
No fooling around with clients...

76
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,886
...and always be prepared.

77
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:50,726
That one's from the Boy Scouts,
but it just makes good sense.

78
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,853
Why not give him to someone else?

79
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,690
No, I can handle it.
I'm a professional.

80
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,776
Pheebs, is that
a new ankle bracelet?

81
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,445
You got a pedicure.

82
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,698
Your feet are all dressed up.

83
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,287
That's the only part he can see
when he's on the table!

84
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,373
You're going to do
some feet flirting!

85
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:17,461
I don't know what
you're talking about.

86
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,506
How do you explain the toe ring?

87
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:27,888
It's Arabian Princess Day at work.
Leave me alone!

88
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,520
My hero! What happened?

89
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,815
I told him no one treats
my friends like that.

90
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,067
And he better apologize.
See you!

91
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,319
Wait a minute.

92
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,654
What did he say?

93
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,534
He wouldn't apologize because
you're living here illegally.

94
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,537
Instead, he'll evict you.
See you later!

95
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:55,040
- You got us evicted?
- I told you not to go down there.

96
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,500
He made Rachel cry!

97
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,419
Rachel always cries!

98
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,299
That's not true!

99
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,427
You go down there,
and you suck up to him.

100
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:10,514
You suck like
you've never sucked before!

101
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,808
All right, I'll try.

102
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,978
If I can't, you stay with us
till you get settled.

103
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,439
- Go!
- All right, all right.

104
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:22,818
I'll have to check first,
but he'll be cool.

105
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:32,161
Remember what we talked about.
You got to be strong.

106
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,288
Now one more time.

107
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't you want a washboard stomach
and rock-hard pecs?

108
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,713
No, I want a flabby gut
and saggy man-breasts.

109
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,841
That's good.

110
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,639
I want to quit the gym.

111
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,935
You want to quit?

112
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,189
I want to quit the gym.

113
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:06,236
You do realize you won't have
access to our new Swedish spa?

114
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,160
I want to quit the gym.

115
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,457
Dave in the Membership Office
handles quitters.

116
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,002
Excuse me.
Are you a member?

117
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,921
Me?

118
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,258
Sorry. Members only.

119
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,386
I want to quit the gym!

120
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:35,766
It's okay, man.
Be strong.

121
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,023
Are you a member of any gym?

122
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,943
No, and I'm not going to be.
So save your little speech.

123
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,737
Okay, no problem.

124
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,865
Could you come here?

125
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,370
Hi, I'm Maria.

126
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,554
You have really pretty feet.

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,765
These old things?

128
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:22,271
Would you spend time on my
sciatic area? It's killing me.

129
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,939
You mean...

130
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,692
By sciatic, you mean...

131
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:30,821
...the towel-covered portion?

132
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,698
Sure, I can do that.

133
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:36,577
Because the muscles
in the sciatic area can get...

134
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:40,789
...real nice and tight.

135
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,922
So tell me, Rick,
how did you injure the area?

136
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:52,593
A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

137
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:06,357
- Did you just bite me?
- No!

138
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,867
Please don't kick the girls out.
This was my fault.

139
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,912
You want me to kick
you guys out instead?

140
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:24,667
You can't. Where would
the chick and the duck live?

141
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,462
You have pets?

142
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,047
Those are nicknames.

143
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:34,343
I'm the "chick",
and Chandler's the "duck".

144
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:38,221
I would've thought
it was the other way around.

145
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,683
Come on.
Let the girls stay.

146
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,601
I'll do whatever you want.

147
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,686
Really? You'd do anything?

148
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,730
Yeah, absolutely.

149
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,315
I got something.

150
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,984
What is it?

151
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:56,031
Can you be my dancing partner?

152
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,869
That's not prison lingo, is it?

153
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,128
His dancing partner?

154
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:15,342
There's this superintendents' dance,
"The Super Ball".

155
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,888
He wants to impress Marge,
this lady super he likes.

156
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,098
Why not practice with a girl?

157
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,392
He's too shy.

158
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,603
He's not good enough
to dance with girls yet.

159
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:27,772
Yeah, right.

160
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:32,776
He almost danced me right down
that garbage chute.

161
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:37,906
Would you let it go already?
You're fine.

162
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,870
So did you quit?

163
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,413
I almost did.

164
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:48,167
Couldn't leave Ross there
without a spotter.

165
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:52,171
Wait, now, so you joined the gym?

166
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:58,093
And that's funny, why?

167
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:04,308
I was just, you know,
picturing you working out, and...

168
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,061
Well, that's it.

169
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,478
We're doomed.

170
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:13,234
They'll take $50 a month from our
accounts for the rest of our lives.

171
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,402
What'll we do?

172
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,989
You could actually go to the gym.

173
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,246
Or we could go to the bank...

174
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:31,543
...close our accounts
and cut them off at the source.

175
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,378
You're a genius.

176
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:37,633
Oh, man! But then,
we won't be bank buddies.

177
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,844
Now there's two reasons.

178
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,894
You guys, remember that cute client
I told you about?

179
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,813
I bit him.

180
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,106
Where?

181
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,192
On the tushy.

182
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,362
And that's not against your oath?

183
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,240
I know,
but the moment I touch him...

184
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,662
...I want to throw out my old oath
and take a new, dirty one.

185
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,581
Next time, try to distract yourself.

186
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,334
Like when I'm doing
something exciting...

187
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,462
...and I don't want to get too...

188
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,130
...excited.

189
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:21,135
I try and think of other things.
Like sandwiches...

190
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:24,722
...and baseball...

191
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,350
...and Chandler.

192
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:32,563
- Thank you.
- Oh no, thank you.

193
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:41,238
All right, I'm here.
Let's get this over with.

194
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,573
Okay, well...

195
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:47,202
...just follow my lead.

196
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:50,790
Don't we need to do some kind
of preparation first?

197
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,083
Like get really drunk?

198
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:58,547
Come on. Hey, just put
your arms around me.

199
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,138
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,391
No. It's okay.
But if I'm Marge...

201
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,435
...my breasts are coming out my back.

202
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,898
Forget it!
I'm not being any good at this.

203
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:17,149
My mom was right.

204
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,112
I'm just a big potato
with arms and legs and a head.

205
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,407
Come on, man.
You're not a potato.

206
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,286
I'm sure as hell not a dancer.
It's no use.

207
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,622
Marge will never go for me.

208
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,626
Come on, Treeger.
Don't say that.

209
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,378
You just need more practice.

210
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,340
Come on.
Let's try it again.

211
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,803
Plus, it was probably
mostly my fault anyway.

212
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:51,183
I'm not that comfortable
dancing with a...

213
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,859
So how goes the dancing?
Gay yet?

214
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:06,991
You guys owe me bigtime.

215
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,330
What was that?

216
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,124
You just did a little dancy thing.

217
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,711
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

218
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,672
- You did a little hop.
- You are so enjoying this.

219
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,257
No, I'm not.

220
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,765
You know the words!

221
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,683
You are so into this!

222
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:39,022
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.
I'm getting pretty good at it.

223
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:44,153
This is so sweet.
Joey, our little twinkletoes.

224
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,864
This isn't some kind of girly dance.

225
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:50,075
It's like a sport, it's manly.

226
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:54,788
- Show me some "manly" moves.
- All right.

227
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,336
I don't know how to lead.

228
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,426
Hello.

229
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,803
We'd like to close our accounts.

230
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,765
Close your accounts?
Is there a problem?

231
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:17,895
No, we'd just like to close them.

232
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,439
Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.

233
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,234
Would you come over here, please?

234
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,403
Hi, I'm Karen.

235
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,198
I want to quit the bank!

236
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:34,995
<i>Okay. Baseball.</i>

237
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,874
<i>Rick playing baseball.</i>
<i>He slides into second.</i>

238
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:43,045
<i>Maybe even his pants</i>
<i>come down a little.</i>

239
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,048
<i>Okay, sandwiches.</i>
<i>Sandwiches.</i>

240
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,091
<i>Okay, on a plate.</i>

241
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:52,346
<i>Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.</i>

242
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,723
<i>Chandler.</i>

243
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:58,852
<i>Okay, Chandler.</i>
<i>That's working!</i>

244
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,612
<i>Chandler's knees.</i>

245
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,781
<i>Chandler's ankles.</i>

246
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,534
<i>Chandler's ankle hair.</i>

247
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,452
<i>Oh, no!</i>

248
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,787
Okay, you're all set.

249
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,082
Wow! That was amazing!

250
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,918
Was that really just an hour?

251
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:27,547
In really long hour-world.

252
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,428
I have an enormous crush on you.

253
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,307
But since you're a client,
I can't ask you out...

254
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:40,895
...even though you give me
the feelings.

255
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,314
I had no idea.

256
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,193
I can always find another masseuse.

257
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,443
Really?

258
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:52,198
Yeah, really.

259
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:56,952
What?

260
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:01,123
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.

261
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,668
Quiet down.

262
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,256
Mr. Simon's been waiting...
Oh, my God!

263
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,383
Why wasn't I offered that?

264
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:15,554
I'd definitely pay more for that.

265
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:19,141
We have rules here.
This is not that kind of place.

266
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:22,185
I know, but this isn't
how it looks at all...

267
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,272
...because Rick is my husband.

268
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,690
Oh, really?

269
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,067
You'd better tell his other wife.

270
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:33,405
She called three times
asking where he is.

271
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:38,743
Yes, I will tell her.

272
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,539
So you didn't leave the bank?

273
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,752
And somehow we ended up
with a joint checking account.

274
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,047
What will you ever use that for?

275
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:54,384
To pay for the gym.

276
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,180
So I had a great day.

277
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,807
Rick and I hit it off.
We were making out.

278
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:05,813
Then my boss walked in
and fired me for being a whore.

279
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,564
- You got fired?
- Oh, my gosh!

280
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,651
It's so weird. I have never
been fired from anything.

281
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,487
Sweetie.

282
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,741
I started walking around,
not knowing what to do next.

283
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:22,787
I started asking people on the street
if they wanted massages.

284
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,041
Then these policemen thought
I was a whore too.

285
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,545
It's really been a bad day,
whore-wise.

286
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:38,428
Hey, Duck.
Is Chick here?

287
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:44,017
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.

288
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,852
Ready for our last practice?

289
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:50,190
We're not getting that spin right
because my place is too small.

290
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,445
- Want to use our place?
- No, I had another idea.

291
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,738
We did it!

292
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,740
That was incredible!

293
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,452
That was amazing!
We totally nailed it!

294
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,955
Hey, listen.
Thanks a lot, Tribbiani.

295
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,041
Oh, my God!
Look at the time.

296
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,878
I got to catch the bus to the ball.

297
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,881
Good luck.

298
00:20:56,131 --> 00:21:00,260
Unless you want to practice
the fox trot. Or the tango?

299
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,514
Thanks, but no.

300
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:08,435
You see, I think I'm ready
to dance with girls.

301
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,856
- Go get them, Treeger.
- Right.

302
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:20,239
You want to come?
Marge has a friend.

303
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:21,532
Really?

304
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,576
You'd dance good with her.
She's the same size as me.

305
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,871
No, I'm good.

306
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,057
It looks like you've got
great experience.

307
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,559
Let's see.
Reason for leaving last job?

308
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,147
They thought I was a whore.

309
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:58,234
Okay. We'll give you a call
if anything comes up.

310
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:02,531
Great. Thank you very much.
