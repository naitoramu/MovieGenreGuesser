1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,060
-Previously on Friends. . . .
-I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,180
You want me to quit my job so you
can feel like you have a girlfriend?

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,180
-Is this about Mark?
-Oh, my God.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,620
-Okay, it's not.
-Oh, my God.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,900
I cannot keep having this
fight with you!

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,260
Maybe we should just take a break.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Fine. You're right.
Let's take a break.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,500
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,340
A break from us.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,900
Then we had this big fight,
and I said I wanted to take a break.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,780
I don't want to take a break.

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,060
This is crazy.

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,900
Can 't we work on this?

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,060
What do you want to drink?

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,380
Who's that?

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,780
Nobody.

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,580
Is that Mark?

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,900
Honey, look, he just--

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,410
Yeah. Got it!

20
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,660
Hey, come dance.
What, are you married?

21
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,580
Because that's okay.

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,010
THE NEXT MORNING

23
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,330
How was the big anniversary dinner?

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,780
Well, we never actually got to dinner.

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,300
Nice.

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,980
We kind of broke up instead.

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,100
What?

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,580
My God!
It's on the ceiling!

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,780
That's okay.

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,020
This is more important than fruit. . .

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,700
. . .on my ceiling.

32
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,180
You broke up?

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,420
Yeah, but it's okay because
when Ross left, Mark came over.

34
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,050
-Oh, no! You and Mark?
-It's okay. Calm down.

35
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,620
Mark and I talked. . .

36
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,900
. . .and I realized how much
I love your stupid brother.

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,460
We got our problems,
but I really wanna make it work.

38
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,170
Morning!

39
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,500
The One the Morning After

40
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,690
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

41
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,980
It's me. I've been trying
to reach you all night. I feel awful.

42
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,100
There's nothing between me and Mark.

43
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,580
This whole breakup thing
is just stupid.

44
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,770
I'm sorry I put you through it.

45
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,380
And I don 't want to get
back together over a machine.

46
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,380
So I love you.

47
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,380
I love you.

48
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,780
And you know what?
I'm gonna go to bed now...

49
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,620
...but on my way to work tomorrow,
I'll stop by around 8:30. Bye.

50
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,020
Chloe, how's it coming?

51
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,570
What kind of puppy do you think
I should get?

52
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,660
Well, how about a big one?

53
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,370
-But my apartment's so--
-Then a small one.

54
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,890
-We have to go.
-Wait! Where's my shoes?

55
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,180
You need shoes?

56
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,090
-Do I know why we're rushing?
-You know my girlfriend?

57
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,220
It turns out that she wants
to get back together.

58
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,370
I found it!

59
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,580
That's so great for you guys!

60
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,220
You must be so happy!

61
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,180
Yes, I am. One of the many
things I'm feeling.

62
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,020
-Good luck with your girlfriend.
-Thank you.

63
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,740
-You got my message?
-You are right on time!

64
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,290
So can I be your girlfriend again?

65
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,980
Yes, you can. very much.

66
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,570
-Why are you mopping your ceiling?
-There's banana on it.

67
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,980
I have the spirit of an
old lndian woman living in mine.

68
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,220
So, then, you know.

69
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,490
The mailman was here,
so I brought your mail.

70
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,740
-Oh, good. Thanks.
-Now, what is Fabutech?

71
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,860
Don't judge me too much, okay?

72
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,380
I saw this infomercial,
and I swear I have never. . .

73
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,700
. . .bought anything on Tv before.

74
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,660
Except for this mop.

75
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,690
But there was this amazing stuff
on leg-waxing--

76
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,820
Waxine!

77
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,380
Yes! Have you seen it?

78
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,060
It's incredible!
I want to be a Waxine Girl!

79
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,450
I know!

80
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,060
Do you think it really doesn't hurt?
How can they do that?

81
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,540
Hello! Organic substances recently
discovered in the rain forest?

82
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,340
They have the best stuff in there.

83
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,940
Oh, my God!

84
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,620
Oh, my God!

85
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,380
We figured when we couldn't find you,
you'd gone to make up with Rachel.

86
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,660
Which is probably what
you should have done.

87
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,010
You think?

88
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,890
God, I'm in hell.
I mean, what am I gonna do?

89
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,020
Rachel's all "I love you,"
and all I can think about. . .

90
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,980
. . .is what is she gonna do
when I tell her what I did?

91
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,780
First, we should address
the more important question. . .

92
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,340
. . .how dumb are you?

93
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,100
Look, we're trying to
rebuild a relationship here, right?

94
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,780
How can I do that
without being honest?

95
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,180
I'm onboard about
the total-honesty thing. I am.

96
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,770
Just not about stuff that's
gonna get you in trouble.

97
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,220
He's right. Nobody benefits,
and you'll just hurt her.

98
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,180
And there won't be a relationship
left to rebuild.

99
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,260
Don't you think--

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,810
If you have to tell her,
at least wait till the timing's right.

101
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,980
And that's what deathbeds are for.

102
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,700
-Yeah, okay.
-All right.

103
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,860
Okay. Now, we just have to make sure
she doesn't find out some other way.

104
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,180
Did you think about the trail?

105
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,010
What trail?

106
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,980
From the woman
you did it with. . .

107
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,380
. . .to the woman you hope
never finds out you did it!

108
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,940
Always think about the trail!

109
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,970
I don't think there's any trail.

110
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,020
Chloe works with that guy, lsaac.

111
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,180
Isaac's sister is Jasmine, who works
at the massage place with Phoebe.

112
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,260
Phoebe is Rachel's friend,
and that's the trail! I did it!

113
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,820
"After applying the Waxine
and linen strips to leg--"

114
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,130
Did that!

115
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,580
"Grasp the linen strip by its tab. . .

116
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,580
. . .and pull it off in one quick,
pain-free motion. "

117
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,380
Was it not "pain-free"?

118
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,420
No, it was pain-ful!

119
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,100
My God, they should call it
"Pain-zine, now with a little wax. "

120
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,370
The girls on the commercial
don't seem to think it's that bad.

121
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,580
Because their nerves are
deadened from being so stupid.

122
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,300
But you know, if you don't
believe me, please, be my guest.

123
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,780
Now are you glad we didn't start
with the bikini strips?

124
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,460
Chloe, hi.

125
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,460
Is this about me taking your watch?

126
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,460
-You took my watch?
-I'm sorry. I do that.

127
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,620
You keep it. Listen, did you
tell anyone about us?

128
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,820
I feel like it really isn't
anybody's business.

129
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,060
Exactly. So you didn't
mention anything to lsaac?

130
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,820
-I tell lsaac everything.
-You do? Of course you do.

131
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,020
Hi, lsaac.
You know, we haven't actually met.

132
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,740
You dog!

133
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,700
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But see,
I happen to have a girlfriend.

134
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,060
Right. Rachel from the coffee place.

135
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,980
That's the one.
Listen, I don't want to hurt her.

136
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,820
I know. It doesn't matter
how much we love them.

137
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,500
Monogamy is too cruel a rule.

138
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,580
Listen, can you keep this
information to yourself?

139
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,100
No problem.
We gotta look out for each other.

140
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,020
We're the same, you and me.

141
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,500
Actually, no, we're not.

142
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,020
Yeah, we are.

143
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,300
No, we're not.

144
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,770
Yeah, we are.

145
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,020
No, we're not.

146
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,490
-Okay, we're not.
-Right.

147
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,540
But we are.

148
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,570
Fine. I just need to know
that you won't tell your sister.

149
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,570
I can promise not to tell her again.

150
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,500
Jasmine? We met at Phoebe's
birthday party. I'm Ross Geller.

151
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,900
You did a bad thing!

152
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,620
-Yes, I did.
-very bad!

153
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,660
-very bad.
-very, very bad!

154
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,820
I'm agreeing with you.

155
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,500
Listen, did you happen
to tell Phoebe yet?

156
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,490
Please. Please don't.

157
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,020
I love my girlfriend very much
and I want to work it out with her.

158
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,940
All right.

159
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,020
Thank you. Thank you.

160
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,100
But you should talk to my roommate.
I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.

161
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,690
Who's your roommate?

162
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,300
Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about
me and the girl from the copy place.

163
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,100
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,060
Was I not supposed to?

165
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,940
-We're all right.
-It's okay. It's okay.

166
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,380
-We were just waxing our legs.
-Off?

167
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,460
For your information, this is a pain
like no man will ever experience.

168
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,300
Unless you've been kicked in an area. . .

169
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,180
. . .that God only meant
to be treated nicely.

170
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,980
Women just have a lower threshold
for pain than men, that's all.

171
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,650
I mean, come on,
it's just a little wax.

172
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,490
Oh, yeah? Come here.

173
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,900
Oh, that's mature.

174
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,380
So now I just pull it off?

175
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,580
That's right.

176
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,180
Just talk to me.
Please!

177
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,300
Talk to you?
I can't even look at you right now.

178
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,900
Nothing. Nothing.

179
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,500
-She said it was okay.
-What are they talking about?

180
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,100
-Just get away from me!
-I made a mistake, okay?

181
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,180
A mistake? What were you trying
to put it in? Her purse?

182
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,460
Where did he put it?

183
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,660
You had sex with another woman!

184
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,780
Oh, my God!

185
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,260
I knew something was wrong because
my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.

186
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,460
I guess they had a fight,
and he got drunk--

187
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,380
You guys knew about this
and didn't tell us?

188
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,970
He has sex and we get hit
in our heads!

189
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,900
I want you to leave!
Just get out! Now!

190
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,900
I want to stay and talk about this.

191
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,940
All right. How was she?

192
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,780
-What?
-Was she good?

193
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,970
Don't answer that.

194
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,500
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk. How was she?

195
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,220
-She was. . . .
-Awful.

196
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,420
-She was not good.
-Horrible. Nothing compared to you.

197
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,210
She was different.

198
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,740
Good different?

199
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,940
Nobody likes change.

200
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,450
-Just stop!
-What? Okay! Okay! Okay!

201
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,410
Should we do something?

202
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,730
Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.

203
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,460
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
I was disgusted with myself. . .

204
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,140
. . .and this morning
I was upset. . .

205
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,820
. . .and then I got your
message and I was so happy.

206
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,980
And all I wanted was to get her out
of my apartment--

207
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,020
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute.

208
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,050
What time did your
little friend leave?

209
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,580
Oh, my God. She was there?
She was still there?

210
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,780
She was in there when I was in there?

211
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,100
Listen, the important thing is
she meant nothing to me.

212
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,770
And yet she was worth
jeopardizing our relationship!

213
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,420
I didn't think there was
a relationship.

214
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,860
-We'd broken up.
-We were on a break.

215
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,490
That, for all I knew, could last
forever. That is a breakup.

216
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,380
You gonna get out of this
on a technicality?

217
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,820
I'm not trying to "get out"
of anything.

218
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,780
I thought our relationship was dead.

219
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,770
Well, you sure had a hell of a time
at the wake.

220
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,500
I don't think we should listen
to this anymore.

221
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,620
What are you doing?
We can't go out.

222
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,980
Why not? I'm hungry.

223
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,900
Because they'll know
we've been listening.

224
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,020
God! And to have to hear about it
from Gunther!

225
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,850
I ran all over the place trying
to make sure that didn't happen!

226
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,940
Oh, that is so sweet.

227
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,220
I think I'm falling in love with you
all over again.

228
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,780
We can go out. They have
other things to worry about.

229
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,090
We'll be fine.

230
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,610
Rachel, I wanted to tell you.
I thought I should.

231
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,380
And then Chandler and Joey
convinced me not to!

232
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,460
Wax the door shut.
We're never leaving.

233
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,570
It's Phoebe. Someone has to take
my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak. . .

234
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,660
. . .because it's 9: 1 5 now,
and I'm not there.

235
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,820
None of this would've happened
if I didn't think. . .

236
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,260
. . .you were having sex with Mark?

237
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,530
All right.

238
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,500
Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would
you have been able to forgive me?

239
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,580
Yes, I would.

240
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,180
You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me,
and been naked with me. . .

241
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,740
. . .and made love to me?

242
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,020
If you knew that our hot, sweaty,
writhing bodies were--

243
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,010
I would have been devastated. . .

244
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,740
. . .but I would still want
to be with you.

245
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,540
Because, I mean, it's you.

246
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,420
Come on, tell me what you're thinking.

247
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,740
I'm thinking. . .

248
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,220
. . .I'm gonna order a pizza.

249
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,900
Order a pizza, like. . .

250
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,580
. . . "I forgive you"?

251
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,610
Oh, man!

252
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,170
Pizza?

253
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,820
I like pizza.

254
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,530
Put olives on the pizza.

255
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,610
We could eat the wax! It's organic!

256
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,900
Oh, great. Food with hair on it.

257
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,300
No, not the used wax.

258
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,740
Because that would be crazy?

259
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,300
Could I get in on that?
Because I'm kind of hungry myself.

260
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,530
Fine.

261
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,420
Yes, I'd like to order
a large pizza.

262
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,700
-No anchovies.
-With extra anchovies.

263
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,980
That's okay.
I'll pick them off.

264
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,380
And could you chop some up
and put it right in the sauce?

265
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
You can have the last piece
if you want.

266
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,780
Well, I should think so.
You slept with someone.

267
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,380
They're gonna get through this,
aren't they?

268
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,420
Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.

269
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,540
They've got to.

270
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,740
What if they don't?

271
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,220
You think I need a new walk?

272
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,260
What?

273
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,180
Well, I've been walking
the same way since high school.

274
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,170
You know how some guys walk into
a room and everybody takes notice?

275
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,300
I think I need a take-notice walk.

276
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,260
Are you actually saying these words?

277
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,370
What, now you're not even
talking to me?

278
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,180
Look, Rachel, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.

279
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,900
I thought I'd lost you.

280
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,020
How insane must I have been
to do something like this?

281
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,140
I don't cheat, right?
That's not me. I'm not Joey!

282
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,500
It's 3 a.m. They don't
know that I've come home yet.

283
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,580
You notice how they aren't
wondering where I am?

284
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,580
You know, people can be
so self-involved.

285
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,700
You know what? I'm not the one
that wanted that break.

286
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,410
You're the one that bailed.
You're the one. . .

287
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,730
. . .that ran the moment things
got rough.

288
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,010
-That's--
-That's what?

289
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,780
-That is neither here nor there.
-Here we are. . .

290
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,020
. . .in a spot again.
What do you want?

291
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,780
How do you want to handle it?
You want to fight for us or bail?

292
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,340
Look, I did a terrible,
stupid, stupid thing, okay?

293
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,210
I'm sorry. I wish I could
take it back, but I can't.

294
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,540
I just can't see us throwing away
something we know is so damn good.

295
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,580
I love you so much.

296
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,580
No, Ross! Don't!

297
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,020
You can't just kiss me and
make it all go away.

298
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,650
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't just make it better.

299
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,660
I think you should go.

300
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,940
What?

301
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,180
I really think you need to go now.

302
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,300
This morning you said there was
nothing we couldn't work out.

303
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,100
What the hell did I know?

304
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,220
There's got to be a way we
can work past this.

305
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,260
I can't imagine my life without you.

306
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,410
Without these arms. . .

307
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,010
. . .and your face and heart. . .

308
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
. . .your good heart, Rach, and. . . .

309
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,660
I can't. You're a totally
different person to me now.

310
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,210
I used to think of you as somebody
that would never, ever hurt me.

311
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,530
Ever.

312
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,260
Now I can't stop picturing
you with her.

313
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,010
I can't. It doesn't matter what you
say or what you do.

314
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,730
It's just changed everything.

315
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,660
Forever.

316
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,660
This can't be it.

317
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,860
Then how come it is?

318
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,890
They've been quiet for a long time.

319
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,300
Maybe she killed him.

320
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,610
Let's go.

321
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,100
Is that your new walk?

322
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,340
I really have to pee.
