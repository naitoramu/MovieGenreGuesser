1
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:42,668
<i>Stop.</i>

2
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,753
<i>I'll stop if you just
explain it to me, because I don't…</i>

3
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,129
{\an8}Would you please
just drop it?

4
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,506
{\an8}All right, all right.
Fine, fine, fine.

5
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,299
{\an8}Consider it dropped.
It's dropped. It's on the ground.

6
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,259
Good.

7
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,096
But, I mean, come on,
everybody loves birthdays.

8
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,473
You got decorations,
you got balloons,

9
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,808
you got parties and cake.

10
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,769
Look. I don't need presents,
I don't want decorations,

11
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,479
and I'm not a cake guy.

12
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,647
Seriously, though,
you don't like cake?

13
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,817
Name one food
better than cake.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,985
Guinea pig.

15
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,611
Again, with the guinea pig.

16
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,613
I bet if I blindfolded you,

17
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,031
you wouldn't be able to tell

18
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,450
the difference between
a skunk and a guinea pig.

19
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,618
Wrong.

20
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,955
Snakes have impeccable taste buds.
I can taste air.

21
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,999
-Air?
-Yes. Air.

22
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,251
Mmm.

23
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,377
Nice.

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,629
I don't know.
They're a little, uh…

25
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,047
They're a little cute
for my taste.

26
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,425
That's what makes them
so delicious.

27
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,012
You're not just eating food,
you're eating pure goodness.

28
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,680
It's not about the pig.

29
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,892
It's about what it symbolizes
on a deeper level.

30
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,020
So, you can…
You can taste air?

31
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,897
-Ah. Forget about it.
-What else you got?

32
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,940
Wait, wait, wait.
Can you also hear color?

33
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,317
All right, all right.

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,443
-Can you see sound?
-Okay.

35
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,361
'Cause we should really be
capitalizing on these skills.

36
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,613
Okay, all right, fine.

37
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,948
-Get it all out. Get it all out now.
-Okay, okay.

38
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,035
Look at that. 4:00 p.m.

39
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,621
Now I know the exact moment
our friendship died.

40
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,166
-Let's bounce.
-Yep.

41
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,961
{\an8}Tastes like, uh, you're gonna
stick me with the bill… again.

42
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,839
Well, it is my birthday.

43
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,467
{\an8}So, now you play the birthday card?
That's interesting.

44
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,012
{\an8}Can we get a check, please,
when you get a chance?

45
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,098
{\an8}Hello?
Checkity-check-check.

46
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,100
You know what?

47
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,270
We're just gonna leave
the money right here, okay?

48
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,689
You know the one good thing
about this place?

49
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,900
-What?
-We never have to wait for a table.

50
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,193
Well, isn't that every place?

51
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,903
Hey, man. How you been?
I haven't seen you…

52
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,821
Snake attack!

53
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,490
Oh! Mints.

54
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,659
Sorry, folks.
I'm switching him to decaf.

55
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,329
- All right.
- Let's do this.

56
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,427
Guinea pig, huh?

57
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,263
It's the Rolls Royce of rodents.

58
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,974
Yeah, but it's still a rodent.
You know what I mean?

59
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,519
Don't mind us,
just robbin' this place.

60
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,160
-Whoo! Yeah! Go bad…
-Or go home.

61
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,377
Hey, you. Get over here.

62
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,379
Little bit closer.

63
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,716
Oh, I know what it is.

64
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,553
You're afraid.
Because I'm the big, bad wolf.

65
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,182
<i>Well, I'm not surprised.
I am the villain in every story.</i>

66
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,976
- Isn't that right, Mr. Snake?
- Yep.

67
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,395
Say hello to Mr. Snake.

68
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,190
<i>Serpentine, safecrackin' machine.</i>

69
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,317
<i>Imagine Houdini, but with no arms.</i>

70
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,737
<i>Kinda guy who'd tell ya the glass
is half empty, then steal it from ya.</i>

71
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,657
He's also my best bud,
and today's his birthday!

72
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,867
Not relevant.

73
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,203
He's a sweetheart.
You're a sweetheart.

74
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,747
Well, look who's here.

75
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,956
Took 'em long enough.

76
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,755
Watch this.

77
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,509
Three… Two…

78
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,635
One.

79
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,721
And over here is Ms. Tarantula.

80
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,057
{\an8}<i>Our in-house hacker,
pocket search engine,</i>

81
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,558
{\an8}<i>our traveling tech wizard.</i>

82
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,185
<i>We call her "Webs."</i>

83
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,442
Very slick, Webs.

84
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,194
I also took over the police dispatch,

85
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,862
blurred their
satellite imaging system,

86
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,823
grounded their chopper,
and one more thing…

87
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,033
You didn't.

88
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,743
I got a special delivery for…

89
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,038
Whoa, don't eat me!
Please, don't eat me!

90
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,832
Happy birthday,
Mr. Grumpypants.

91
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,543
I think I hate you.

92
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,679
-Ooh!
-Oh!

93
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,058
Guys! It's me!

94
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,476
I was the construction worker!

95
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,355
<i>And this is Mr. Shark,
master of disguise.</i>

96
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,024
<i>Apex predator of a thousand faces.</i>

97
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,193
<i>His greatest trick?</i>

98
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,822
<i>Stealing the</i> Mona Lisa,
<i>disguised as the Mona Lisa.</i>

99
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,073
Dig that.

100
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,951
Watch it, big tuna.
I'm tryin' to work here.

101
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,162
Keep it cool, baby.
Birthdays should be chill.

102
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,624
<i>And rounding out the crew…</i>

103
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,004
Surprise!

104
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,339
<i>…is Mr. Piranha.</i>

105
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,841
- <i>He's a loose cannon…

106
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,844
<i>…with a short fuse, willing to scrap
with anyone or anything.</i>

107
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,095
<i>He's brave.</i>

108
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,931
- <i>He's fearless.

109
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,100
<i>Uh, who am I kidding? He's crazy.</i>

110
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,565
Uh, Piranha,
did we forget something?

111
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,276
-What?
-The present. You know?

112
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,862
Oh, um, of course I didn't forget.

113
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,948
You know you fart
when you lie, right?

114
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,742
What? No, I fart when I'm nervous.

115
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,869
Yeah. Nervous about lying.

116
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:09,953
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,788
Piranha!

118
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,624
Don't breathe it in.
I breathed it in!

119
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,044
<i>Yeah, they're a bit eccentric,
but when you're born us,</i>

120
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,755
<i>you don't exactly win
many popularity contests.</i>

121
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,839
Shark!

122
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,341
A shark!

123
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,843
Do I wish people
didn't see us as monsters?

124
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,136
Eight legs, eight times the cardio!

125
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,096
- Spider!
<i>- Sure, I do.</i>

126
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,223
What's up, papa?

127
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,934
But these are the cards we've been
dealt, so we might as well play them.

128
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,560
Jackpot!

129
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,645
Yes!

130
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,031
Um…

131
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,534
-What the thorax?
-Are you crazy?

132
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,161
What? I just wanted
a longer car chase.

133
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,579
It's the best part.

00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,212
Seriously?

161
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,173
Snake, come on.
At least make a toast.

162
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,966
-Toast.
-Come on.

163
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,718
-Okay, all right, a toast.
-Yeah!

164
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,886
Fine.

165
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,929
I've made a lot of enemies
in my time.

166
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,472
I mean, a lot!

167
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,600
But out of all the people
in the world,

168
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,561
I hate you guys the least.

169
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,229
That was actually
kind of beautiful.

170
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,314
You a poet, man.

171
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:09,568
To Mr. Snake
and his strange dislike of birthdays.

172
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,656
Everyone say, "Robbery!"

173
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,533
Robbery!

174
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,578
Look at those dimples.

175
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,913
Happy birthday, buddy.

176
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,581
Okay. Now, dig in, fellas.

177
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,874
Yes!

178
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,459
-No, no, no!
-Piranha!

179
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,170
- Don't do that.
- That was so gross.

180
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,755
That was my lunch.

181
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,924
You snooze, you lose.

182
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,258
You like that.

183
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,677
Nice.

184
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,639
Ooh! Wow!

185
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,432
I forgot we had those Push Pops.

186
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:43,185
Man, my tummy is rumblin'
like a kraken right now.

187
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,978
Yeah. Want it?

188
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,231
You know he's not
gonna give it to you.

189
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:51,610
No. I believe that, deep down,
Snake is a kind and generous soul.

190
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,737
Why?

191
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,906
Here. Take it.

192
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,408
Oh, yeah! Pop me, please.

193
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,539
- Sucker.
- Come on, man!

194
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,541
Now you're gonna make me
get all aggressive.

195
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,087
-Animals.
-Spit it out! Spit it out!

00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,538
Actually, the Crimson Paw

00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,873
Yeah, but he never stole
anything again.

245

Snake, what better way

00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,503
the governor's fuzzy face,

247

than stealin' the Golden Dolphin
from right under her whiskers?

248
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,509
This is the holy grail of thievery.

249
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,760
If we pull this off,

250

Whoa, whoa, buddy.

Good.

Yes, did I not mention that?
That's weird.

00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,749
The Good Samaritan is…

263
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,001

Trashy, pointless and pretentious.

Hmm. They say that art reveals

00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,228
crude disguises,
compulsive showboating.

317
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,646
I mean, it was a mess.

318
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,482
All the classic signs
of a crew in decline.

319
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,485
Next, they're gonna make it personal.

320
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,863
That's when you know they're toast.

321
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,658
Uh, well, that's your opinion.

322
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,785
It is. And I'm the governor.

323
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:38,582
As for the sculpture,
I think it's about perspective.

324
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,126
If you look closely enough,

325
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,379
even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful.

326
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,925
How about that.

327
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,553
I guess some things
aren't always as they appear.

328
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,431
That reminds me, may I?

329
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,809
I can't miss a photo op with
the governor and a pile of garbage.

330
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,729
Mr. Poodleton,
you're too hard on yourself.

331
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:01,855
Hey…

332
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,401
Okay, friends.

333
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,237
It's showtime.

334
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,324
<i>Once we're in,
it's on to step three.</i>

335
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,367
<i>We split up
and we take our positions.</i>

336
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,704
Officers, if the Bad Guys
crash this event,

337
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,540
I am definitely going to lose my job.

338
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:24,294
And I will not hesitate to
take you down with me.

339
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,462
Now, move out!

340
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:26,964
Yes, ma'am!
Hut, hut, hut, hut!

341
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,341
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut!

342
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,358
Mic's on.
Everyone on comms, do you copy?

343
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,442
-Copy.
-Copy.

344
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:48,902
-Copy.
-Copy.

345
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,464
A drink for the pretty lady?

346
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,843
No, thank you.
My life is too complicated right now.

347
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:13,927
Uh…

348
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,457
Boys, it's dolphin season.

349
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,045
Copy that. I'm on the move.

350
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,299
Unit Two,
is the backstage area still secure?

351
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,467
<i>Unit Two. All clear.</i>

352
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,761
This is where
all the training pays off.

353
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,055
Pardon me. Terribly sorry.

354
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,681
Not a problem, sir.

355
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,600
Keep your eyes open, boys.

356
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,978
They could be anywhere,
just waiting to humiliate us.

357
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,566
Wolf is in position.

358
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,277
<i>Piranha,
you all penguin-suited and booted?</i>

359
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:16,073
Affirmative. I'm a clean, mean
dolphin-stealin' machine.

360
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,491
What's goin' on, guys?

361
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,160
Here, let me help you.

362
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,580
Are you okay, ma'am?

363
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:07,708
My gracious, yes.

364
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,378
I may be dizzy, but I'm alive!
Thanks to you.

365
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,504
What are you…

366
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,423
Oh.

367
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,926
Thank you, dear.

368
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,055
You're such a good boy.

369
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,160
All good, brother?

370
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,872
Yeah, all good. Yeah, yeah.

371
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,123
Um…

372
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,626
Webs, what do you say
about movin' on to step four?

373
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,587
Copy that. Shark, you're up.

374
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,796
Do your thing.

375
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,715
-<i>Do I get to improvise?
</i>-<i>Yes, fine.</i>

376
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,051
Improvise. But please be subtle.

377
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,182
I'm having a baby!

378
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,433
Is there a doctor?

379
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,602
Or perhaps several security guards

380
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,812
that could leave their post
and help me?

381
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,084
"Fish surprise"?

382
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:34,711
Surprise!

383
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,346
Hey, Webs,
can you enhance this…

384
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,348
<i>Done.
Eight steps ahead of you, Wolfie.</i>

385
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,190
- Ah.
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

386
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:58,402
<i>your MC for
the Good Samaritan Awards…</i>

387
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,822
<i>All right, Shark, we're in.</i>

388
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,657
Oops, I forgot. I'm not pregnant.

389
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:06,201
<i>…president of the committee,</i>

390
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,579
<i>Governor Diane Foxington.</i>

391
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,373
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

392
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,624
Thank you.

393
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,795
Last year, we faced our biggest test

394
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:20,549
when a meteorite crashed
into our dear city.

395
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,969
That meteorite didn't just make
a hole in our city,

396
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,013
it made a hole in our hearts.

397
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,097
Aw.

398
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,975
But even in tragedy,
Professor Marmalade,

399
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,643
he did what he does so well.

400
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:34,354
He made us
look at things differently.

401
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,064
And thanks to you, Marmalade,

402
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,234
the Love Crater Meteorite
will forever serve

403
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,111
as a symbol of how there is good,

404
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:43,655
even in the worst places.

405
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,450
Whoo!

406
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:57,503
Hurry up.

407
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,798
<i>And successfully reversed
climate change</i>

408
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,967
<i>for the well-being of all of us.</i>

409
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,929
This is going surprisingly smoothly.

410
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,439
What the molt is that?

411
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:20,609
The Wolf-Piranha-Snake-Shark-
Tarantula Protection System.

412
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,986
- <i>The W.P.S.S.T.?
</i>-This was not supposed to happen.

413
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,031
-What?
-Guys, calm down. I'm on it.

414
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,283
Initiating
W.P.S.S.T. Override Protocol.

415
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:30,827
Get it, queen!

416
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,748
- <i>Did it work?
</i>-Just give me five minutes.

417
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:35,791
<i>And now,</i>

418
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,085
please join me in welcoming
to the stage…

419
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,795
We don't have five minutes.

420
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,839
…Professor Marmalade!

421
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:43,131
Oh.

422
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,384
We love you,
Professor Marmalade!

423
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,593
The pig is on the move.

424
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:49,054
I repeat, the pig is on the move.

425
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,138
<i>Webs, Webs!</i>

426
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,766
-The curtain's going up any minute!
-It's not letting me in.

427
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,101
Check your system preferences.

428
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,561
You probably need to
download a driver.

429
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:56,562
Try rebooting.

430
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,230
Oh, my gosh, you fixed it.

431
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,982
- <i>Really?
</i>-No!

432
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:01,108
Hey, Larry.

433
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:04,194
Come on, open up.
What did we say about lockin' doors?

434
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,655
No, no, no.
Shark, I got a situation here.

435
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:07,990
<i>Copy that. I'm on my way.</i>

436
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,326
Hurry up, guys.

437
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,453
Time to turn this baby on beast mode.

438
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:17,541
Eat it, W.P.S.S.T.

439
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,423
Please, not now.

440
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,175
- Wolf!
- Wait, wait, wait. No, Piranha!

441
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,759
This award is for…

442
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,014
As I was saying…

443
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:35,058
No, no, no.

444
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,273
Piranha! Are you kidding me?

445
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:42,232
Sorry!

446
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,526
And that's why
my Gala for Goodness

447
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,404
will raise all the money needed
for those less fortunate.

448
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,655
Come on!

449
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,659

<i>Webs! Webs!</i>

451

we've all been waiting for.

452
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:01,710
Whoa!

453
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,807
Excuse me.
Is this the ladies' room?

454
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:20,521
Oh, uh, you need to take a right
at the end of the hall, ma'am.

455
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,731
Whoa.

456
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,861
Yes! Whoop-bam!

457
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,322
Oh, come on!

And now, it is my honor to award
Professor Marmalade

459
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:38,914

00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,251
-No!
-No!

00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,087
Yes! I mean, yes!

00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,005
What?

463
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,847
Everyone, everyone,
please don't panic.

464
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,515
Just stay calm.

I'm sure
there's an explanation for this.

466

I repeat, please do not panic.

467

Nice work, everybody.

Diane, Diane, if I may…

472
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,661
You have to understand,

473
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:21,248
I didn't bring hope back to the city
for an award.

474
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,918
I did these good things
because of how they made me feel.

475
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:28,005
That tingly feeling I get.
That shiver up my spine.

476
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,091
The wag in my tiny tail.

477
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:33,844
Because you see,

478
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:38,140
being good just feels so good.

479
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:41,435
And when you're good, you're loved.

480
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,606
-Huh?
-Wolf?

481
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,024
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

482
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,108
- Go!
- Go!

483
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,903
It's the Bad Guys!

484
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,154
Arrest them!

485
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,448
Hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut!

486
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,912
They stole the Golden Dolphin!

487
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,997
Come on, you can't prove that.

488
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,043
My baby!

489
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,921
On your knees, Bad Guys,
with your hands up!

490
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,173
Never! We're outta here.

491
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:15,928
So long, suckers!

492
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:24,728
Well, this just got a little weird.

493
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,899
{\an8}<i>The Bad Guys go bust!</i>

494
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:32,069
{\an8}<i>The nefarious fivesome
has finally been captured.</i>

495
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,780
{\an8}<i>And I, Tiffany Fluffit,
am first on the scene.</i>

496
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,865
Wow. You know, I just realized

497
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:40,118
that I have devoted my entire
adult life to putting you in jail.

498
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:41,787
You are my purpose.

499
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,872
Without you, who am I?

500
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:45,040
I'm just kiddin'!

501
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,626
This is the best moment of my life!

502
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,838
It's the end of the Bad Guys.

503
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:52,339
No!

504
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,424
Get your hands off of me.

505
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,802
You're begging for
a bitin' right now.

506
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,053
Wolf!

507
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:04,142
Professor Marmalade!
Madam Governor!

508
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,310
Professor Marmalade!

509
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:07,813
-Madam Governor! Madam Governor!
-One at a time. One at a time.

510
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,400
-Hey. Hey!
-Excuse me.

511
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,360
Sorry to interrupt,

512
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,154
I just wanted to congratulate
the governor here.

513
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:18,949
I gotta say,
you really got us pegged.

514
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:23,287
We're just a deep well
of anger and self-loathing.

515
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,080
- Denial.
- Sure. That too.

516
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,373
- Narcissism.
- Yeah. Yeah.

517
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:27,708
Emotional emptiness.

518
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,126
So, we're on the same page.

519
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,253
What is he doin'?

520
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:34,381
Sadly, we were never given a chance

521
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:37,843
to be anything more
than second-rate criminals.

522
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,970
If only there was someone

523
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:44,349
who could help the flower of goodness
inside us blossom.

524
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:47,311
Some icon of love
and forgiveness, like…

525
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,105
I don't know, Mother Teresa.

526
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:53,108
Best thing is
to just throw us in jail

527
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:55,152
for the rest of our hopeless lives.

528
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,070
Yeah, that's the plan.

529
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,239
Wait, wait! No, no!

530
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,074
-Get in there.
-Ow!

531
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,744
Wait!

532
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,204
B-Beg pardon?

533
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,414
Mr. Wolf may be a savage beast.

534
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:08,999
Basically, walking garbage.

535
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,417
Sorry, I'm making a point.

536
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,085
Do what you need to do, pal.

537
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:16,715
But how can we say they're hopeless
if they've never been given a chance?

538
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:17,841
What if…

539
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:19,843
What if we tried
a little experiment, Diane?

540
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,221
As you know,
my Gala for Goodness…

541
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,183
the #Charity Event of the Year
is coming up.

542
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,811
If I can prove to everyone at that
gala that the Bad Guys have changed,

543
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:32,689
will you set them free
and give them a clean start?

544
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,193
What? Professor Marmalade!

545
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,319
No, no, no.

546
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,780
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's playing you!

547
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,031
But it was my idea.

548
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,241
It was his idea.

549
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:44,326
But only because
you made him have it!

550
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,787
Madam Governor,
you can't just let them go.

551
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,623
Professor, I'm not about to put
the safety of the city on the line

552
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,166
for an experiment.

553
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,918
Excuse me, Madam Governor.

554
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:56,505
I seem to remember that
a wise person once said,

555
00:29:56,588 --> 00:30:00,592
"Even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful."

556
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:05,931
Okay. I'm game.

557
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:08,392
But only because it's you, Professor.

558
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,434
No!

559
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,020
We'll hold onto the dolphin
until the gala,

560
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:15,315
just to remove
any unnecessary temptation.

561
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,526
Of course. Good thinking.

562
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,611
That's why you're governor.

563
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,864
Now that everyone's happy…

564
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:23,448
Not happy.

565
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:28,161
…I, Rupert Marmalade the Fourth,
will turn the Bad Guys into

566
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:29,913
the Good Guys!

567
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,249
Ooh!

568
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:36,920
I think these belong to you.

569
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,005
Hey!

570
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:41,508
Not everyone
gets a second chance.

571
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,470
Make the most of it, Mr. Poodleton.

572
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:56,982
Wolf.

573
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,317
What are you doing?

574
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,818
- What?
- Yeah.

575
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:01,320
Oh, that!

576
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,740
I'm sorry, I thought it was obvious.

577
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,742
We're gonna go good.

578
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,037
Uh, you totally lost me.

579
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,164
I told him to stop drinkin'
out of the toilet.

580
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,166
Hey, did you get hit on the head?

581
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,334
What? No, I didn't get…

582
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,294
My cousin got hit on the head
with an anchor,

583
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,213
and after that,
he only swam in a circle.

584
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,215
No, guy, guys, guys.
You're not following me.

585
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,259
We're gonna pretend to go good.

586
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,094
Just a few days with Marmalade.

587
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:30,098
And then,
we roll into the gala as good guys

588
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:33,435
and roll out scot-free with…

589
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,355
The Golden Dolphin!

590
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:37,564
You got it.

591
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:39,858
Since when do we not finish a job?

592
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:43,237
The Bad Guys become the Good Guys

593
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,657
so we can stay the bad guys.

594
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,742
You know what I'm saying?

595
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,744
Bad guys acting good?

596
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,664
It's the ultimate bad-guy thing.
It's fantastic.

597
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,374
Wolf, you're a genius!

598
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,503
It's gonna be, like,
the most relaxing con ever.

599
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:00,921
Like a vacation.

600
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:03,382
Oh, oh-oh-oh! A con-cation.

601
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,512
My parents met on a con-cation!

602
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,194
Oh, goody!

603
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:25,612
Wow!

604
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,281
Big and fancy.

605
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:30,075
Rodent's got taste. Okay!

606
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,536
Almost makes me wanna be cute.

607
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:36,039
They say experience
is the best teacher.

608
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:38,041
And they are wrong.

609
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,126
I am.

610
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:41,670
Good morning,
students of goodness.

611
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:46,758
And welcome to the first day
of the rest of your best life.

612
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,177
A giant butt!

613
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,761
Huh?

614
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:51,471
Uh, it's-- it's not a butt.

615
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:55,225
It's a lamp in the shape
of the Love Crater Meteorite,

616
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:56,268
my greatest…

617
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:57,436
I wonder whose butt it is.

618
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,770
Uh…

619
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:01,648
Once again,
it's not a butt, thank you.

620
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:02,774
It's a heart.

621
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:04,735
-Now, as I was saying…
-Then why does it have cheeks?

622
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:05,819
-Shut it!
-What?

623
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,196
I've never seen a heart
with cheeks.

624
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,656
- It's not a…
- Booty!

625
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,742
It's not a butt! Not a butt!

626
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,452
Does he know what a butt is?

627
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,954
As I was saying,

628
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:18,832
on the outside,
the five of you are villains,

629
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:21,001
predators,
remorseless sociopaths.

630
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,961
Oh, stop,
you're makin' me blush.

631
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:25,005
But inside, there's a flower.

632
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,798
The flower of goodness.

633
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,175
And when it blooms

634
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:30,427
and you feel that tingle
of positivity

635
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:32,262
radiating through your body,

636
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:35,224
you're going to want to feel it
all the time.

637
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:36,975
So, we're going for a tingle?

638
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,310
Not any tingle.

639
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:39,895
The tingle of goodness.

640
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:44,149
Which you'll feel in my
state-of-the-art Sharing Laboratory!

641
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,945
Okay, Mr. Snake,
I'm going to give you a Push Pop.

642
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:50,572
Great! Push Pop just for me!

643
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:52,241
No, to share.

644
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,325
Why?

645
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,452
Well, on a fundamental level,

646
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:58,705
it's about putting someone else's
needs ahead of your own.

647
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:01,500
Oh, no. No way.

648
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,751
Snake…

649
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:06,171
All right, all right.

650
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:08,382
This is gonna taste extra sweet,

651
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,926
'cause I know how bad you want it.

652
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,931
Pop me, please. Ah!

653
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:20,601
Nope!

654
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:23,355
-Sucker!
-That's it! I'll teach you to share!

655
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,609
I like sharin'. It's yummy. Mmm.

656
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,610
Totally worth it.

657
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:31,780
Well, that's terrifying.

658
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,991
Let's try something simpler.

659
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,953
A good person always pays attention
to the needs of others.

660
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:40,581
Now, here's a kindly, frail grandma.

661
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,253
Mr. Piranha,
help Grandma across the street.

662
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:48,630
Pish! Sure, sure, sure.
I do this all the time.

663
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:51,091
Here you go, ma'am.

664
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,511
Oh, he is totally gonna blow it.

665
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:56,847
What was that? What did you say?

666
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,891
-You think I can't do this?
-No, no, no, Piranha…

667
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,022
Maybe simpler?

668
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:10,110
Hey, look!
It's a cat stuck in a tree.

669
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:11,987
It doesn't get
much simpler than that.

670
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,116
Now, what in this scenario
would give you that good tingle?

671
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,953
Eating it? This is why I always carry
two pieces of bread with me.

672
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:23,832
No. I want you to s…

673
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,042
-Smack it.
-Skin it?

674
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:25,959
Stab it.

675
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:27,044
-Sauté it.
-Sing to it?

676
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,379
Save it. I want you to save…

677
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,840
It's so obvious…
I want you to save it.

678
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:34,259
Oh! Right, right.

679
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:37,763
Here, kitty, kitty cat!

680
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,225
Whoa,
that cat is obviously defective.

681
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:44,311
What is wrong with you?
You're gonna give it a heart attack.

682
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:45,771
I'll handle this.

683
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:47,773
What's up, papa!

684
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:53,195
Get him off my face!
He's on my face!

685
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:55,322
No, no, no! Listen.
What are you doing?

686
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,747
Okay. What, may I ask,
are you good at?

687
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,750
-Stealing stuff?
-Oh, yeah, we're great at that.

688
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:07,876
-Robbery.
-Larceny.

689
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,002
-Wire fraud.
-Extortion.

690
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:10,254
-Tax evasion.
-Heists.

691
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,381
- Mail fraud.
- Wait. "Heists," you say?

692
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:14,716
Well, that's…
Yeah, that's kind of our specialty.

693
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,386
I might just have an idea.

694
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,889
Free the pigs! Free the pigs!

695
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,975
That is an animal testing lab.

696
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:26,186
Within, 200,000 helpless guinea pigs,

697
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:30,232
all being poked and prodded
by sadistic scientists.

698
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:31,692
Guinea pigs, you say?

699
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,110
Snake…

700
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:34,528
I want you to rescue them.

701
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,780
But this is a heist for good.

702
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:40,158
So, I brought something
more friendly for you to wear.

703
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:41,451
Bye.

704
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,288
Well, there goes our street cred.

705
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,164
At least it's comfy.

706
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,752
All right,
we need to distract that scientist.

707
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:52,963
-Shark, you're up.
-Copy that.

708
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:55,465
Okay. We're gonna need
a rope and a hook.

709
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:56,633
I got this one.

710
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:57,801
-What?
-You're volunteering?

711
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,845
You've never volunteered
for anything.

712
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,930
Sure I did. Right now.

713
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:04,600
-Throw me up there! Giddy up!
-Really?

714
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:07,269
Yep.
I'm 99% sure you can make it.

715
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,104
-Okay.
-Let's do it!

716
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,441
-Hey there, son.
-Dad?

717
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,234
I know you've got an important job,

718
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:16,737
but I hope you still have time
for a catch with your old man.

719
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:20,282
- Hey, kiddo.
- 96% sure.

720
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,242
You'll always be my special boy.

721
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:24,912
Maybe 90%.

722
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:27,664
I've been waiting my entire life
for this moment.

723
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,750
- Okay, then. Now, go long.
- Ow! I don't know.

724
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,503
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Thank you, Daddy!

725
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,882
Ow! Fifty? What day is it?

726
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,425
Who am I?

727
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:42,262
Right. The guinea pigs are locked
behind a three-foot thick steel door.

728
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:44,139
The only way in
is through the vents.

729
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:45,891
I got it.

730
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:47,267
Upsy-daisy!

731
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:48,810
♪ <i>Over the filters
And through the vents… ♪</i>

732
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:51,605
I have never seen him so chipper.
Has he been meditating?

733
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:54,107
♪ <i>To Guinea Pig Land we…</i> ♪

734
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,698
Oh.

735
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:03,909
Snake attack.

736
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:06,954
Hey, look! It's Professor Marmalade.

737
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:10,791
Yes, that's right.
It's me. Help has arrived.

738
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:13,210
Just keep your eyes
glued to that door.

739
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:15,546
Snake. Come on, Snake, open up.

740
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:19,633
Relax. These doors are complicated.

741
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,718
Are you kidding me?

742
00:38:21,802 --> 00:38:23,136
What do you think you're doing?

743
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,097
We're supposed to save them,
not eat them.

744
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,808
Well, I'd say
they've gone to a better place.

745
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,143
That's it.

746
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:31,854
Spit them out!

747
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,148
We're gonna save you
whether you like it or not.

748
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:36,733
We're saving you, stupid hair balls.

749
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:38,777
Not that door. The other door.

750
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:40,904
Hey, hey!

751
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,365
Any second.

752
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,878
It's not what it looks like.

753
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:05,304
"Trespassing,
burglary, mayhem,

754
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:08,223
assault with a deadly reptile"?

755
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:11,185
As if those poor rodents
haven't been through enough already!

756
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,519
No, Diane. Please.

757
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:17,107
Whoo! Okay. I'm sorry, Professor,
but I'm calling the chief.

758
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:19,318
- Please. Come on.
- This experiment is over.

759
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,737
- Experiments take time.
- You couldn't help yourself?

760
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,363
So I had a moment of weakness.
Sue me.

761
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,115
That's gonna be difficult
to do from prison!

762
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,284
Guys! What do we do now?

763
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:32,789
Hmph.
Time to launch a charm offensive.

764
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:35,918
Oh, yeah. The full Clooney.

765
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,129
Madam Governor. Diane.

766
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,423
Do not Clooney me, Wolf.

767
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,634
I see what's going on.
You think I'm still a bad guy

768
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:46,053
tryin' to bamboozle my way
to freedom.

769
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,262
But we've changed.

770
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,973
That flower of goodness
is blossoming all over the place.

771
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,768
Don't you ever get tired of lying?

772
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,144
No.

773
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,312
I mean…

774
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,814
Fudge.
That was a trick question, right?

775
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:00,400
I gave you an opportunity.

776
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:01,985
A chance to show the world

777
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,279
that you're more
than just a scary stereotype,

778
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:08,867
but you're too proud or too gutless
to take advantage of it.

779
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,119
Gutless? I'm gutless?

780
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,539
Oh-ho-ho!
I'm sorry, have we met?

781
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,290
I'm the villain of every story.

782
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:16,792
Guilty until proven innocent.

783
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,545
Even if by some miracle
we did change,

784
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,713
who's gonna believe us, huh?

785
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:23,507
Of course you wouldn't know
anything about that

786
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,510
with your Little-Miss-Perfect
power suits.

787
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:29,513
Is that so?

788
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:33,016
Wait a second, what did…
How did you…

789
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,478
A wolf and a fox
are not so different.

790
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:40,649
Maybe they will believe you,
maybe they won't.

791
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,025
But it doesn't matter.

792
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:44,778
Don't do it for them.
Do it for you.

793
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:47,239
This is a chance
to write your own story,

794
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:49,825
to find a better life for you
and your friends.

795
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,661
Come on,
what have you got to lose?

796
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:54,454
I don't know. My dignity?

797
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:59,209
Yeah, well,
that ship has already sailed.

798
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:07,843
Believe it or not,
I'm rootin' for you, Wolf.

799
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:10,804
So you're not gonna call the chief?

800
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,390
I'll see you at the gala.

801
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:52,346
I think we got off
to a bad start.

802
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:53,889
The name's Wolf.

803
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,393
Yep.

804
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:01,522
I get that a lot,
first impressions and all.

805
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:06,401
No, no, no!

806
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:16,828
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

807
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:19,331
I know you're scared.
I would be, too, if I were you.

808
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,459
Just give me a chance.

809
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:26,922
Truth is,
we actually have a lot in common.

810
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,215
Don't tell anyone,

811
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:34,137
but I love a little scratch
on the spot behind my ears.

812
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:35,639
You know, right there.

813
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:37,766
The best.

814
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:44,565
Come on, kitty.

815
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:06,044
Yeah. Who's a good kitty?

816
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:07,713
- Who's a good kitty?
- Uh, Wolf?

817
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:10,632
Um, you saved him?

818
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:11,967
Yes!

819
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:15,220
Yes, it's working.

820
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:16,597
You filmed that?

821
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,683
Yes, and they're starting
to like you.

822
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,643
-Yes!
-All right!

823
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,855
This might just be enough
to win over the guests at the gala.

824
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:26,857
-Now we're talking!
-All right!

825
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,651
Yeah, we did it! All right!

826
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:31,737
Uh, Wolf?

827
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,156
I must say,
you've really turned a corner.

828
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,033
- You're really getting it.
- Really?

829
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:37,826
Oh, thanks.

830
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,787
No, I mean it.
I can see it from tip to tail.

831
00:43:42,372 --> 00:43:44,917
It's just a shame that
you have to carry all that baggage.

832
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:47,878
What are you talk…
You mean the guys?

833
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:49,755
What do you mean?

834
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,298
You have great potential, Wolf.

835
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:53,175
But at some point,
you're going to have to choose

836
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:54,927
between your friends

837
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,178
or the good life.

838
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:07,189
Hey. You still awake?

839
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:10,776
You… You brought the cat in?

840
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,861
Yeah. Yeah.

841
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:14,905
I'm just savin' it up for later.

842
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:15,948
Why, what's up?

843
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:18,867
I was just gettin' a little worried

844
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:21,328
since you've kinda become a…

845
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:22,454
Become a what?

846
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:24,748
You know, teacher's pet.

847
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,251
Gettin' all cozy with Marmalade.

848
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:29,294
Your tail waggin' and everything.

849
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:31,797
Well, yeah,
because it has to be believable.

850
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,508
Uh-huh. Yeah, I guess so.

851
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,760
As long as it's all part of the plan.

852
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,347
It is all part of the plan, isn't it?

853
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,851
Snake, buddy,
who made the plan to begin with?

854
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:44,935
You did.

855
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:48,564
So I'm the one who sticks to the plan
the most, right?

856
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:52,109
Yeah, all right. Yeah, okay.

857
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:54,027
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

858
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:59,491
But if the plan were ever to change,
you'd tell me, right?

859
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:03,871
You have my word.

860
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:05,789
Go bad…

861
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:08,250
Or go home.

862
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:18,135
Hey, Snake.

863
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:19,303
Yeah?

864
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:21,180
You ever wonder what it'd be like?

865
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:24,558
The world loving us
instead of being scared of us?

866
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,310
You ever… You ever think about that?

867
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,603
Loving us?

868
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,479
Yeah, right.

869
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:33,233
I don't waste time thinkin' about
stuff that's never gonna happen.

870
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:37,196
I can't wait for things
to get back to normal.

871
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:47,164
Yeah. Back to normal, back to normal.

872
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:58,133
{\an8}<i>What up!
We are just moments away</i>

873
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:00,802
{\an8}<i>from Professor Marmalade's
Gala for Goodness,</i>

874
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:03,013
{\an8}<i>where the legendary
Love Crater Meteorite</i>

875

{\an8}<i>will be on display

about is the Bad Guys</i>

877
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,980
{\an8}<i>whose heart-melting rescue video</i>

878
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:15,442
{\an8}<i>has made them

879
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:19,279
All right, guys, this is the big one.

880
00:46:19,363 --> 00:46:21,740
The Golden Dolphin
is inside a titanium case

881
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:24,701
<i>controlled by a randomly generated
five-digit code--</i>

882
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:27,579
<i>a code kept safe and secure
inside a briefcase</i>

883
00:46:27,663 --> 00:46:29,289
<i>handcuffed to the chief of police.</i>

884
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,208
<i>She's not messin' around.</i>

885
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:34,211
<i>The code is only accessible
with her authorized fingerprints.</i>

886
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:35,504
<i>Leave that to me.</i>

887
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:38,215
<i>While Snake gets the code,
Shark will secure the fake Dolphin.</i>

888
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:39,550
<i>I like the sound of that.</i>

889
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,635
<i>Meanwhile, the rest of us
plant circuit jammers.</i>

891
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:46,515
<i>At the end of the night,
we toast the professor…</i>

892
00:46:46,598 --> 00:46:47,766
<i>Blah-blah-blah, yada yada…</i>

893
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,435
<i>and when I say "Marmalade,"
the lights go out,</i>

894
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,938
<i>and we'll have exactly four seconds
to make our move.</i>

895
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:55,440
<i>The old switcheroo.</i>

896
00:46:55,524 --> 00:46:58,193
<i>Chief hands Marmalade
the fake Dolphin.</i>

897
00:46:58,277 --> 00:46:59,403

898
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,321

899
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:03,615

900
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:05,409

901
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:08,579

902
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:09,830

903
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:13,000

You're a real artist.

904
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:18,297

you didn't do it. How could you?

The old lady, the Golden Dolphin,

1070

It was all to get us here

1071
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:22,007
so he could steal the meteorite
and let us take the fall.

1072

Whoa, what old lady?

1073

Uh, guys? He's creepin' me out.

1075
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:32,935
Wait, what?

1076
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:35,020

1079
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:41,944
You stole the meteorite?

1080
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:44,071
It's not just a meteorite.

1081
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:45,531

It's not a butt!

1083

It's the ultimate power source.

1084
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,871

<i>scientists found that it emitted

1087
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,753

1089
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:05,676
You should've eaten him

1090
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,386
-Yep.
-But why us?

1091
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:09,930
Because you're the perfect patsies.

1092
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:13,267
Come on, when people look up "bad"
in the dictionary,

1093
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,936
do they see a sweet,
adorable guinea pig?

1094
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,855
No. They see you.

1095
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:19,982
And they always will.

1096
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:21,483
Okay. Fine.

1097
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:23,068
But you set us up.

1098
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:24,653
Oh, pish-pish.

1099
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:28,115
Let's be honest.
Evolution set you up.

1100
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:30,284
But Wolfie here really clinched it.

1101
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,870
You fell for every one of my traps,

1102

a helpless little old lady.

1103
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,501

00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:43,672
Whoops.

1105
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:45,716
Did I say too much?

1106
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,136
Anyhoo, looks like yet again

1107
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:52,806
the big, bad wolf got outsmarted
by a little piggy.

1108
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:55,767
You little pouchy-cheeked rat!

1109
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:57,436
I'll kill you, you hear me?

1110
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:59,354
- Help! Help!
- You're dead! You're dead…

1111
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:01,815
Help!
The big, bad wolf is attacking me.

1112
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:04,234
Now you are done forever, Wolf!

1113
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:17,247
Professor, Professor,
any thoughts on how the Bad Guys

1114
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:19,666
managed to steal the meteorite
in plain sight?

1115
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,251
Well, off the top of my head,

1116
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:22,961
perhaps they accessed
the site previously

1117
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:25,506
and set up an intricate system
of tunnels and trapdoors

1118
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:26,924
that could be remotely triggered

1119
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:28,884
to suck the meteorite
down into a holding area.

1120
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:30,511
- But how should I know?
- Totally.

1121
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:33,597
{\an8}I mean, they're
the deranged masterminds. Not me.

1122
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:57,079
<i>I'm giving it all back.</i>

1123
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:25,232
I can't believe we got double-crossed
by a tiny rodent.

1124
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,901
Oh, we got double-crossed
by a rodent, all right.

1125
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:29,903
But, uh, not a tiny one.

1126
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:31,071
What?

1127
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:33,991
This was supposed to be
us conning Marmalade.

1128
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:36,994
It turns out, it was Wolf conning us.

1129
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,747
Does that sound familiar
to you, Wolf?

1130
00:59:40,831 --> 00:59:42,124
Why would you think that?

1131
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,877
I don't know,
maybe because you just sabotaged

1132
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,087
the biggest heist of our lives?

1133
00:59:47,171 --> 00:59:49,464
I think you owe us
an explanation, buddy.

1134
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,343
Okay. You're right.

1135
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:54,511
This is what happened.

1136
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:58,015
Back in the museum, I just tried
to steal an old lady's purse.

1137
00:59:58,098 --> 00:59:59,349
Classic snatch and grab.

1138
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:00,976
"Tried to"?

1139
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:03,770
Since when do you try to steal
something and not just steal it?

1140
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:07,232
I was trying to steal the purse,
when the old lady fell…

1141
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:09,109
…and I kinda helped her.

1142
01:00:09,193 --> 01:00:10,152
What?

1143
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:12,279
I kinda helped her.

1144
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:13,572
But then you stole her purse?

1145
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:15,407
No. I didn't.

1146
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,201
I saved the old lady,

1147
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:19,703
and she hugged me,
and my tail wagged,

1148
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:22,748
and I didn't know what it was,
but it felt, you know…

1149
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:24,374
good.

1150
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:28,921
Ah! But then,
you stole the purse?

1151
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:30,631
No!

1152
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:34,384
You know, I heard what the pig said
to you about cuttin' us loose.

1153
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:36,720
Wait. Like, "us" us?

1154
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:39,014
But I never thought
you'd actually do it, man.

1155
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:40,224
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1156
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:42,768
I would never… I was tryin' to…

1157
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:44,853
I was trying to find us
a better life.

1158
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:48,649
Our life was perfect
until you decided to ruin it.

1159
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:49,733
I didn't.

1160
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:52,027
You guys felt it at the gala.

1161
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,071
The clapping, the cheering.

1162
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:56,949
We were more than
just scary villains. They loved us.

1163
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:59,618
Oh, yeah? If they loved us so much,

1164
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:02,704
how come we're in prison
for a crime we didn't commit?

1165
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,289
You know what?

1166
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:05,832
I'll give Marmalade this:

1167
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,960
At least he sees the world
for what it is:

1168
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:12,005
A place where some people are scary
and some people are scared.

1169
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:15,509
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm tired of bein' scary.

1170
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:17,511
I'm tired of bein' an outcast.

1171
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:19,972
-Maybe I don't wanna be a--
-What? A bad guy?

1172
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:22,391
Don't wanna be
a bad guy anymore, huh?

1173
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:23,642
Say it, Wolf!

1174
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,813
Yeah, I thought so.

1175
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:30,357
And us? Your lifelong friends?

1176
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,567
We're just holdin' you back?

1177
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,318
Yeah, maybe you are!

1178
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:38,448
-Take it back.
-Snake!

1179
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:40,200
Take it back! Apologize!

1180
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:42,160
Hey, hey, hey!

1181
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:43,996
Prison is no place for fighting.

1182
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:46,748
Tell that to him.

1183
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:47,833
Huh?

1184
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:54,882
What?

1185
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,524
Shh.

1186
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:39,384
Wait, wait! Hold…

1187
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:42,888
Diane?

1188
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:45,390
But how do you know how to do
all of that kick-kick-punch-punch?

1189
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:47,893
Wait a sec, you're the Crimson Paw?

1190
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:53,190
<i>The Queen of Cons,
Acrobatic Swiss Army Knife,</i>

1191
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:55,776
<i>stole the Zumpango diamond twice,
once for profit,</i>

1192
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,402
<i>second time just for fun.</i>

1193
01:02:57,486 --> 01:03:00,113
<i>Never identified, never caught.</i>

1194
01:03:00,197 --> 01:03:04,243
Guess I'm still the best
bad guy the world has ever seen.

1195
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:07,454
At least I used to be.

1196
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:19,842
Nope, I am still the best.

1197
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:22,302
Just like riding a stolen bicycle.

1198
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:25,013
Oh. Uh, you got a little… Ouch.

1199
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:27,349
Hey, why…
Why did you save us anyway?

1200
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:29,726
After the gala,
I knew something wasn't right.

1201
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,728
So, I did some investigating,
and that meteor…

1202
01:03:31,812 --> 01:03:32,813
I know.

1203
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:35,566
Some kinda
cosmic-mega-super-antennae thing.

1204
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:38,193
Right. If conducted through
an array of ionized crystals,

1205
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:40,279
it will generate
a massive psychokinetic field

1206
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:41,655
the size of a city.

1207
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:44,324
Oh, my gosh, did I interrupt you?
Were you gonna say that?

1208
01:03:44,408 --> 01:03:46,910
Uh… I was gonna be
a little more technical,

1209
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:49,413
but you got the gist of it.

1210
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:54,168
Marmalade needs to be stopped,
but I can't do it alone.

1211
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:56,128
You know his compound
better than anyone.

1212
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:57,838
You can count on us.

1213
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,214
Right, guys?

1214
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:01,550
There is no "us."

1215
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:03,177
We're through, Wolf.

1216
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,095
Done. Finito.

1217
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:06,889
Because of
that little tiff back there?

1218
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:09,725
Come on, man, that's what we do.

1219
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:11,894
You serve, I volley.
That's our little dance.

1220
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:14,521
Not this time.

1221
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:21,069
Piranha?

1222
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,033
Webs?

1223
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:27,409
Sorry, Wolfie.

1224
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:30,704
Shark…

1225
01:04:30,787 --> 01:04:32,247
Hmm.

1226
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:33,498
Hey.

1227
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:35,417
Guys?

1228
01:04:36,585 --> 01:04:37,878
Guys?

1229
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:41,173
You wanna know
why I hate birthdays, Wolf?

1230
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:42,132
Do you?

1231
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:47,721
When you grow up a snake,
nobody shows up to your party.

1232
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:50,849
Birthdays are a constant reminder
that out there

1233
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:55,479
I'm just a scary,
good-for-nothin' monster.

1234
01:04:57,105 --> 01:04:58,148
Yeah.

1235
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:01,860
But nothing compares
to havin' the one guy--

1236
01:05:01,944 --> 01:05:05,239
the one guy I thought I could trust--

1237
01:05:05,781 --> 01:05:07,074
stab me in the back.

1238
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:13,288
Come on, guys. Let's get outta here.

1239
01:06:00,836 --> 01:06:04,673
Now, this is what a true bad guy
looks like.

1240
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:13,265
What do you say we have some fun?

1241
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:53,388
Hey.

1242
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:55,224
You okay?

1243
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:57,100
No, I'm not okay.

1244
01:06:57,184 --> 01:06:59,436
I'm very, very un-okay.

1245
01:07:00,312 --> 01:07:03,857
Um, I just left the only friends
I have ever had, so what am…

1246
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,109
What am I doin'?

1247
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:10,906
I know this isn't easy,

1248
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,367
leaving everything behind.

1249
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:16,036
-Do you?
-Yeah.

1250
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:18,288
I was the best thief in the world.

1251
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:21,416
Fast, fearless, inventive.

1252
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:24,753
I just had one thing left to steal.

1253
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:26,839
The Golden Dolphin.

1254
01:07:26,922 --> 01:07:27,965
So you went after it.

1255
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:30,467
I didn't just go after it.

1256
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:33,554
<i>I had it.</i>

1257
01:07:33,637 --> 01:07:35,597
<i>And a clear escape route.</i>

1258
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:39,852
<i>But…</i>

1259
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:43,689
<i>all I saw in the end
was the tricky fox</i>

1260
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:45,607
<i>that they always told me I was.</i>

1261
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:49,027
<i>It changed everything.</i>

1262
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:53,907
So, now, instead of hurting people,
I'm helping them.

1263
01:07:53,991 --> 01:07:55,701
I'm still me.

1264
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:58,871
I'm just me, on the right side.

1265
01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:02,708
You're doing the right thing.

1266
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:05,460
And some day, your friends,
if they're real friends,

1267
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,671
I think they'll understand.

1268
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:10,966
Now, come on, let's get inside.

1269
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:12,843
You look like
you just busted out of a prison.

1270
01:08:17,096 --> 01:08:18,390
Guinea pigs?

1271
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:20,267
Marmalade!

1272
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:21,268
Let's bounce.

1273
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:25,856
So, this is the hideout
of the great Crimson Paw.

1274
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:28,442
Snack break?

1275
01:08:28,524 --> 01:08:31,028
Okay, oddly timed, but you do you.

1276
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:33,029
- <i>Identity verified.
</i>-What?

1277
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:34,573
<i>Welcome, Diane.</i>

1278
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:41,580
Whoa!

1279
01:08:41,662 --> 01:08:44,124
Holy moly!

1280
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:46,335
Ah! It's so good to be home.

1281
01:08:46,417 --> 01:08:47,627
Are you kiddin' me?

1282
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:49,212
Laser-sighted zip line?

1283
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:52,216
The XM 2400 Radar Jammer? No way!

1284
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:54,301
I actually prefer the earlier model.

1285
01:08:54,384 --> 01:08:56,511
Agree to disagree.

1286
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:59,055
This stuff is nice too.

1287
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:00,724
Yeah, that's a blowtorch.

1288
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:02,559
Also, not really your color.

1289
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:03,685
Ugh.

1290
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:04,937
All righty.

1291
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:09,649
Marmalade, what are you up to,
you fuzzy little weirdo?

1292
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:11,151
We need eyes on the city.

1293
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:14,613
Let's see if we can't hack into the
government's surveillance satellite.

1294
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:16,365
But you're the governor.
Couldn't you just ask?

1295
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:17,991
Yeah, but the paperwork.

1296
01:09:23,287 --> 01:09:27,125
I am definitely picking up on
suspicious activity here.

1297
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:29,336
Those are guinea pig heat signatures.

1298
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:31,587
Marmalade seems to be
controlling them.

1299
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:33,756
But to do what?

1300
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:35,050
There are no obvious targets.

1301
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:39,720
That's because
they're moving targets.

1302
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:42,349
His charity fundraiser.

1303
01:09:42,432 --> 01:09:45,352
He's gonna steal the money.
Raised in his own name?

1304
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:47,895
It's the greatest heist
the world's ever seen.

1305
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:50,232
One billion dollars inside trucks

1306
01:09:50,314 --> 01:09:52,317
on their way to charities
all over the city.

1307
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,861
We need to cut off
Marmalade's communication

1308
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:54,945
with his guinea pig army.

1309
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:56,530
If there's no signal…

1310
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:57,865
There's no heist.

1311
01:09:57,948 --> 01:10:00,450
We have to steal the meteorite.

1312
01:10:00,534 --> 01:10:01,577
That was very cute…

1313
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:02,953
-All right.
-…what we just did there.

1314
01:10:03,036 --> 01:10:05,372
Put on your big-girl pants.
We're gearin' up.

1315
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:14,298
I wouldn't take that. Those things
rip your pants right off.

1316
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:17,718
Huh. Try wearing clean underwear.
Just in case.

1317
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:20,012
What…

1318
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:23,682
You stole my car?

1319
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:25,434
Respect.

1320
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:27,728
Let's do this.

1321
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:40,365
- No!
- What?

1322
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:41,658
All our stuff?

1323
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:43,911
- Oh, no.
- Where is everything?

1324
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:46,205
-No, no, no!
-All our stuff.

1325
01:10:46,288 --> 01:10:48,415
-It's all gone!
-My disguise closet!

1326
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:49,958
Where's my things?

1327
01:10:51,335 --> 01:10:53,754
Wolf gave away all our loot!

1328
01:10:53,837 --> 01:10:56,298
We stole it fair and square!

1329
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:59,801
Now I understand what it feels like
to have things stolen from you.

1330
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:02,346
I don't like it.

1331
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:06,308
I really don't like it!

1332
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:12,773
We got no food.

1333
01:11:12,856 --> 01:11:15,067
We got no money. We got no money
we could use to buy food.

1334
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:16,652
No food we can sell for money.

1335
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:19,571
We…

1336
01:11:20,322 --> 01:11:21,823
All right! Okay, okay.

1337
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:23,534
Here, here. Take it.

1338
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:25,827
Now, stop cryin', buddy.

1339
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:28,038
Oh!

1340
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:33,710
Um… Snake, what did you just do?

1341
01:11:33,794 --> 01:11:35,462
What? My friend was sad.

1342
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:37,089
I was just cheerin' him up.

1343
01:11:37,172 --> 01:11:38,382
You…

1344
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:40,384
You did a good thing. For me.

1345
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:41,552
Don't be ridiculous.

1346
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:43,971
I just put your needs before my own.

1347
01:11:44,054 --> 01:11:46,598
-Yeah. You're being good.
-I'm not.

1348
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:49,643
I was simply making a sacrifice
so Shark could be happy.

1349
01:11:49,726 --> 01:11:52,563
That is the actual definition
of being good.

1350
01:11:52,646 --> 01:11:53,814
Snake!

1351
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:55,691
You! The worst one of us!

1352
01:11:55,774 --> 01:11:57,901
-The most selfish.
-Spiteful.

1353
01:11:57,985 --> 01:11:59,111
-Terrible.
-Sneaky.

1354
01:11:59,194 --> 01:12:00,487
-Dishonest.
-Insensitive.

1355
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:01,572
-Manipulative.
-Snake-like.

1356
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:03,824
-Stanky.
-And your point is?

1357
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:06,285
I think Wolf was right.

1358
01:12:06,368 --> 01:12:09,162
Maybe we could be
more than just scary villains.

1359
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:13,959
What…

1360
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:15,210
Oh, wow!

1361
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:17,337
Is this… Is this "wagging"?

1362
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:20,966
We're wagging!

1363
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:25,387
No! No! No!

1364
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:29,391
We'll always be bad guys!

1365
01:12:55,626 --> 01:12:58,045
Faster, faster, my little pigs.

1366
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,141
No!

1367
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:45,467
Once we steal the meteorite,
we take it straight to the police.

1368
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:47,386
And all will be forgiven.

1369
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:50,931
I don't know about "all,"
but it's a start.

1370
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:11,493
That's strange.

1371
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:14,872
Why would Marmalade
leave the Golden Dolphin unprotected?

1372
01:14:14,955 --> 01:14:16,915
Because maybe it's a trap.

1373
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:18,542
-Or maybe…
-Wait, wait, wait!

1374
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:22,045
Yeah, it was a trap.

1375
01:14:22,129 --> 01:14:23,547
Well, well, well.

1376
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,300
If it isn't my prized pupil.

1377
01:14:26,383 --> 01:14:28,302
And you've brought along
the governor.

1378
01:14:28,385 --> 01:14:31,013
Or should I say, the Crimson Paw?

1379
01:14:32,723 --> 01:14:36,310
What an ingenious way
to disguise the Zumpango diamond.

1380
01:14:36,393 --> 01:14:39,354
Hiding it in plain sight.

1381
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:40,898
You gotta be kidding me.

1382
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:42,691
What? I'm sentimental.

1383
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:44,193
You always did have panache.

1384
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:47,529
And yet,
you still fell right into my trap.

1385
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:49,740
But how did you know
we'd even be here?

1386
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:52,951
Oh, I got a little tip…
from a friend.

1387
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:57,414
Hey, buddy. How's it hangin'?

1388
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,458
Snake.

1389
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:02,544
What can I say? We just clicked.

1390
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:06,006
Oh, yeah? How's it feel to be workin'
for your favorite food?

1391
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:07,883
Ah, you're just jealous

1392
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:10,552
to be missin' out
on the heist of the century.

1393
01:15:10,636 --> 01:15:11,720
It's got everything.

1394
01:15:11,803 --> 01:15:15,432
Betrayal, a meteor, mind control.

1395
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:16,600
Can I try it on?

1396
01:15:16,683 --> 01:15:19,269
-Of course, partner.
-Nice.

1397
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:22,606
All the crime
with none of the exercise.

1398
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:26,109
And what about all that
"Flower of goodness" talk?

1399
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:27,319
Was it all just a lie?

1400
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:29,071
Uh, pretty much, yeah.

1401
01:15:29,154 --> 01:15:31,073
You see,
I never cared about what's "good."

1402
01:15:31,156 --> 01:15:33,116
Only what's good for me.

1403
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,702
Like, say, a billion dollars.

1404
01:15:35,786 --> 01:15:38,497
Ooh! I just got a tingle.

1405
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,375
Go bad…

1406
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:42,709
Or go home.

1407
01:15:43,794 --> 01:15:45,671
Cuddles! Finish them.

1408
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,975
Poison gas?
Don't breathe it in.

1409
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:00,352
Wait a second.

1410
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:01,812
That's not poison gas.

1411
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:04,565
Sorry!

1412
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:07,651
Surprise!

1413
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:08,986
What?

1414
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:12,614
-Guys! I can't believe it's you.
-You were right, Wolfie.

1415
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:14,992
- We felt the wag, man.
- And the tingle.

1416
01:16:15,075 --> 01:16:16,785
- It's good, right?
- Oh, yeah!

1417
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:18,996
This is super moving,
but can we do this later?

1418
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:21,498
Feels like I got
a rhythm section in my fin!

1419
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:24,918
Come on!

1420
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:25,961
Spinning blades!

1421
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:27,171
Oh, yeah. Right.

1422
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:28,422
Sorry. I got it.

1423
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:31,800
Guys,

1424
01:16:31,884 --> 01:16:33,719
am I happy to see you!

1425
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:41,518
Now it's time to huff and puff and
blow this little piggy's heist down.

1426
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:43,353
Game over, guinea pig!

1427
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:46,690
With this meteorite,
we will be able to commit crimes

1428
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:48,609
people have only dreamed about.

1429
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:50,777
Not bad for a butt rock.

1430
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:52,946
Once again, it's not a…

1431
01:16:53,864 --> 01:16:55,324
Don't mind us,

1432
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:57,075
just robbin' this place.

1433
01:16:59,703 --> 01:17:00,954
No, no, no!

1434
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:09,379
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1435
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:25,062
Whoo-hoo!

1436
01:17:25,145 --> 01:17:26,563
- Yeah!
- All right!

1437
01:17:26,647 --> 01:17:27,689
We did it!

1438
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:30,275
Now, to get this thing to the chief
and clear your names.

1439
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:32,569
Weird. Usually,
we drive away from the police.

1440
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:35,113
Hey, <i>chico</i>, are you sure
we stopped the heist?

1441
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:36,782
-Yeah.
-Relax.

1442
01:17:36,865 --> 01:17:39,618
Marmalade can't control them
if he doesn't have the meteorite.

1443
01:17:39,701 --> 01:17:41,912
So, who's drivin' those trucks?

1444
01:17:44,915 --> 01:17:46,834
The meteorite!

1445
01:17:46,917 --> 01:17:48,293
-It's still transmitting.
-Uh-oh.

1446
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:49,378
The charity money.

1447
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:51,088
Change of plan, guys.

1448
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:53,674
Webs, is there some way to override
the truck's navigation system?

1449
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:56,927
We'd need some kind of
magnetized cross-circuit interceptor.

1450
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,054
You mean this?

1451
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:01,473
Ooh! She just keeps gettin' cooler!

1452
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:02,766
Oh, yeah!

1453
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:07,396
Whoo!

1454
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:14,444
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1455
01:18:18,323 --> 01:18:19,575
Oh, no.

1456
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:21,785
We gotta split up.

1457
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:23,912
Webs, you feel like a girls' trip?

1458
01:18:23,996 --> 01:18:25,831
Um, yes.

1459
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:29,042

1527
01:21:31,183 --> 01:21:32,768

1528
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:37,022
Oh, there you go again,
making it personal.

1529
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:39,816
I'll give you one last chance
to give me the meteorite.

1530
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,528
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna do, Whiskers?

1531

01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:47,783
What the…

1533
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,792
-We've got adorable company.
-Floor it!

1534
01:22:01,964 --> 01:22:03,006
Whoa!

1535
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:07,803
Maybe I shouldn't have called him
"Whiskers."

1536
01:22:15,394 --> 01:22:16,895
When I woke up this morning,

1537

1538

1539
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,902
Come on!

1540
01:22:25,612 --> 01:22:28,866
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey,
let's dial this down a notch, huh?

1541
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:31,493
Besides, you'll never get him.
He's too good a driver.

1542
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:34,454
Hmm. You're right.

1543
01:22:34,538 --> 01:22:35,831
But now that I think of it,

1544
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:38,375
maybe it would be better to exploit
his greatest weakness.

1545
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:40,085
Exactly.

1546
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:41,753
Wait.

1547
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:43,213
No!

1548
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:47,176
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1549
01:22:47,259 --> 01:22:49,344
Hold on, hold it, hold it, hold it.

1550
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:51,138
Okay, okay. You win.

1551
01:22:51,221 --> 01:22:52,931
You can have the space rock.

1552
01:22:53,557 --> 01:22:54,808
Good boy, Wolf.

1553
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:06,195
Take the wheel.

1554
01:23:06,278 --> 01:23:08,572
Not so fast! Pull him up first.

1555
01:23:08,655 --> 01:23:10,824
Or I'll use this.

1556
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:12,576
Oh, come, now.

1557
01:23:16,997 --> 01:23:19,291
Do it, or you'll lose the rock.

1558

1559

1569
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:28,694
I should've been honest with you.

1570
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:32,155
I was afraid that if you knew
I wanted to be good, that you'd…

1571
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,616
Act like a jerk
and never talk to you again?

1572

you guys?

1577

01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:06,023
Whoo-hoo!

1583
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:07,774
Gah!

1584
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:17,326
No! Cuddles!
We're losing altitude!

1585
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:19,620
We're losing altitude!
We're going down!

1586
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:28,003
What happened?
Did we blow up?

1587
01:25:28,086 --> 01:25:29,087
Is this heaven?

1588
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:41,892
- That is it.
- Hey!

1589
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:45,395
There is absolutely no way
you're getting away this time.

1590
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:46,605
Wait, Chief.

1591
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:47,940
Governor Foxington?

1592
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:49,107
- Don't do this.
- Ow!

1593
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:51,652
They didn't steal the meteorite.
They were bringing it back.

1594
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:54,071
Ha! How could you know that?

1595
01:25:54,154 --> 01:25:55,614
Unless…

1596
01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:59,117
Unless you were conspiring
with a bunch of known criminals.

1597
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:01,870
Well…

1598
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:03,914
…as a matter of fact,

1599
01:26:05,082 --> 01:26:07,042
it's time I came clean
about something.

1600
01:26:08,293 --> 01:26:10,838
The truth is I'm really…

1601
01:26:10,921 --> 01:26:14,174
-…really--
-Really a big fan of redemption arcs.

1602
01:26:14,258 --> 01:26:15,342
Yeah, we know.

1603
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:23,433
-We're done runnin' away.
-Yeah.

1604
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:24,643
-Yeah.
-Yep.

1605
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:27,437
Chief, do what you need to do.

1606
01:26:27,521 --> 01:26:28,772
What?

1607
01:26:28,856 --> 01:26:31,608
Y-- You're turning yourself in?

1608
01:26:31,692 --> 01:26:33,569
We might not have
stolen the meteorite,

1609
01:26:33,652 --> 01:26:36,113
but we did steal
a lot of other things.

1610
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:38,532
It's time we took
some responsibility.

1611
01:26:38,615 --> 01:26:40,492
Start a clean state.

1612
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,161
Take us in, Chief.

1613
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:45,497
Wow, really?

1614
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:47,165
You finally did it.

1615
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:49,793
This is your moment, Chief.
Drink it in.

1616
01:26:49,877 --> 01:26:52,963
Wow!
You know, I should give a speech.

1617
01:26:53,046 --> 01:26:54,631
Well, I should, shouldn't I?

1618
01:26:54,715 --> 01:26:55,841
Uh…

1619
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:57,134
When I was six years old,

1620
01:26:57,217 --> 01:26:59,094
I decided that
I wanted to play the piccolo,

1621
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:01,889
only to find that my fingers
were just too powerful

1622
01:27:01,972 --> 01:27:03,849
for that fragile little instrument.

1623
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:06,852
And that's when I discovered
law enforcement.

1624
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:09,938
I'm proud of you, Wolf.

1625
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:13,192
You know, a fox and a wolf
are not that different.

1626
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:15,485
You got a good thing
goin' here, Governor.

1627
01:27:15,569 --> 01:27:18,614
So, it turns out the saga
of the Bad Guys has come to

1628
01:27:18,697 --> 01:27:21,408
{\an8}<i>a simple and totally satisfying
conclusion.</i>

1629
01:27:21,491 --> 01:27:24,119
{\an8}<i>Though, I wonder,
what happened to the meteorite?</i>

1630
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:25,954
{\an8}<i>Cuddles! Faster, faster!</i>

1631
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:27,664
{\an8}<i>It's Professor Marmalade!</i>

1632
01:27:27,748 --> 01:27:29,625
{\an8}<i>He's bringing the meteorite back!</i>

1633
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:30,709
{\an8}<i>Huh?</i>

1634
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:32,878
{\an8}<i>Uh, yes. Yes.</i>

1635
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:34,338
{\an8}<i>Bringing it back.</i>

1636
01:27:34,421 --> 01:27:36,006
That's precisely what I am doing.

1637
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:41,845
Look no further.

1638
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:44,097
Your hero has arrived.

1639
01:27:44,181 --> 01:27:45,516
Professor, care to comment?

1640
01:27:45,599 --> 01:27:47,601
I tried to help them, Tiffany.

1641
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:50,229
But in the end,
it's the same old story.

1642
01:27:50,312 --> 01:27:53,106
Bad guys, bad.
Good guys, good.

1643
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:54,816
So true. So wise.

1644
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,568
Furthermore,
for the good of the city,

1645
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:59,404
I have generously decided
to take the meteorite back

1646
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,782
to my compound for safekeeping.

1647
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:04,952
Is he seriously
gonna get away with this?

1648
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:07,913
Thank you.
Gosh, you're kind.

1649
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:09,540
Give it up for me!

1650
01:28:09,623 --> 01:28:11,124
Wait a second.

1651
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:12,960
This isn't the meteorite!

1652
01:28:13,043 --> 01:28:14,419
It's a lamp!

1653
01:28:14,503 --> 01:28:16,421
Huh?

1654
01:28:16,505 --> 01:28:17,506
What?

1655
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:20,008
<i>Snake, what did you just do?</i>

1656
01:28:20,092 --> 01:28:22,761
<i>What? My friend was sad,
and I was just cheerin' him up.</i>

1657
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:24,638
<i>I think Wolf was right.</i>

1658
01:28:24,721 --> 01:28:27,432
<i>Maybe we could be
more than just scary villains.</i>

1659
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:32,521
I'm bad, you're bad.

1660
01:28:32,604 --> 01:28:33,897
Let's be bad together.

1661
01:28:33,981 --> 01:28:35,858
You've got yourself a deal.

1662
01:28:37,776 --> 01:28:40,571
-Can I try it on?
-Of course, partner.

1663
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:57,504
Don't mind us,

1664
01:28:57,588 --> 01:28:59,256
just robbin' this place.

1665
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:04,094
No, no, no!

1666
01:29:08,557 --> 01:29:11,268
But if that's a lamp, where is the…

1667
01:29:11,351 --> 01:29:12,728
The old switcheroo.

1668
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:44,134
It's a butt.

1669
01:29:51,308 --> 01:29:52,309
Hold on.

1670
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:54,603
This is the Zumpango diamond!

1671
01:29:54,686 --> 01:29:58,106
But this was stolen by the…

1672
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:00,526
By the Crimson Paw!

1673
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:02,027
Me? No, no, no.

1674
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:04,071
OMG.

1675
01:30:04,154 --> 01:30:06,031
-And a shocking twist.
-You're making a huge mistake.

1676
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:09,535
The notorious bandit
known as the Crimson Paw

1677
01:30:09,618 --> 01:30:13,247
has been revealed to be
none other than Professor Marmalade.

1678
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:14,790
I'm not the Crimson Paw.

1679
01:30:14,873 --> 01:30:16,250
She's the Crimson Paw.

1680
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:17,584
She's the Paw!

1681
01:30:17,668 --> 01:30:19,753
I'm a flower of goodness! No!

1682
01:30:19,837 --> 01:30:22,256
Whoo! That's my reptile, right there.

1683
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:23,924
-That's what I'm talkin' about.
-Yeah!

1684
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:26,677
Come on, somebody had to
destroy that meteorite.

1685
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,136
That thing was dangerous.

1686
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:30,389
That was pretty good there, Snakey.

1687
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,391
Good? It was genius.

1688
01:30:32,474 --> 01:30:34,309
Not only did I foil the pig,

1689
01:30:34,393 --> 01:30:37,396
I got you to admit
how much you care about me.

1690
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:38,480
Sure, yeah.

1691
01:30:38,564 --> 01:30:40,274
I just wonder about one little thing.

1692
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:41,733
Oh, yeah? What's that, Wolf?

1693
01:30:42,442 --> 01:30:45,571
Who do you think
put that one Push Pop in the fridge?

1694
01:30:47,447 --> 01:30:48,532
Wait.

1695
01:30:48,615 --> 01:30:49,741
You…

1696
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:51,827
-No.
-I knew you were good.

1697
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:53,829
No!

1698
01:30:54,454 --> 01:30:55,873
We good, baby.

1699
01:30:55,956 --> 01:30:57,165
-We good.
-Yeah!

So, imagine it's your birthday.

1715
01:31:44,713 --> 01:31:46,715
{\an8}-It is my birthday.
- Yeah, I know.

1716
01:31:46,798 --> 01:31:48,884
{\an8}But we're walkin' along,
and you meet a genie.

1717
01:31:48,967 --> 01:31:51,637
- Okay. What's his name?
- What's the genie's name?

1718
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,180
Yeah, I wanna know
who I'm talkin' to.

1719
01:31:53,263 --> 01:31:54,848
{\an8}I don't know.
"Genie," or "Gene" for short.

1720
01:31:54,932 --> 01:31:56,350
{\an8}So he offers you three wishes.

1721
01:31:56,433 --> 01:31:57,476
{\an8}Why three?

1722
01:31:57,559 --> 01:32:00,604
{\an8}You know, industry standard.
Now, what do you wish for?

1723
01:32:00,687 --> 01:32:02,022
{\an8}-Uh…
-Good luck out there, guys.

1724
01:32:02,105 --> 01:32:03,315
{\an8}I'm gonna go with nothin'.

1725
01:32:03,398 --> 01:32:04,525
{\an8}Nothing?

1726
01:32:04,608 --> 01:32:06,401
{\an8}Come on, it's your birthday.

1727
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:08,612
{\an8}All right!
But what do I need wishes for?

1728
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:10,030
{\an8}I got my freedom.

1729
01:32:10,113 --> 01:32:11,198
{\an8}-Hey.
-Guys!

1730
01:32:11,281 --> 01:32:12,574
{\an8}Lookin' good, <i>hermanos!</i>

1731
01:32:12,658 --> 01:32:13,992
{\an8}-I got my friends.
-Aw.

1732
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:16,578
{\an8}I've got the skin
of a reptile half my age.

1733
01:32:16,662 --> 01:32:18,914
{\an8}I don't know about "half your age,"
but you look good.

1734
01:32:18,997 --> 01:32:20,249
{\an8}Well,
that's because you just molted.

1735
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:21,416
{\an8}Yes, I did.

1736
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,626
{\an8}You smell good, too.

1737
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:24,586
{\an8}I'm shiny, I'm gorgeous.

1738
01:32:27,339 --> 01:32:28,340
{\an8}Huh.

1739
01:32:31,802 --> 01:32:33,011
{\an8}Um…

1740
01:32:33,095 --> 01:32:34,930
{\an8}So, what do we do now?

1741
01:32:35,013 --> 01:32:36,807
{\an8}-Steal a car?
- Piranha!

1742
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:38,559
{\an8}I was joking.

1743
01:32:38,642 --> 01:32:39,893
{\an8}It was a joke!

1744
01:32:39,977 --> 01:32:44,147
{\an8}You know, on second thought, Wolf,
maybe I'd wish for a ride.

1745
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:46,316
Oh, yeah? Alakazam.

1746
01:32:48,277 --> 01:32:49,403
Nice.

1747
01:32:49,486 --> 01:32:51,530
Hey, guys.
Ready to get to work?

1748
01:32:52,698 --> 01:32:54,324
Hey! Whoa!

1749
01:32:58,996 --> 01:33:00,038
Hey, you.

1750
01:33:00,122 --> 01:33:02,749
That's right, come here.
A little closer.

1751
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:04,293
I said, "Closer."

1752
01:33:05,002 --> 01:33:07,880
Now that we've had some time
to get acquainted, uh,

1753
01:33:07,963 --> 01:33:10,507
not so scary now, are we?

1754
01:33:10,591 --> 01:33:12,301
Webs, hit it.

1755
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:18,682
