1
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:08,941
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

2
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:13,147
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

3
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:19,194
<i>Happy birthday, dear Chelsea</i>

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,747
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

5
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,011
- Happy birthday. Good night.
- Good night.

6
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,602
Chelsea!

7
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,561
Chelsea, come on. We have no time.

8
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,528
My painting! Where's my painting?

9
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,792
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Bob!

10
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,750
Daddy! Daddy!

11
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,468
Bob, get the hell out of there,
for God's sake!

12
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,390
Jesus!

13
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,549
<i>This was
the scene 18 years ago,</i>

14
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,663
<i>as millions of dollars' worth of Sebastian
Deardon paintings literally went up in smoke.</i>

15
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,709
<i>Deardon perished in the flames.</i>

16
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,130
<i>Surviving the inferno was his
eight-year-old daughter, Chelsea Deardon.</i>

17
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,087
<i>Last night,
that same Chelsea Deardon, now 26,</i>

18
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,636
<i>was arrested for attempting to steal
one of her father's valuable paintings</i>

19
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,466
<i>from the Manhattan penthouse
of Robert Forrester. Police...</i>

20
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,596
Hey. I was watching that.

21
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,387
- Sorry! The news is so boring.
- Yeah.

22
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,186
Did you do your homework?

23
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,853
I'm just finishing it.

24
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,024
Your mother always tells me
to make sure you do your homework.

25
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,698
And you tell me that you have no homework,
until it's time to leave.

26
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,326
Why is that?

27
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,913
I only have to write one paragraph
on an emotion. It's easy.

28
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,870
Easy? You think things are easy?

29
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,271
- Can we go out for breakfast?
- No, we can't go out for breakfast.

30
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,376
We ate out last night.

31
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,750
When you stay with me, we're a family.

32
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,123
We eat in,

33
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,583
occasionally.

34
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,338
- Dad?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,349
- You didn't sleep again, did you?
- Huh?

36
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,311
- You didn't sleep again.
- I slept.

37
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,858
I woke up and I heard these strange sounds.

38
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,403
And...

39
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,738
Were you dancing in the bathroom?

40
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,532
Dancing in the bathroom?

41
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,528
Mom says whenever you can't sleep,
you tap dance in the bathroom.

42
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,908
Oh, she did, huh? Do you believe that?

43
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,371
Well, so I danced once or twice,
but I don't tap dance.

44
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,378
Uh-huh?

45
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,342
Dad!

46
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,881
Oh!

47
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,771
Get back. Hold on.
I got it. I can handle it.

48
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,403
Got it.

49
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,397
Don't tell Mom about the toast.

50
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,441
See you in a few days.

51
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,988
- Bye.
- Bye.

52
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,411
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

53
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,044
Oh, it's, um...

54
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,178
- Good morning.
- Hey. Good morning, Tom.

55
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,991
- You're going to court.
- Court? This morning?

56
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,428
Howard Marchek, receiving stolen property.

57
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,641
Slumber party?

58
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,639
Marchek. This isn't my case.
This is Henning's.

59
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,436
Yours now. Henning's got laryngitis.

60
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,431
Tom, thanks.
You were right about the landlady.

61
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,434
I put her on the stand
and she cracked like an egg.

62
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,480
Oh, yeah?

63
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,483
I cracked her like a walnut.
She crumbled like blue cheese.

64
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,699
- He ought to open a restaurant.
- How'd you get oatmeal on your shirt?

65
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,785
Oh, damn it.

66
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,495
Do me a favor, will you?
Help me with this shirt.

67
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,101
What do I got here?
What's wrong here?

68
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,457
Oh, great.

69
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,794
I hate to break up your aerobics class,
Logan, but this is important.

70
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,506
- What do you got, Blanchard?
- Logan, I need that 750 form.

71
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,631
- Of course you do. What is it?
- 750?

72
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,633
The monthly composite of trials
and verdicts.

73
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,846
- Do you have it?
- No. No, I don't.

74
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,221
- Okay.
- I filed an 822 instead.

75
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,523
Logan, I'm familiar with every form
used in every division of the DA's office.

76
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,485
I assure you there's no 822,
and I do know that.

77
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,523
You got me.

78
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,778
Okay. I'd like to see this form, 750,
on my desk by the end of the day.

79
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,867
- Okay? Thank you.
- Yes.

80
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,821
- You've got lunch with the chief today.
- Yeah, I know. 12:30, his office.

81
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,493
1:00 at Le Zinc.

82
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,036
Right, 1:00. Le Zinc.

83
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,163
Hey. Marchek,

84
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,916
- who's the defense on that case? Yeah?
- Laura J. Kelly.

85
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,874
She once tried to put a dog
on the witness stand.

86
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,883
Under oath?

87
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,306
Mr. Marchek is a beloved member
of a very large and tight-knit family.

88
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:41,511
We've brought forth over two dozen
cousins, aunts, uncles, in-laws,

89
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,566
each of whom has testified under oath
that the alleged stolen property

90
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,811
was given to Mr. Marchek
as birthday gifts by them.

91
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,531
Now, 14 of them chose to give him
a television set.

92
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,242
An unlikely coincidence?

93
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,536
Under normal circumstances, perhaps.

94
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,995
But we all heard Mr. Marchek's
sworn testimony

95
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,705
that all he really wanted
was a sort of a media room,

96
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,872
not unlike that of
the President of the United States.

97
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,338
Now, then. The prosecution has made
a rather big issue out of the fact

98
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:17,547
that none of these relatives could
produce a receipt for the merchandise.

99
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,660
Oh, that's a very lovely watch, sir.
Do you have a receipt?

100
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,720
No.

101
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,553
- Clerk, arrest this man.
- Objection, Your Honor.

102
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,555
Defense is fondling one of the jurors.

103
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,565
Sustained.

104
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,437
You're not a thief.
Neither is Howard Marchek.

105
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,519
Receipts come, and receipts go.

106
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:37,075
He did what any compassionate human being
would've done in a situation like this.

107
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,861
He offered a fellow citizen a fair deal.

108
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,655
Are we to reward that kindness
with a jail term?

109
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,741
For all our sakes, I hope not.

110
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,710
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
please look into your hearts,

111
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,581
place yourselves in Mr. Marchek's position,

112
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,585
and return a verdict of "not guilty."
Thank you.

113
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,605
Before I begin my closing remarks,
I'd like to congratulate Miss Kelly

114
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,520
on a defense which has been
so entertaining and imaginative.

115
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,353
I must confess to you, I...
I didn't know whether to refute it

116
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,605
or to simply give it a round of applause.

117
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,779
But we're not in a theater here.
We're in a court of law.

118
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,619
And in court we have to deal with the facts.

119
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,781
Now, the defense says
this was a birthday party.

120
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:31,412
Well, we've all been to birthday parties.
We've had our share of birthday presents.

121
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:35,542
But all known generosity pales
when compared to the attention

122
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,299
lavished on Mr. Howard Marchek
by his adoring relatives.

123
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,636
This must have been some birthday party.

124
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,636
Detectives said they found TV sets,
stereos, microwaves, typewriters.

125
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,938
Not exactly the kind of variety
you find at Sears,

126
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,017
but definitely selling
at much better prices.

127
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,523
What about the Obitser arraignment?

128
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,401
- I'll set the date.
- Mr. Logan. Slow down.

129
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,777
Twenty-seven relatives, birthday presents.
Were you serious?

130
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,746
It was all I had.
It was the best possible defense.

131
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,393
That case never should have gone
to court.

132
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,311
You should have pleaded him
guilty at the arraignment.

133
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,954
Think of it this way, every person,
guilty or innocent, deserves a defense.

134
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,087
- It's in the Constitution. You could look it up.
- Why are you following me?

135
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,751
I'd like you to talk to one of my clients,
Chelsea Deardon.

136
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,679
Chelsea Deardon.
I plan to talk to Chelsea Deardon, in court.

137
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,388
I'm not talking about court.

138
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,967
There are special circumstances
surrounding this case. I'd like to brief you...

139
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,685
- If the evidence is compelling enough...
- It is.

140
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,681
Well, then I'm sure the jury will agree
with you. Now, excuse me.

141
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,934
I'm trying to prevent
a miscarriage of justice.

142
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,691
I'm talking about evidence
a jury may never have a chance to hear.

143
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,576
You have a reputation for fairness.

144
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,696
Chelsea Deardon is important to me.

145
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,870
- She's a client I can believe in.
- Like Howard Marchek?

146
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,120
That's it?

147
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,629
- That's the entire extent of your curiosity?
- Oh, no, on the contrary.

148
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,627
Twenty-seven relatives, a talking dog?

149
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,256
I can't wait to see what you're gonna
come up with next. See you in court.

150
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,925
Clients of yours?

151
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,971
Listen, you got to get that done this
afternoon because of the banquet. All right?

152
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,723
Got it. Right.

153
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,150
Watch it!

154
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,779
Tom.

155
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,855
- Tom.
- Yeah.

156
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,738
You got a handkerchief?

157
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,153
Yeah, sure. God.

158
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,683
That is my table.
I sit there every day of the week.

159
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,893
- Just a minute.
- You know it is.

160
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,353
- Please, sir.
- I always have reservations.

161
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,743
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,541
- Tom, I need your legal opinion.
- Not now, I gotta see Bowers.

163
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,667
I'll make it short.

164
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,750
My client slams his truck
through the window of a 7-Eleven.

165
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,753
He breaks a customer's leg,
bangs up the clerk with bruises.

166
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,924
You got a problem.

167
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,758
Okay, look, my client is driving,
but he is also with a woman

168
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,852
who's resting her head in his lap actively.

169
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,768
What are you talking about?
Speak English, Ed.

170
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,232
Resting her head with affection.

171
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,691
Naturally, this breaks his concentration
on driving, and...

172
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,814
I can build a case on this.

173
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,943
Ultimately, the accident is her fault
and not his.

174
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,158
- What do you think?
- I'd sell the screen rights.

175
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,667
Chief.

176
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,577
- A drink for you, sir?
- Um...

177
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,794
- Yeah. No. Sorry.
- You're late. Cause me stress.

178
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,800
Doctor says I'm supposed to
cut down on stress.

179
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,800
These pills kill the acid in the coffee

180
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,389
before the acid in the coffee kills me.

181
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,886
Now let's get to the point here.

182
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,811
You know, Tom, I always had
the highest personal regard for you,

183
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,276
both as a lawyer and a human being.

184
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,403
I appreciate that.

185
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,449
That's why I picked you to give the keynote
at the banquet tonight.

186
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,994
Every year some poor son of a bitch
has to get in front of the crowd

187
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,117
and spout comforting nonsense.

188
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,835
This year, I want to hear it
from someone with style and charm.

189
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,081
I want to hear it from someone
who's my choice

190
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,295
for the next district attorney.

191
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
You.

192
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,058
Me?

193
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,846
<i>This is finally it, folks,
my last year as your district attorney.</i>

194
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,770
<i>Too late.</i>

195
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,648
<i>Appeal denied.</i>

196
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,526
<i>Now then, the big question is,
who'll replace me?</i>

197
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,860
<i>Well, perhaps someone
like our keynote speaker here tonight.</i>

198
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,950
<i>For the past 12 years,
I've given this man</i>

199
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,999
<i>the toughest assignments
and the heaviest case loads,</i>

200
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,920
<i>and for one simple reason.
He gets the job done!</i>

201
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,879
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

202
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,458
<i>a man whose past performance</i>

203
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,512
<i>guarantees him a brilliant future,
Tom Logan.</i>

204
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,391
Chelsea, wait.

205
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,894
Let's do something.

206
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,900
I think this is better.

207
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,192
Yeah. Much better.

208
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,323
<i>An attorney has to know the truth.</i>

209
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,906
<i>Whether he attacks it or defends it,</i>

210
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,707
<i>the truth is the touchstone of his trade.</i>

211
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,083
<i>That's the tricky part,
because clients often lie to him.</i>

212
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,292
<i>I don't know what it is about us,</i>

213
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:32,342
<i>but it seems to be human nature
to lie to a lawyer.</i>

214
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,932
Is that him?

215
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,767
<i>If your client was five miles away
from the scene of a crime,</i>

216
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,015
<i>he'd probably tell you he was 10 miles away.</i>

217
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,938
<i>Nobody seems to trust a lawyer enough
to tell the truth.</i>

218
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,571
<i>Because we are</i>

219
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,782
<i>what we are,</i>

220
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,238
<i>and tend to...</i>

221
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,203
<i>Because we... We, uh...</i>

222
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,952
<i>Because people lie so often to lawyers,</i>

223
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,996
<i>a prosecuting attorney in particular
has to develop that instinct</i>

224
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,541
<i>when it comes to determining the truth,</i>

225
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,289
<i>even when it turns out to be
against his best interests.</i>

226
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,633
<i>He has to expose the truth.</i>

227
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,970
<i>Now, that's justice.</i>

228
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,012
<i>And that's why I'm an attorney.</i>

229
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,971
<i>Thank you.</i>

230
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,978
We'll back you all the way.

231
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,528
Kelly wants to file a cross-complaint
on the Deardon case. I told her no.

232
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,654
What?

233
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,763
She's threatened to call
a press conference right on the spot.

234
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,787
What did you tell her?

235
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,239
I told her that you'd
examine the cross-complaint.

236
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,914
A quick investigation.
We don't need this kind of press.

237
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,916
- Well, I'm not gonna do it.
- Come on, Chelsea.

238
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,303
No.

239
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,185
<i>Moments ago, Laura J. Kelly,
a Manhattan attorney</i>

240
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,309
<i>told us she plans to file charges
against the district attorney's office.</i>

241
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,649
<i>Miss Kelly, can you tell us
what this is all about?</i>

242
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,065
<i>Well, first, I'd like to apologize
for my conduct this evening.</i>

243
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,439
She's doing it. She's doing it.

244
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,617
<i>...left open to us.
This young lady, Chelsea Deardon,</i>

245
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,536
<i>has been victimized
by some very unscrupulous people.</i>

246
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,951
<i>We've been trying to get cooperation
from the DA's office,</i>

247
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,828
<i>but so far they've been stonewalling us.</i>

248
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,205
<i>We have no choice
but to file a cross-complaint</i>

249
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,662
<i>against the district attorney's office
in this matter.</i>

250
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,920
<i>Oh! Here is Tom Logan
from the district attorney's office.</i>

251
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,543
<i>Mr. Logan, what can you tell us
about this situation?</i>

252
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,047
<i>Well, this is a total surprise to me.
I can assure you that</i>

253
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,676
<i>if there's any implication of impropriety
on the part of our office,</i>

254
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,889
<i>why, it's unfounded.</i>

255
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:48,482
<i>I'd like to also say that I personally will
be taking charge of this case from now on.</i>

256
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,355
<i>Well, I'd like to add that I had no doubt</i>

257
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,061
<i>that when a man of Tom Logan's
character and reputation</i>

258
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,735
<i>found out about the predicament
of my client,</i>

259
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,906
<i>he would take quick and decisive action.
Thank you so much, Mr. Logan.</i>

260
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,745
Okay. For the record,
and so there's no misunderstandings,

261
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,458
you're entitled to remain silent.

262
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,083
Anything you say
can and will be held against you.

263
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,693
If you're not exactly thrilled with your
attorney, one will be provided.

264
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,083
- Oh, no, I like her.
- Thanks.

265
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,676
Did you steal the painting?

266
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,094
- No.
- Yes.

267
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,338
Yes, but no.

268
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,514
- Which is it?
- Both.

269
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,309
This is going to be a waste of my time.
I can feel it.

270
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,513
I did try to take the painting,
but it already belonged to me.

271
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,143
Can you prove that?

272
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,813
My father gave me that painting
when I was eight years old.

273
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,106
He even dedicated it to me
on the back in writing.

274
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,445
All anyone has to do is look.

275
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,358
Is there any other proof
that that painting once belonged to you?

276
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,698
My father kept a journal.

277
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,283
Chelsea, you never told me about that.

278
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,036
There were sketches
of that painting in the journal.

279
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,119
Beside one of them, he wrote
"For Chelsea's eighth birthday."

280
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,121
I'd like to see the journal.

281
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,214
It's in my apartment.

282
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,428
You can come by any time.

283
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,640
I'll be up there soon.

284
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,144
What... Who did you steal
this painting from?

285
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,934
She didn't steal the painting.
She allegedly stole the painting.

286
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,562
From one Robert Forrester,
major developer.

287
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,144
Robert Forrester?
What were you doing at his place?

288
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,193
His wife throws parties for young artists.

289
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,819
That way people think she knows art.

290
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,740
She's bored. She likes to wear earrings.

291
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,540
- And what is the painting worth?
- $200,000.

292
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,629
- Your father must've made a lot of money.
- I guess.

293
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,794
- How much inheritance did you get?
- None.

294
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,841
The estate was bankrupt.

295
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,760
All the unsold paintings
were destroyed in the fire,

296
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,177
including the one that
Chelsea allegedly stole from Forrester's.

297
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,357
Okay.

298
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,193
We'll look at the painting tomorrow,
and if there's an inscription on the back,

299
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,357
I'll consider dropping the charges.

300
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,571
Great.

301
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,203
- Mr. Forrester.
- Come in.

302
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,216
I'm afraid I can't show the Deardon to you,
Mr. Logan.

303
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,296
You see, I no longer own it.

304
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,506
- I don't understand.
- I traded it just yesterday.

305
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,008
- Traded it to whom?
- To a gallery.

306
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,934
Which gallery?

307
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,471
Taft Gallery.

308
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,647
Mr. Forrester, that painting is
material evidence in a felony proceeding.

309
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,645
Not anymore.

310
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,149
You see, I've decided to drop
all charges against Chelsea.

311
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,242
- What?
- Why?

312
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,737
Her father and I were very good friends.

313
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,706
Chelsea's had a rather difficult childhood.

314
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:56,249
It's obvious to me she acted on impulse.
There was no harm done.

315
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,915
Well, forgive me for asking, Mr. Forrester,

316
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,672
but what did you receive
in return for the Deardon?

317
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,517
A Picasso for a Deardon?

318
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,266
Yes, I thought it was
a rather good trade as well.

319
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,519
Mmm. This is good.

320
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,743
So Taft traded a Picasso for a Deardon.
That's not a good trade?

321
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,662
Not for a gallery owner that attempts
to stay in business.

322
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,162
No offense, Logan,
but since I know something about art,

323
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,085
- why don't you let me do the talking?
- Sure.

324
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,680
Can I help you?

325
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,304
Yes. Mr. Logan, Miss Kelly.
We're here to see Mr. Taft.

326
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,676
- Oh, yes.
- He's expecting us.

327
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,012
- Yes. Wait here just one moment.
- Okay.

328
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,320
Dubuffet.

329
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,318
de Kooning.

330
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,992
Calder.

331
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,863
How about that?

332
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,787
- Mr. Logan?
- Yes.

333
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,073
I'm Victor Taft.

334
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,979
Thanks for calling in advance.
I have a rather busy schedule,

335
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,105
as I'm sure you can appreciate.

336
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,086
I do. We'll be brief. This is Miss Kelly.

337
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,290
- Pleasure.
- Magnificent gallery.

338
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,962
I was wondering if you have any Picassos
around here at this present time?

339
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,344
Well, yes. Matter of fact,
you're standing right in front of one.

340
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,350
Right.

341
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,805
Right. That's expensive?

342
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,147
Oh...

343
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,599
Value is a relative thing, is it not?

344
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,355
Come. Let me show you around.

345
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:53,157
Picasso is one of the true masters
of this century.

346
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,113
And yet you traded a Picasso

347
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,200
for a Deardon,
which couldn't possibly be worth as much.

348
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,414
That particular Deardon was one of his last.

349
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,164
A work of total confidence and maturity.

350
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:09,003
Deardon was my discovery,
so I feel proprietary about his work.

351
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,551
I pestered Robert Forrester
to part with it for years.

352
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,221
Frankly, I was thrilled
when he finally agreed.

353
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,855
Let's set it on the stand.

354
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,023
It's a Bertolini. Startling, isn't it?

355
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,800
It was his model for a larger version,
which stands at Southern Square Park.

356
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,611
I bet the price's equally startling.

357
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,406
It's not for sale.
It was given to me personally by the artist.

358
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,244
It has great sentimental value.

359
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,413
If you don't mind me asking, Mr. Taft,

360
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,856
what exactly was or is
your relationship with Chelsea Deardon?

361
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,749
Her father and I were very close.
I watched little Chelsea grow up.

362
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,418
Mr. Logan, you're leaning.

363
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,427
Sorry.

364
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,009
Recently, Chelsea and I have lost touch.

365
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,225
I have followed her career,
but her sensibility in art doesn't interest me.

366
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,102
She's... She's a performance artist.

367
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,643
- Happenings, very ephemeral experiences.
- She's what?

368
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,438
- A performance artist.
- I hear she's quite talented.

369
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,026
Ah. Thank you, Roger.

370
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,448
It's very powerful.

371
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,112
It is.

372
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,445
I'd like to see the other side,
if you don't mind.

373
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,664
How refreshing.

374
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,081
Most of my clients prefer to see the front.

375
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,477
That was one of the shiftiest
performances I've ever seen.

376
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,850
I don't know.
I thought he was pretty straightforward.

377
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,731
Logan, whatever happened to that sixth sense

378
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,215
you're supposed to be so famous for?

379
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,823
- Doesn't it feel too neatly tied up to you?
- Kelly, it's dead.

380
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,827
There's no signature.
The charges are dropped. It's done.

381
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,490
- Can I get you a cab?
- I can get my own cab, thanks.

382
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,517
God, give me a break.

383
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,766
Okay.

384
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,267
That's it.

385
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:41,766
No.

386
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,710
<i>- I couldn't let you do it.</i>
- Why not?</i>

387
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,772
<i>You wouldn't be seen.
You'd be throwing away your own career.</i>

388
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,149
<i>It has nothing to do with my career.</i>

389
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,270
...<i>feeling
I'm happy again</i>

390
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,731
<i>I'm laughing at clouds</i>

391
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:03,672
<i>Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face</i>

392
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,338
- Someone's following me.
- What?

393
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,558
- I'm scared. Can I come in?
- Who... How did you...

394
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:52,012
Sure. How did you know where I live?

395
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,724
- I was afraid he'd follow me home.
- Who? Who'd follow you home?

396
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,726
- The man.
- What man?

397
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,194
I don't know what man.
I've seen him at three different times

398
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,646
and three different places today.

399
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,527
Where is he now? Do you know?

400
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,324
Probably right out front.

401
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,753
I'm sorry. I don't see anybody.

402
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,751
He's hiding.

403
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,430
Chelsea, you can't stay here.

404
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,764
Maybe a friend's house?

405
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,936
I don't have a friend.

406
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,653
Okay. I'll run you home.

407
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,243
Hang on. I'll get dressed.

408
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,055
Did you talk to Kelly?

409
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,852
Earlier.

410
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,818
So then you know there's no signature
on the back of that painting?

411
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,823
You're sure Victor Taft showed you
the right painting?

412
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,829
I suppose you think you're familiar enough
with my father's work

413
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,793
to tell one from another?

414
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,630
Won't you come in?

415
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,884
Okay.

416
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,770
- Lot of room.
- Yes.

417
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,364
What's all this?

418
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,904
Something I'm working on.

419
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,914
Let me show you.

420
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,878
<i>Sit down.</i>

421
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,941
<i>Heart's desire, heart's desire</i>

422
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,409
<i>Never, never play with fire</i>

423
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,370
Piece of cake.

424
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,347
Old flame.

425
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,530
<i>I was driving down the highway</i>

426
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:17,156
<i>I saw a car burning on the side of the road</i>

427
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,988
<i>A woman was slumped over the wheel</i>

428
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,997
<i>Her shoulders were shaking,
like she was crying</i>

429
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,256
Brush.

430
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,974
Brush fire.

431
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,993
<i>Through the windshield,
on the hood of the car, there was a stack.</i>

432
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,578
<i>Maybe it was a small child.</i>

433
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,033
<i>As I drove by,
I noticed that nobody stopped.</i>

434
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,255
<i>Nobody stopped.</i>

435
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,082
<i>Neither did I.</i>

436
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,050
<i>Put out the fire.</i>

437
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,504
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

438
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,259
<i>Fire.</i>

439
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,597
<i>Put out the fire.</i>

440
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,804
<i>Put out, put out.</i>

441
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,606
<i>Put out the fire.</i>

442
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,059
<i>Fire!</i>

443
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,903
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

444
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,900
What did you think?

445
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:51,672
I...

446
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,084
Think...

447
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:58,971
Fine.

448
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,090
What did you think?

449
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,441
I think...

450
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,697
I think I'm uncomfortable.

451
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,110
- Good.
- Good?

452
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,237
Yeah, good.

453
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:29,079
That's what I'm trying to do,
challenge your perspective.

454
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,121
Make you uncomfortable.

455
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,346
Still uncomfortable?

456
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,357
You bet.

457
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,818
There was a journal?
You said your father had a journal?

458
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:04,787
Mmm-hmm.

459
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,829
Can I see it?

460
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,958
Hmm?

461
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,160
- Yeah.
- Now?

462
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,787
Oh, I'd have to find it.

463
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,382
Well, it shouldn't take too long.

464
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,346
Maybe it's in the storeroom. I forget.

465
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,475
When was the last time you saw it?

466
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,512
- Two weeks ago.
- There's no journal, is there?

467
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,023
- There is a journal.
- But you don't have it?

468
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:41,193
- Do you always cross-examine people?
- Only when they lie.

469
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,165
I don't have anything
from when my father was alive.

470
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:03,048
There was a journal. There were paintings.
There was a fire.

471
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,804
I need your help.

472
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,343
I lied to you before because

473
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,228
I didn't think the truth was good enough.

474
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,444
He's there.

475
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,235
- What?
- He's there.

476
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,236
- No. There's no one there.
- No, he is. I can feel it.

477
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,580
- I gotta get some sleep.
- You can sleep here.

478
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:38,253
If there's any real trouble, call the police.
911, emergency.

479
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,132
Thanks for taking me home.

480
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,325
Something interesting up there?

481
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,294
<i>Hi. This is Laura Kelly.
I can't come to the phone right now,</i>

482
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,106
<i>but if you leave your message at the tone...</i>

483
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,157
Get me the police.

484
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,614
Miss Kelly, I need to talk to you.

485
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,043
Office hours are 9:00 to 5:00.
My number's in the book.

486
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:45,832
I'm with the police department, Miss Kelly.
My name is Cavanaugh, C.J. Cavanaugh.

487
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,050
I'm a detective. Manhattan South.

488
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,513
Just a minute.

489
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,562
- You have any ID?
- Yes, mam.

490
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,153
Show it.

491
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,400
Yeah, that's ID.

492
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,416
Come on in.

493
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,007
- What's this about?
- The Deardon case.

494
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,429
There is no Deardon case.
The charges were dropped yesterday.

495
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,846
Wrong Deardon case.

496
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,896
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- No. I'll sit with you.

497
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,321
Seventeen years ago,
I headed up an investigation

498
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,405
into the murder of Sebastian Deardon.

499
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,906
- Murder?
- Murder.

500
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,328
I... Could you excuse me?

501
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,545
Are you all right?

502
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,248
Fine.

503
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:15,512
- Can I get you something?
- No, no! No!

504
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,518
I read the record on that case.

505
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,475
There was nothing about a murder.

506
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,600
No. You read the whitewash, Miss Kelly.

507
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,778
My report got filed in somebody's
wastebasket down at City Hall.

508
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,024
Seventeen years ago,

509
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:35,233
I pushed on that case a little too hard
with the captain in charge.

510
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,526
All of a sudden, I'm busting winos
out in Staten Island.

511
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,496
So, what do you want me to do about this?

512
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,042
I want you to read this.

513
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:51,340
You're the Deardon girl's lawyer.
I hear you're curious.

514
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,924
Just read it.

515
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,510
If you need some more, I'll get it for you.

516
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,379
Wait a minute. Is this stolen material?

517
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,516
If it's stolen, you didn't get it from me,
because we never met, right?

518
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,262
- Try some tomato juice.
- Right.

519
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,360
Watson, have you seen Tom Logan?

520
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,529
Not since he buried me in court last week.

521
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,930
And I'm not looking for him either.

522
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,990
Okay.

523
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,533
- Thompson, where's Logan?
- I'm late, unprepared, and doomed!

524
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,536
- I need Logan, Thompson!
- He's in courtroom seven or six.

525
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,626
I don't know. One of those.

526
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,965
But you were having sexual relations
with the defendant.

527
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,292
No.

528
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,002
- I see.
- We have to talk.

529
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,760
- Then you don't deny it?
- On the contrary. I just did deny it.

530
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,804
- Oh, uh...
- Miss Kelly.

531
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,145
Today is my birthday
and things are going so well.

532
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,309
- Are you going to spoil my birthday?
- Happy birthday, Your Honor.

533
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,529
Begging the court's indulgence, could I
just confer with Mr. Logan for one moment?

534
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:59,321
- Mr. Rustavlov?
- No objection, Your Honor.

535
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,197
Get on with it.

536
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,242
I tried to call you last night.
The most incredible happened.

537
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,161
I'll say. I made a huge discovery that...
You tried to call me?

538
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,583
Yeah. What discovery?

539
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,624
The Deardon case. Major fraud.
I've got hard evidence.

540
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,381
Okay.

541
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,210
Your Honor, an important matter has just
come up that requires my urgent attention.

542
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:20,179
My learned assistant, Miss Freeman

543
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,590
will continue cross-examination
in my absence.

544
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,806
What? Me?

545
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,059
What about this hard evidence?

546
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,855
This.

547
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,606
It's a complete collection
of Sebastian Deardon's paintings.

548
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,609
Wait a minute.

549
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,982
This is a confidential insurance file.
Where'd you get this?

550
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,404
I have my sources.

551
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,029
Notice the red stamps
near most of the paintings?

552
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,278
These were the ones destroyed in the fire.
Look at 122.

553
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,663
Look familiar?

554
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,270
Yeah. This looks like the painting
that Taft showed us at the gallery.

555
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,628
Not looks like, Logan. Is.
Notice the red stamp next to it?

556
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,624
This painting was supposedly
destroyed in the fire.

557
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,556
I say we squeeze him and see what comes out.

558
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,638
Squeeze? No, no.

559
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,647
We're gonna go slow with this guy.

560
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,642
And I don't want to hear the word fraud
come out of your mouth,

561
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,645
'cause we don't know what we've got.
The whole thing could be a clerical error.

562
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,647
Right. A $20 million clerical error?

563
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:22,403
- I'm here with no authority whatsoever.
- Look.

564
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,531
You're in possession of insurance files
of a totally dubious origin.

565
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,529
Inside, I'll do the talking.

566
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,454
Stay behind me
and try to look like an attorney.

567
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,084
Yes, Your Holiness.

568
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,879
At $2,700,000 on the right side.

569
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,211
Now at $2,700,000. Now say 8.

570
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,465
$2,800,000 on the aisle here now.

571
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,672
At $2,800,000. Now say 9.

572
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:48,680
At $2,800,000 on the left aisle,
and fair warning

573
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,678
at $2,800,000.

574
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,685
Sold for $2,800,000.

575
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,684
That's for number 176.

576
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:02,280
Your next lot is number 12.
Lot 12, the Renoir.

577
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,739
Mr. Taft, I'd like to ask you a few more
questions about the Deardon painting.

578
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,348
Actually, I'm in the middle of pursuing
a rather elusive painting...

579
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,706
I'm sorry to bother you. Excuse me.

580
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,329
A colleague of mine
received some documents

581
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,958
related to art underwriting from
the Seaboard Fidelity Company.

582
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,468
- Please, I'm busy.
- We have evidence indicating

583
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,591
not as many Deardons
were destroyed in the fire

584
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,388
as was previously thought.

585
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:32,595
$1,300,000 now, in the left aisle,
a gentleman's bid at $1,300,000.

586
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,519
- I have $1,300,000 on the left.
- Go to $1.8.

587
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:40,523
$1,400,000. I have $1,400,000.

588
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:44,732
I have $1,400,000. Now 5. I have $1,400,000.

589
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,075
Five, $1,500,000. The gentleman at the back.

590
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,743
$1,500,000. Now 6.

591
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,739
I carried little Chelsea out
through the flames. I saved her life.

592
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,786
Everything else, everything,
burned to the ground.

593
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:57,411
And the Deardon you showed us yesterday?
Somehow that managed to survive.

594
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,748
Right. That's it. Get out, both of you,
before I have you thrown out.

595
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,759
- We're not making specific allegations...
- We know those paintings exist.

596
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,549
And we think you have them.

597
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:12,346
If you repeat that allegation anywhere,
publicly or privately,

598
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,763
I'll see to it you never practice law
in any court in this country.

599
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,982
That won't be necessary. Look,
I apologize for Miss Kelly's allegations

600
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,978
but as you know, I do represent
the district attorney's office.

601
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,490
And I would like to look
at your business records.

602
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,657
So if you'll just cooperate, I'm sure
we can avoid any further unpleasantness.

603
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,777
You seem an intelligent man, Mr. Logan.

604
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,446
Far too intelligent
to risk a profitable career

605
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,245
by meddling into legitimate matters
which are none of your concern.

606
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,457
Am I making myself clear?

607
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,163
Perfectly.

608
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,454
I'll have a grand jury issue you
a subpoena in the morning.

609
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,261
And I want to look at all of your records
for the past five years.

610
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,681
Shipping orders, inventories,
bills of sale, the works.

611
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,997
And if you fail to comply, I'll have a federal
marshal will confiscate those records,

612
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,138
and you'll be subject to arrest.

613
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,268
Is that clear?

614
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,605
- 'Bye.
- Good-bye, Mr. Taft.

615
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,281
"Oh, we know those paintings exist,
and we believe you have them."

616
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,650
Didn't you learn anything in law school?

617
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,202
Yeah, but, Logan,
we really shook him up in there.

618
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,288
Oh, yeah.

619
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,873
- That look in your eyes at the end.
- What?

620
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,833
Pure blue steel.

621
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,815
- What are you talking about?
- I'd like to develop a look like that.

622
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,297
You don't develop looks. You just look.

623
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,839
Not me. I practice looks in the mirror.

624
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,508
- I got one I picked up from you.
- What?

625
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:34,091
I'm cross-examining someone
and they give me an answer I just don't buy,

626
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,842
this is what you do.

627
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,847
- I don't do that.
- Yes, you do.

628
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,394
- I don't do that.
- All the time.

629
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,851
- Just like that.
- Come on.

630
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,862
You stand by the jury,
and you sort of give a quarter-turn,

631
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,224
and then you give that exact look.

632
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,862
I saw it, you totally discredited
Van Dyke with it.

633
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,202
Van Dyke? You were in the courtroom?

634
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,827
Yeah. Some people go to ballgames.
I go to court.

635
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,663
Do you have the keys?

636
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,427
Yeah.

637
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,337
Hang on. Hang on.

638
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,674
I'll be right back.

639
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,144
Where did you learn how to do this?

640
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,900
I used to... Never mind.

641
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,646
You can't always get it at first.

642
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,152
Well, you're closer.

643
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,118
- Much closer. There, you got it.
- Ah!

644
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,243
It's Taft.

645
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:47,084
- Sure seems to be in a hurry.
- Yeah.

646
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,721
- Logan. Logan, don't lose him, all right?
- I'm not gonna lose him. Where did he go?

647
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,552
He's... He's Right up there. See?

648
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,600
See? Just up ahead.

649
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,390
No, no. Not that car.
It's the gray Mercedes.

650
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,311
The idea is not to get too close,
so don't get too close.

651
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:13,399
- Oh, is that the idea?
- Hurry, but don't get too close.

652
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,360
Just ease back a little bit.
That's it. All right.

653
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,994
Good. You're doing good.

654
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,701
Okay.

655
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,951
Pull over to the right
so we can make a right-hand turn.

656
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,583
Can you do that? Can you do that?

657
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,959
What are you doing? Logan.
Logan, get back in.

658
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,961
- You drive.
- I don't want to drive.

659
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,963
You seem to have a pretty clear idea
about how to do all this.

660
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,306
I thought you were doing great.
Get back in the car.

661
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,760
- It's your turn, really. Drive.
- I can't.

662
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,514
- What?
- I can't drive.

663
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,860
Oh.

664
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,191
The light's changing.

665
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,024
- Let's...
- Don't. Don't even say it. Don't even think it.

666
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,523
Look, I know you've got
a lot of energy and enthusiasm,

667
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,074
and maybe that's not all bad,

668
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,680
but if we go through that door,
it's called breaking and entering.

669
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,038
Oh, it's not breaking, it's just entering.
There's no law against entering.

670
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,519
There are hundreds of laws against entering.

671
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,583
Not for a government official
in pursuit of a felon.

672
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,498
No. Not a felon. He's not a felon.

673
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,038
In pursuit of a probable felon.

674
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,712
- Probable felon.
- Uh-huh.

675
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,169
<i>"Boston vs. Cavalero, 1967.</i>

676
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,885
"If a certified public official
is in pursuit of a probable felon,

677
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,726
"he or she may enter an unlocked business
or storage area without a warrant

678
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:08,847
"is he has reasonable suspicion that
there are unlawful activities therein."

679
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,059
<i>Boston vs...</i>

680
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,482
Hey. Come here.

681
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,861
Come here.

682
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,992
- Hey!
- I'm just taking a peek.

683
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,209
An open door is practically an invitation.

684
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:35,086
I actually can cite cases where an implied
invitation is a valid reason to enter.

685
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:39,336
- In a building with a security...
- Do you hear something?

686
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,638
It's Taft. Coming, Victor.

687
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,099
He invited you, too.

688
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,176
Jesus.

689
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:15,182
I don't want to blur your concentration
or anything, but we're locked in here.

690
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:19,231
- What's all this flammable stuff?
- Look at this.

691
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:22,356
Look at this.
Here's the business records we wanted.

692
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,360
Letters of incorporation dated 1962.

693
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,244
Three-man partnership.

694
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,539
Triad Enterprises.

695
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,537
Victor Taft, counseling.

696
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,794
Victor Taft, Robert Forrester, Joseph Brock.

697
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,338
- Joseph Brock?
- Taft and Forrester were business partners.

698
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:42,088
No wonder they traded
that painting so quickly.

699
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,211
Look. Deardon's name is everywhere.

700
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,214
Joseph Brock.
What the hell happened to him?

701
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,638
His name disappeared in 1962.

702
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,357
Okay. Here's the insurance payoffs
on the Deardon paintings.

703
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,630
What's that sound, is that your watch?
It's driving me nuts.

704
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,145
No. No.

705
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,323
Robert Forrester. Victor Taft and
Robert Forrester were co-beneficiaries.

706
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,413
- Hey!
- Do something.

707
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,867
Hey. Hold it. Move. Let's go.

708
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,256
Here. Down here!

709
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,283
- Jump!
- Jump?

710
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,746
Are you all right?

711
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,744
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

712
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,171
You all right?

713
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,724
I don't ever want to do this again.

714
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,185
Never again.

715
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:02,390
Make out a warrant
for the arrest of Victor Taft for arson.

716
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:05,189
I think you should know
the chief is totally crazed.

717
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:08,147
He's scarfing down
those little pink pills like they were M&Ms.

718
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:12,359
He almost let the police charge you
and Kelly with breaking and entering.

719
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,611
He's probably never heard of <i>Boston vs...</i>

720
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,362
<i>- Cavalero.</i>
- Right.

721
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,789
Make sure the detective squad hires
some art experts

722
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,961
to sift through the wreckage
of that warehouse.

723
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,959
- Art experts.
- Yeah.

724
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,541
How'd the trial go? Did you win it?

725
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,551
I don't want to talk about it.

726
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,629
- Hey, Miss Kelly.
- Cavanaugh.

727
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,201
Just coming down to see you.
Are you okay? I heard all about it.

728
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,387
Jesus. Must have been a hell of a bang.

729
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,386
- I'm talking to the lady here.
- I can see that.

730
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,389
I'm listening to you talk to the lady.

731
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,732
- Who is this guy?
- Who is this guy?

732
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,268
C.J. Cavanaugh, detective.

733
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,192
This is Tom Logan,
Assistant District Attorney.

734
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:54,401
Excuse me.
I said not to tell the DA's office.

735
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:58,408
- This is supposed to be between you and me.
- No, Cavanaugh. We're doing this together.

736
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,158
- Doing what together?
- It's just an expression.

737
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,540
This is Detective Cavanaugh, and he
investigated the original Deardon fire.

738
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,417
Oh, yeah?
You know something about the case?

739
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,586
Yeah, I know something about this case.

740
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,545
What about this partnership
between Taft and Forrester and...

741
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,804
- Brock.
- Brock, yeah.

742
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,179
Well, there's not much to tell.

743
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,436
The three partners were cooking the books.

744
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,063
Phony tax records.

745
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,602
The IRS starts sniffing around.

746
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:29,440
Taft and Forrester set up Joe Brock
to take the fall for them.

747
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,776
Brock was sitting in the can at Green Haven
when Deardon was murdered.

748
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,110
- Murdered?
- That's the way I see it, yeah.

749
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,994
What happened to Brock?

750
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,823
Joe Brock was not a lucky man.

751
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,622
He got the big C
the year he was released from prison.

752
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,997
Dead and buried in Kansas City, 1972.

753
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,504
That's it?

754
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,135
Yeah, that's it, for now.

755
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:59,220
Look, I do something for you,
you do something for me.

756
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,989
That's my home phone number on the bottom.

757
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,477
If you come up with anything, you call me.

758
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,605
Oh.

759
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:11,937
Snow. That's...

760
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,076
Uh...

761
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:21,492
Listen, I'm having dinner with my daughter.
Do you want to join us? You hungry?

762
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,491
- I have a date.
- A what?

763
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,663
A date.

764
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:30,546
You know, where a man invites
a woman out and they have a very nice...

765
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,591
No, I know what... I'm just wondering.
Are you any...

766
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:38,053
- Are you in any kind of condition to...
- Pardon me?

767
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,178
Well, I mean it's...
You look a little... Forget it.

768
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,523
Logan,

769
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,313
if there's anything at all
about me that you like,

770
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,986
could you tell me what that is right now?

771
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,703
I like your eyes.

772
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,244
Yeah?

773
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,835
They're very warm eyes.

774
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,833
Thank you.

775
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,550
- Cold ears.
- Very cold.

776
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,544
- Can I give you a lift?
- Yes.

777
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,177
May I come in?

778
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,645
Don't ever be a lawyer.

779
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,935
Everybody hates lawyers.

780
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,398
Dad, when you get to be district attorney,

781
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,480
does that mean you have to go into politics?

782
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,652
Oh... I already am in politics.

783
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,973
Princess, politics is
more than just running for elections.

784
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:10,832
Politics...
Politics should be the wise exercise,

785
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,250
distribution, and maintenance of power.

786
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,664
Then what's sexual politics?

787
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,584
Sexual politics?

788
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,265
Well, that's when you have... Uh...

789
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,677
Sex is...

790
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,807
If two...

791
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,434
Dad.

792
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,813
Is it like when... When you call a boy,
but he won't call you

793
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,064
because he's too cool,

794
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:41,567
so you call him to tell him he's cool.

795
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:46,409
So then he can tell everyone you like him,
but he doesn't have to say he likes you.

796
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,696
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Right.

797
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,915
Well then, politics is
just getting what you want, right?

798
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,831
Wait a minute. What have we got here?

799
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:10,494
- I did something really crazy.
- Chelsea, this is not a good time.

800
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:13,135
- I went to see Victor Taft. I had a gun.
- A gun?

801
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,347
- Yeah.
- Come in.

802
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,003
I was trying to force him to tell me
where my father's paintings were.

803
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,063
With a gun?

804
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,486
He knocked me around. He took the gun away.

805
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:26,816
I got all panicky. He hit me.
I managed to break free and run out.

806
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,744
- Did you call Kelly?
- I called Kelly. Her machine was on.

807
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:33,490
Logan, Victor said he was gonna
call the police. I'm really scared.

808
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,284
We've got to get you dry. Uh...

809
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,499
You can use the bathroom.
It's in there. Okay?

810
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:43,337
- This is my daughter, Jennifer.
- Hi.

811
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,464
It's okay.

812
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,763
She looks guilty to me, Dad.

813
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,685
A juror's not supposed
to make a determination

814
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,644
until they have all the evidence. Okay?

815
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,280
Is this someone I'm gonna
get to know her really well?

816
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,028
No, you're not gonna
get to know her very well,

817
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,138
but that doesn't mean you shouldn't
be on your best behavior.

818
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,162
Yeah.

819
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,079
You, too. Right, Dad?

820
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,022
What in the hell... Hold it.
Hold it. It might be the police.

821
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,082
Police?

822
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,789
Why are you protecting her?
She's your girlfriend, isn't she?

823
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,170
No, she's not my girlfriend.
She's just someone... Oh!

824
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,887
Well, look who's here. What a surprise.

825
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,805
- Hi, Mom. We thought you were the cops.
- What?

826
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,549
Uh, well, there we are.

827
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,760
- She's ready. She's ready. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

828
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,806
What's the matter with you guys?
You're acting...

829
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,816
There you go.

830
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,440
- Oh. Uh...
- In front of the kid?

831
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,563
Nothing happened in front of the child.

832
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,818
Mom, Dad didn't hit her in the face.

833
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,945
It was just some guy
she was trying to rob with a gun.

834
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,860
- Thanks.
- Oh.

835
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:57,536
Congratulations. This seems like a perfect
environment for my daughter to be raised in.

836
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:01,494
- She's our daughter. You seem to forget that.
- Right now, I'm trying real hard to forget that.

837
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:04,626
Dad. Dad, I'll make sure she knows
you didn't do anything. Okay?

838
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:05,716
Yeah.

839
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,422
- 'Bye.
- Be good.

840
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,842
What do you want, Ed?

841
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,266
It's none of your business.

842
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,352
- I guess I screwed things up for you, didn't I?
- Oh, forget it.

843
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,863
- I'm always doing that.
- Forget it.

844
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,866
- Mind if I make myself some tea?
- No, I'll make... I'll call Kelly.

845
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,799
<i>Hi. This is Laura Kelly.</i>

846
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,605
<i>I can't come to the phone right now,
but if you leave your message...</i>

847
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:13,241
First thing you're gonna do
in the morning is to call Kelly.

848
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:17,907
Then you're gonna go down
to the police station and file a report.

849
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,997
Why can't you come with me?

850
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:28,297
Why? Why? Because...

851
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,258
Because she's your attorney. I'm not.

852
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,930
- Personal question?
- Huh?

853
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,852
What do you think of me?

854
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,935
Interesting.

855
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,944
The other night when I kissed you,

856
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,313
what did you think of that?

857
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,069
Dangerous.

858
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,319
That's a carefully chosen word.

859
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:01,952
Well, carefully chosen words are the tools
of my profession.

860
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,957
I think you've got everything here.

861
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,831
This has been such a complicated day. I'm...

862
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:10,543
Let's hope everything's fine. Here, I'm...

863
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,044
See you in the morning.

864
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,248
Freeze! Hold it right there! Don't move!

865
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,100
- You have the right to remain silent...
- I know what my rights are.

866
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,374
- Who the hell are you?
- Freeze! Don't move again.

867
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,961
Hey, wise guys! What the hell's happening?

868
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:42,765
Chelsea Deardon, you're under arrest
for the murder of Victor Taft.

869
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,807
Murder! It's not true!

870
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:47,061
Anything you say can be held against you.

871
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:50,431
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Looks like she's already had her attorney.

872
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,482
- Hey!
- Get your clothes on, pal.

873
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,650
Is it true you were found
in bed with the suspect?

874
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,677
They're calling you the darling DA.
What do you think of the name?

875
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:09,079
Our clairvoyant at <i>World's People</i> says
Chelsea Deardon's carrying your child.

876
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,077
Police report says you were both naked.

877
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,545
Do you usually examine suspects this way?

878
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,081
Whoa!

879
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,254
One year!

880
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,808
I had one more year. Now what do you
think they're gonna remember?

881
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,809
The 67,000 convictions I got?

882
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:30,103
No, they're going to remember
one horny bastard

883
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:32,397
who made my office the laughingstock
of the city.

884
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,729
Damn it, Logan, when we service
this community,

885
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,727
we do it with our pants on!

886
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:39,817
Who sent the cops to my place?
Who knew Chelsea was there?

887
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,114
An anonymous caller.

888
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,720
Most anonymous calls end up
in the wastebasket.

889
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:46,863
Most anonymous calls don't involve
an assistant district attorney.

890
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,540
I get shot at, my suspect blows up
a building and then gets killed.

891
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:52,284
Somebody's setting me up.

892
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,711
Well, I got no alternative

893
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,331
but to suspend you
for 90 days pending investigation.

894
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,467
What?

895
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,133
Suspend me?

896
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,261
You... What kind of a cheap
political dodge is that?

897
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:06,136
When I need your help and support
the most, suspend me?

898
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:08,852
No.

899
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,975
You're right. I'm not going to suspend you.

900
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,143
- No. Don't say it. Don't say it.
- You're fired.

901
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,437
No. What, fired? No.
You can't do that. I won't accept it.

902
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,143
- You're fired!
- I quit!

903
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,149
- You what? You what?
- 'Bye.

904
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,522
You what?

905
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,449
You're Logan.
I saw your picture in the paper.

906
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,871
Yeah? What about it?

907
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:32,449
Nothing. I just think
you got a raw deal from the press.

908
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,377
This is a subpoena for you
to appear in court to show cause

909
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,088
why you're inhibiting the proper
education of your daughter.

910
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,414
Your former wife has brought charges before
Judge Lloyd Solomon of district court.

911
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:45,963
You may bring legal counsel to this hearing
if you so desire. Give 'em hell.

912
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:01,986
You want to play rough?

913
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:05,233
Want to find out how good a goddamn
lawyer I am? Well, you got it, sweetheart.

914
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,763
By the time I finish with you,
I'll cut you into so many legal pieces,

915
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,198
they'll have to put you in a bag.

916
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,206
Huh? Oh!

917
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:15,501
Jennifer. Hi, sweetie.

918
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:19,497
Uh... Oh, no. No, I'm fine. I'm good.

919
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:23,835
I'm angry, that's all. Is Mom there?

920
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:26,555
Ah-ha.

921
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,216
Well, when she gets out of the tub,
would you just tell her I called?

922
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:32,768
Great. Okay. Fine.

923
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:36,017
I love you, too. 'Bye.

924
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,693
- Sorry, boss. Elliott Blanchard...
- Oh, not you.

925
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,113
Not now.

926
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,316
I was just checking out the office.

927
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:50,244
This is my damned office until I clean out
my damned desk.

928
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,239
Wouldn't listen, would you?

929
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,208
Everything had to be done your way.

930
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:01,247
Well, you're history.
I'll talk to you later, Doreen.

931
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,349
What?

932
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,261
What happened?

933
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,263
I really can't discuss it right now.

934
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,265
There's an excellent account
available in the <i>Post.</i>

935
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,267
Bit lurid, but highly provocative reading.

936
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:22,813
I read the <i>Post.</i>

937
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:25,442
So you know, or think you know.

938
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,280
You tell me otherwise, Logan.

939
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,283
Tell me you didn't sleep with my client.

940
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:37,290
- Damn it.
- Damn it? Damn it?

941
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,520
Is that what you said? Damn it?

942
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:42,288
Yes, damn it, Logan.
Why did you have to sleep with her?

943
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:45,291
She didn't have enough trouble as it was?
You had to make your conquest public?

944
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,634
Absolutely right. It is my mistake.

945
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,449
I should have kicked her out
the door and right out onto the street.

946
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,701
But I made the mistake and I'm the one
who's gonna pay for it.

947
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,512
Me, no one else, Tom Logan.

948
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,268
Ex-Assistant District Attorney.

949
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:12,326
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping you.

950
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:16,239
Well, don't.
Don't ever help me again. Please.

951
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,414
I think it's obvious
that you're being set up.

952
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,122
We both know that Chelsea was framed.

953
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,834
I think this trumped up murder charge
is just more of the same.

954
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:27,749
Well, a person is entitled
to his or her own opinion.

955
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,672
Lawyers have to prove theirs in court.

956
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,964
- I can prove it.
- Oh, yeah?

957
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,890
I could prove it.

958
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,977
Especially if I had someone working
on the case with me

959
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,347
that knew as much about it as I did.

960
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:47,061
- What are you... What are you saying?
- Someone...

961
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,357
Someone that would benefit a great deal
by Chelsea's acquittal.

962
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:52,576
No.

963
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:57,371
- No.
- Just for this one case, Logan.

964
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,118
You'd get your job back,
and I'd be on my way.

965
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,383
You get one side of the desk.
I get the other.

966
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,595
You have three drawers on your side.
I have three drawers on my side.

967
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,510
We can share the drawer in the center.

968
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,387
I'll just put the phone right in the middle.

969
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,764
My side of the desk will tend
to be very messy.

970
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,978
And I like it like that way,
so don't try to straighten anything up.

971
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,145
All right.

972
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,397
Can we discuss Chelsea's defense?

973
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:29,861
Well, in my opinion we have

974
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:33,611
to cloud the issues in this trial.
We have to get the focus off Chelsea.

975
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:36,409
We've got two witnesses.
How can we discredit them?

976
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,077
Do they have criminal records?

977
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,406
Do they pay their bills,
what do their neighbors think of them,

978
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,749
do they have parking tickets,
they have bounced checks?

979
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:45,744
You know, what kind of people are they?

980
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,672
Any old trick, huh,
to get the client off?

981
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:52,672
You're a defense attorney now, Logan.
You're supposed to get the client off.

982
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,430
I'm gonna need more room here.

983
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,428
I've got to have room to pace.

984
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:00,429
I'm a pacer.

985
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,183
All right. Can we get down to basics now
in the case?

986
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,557
Is she guilty? Do we think she killed Taft?

987
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:09,985
- I think she's capable of killing someone.
- I don't think she killed Taft.

988
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,441
The whole case is based
on circumstantial evidence.

989
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,441
Absolutely. That's why
we don't have to disprove anything.

990
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,443
- We just have to cast some doubt on it.
- Right.

991
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,453
Right.

992
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,289
There's one more important issue here.

993
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,369
What?

994
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:30,960
Are you going to sleep
with our client again?

995
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,459
What has that got to do with the trial?

996
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,572
It has everything to do
with our working relationship.

997
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:40,057
- She's a very attractive young girl.
- Extremely attractive.

998
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,676
I didn't say extremely,
I said just attractive.

999
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,477
Extremely.

1000
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,475
- She has a nice body.
- A sensational body.

1001
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,852
I'll pick the adjectives. A good body.

1002
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,820
Big eyes.

1003
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,233
- Hypnotic.
- Big eyes.

1004
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:58,493
Unforgettable.

1005
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:01,362
Logan, are you going to
sleep with her again or not?

1006
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,001
No.

1007
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:09,254
Good.

1008
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:11,876
That's all I wanted to know.

1009
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:13,545
All rise.

1010
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,570
The Supreme Court
for the County and State of New York

1011
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,712
is now in session. Draw near
and ye shall be heard.

1012
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,514
The honorable judge John Dawkins presiding.

1013
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,143
Please be seated.

1014
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:27,600
Your Honor, the case for
<i>The People of New York</i>

1015
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:31,183
<i>vs. Chelsea Elizabeth Deardon</i>
is ready to proceed for arraignment.

1016
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,439
Counsel is present.
The defendant is present.

1017
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,737
With respect to this matter
of change of venue,

1018
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,153
does defense wish
to engage in oral argument?

1019
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,534
- We don't, Your Honor.
- Yes, we do.

1020
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:43,953
- We don't.
- Yes, we do.

1021
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:45,447
Which is it?

1022
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,181
- No, we don't. No, we don't.
- Of course.

1023
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,539
We move for a change of venue

1024
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:52,621
due to unreasonable and misleading
exposure in the press, Your Honor.

1025
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:56,299
- I object.
- You object to your own co-counsel?

1026
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,085
I do, yes.

1027
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,840
I see.

1028
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,549
Would counsel approach the bench
for a moment, please?

1029
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:11,773
Well, boys and girls,
is this the way things are going to be?

1030
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,559
Your Honor, everyone in New York
has read about this case.

1031
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,882
You think you can find a place
looser morally than New York?

1032
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,863
I happen to be talking to His Honor,
Mr. Logan.

1033
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,803
Maybe you guys should flip a coin to decide
who's going to be your spokesperson.

1034
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,911
Enough already. Motion is denied.

1035
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,702
Does defense wish to enter a plea
at this time?

1036
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,587
Yes, Chelsea Deardon pleads "not guilty."

1037
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:38,588
The court will note for the record
your plea of not guilty. Call the next case.

1038
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:43,596
<i>The State of New York
vs. Christian Clemenson...</i>

1039
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,315
You're a good typist.

1040
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:57,231
Thanks. I thought I'd need something
to fall back on

1041
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:59,605
in case I didn't make it through law school.

1042
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,950
- My dad's a terrible typist.
- I've noticed.

1043
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,915
- But he has his good points.
- Yeah.

1044
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:17,589
You guys like each other, don't you?

1045
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,760
Yeah.

1046
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,427
I see the way you look at each other.

1047
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:27,049
I like the way he moves.

1048
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,476
Yeah, until he trips over something, right?

1049
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,764
- Hello.
- Hi.

1050
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:38,022
- Are there any calls?
- Just Mom. She's on her way over.

1051
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,998
- Dad?
- Yeah.

1052
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:57,421
I, uh... I had a long talk with Mom
and I got her to cancel the subpoena.

1053
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,462
How did you get her to do that?

1054
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:03,989
Well, I told her it would be all right
with you if I went to California.

1055
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,174
What?

1056
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:09,762
But... But you get to pick me up on June 1,
in LA and keep me for 60 consecutive...

1057
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:11,684
Ninety consecutive days.

1058
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,681
What do you know about this?

1059
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:17,734
Uh...

1060
01:18:21,822 --> 01:18:23,313
Did you do this?

1061
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,315
You did this.

1062
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,012
And you thought I'd buy a deal like that?

1063
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,779
Right now, you have her four days a month,
that's 48 days a year.

1064
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:33,240
- I got you 42 more days.
- Yeah. That's... That's almost double, Dad.

1065
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,166
I can add.

1066
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,289
That's Mom.

1067
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,292
- You got everything?
- Yeah. I think so.

1068
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,841
- Here, take this, this time.
- Yeah.

1069
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:48,717
Dad?

1070
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,720
So what do I tell her?

1071
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:53,802
Tell her she's got a deal.

1072
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,681
- Okay. 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1073
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:01,477
You guys are really a great team.
You have a lot in common.

1074
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,675
What's she mean we have "a lot in common"?

1075
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:06,735
I don't know.

1076
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,825
Earlier, she said you liked me.

1077
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,737
What does she know? She's just a kid.

1078
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,742
She's a pretty bright kid.

1079
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,743
Okay, so you have the case load.

1080
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:20,836
- You're going to bring that. Yeah, trial notes.
- You have the trial notes?

1081
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,755
Bring them over tomorrow.

1082
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,750
- All right.
- Good night.

1083
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:38,271
All right.

1084
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,520
- That was nice.
- Yes, it was.

1085
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,897
- See you tomorrow, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1086
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,123
Ladies and gentlemen,

1087
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:08,843
we, the people, are prepared
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt

1088
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:12,339
that on the night of October 7,
Chelsea Elizabeth Deardon

1089
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:16,935
did commit the crime of murder
against the person of one Victor Taft.

1090
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:22,558
That, with intent to cause
the death of Victor Taft,

1091
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,652
she shot him in the chest three times.

1092
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:29,189
We'll call witnesses
who'll testify under oath that they saw

1093
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:31,149
Chelsea Deardon flee the scene of the crime.

1094
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:32,943
Ballistics will prove

1095
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,947
that the gun used to kill Victor Taft was
registered in the name of Chelsea Deardon.

1096
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,664
And most important,

1097
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:41,960
her fingerprints were all over that gun.

1098
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,753
So, we'll prove Chelsea Deardon
was at the scene of the crime,

1099
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:52,133
possessed the means to commit that crime,
and had every opportunity to do so.

1100
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,507
Opportunity and means.

1101
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:59,345
Crucial evidence which, by themselves,
would be enough to establish guilt

1102
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,893
beyond a reasonable doubt in a murder case.

1103
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:07,193
But we will also provide
a compelling motive as well.

1104
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:13,316
This was a crime committed by a woman

1105
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,866
who was secretly Victor Taft's
lover for two years,

1106
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:21,412
during which time he was
her only means of financial support.

1107
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:25,545
It's been one lie after another.

1108
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:27,418
We looked like incompetent idiots out there.

1109
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:28,919
Why didn't you tell us
about your relationship?

1110
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:30,883
Did you really think you could
keep a lid on that?

1111
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,377
It wasn't common knowledge.

1112
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,550
Victor ad I never went out
in public together.

1113
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,132
I thought if you knew,
it would only make me look more guilty.

1114
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,996
You went to his apartment,
you had a fight with him and you killed him!

1115
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,478
No! No! I didn't!

1116
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,351
We had a fight, but I didn't kill him.

1117
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,649
You shot Taft,
then you went to Logan's apartment

1118
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,894
and got him emotionally involved
so he could clear everything.

1119
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,863
I went to Logan's apartment
because I was scared.

1120
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:55,942
Why don't you believe me?
I didn't kill anyone.

1121
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:02,040
That's the most preposterous explanation
I've ever heard.

1122
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,533
Yeah, it is.

1123
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,458
- I believe her.
- What?

1124
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,749
What, based on her track record so far?

1125
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:13,335
No, hunch. Instinct.

1126
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,797
Let's hope it's coming from above the waist.

1127
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,599
I believe her, too.

1128
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,932
Okay, she's telling the truth.

1129
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,935
You ready to do some tap dancing?

1130
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:31,237
Oh, hey.

1131
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,987
Ladies and gentlemen,
Chelsea Deardon did not kill Victor Taft.

1132
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:39,737
The prosecution has suggested
a possible motive,

1133
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,949
but one based entirely on hearsay,
conjecture and circumstantial evidence.

1134
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:47,752
Evidence that on the surface would appear
to have some substance,

1135
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,670
but upon closer examination

1136
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:53,003
will prove to have no relevance
whatsoever to this case.

1137
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,093
You're not buying this, are you?

1138
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:04,014
You're not listening to a word I'm saying.
Really, are you?

1139
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:07,264
Guess what? I don't blame you.

1140
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:12,481
After listening to Mr. Blanchard lay out
the prosecution's evidence,

1141
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:17,983
even I'm convinced
my client murdered Victor Taft.

1142
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:23,029
After all, if I had walked in the room
and found Victor Taft dead on the floor

1143
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,033
and Chelsea Deardon's fingerprints
all over the weapon that killed him,

1144
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:29,043
there isn't much in the world that would
convince me that she wasn't guilty.

1145
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:32,000
Look. Let's just save ourselves
a lot of time here.

1146
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:36,001
Let's be honest. I'm sure there are a lot
better things for us to be doing.

1147
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,128
Who thinks Chelsea Deardon is guilty?

1148
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:40,805
Objection, Your Honor.

1149
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,884
Mr. Logan.

1150
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,123
Come on. Here, don't hold back.
I got my hand raised. Look here.

1151
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:50,231
I believe that my client murdered
Victor Taft in cold blood.

1152
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:52,058
Isn't everybody convinced?

1153
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,482
- Mr. Logan.
- Who agrees with me? Come on.

1154
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,312
- I object!
- Mr. Logan.

1155
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,485
- You're convinced, aren't you?
- Your Honor.

1156
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,908
- Your Honor!
- Look! Prosecution says she's guilty.

1157
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:04,032
Everybody in the jury says she's guilty.
Let's save the State of New York

1158
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,032
a lot of time and money
and move directly to sentencing.

1159
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:11,040
- What?
- Isn't she entitled to a fair trial?

1160
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,164
Oh. Let's give her
a fair trial and then convict her.

1161
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,540
Mr. Logan!

1162
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,171
You are totally out of order
and you know it!

1163
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,090
This jury is disqualified.

1164
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,048
Court will stand in recess
while I consider holding you in contempt.

1165
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:26,927
Your Honor, I recognize that my opening
remarks are highly irregular,

1166
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,182
but, please, let me continue
even though the jury

1167
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:31,310
may consider my client guilty
at this time,

1168
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,063
I'd like to state for the record that
I still believe in this jury,

1169
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:37,358
and I'm willing to accept their final verdict,
whatever it might be.

1170
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:39,071
I concur, Your Honor.

1171
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:43,068
Prosecution has... Has equal faith
in this jury, Your Honor.

1172
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:45,949
May I proceed?

1173
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,949
Very well. You may proceed, Mr. Logan.

1174
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,916
Thank you, Your Honor.

1175
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:54,964
Okay.

1176
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:58,091
So we all think she's guilty.
Now what do we do?

1177
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,085
That's a dilemma, isn't it?

1178
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:02,842
It's an especially difficult problem
because we've developed

1179
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:06,011
a legal concept in this country
to protect ourselves,

1180
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,092
to protect our rights,

1181
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:11,813
and it's called "presumption of innocence."

1182
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:16,939
In simpler words that means
that one is presumed innocent

1183
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,611
until proven guilty.

1184
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:22,218
That means that whatever assumptions you
might have already made in this case,

1185
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:25,110
Chelsea Deardon must be seen in your eyes,

1186
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,238
must be believed in your minds,
must be understood in your hearts

1187
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:30,115
to be innocent.

1188
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,618
So what is the truth?

1189
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:40,667
Maybe the truth begins 18 years ago

1190
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,298
when dozens of paintings,

1191
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,552
works of art by the defendant's father,
Sebastian Deardon,

1192
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:50,764
supposedly perished in a fire,
which also tragically took his life.

1193
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:54,977
Now, the insurance paid on those paintings
totaled $2.5 million.

1194
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,558
Now, that's a staggering sum

1195
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:59,520
but only a fraction
of what they'd be worth today.

1196
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:08,615
We believe

1197
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,247
that those paintings still exist,

1198
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:15,710
and are today worth more than $20 million.

1199
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:24,886
Victor Taft was not murdered
as an act of revenge by the defendant.

1200
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,173
Victor Taft was murdered to protect someone.

1201
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,887
Someone who himself, 18 years ago

1202
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,853
was a co-conspirator
to arson, fraud, and murder.

1203
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:37,228
Someone who took advantage
of Chelsea Deardon

1204
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:42,312
and who tried to frame her for a crime
for which he himself was responsible.

1205
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,862
Listen, ladies and gentlemen,
this is a complex case,

1206
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:51,204
but I'm confident that
once you've heard all the evidence,

1207
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:54,741
that you will come to a decision
that is the truth.

1208
01:26:56,503 --> 01:27:00,087
And the truth is,
Chelsea Deardon is innocent.

1209
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:03,128
Thank you.

1210
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:15,057
Without objection, this court is adjourned
until 9:00 Monday morning.

1211
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:21,526
Eloquent, Tom.
Better have the goods by Monday.

1212
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,695
- Yeah, just show up, Blanchard.
- Great opening.

1213
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,275
Congratulations, counselor.

1214
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:32,237
If you meant to baffle them with bullshit,
my hat's off to you.

1215
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,328
Would you excuse us?

1216
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,852
If that's an indication
of where you're heading with this case...

1217
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,242
Count on it, Forrester.

1218
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:41,871
Daddy!

1219
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,092
- Murderer.
- What?

1220
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,842
- How dare you?
- I was there.

1221
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:53,265
A small child was there, hardly qualified
to come to a rational conclusion.

1222
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:55,058
You're a liar.

1223
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,103
I won't be made the scapegoat

1224
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,183
for the desperate act
of an emotionally disturbed young woman.

1225
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,268
Is that clear?

1226
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:06,821
<i>Yes, could you get Mr. Crane
in records, please?</i>

1227
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:08,818
Mr. Crane,

1228
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:12,819
I have Mr. Morrison from claims.
One moment, please.

1229
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,575
Crane?

1230
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:17,999
Crane. Crane, where are they?

1231
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:23,629
I'm talking about the shipping files,
the Taft Gallery warehouse shipping files.

1232
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:24,918
Where are they?

1233
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:28,297
I've got customers all over me.
Claim they never arrived.

1234
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:29,512
Huh?

1235
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,386
Immediately!

1236
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,718
No, not tomorrow, now.

1237
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,309
Taft! Do I have to spell it for you, too?

1238
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,394
Listen, Crane, get those files
up to me right away.

1239
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,889
Morrison. Claims. Now!

1240
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:44,100
Otherwise you can talk
to the legal department.

1241
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,565
May I help you?

1242
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:52,317
Is this claims?

1243
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,827
- No. That's on 26.
- Oh!

1244
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:06,549
Well?

1245
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:09,838
How do I look?

1246
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:16,803
Joe Morrison. It's my first day on the job.

1247
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,344
Trying to make a good impression.

1248
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:21,972
- Where's my office?
- Morrison.

1249
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:24,774
Nobody told me. Are you sure?

1250
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:30,188
- Laura, do you have that...
- Yes, of course, Mr. Morrison.

1251
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,281
It's right here.

1252
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:37,992
"Effective immediately,
Joseph J. Morrison." That's me.

1253
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:40,164
"Position of claims adjuster."
Blah, blah, blah.

1254
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,583
It's all here.
This is the claims department, isn't it?

1255
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:44,577
Yeah. Was somebody let go?

1256
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,541
What a jungle.

1257
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,793
They fire someone and don't even tell them?

1258
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:52,298
- Welcome to corporate America.
- This memo isn't signed. I'll have...

1259
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:54,546
- Mr. Morrison's office?
- That's me, son.

1260
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,426
- Mr. Morrison?
- Yeah.

1261
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:59,392
I need to do this work from an office.
Could you tell me which one it is?

1262
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:03,183
I'll have to speak to Mr. Phillips
about this. Please, just wait right here.

1263
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,857
Let's get the hell out of here.

1264
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,227
Hong Kong. Two crates.

1265
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:17,869
Please excuse me. What?

1266
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:20,454
- You put the London form in the Asian pile.
- No, that's not...

1267
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:24,576
- That's not the Asian pile.
- What's that, South America?

1268
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:27,036
No. Medium-sized crate pile. Medium-size.

1269
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:28,875
We're doing it geographically.

1270
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:31,611
We're trying to find out what the pattern is,
then what breaks the pattern.

1271
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:34,503
No, I know that, Logan,
but I'm doing it by size. See?

1272
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:38,260
"Taft Gallery to Victor Taft,
40 x 80 x 15."

1273
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,888
- I see, but...
- Very large crate, very large crate.

1274
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:43,056
Guess where it goes? Large crate pile.

1275
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:47,732
Here's another one. "Taft Gallery to
Victor Taft." Very large crate. So big.

1276
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:50,434
- Goes right there.
- Where did they ship to?

1277
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,152
Manhattan. Sutton Place.

1278
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:55,443
Sutton Place?
Victor Taft at a Sutton Place address?

1279
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,050
I thought he lived on Central Park West.

1280
01:30:57,827 --> 01:30:58,943
<i>What are the dates?</i>

1281
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,952
<i>Mid-September, all of them.</i>

1282
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,497
<i>- About the time we were at the gallery.
- Yes.</i>

1283
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,743
So Taft sends himself a large shipment
to a strange address?

1284
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:09,461
About the same time
that we went to see him at the gallery.

1285
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,875
The Deardons!

1286
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:19,255
It's me.

1287
01:31:20,266 --> 01:31:22,758
I think they found
what you're looking for.

1288
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,642
You'll get there first.
I'll take care of it.

1289
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,401
Want to drive?

1290
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:46,041
You all right?

1291
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,502
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

1292
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:02,514
Logan, what are you doing?

1293
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:04,175
Logan!

1294
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,685
- Logan!
- Hey!

1295
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:13,188
What's your rush, man?

1296
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:40,544
What are you...

1297
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:45,015
What's the matter with you?

1298
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,080
Oh!

1299
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:16,751
I can do this. I can do this!

1300
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:20,672
Holy shit!

1301
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,597
God! Are you okay?

1302
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,595
- Oh, my God.
- He ran right in front of me!

1303
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,428
- You see it?
- No, but I heard a crash.

1304
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,063
Okay. Okay.

1305
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:43,611
Logan!

1306
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,112
What are you doing?

1307
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:51,199
- He took his wallet!
- Hey! Hey!

1308
01:33:52,919 --> 01:33:54,535
- Logan!
- Hey!

1309
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:59,711
- Get in!
- Kelly! Brake! Brake!

1310
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:04,462
Help! Police!

1311
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,727
Are you okay?

1312
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:15,639
- Good driving.
- Thanks.

1313
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:17,649
Credit cards.

1314
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:20,353
$45 cash. Cleaners.

1315
01:34:20,864 --> 01:34:24,653
Look at this.
Robert Forrester's business card.

1316
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,696
- Forrester?
- Forrester.

1317
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:55,687
What we got here is Fort Knox.

1318
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,682
Here's Taft. 2-B.

1319
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:05,732
Okay, you can come up,
but none of that funny stuff.

1320
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:09,156
Yeah? Then what's the point of coming up?

1321
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,169
What's this? It's open.

1322
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:22,965
Be careful.

1323
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,636
Chuck Close.

1324
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:39,940
The Transcontinental Express.
That's the same size as the shipment.

1325
01:35:40,026 --> 01:35:42,734
Somebody's already
been through this stuff. Look.

1326
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,319
Campbell's soup.

1327
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:47,610
Look at this Lichtenstein!

1328
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:51,235
God, it must be worth $200,000.

1329
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,454
Why would somebody leave paintings
worth $200,000 lying around?

1330
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:55,914
Mondrian...

1331
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:57,833
Steinberg...

1332
01:35:58,378 --> 01:36:00,620
There's millions of dollars' worth
of paintings here,

1333
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:01,874
but there's no Deardons.

1334
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:05,249
Look at this.

1335
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,376
A wall-to-wall bed.

1336
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,049
You could have a tag-team match
on that thing.

1337
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:17,553
Tom.

1338
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,559
If Taft has. Jeez!

1339
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:23,777
Oh!

1340
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,481
Forrester.

1341
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:33,159
I'm going to call the police.

1342
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,658
No, on... On second thought,
maybe we shouldn't call the police.

1343
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:40,159
Maybe we should.

1344
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:43,670
What?

1345
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:46,749
- What?
- God.

1346
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:48,964
- You scared me to death.
- Oh!

1347
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:51,295
What are you doing here?

1348
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:53,844
There was a message on my machine
to meet you here.

1349
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,467
- There was no message.
- You left a message.

1350
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:58,639
How did you get in here?

1351
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,813
This was Victor's and my place.
I have a key.

1352
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:03,224
Oh no, not again.

1353
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:09,526
Okay, let's hear it.
That famous Logan instinct.

1354
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:10,860
You first.

1355
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,076
All right.

1356
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:16,825
I don't see how she could've lifted
a 200-pound man on the bed.

1357
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,663
Therefore, she's innocent.

1358
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:23,619
What in the hell is that?
Where have I seen that before?

1359
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:24,874
That's the Bertolini.

1360
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:27,089
Remember we saw the model
for it in Taft's office?

1361
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:29,503
The one he couldn't sell
for sentimental reasons.

1362
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:31,051
Victor hated that sculpture.

1363
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:34,509
He thought Bertolini was a joke.

1364
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,477
We got to get to the Taft Gallery.

1365
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:44,932
I'll find Cavanaugh,

1366
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:48,232
get a search warrant and meet you
at the gallery in a few minutes.

1367
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:25,894
<i>The private Victor Taft was also
an incredibly warm human being...</i>

1368
01:38:26,526 --> 01:38:27,733
<i>A leader,</i>

1369
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,943
<i>a benefactor.</i>

1370
01:38:32,198 --> 01:38:34,906
<i>Victor Taft championed my work</i>

1371
01:38:35,785 --> 01:38:38,277
<i>at a time when no one else was interested.</i>

1372
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:40,283
<i>But Victor had vision.</i>

1373
01:38:59,225 --> 01:39:02,935
<i>...the contribution that Victor made
to young artists,</i>

1374
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:04,553
<i>and through them...</i>

1375
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,646
What do you think?

1376
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:15,443
- It sounds hollow.
- Yeah.

1377
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:18,952
Uh...

1378
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:21,741
Cavanaugh, Detective Cavanaugh,
you guys. Where...

1379
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:26,951
Uh... Detective Cavanaugh?

1380
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:27,961
Yo.

1381
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:33,131
- I'm looking for Detective Cavanaugh.
- That's me. What can I do for you?

1382
01:39:34,343 --> 01:39:35,959
- You're Cavanaugh?
- Yeah.

1383
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:38,305
You're...

1384
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:41,139
You're the only Detective Cavanaugh
in Manhattan South?

1385
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:43,638
There must be a way into this.

1386
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:55,069
Cavanaugh.

1387
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,031
The name's Joe Brock.

1388
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:02,407
And whatever's inside
that piece of crap belongs to me.

1389
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,366
Oh, God!

1390
01:40:08,628 --> 01:40:09,664
Shit!

1391
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:21,471
Hey! What the hell are you doing over there?

1392
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:24,804
Breaking into my car.

1393
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,020
Oh.

1394
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:34,609
Is that the gun you used
to kill Taft and Forrester?

1395
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:39,903
It just might be the gun I use to kill you.
Take that.

1396
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:42,670
All right, Kelly, go on, take a whack at it.

1397
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,194
Pretend it's my head.

1398
01:41:16,946 --> 01:41:20,064
Who was the guy that shot at us?
The one that followed Chelsea?

1399
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:22,361
Nobody. A hired hand, paid to do a job.

1400
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:23,779
It's in there!

1401
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:25,740
Come on, hit it again!

1402
01:41:29,542 --> 01:41:31,875
When did you decide to kill Taft, Cavanaugh?

1403
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:34,544
After Taft and Forrester set me up
for that prison stretch.

1404
01:41:34,672 --> 01:41:37,289
Just waited for my chance. Come on.

1405
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,094
Come on!

1406
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:57,110
Come on.

1407
01:42:08,164 --> 01:42:10,030
It's mine!

1408
01:43:22,363 --> 01:43:24,195
Fire! Fire!

1409
01:43:49,974 --> 01:43:50,974
Logan!

1410
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:53,226
Laura!

1411
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:53,411
Logan!

1412
01:45:15,935 --> 01:45:17,301
Oh, God.

1413
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:20,095
Please hurry.

1414
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,540
Ah!

1415
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:01,354
Whoa!

1416
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:22,834
Kelly!

1417
01:46:37,892 --> 01:46:39,383
Come on, Chelsea!

1418
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:40,768
Kelly!

1419
01:46:43,689 --> 01:46:44,689
Kelly!

1420
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:47,394
Go on!

1421
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,320
Kelly!

1422
01:46:50,779 --> 01:46:51,779
Logan!

1423
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:00,779
- Can we go down the stairs?
- No, you can't get out there.

1424
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:04,328
- Over here!
- Chelsea, come on!

1425
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:05,418
Down here.

1426
01:47:06,503 --> 01:47:07,789
Let's go!

1427
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,416
What about me?

1428
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:42,662
Over here.

1429
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:56,467
Oh, my God!

1430
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:00,721
Oh, God.

1431
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:16,859
And so in conclusion,
Your Honor, in light of the new

1432
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:21,489
and seemingly incontrovertible
evidence presented before this court

1433
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:26,490
on the admirable initiative
of the estimable co-counsels for defense,

1434
01:48:27,418 --> 01:48:30,126
we, the people, now recommend
that all charges against

1435
01:48:30,212 --> 01:48:31,953
Chelsea Elizabeth Deardon

1436
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:33,421
be dismissed.

1437
01:48:33,549 --> 01:48:34,790
So be it.

1438
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:37,216
This case is dismissed.

1439
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:39,002
The court is adjourned.

1440
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:51,524
Ha-ha!

1441
01:48:52,443 --> 01:48:53,809
Congratulations, Tom.

1442
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:55,105
Wonderful job.

1443
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:56,527
Comeback of the year!

1444
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:57,737
Oh, I had a little help.

1445
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:59,780
Yeah, sure. Good work, Miss...

1446
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:02,359
- Kelly.
- Kelly. Right.

1447
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:04,744
- Tom, you got a great opportunity here.
- What?

1448
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:07,538
All these reporters. It's the perfect time
to launch your campaign.

1449
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:10,158
- Campaign!
- For district attorney, remember?

1450
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:12,911
I remember being fired
as an assistant district attorney.

1451
01:49:13,005 --> 01:49:14,746
You were fired, not officially.

1452
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:16,943
- I Never put the paperwork through.
- This is amazing.

1453
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:19,550
In his own way,
he was backing you 100 percent.

1454
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:21,197
You got to start thinking like a politician.

1455
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:24,259
Tom, you're the hottest legal property
in the city.

1456
01:49:24,349 --> 01:49:26,762
We could win this election
by just announcing your candidacy.

1457
01:49:26,852 --> 01:49:28,343
What do you say?

1458
01:49:29,146 --> 01:49:30,353
Forget it.

1459
01:49:31,273 --> 01:49:33,765
- Forget it?
- Forget it.

1460
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:36,268
Too proud to come back?

1461
01:49:38,822 --> 01:49:40,563
Too happy where I am.

1462
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:43,198
Should have put the paperwork through.

1463
01:49:43,285 --> 01:49:46,574
Ms. Deardon, what will happen
to your father's paintings?

1464
01:49:47,206 --> 01:49:48,492
I'm not sure.

1465
01:49:48,874 --> 01:49:50,661
I'm just happy they still exist.

1466
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:53,456
Were you ever
actually in love with Taft?

1467
01:49:55,047 --> 01:49:56,254
Once.

1468
01:49:57,591 --> 01:49:58,591
Maybe.

1469
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:00,208
I can't remember.

1470
01:50:00,302 --> 01:50:02,510
Yet you lived with him
for some time.

1471
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:04,258
For some time for one purpose.

1472
01:50:04,598 --> 01:50:06,034
How do you feel now that you've...

1473
01:50:06,058 --> 01:50:07,594
Vintage Chelsea.

1474
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:10,435
First she seduces Taft
because she needed information.

1475
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:12,638
Then she seduces you
because she needed help.

1476
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:15,891
With the risk of seeming immodest,
I'd like to think she did with me

1477
01:50:15,984 --> 01:50:18,772
what she did with me
because she found me simply attractive.

1478
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:21,275
Oh, it's...

1479
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:23,277
It's perfectly understandable.

1480
01:50:23,408 --> 01:50:24,615
- It is?
- Yeah.

1481
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:27,452
Because Chelsea's very good
at luring men onto her bed.

1482
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:28,824
Extremely good.

1483
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:31,827
No, no. I pick the adjectives.

1484
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:34,496
"Big eyes."

1485
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,081
"Hypnotic eyes."

1486
01:50:36,338 --> 01:50:38,625
"Unforgettable eyes." She has great eyes!

1487
01:50:38,715 --> 01:50:40,206
Yes, she does,

1488
01:50:41,677 --> 01:50:43,919
but they're not as great as yours.
