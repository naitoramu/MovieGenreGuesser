1
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:28,126
June 1989.

2
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:47,792
On the last day of school,
the last year of high school,

3
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:50,501
the bell rings
after your last class

4
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:54,542
and you think it's the last second
of your adolescence.

5
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:59,376
You have to mark the event
with a memorable slogan like:

6
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:01,917
"May the force be with you".

7
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:04,709
Or "Champions of the world!

8
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:07,751
Champions of the world!"

9
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:12,959
But most of all,
you just want to let off the steam

10
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:16,376
that's built up over the years.

11
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:32,709
Thanks for the book.

12
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:34,917
Tell me what you think.

13
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:38,542
Kundera's light years
ahead of his time.

14
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,834
Antonio Martinelli,

15
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:45,251
the biggest asshole Lit teacher
in history.

16
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:48,959
Known as "The Prick"
by four generations of students.

17
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:52,167
I was nothing more
than a number to him.

18
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:54,917
Actually, a letter... C -.

19
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:57,584
To what
do I owe the honour, Molinari?

20
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,292
- Do you have a second?
- Just one, no more.

21
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,126
So?

22
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:07,251
I just wanted you to know
you're a total dick.

23
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,209
You've ruined
the last few years of my life.

24
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:17,709
You made me hate school

25
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:20,001
and I think you're a mega-loser.

26
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:23,167
I've been wondering for five years

27
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,001
where you buy
these awful '70s jackets?

28
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:29,834
Is the dandruff included
or is that your special touch?

29
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:33,376
And your bag? Same supplier?

30
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:38,126
And Miss Lattanzi
thinks the same way.

31
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:41,542
There's no point
in giving her Kundera,

32
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:46,042
someone like her would never
put out for someone like you.

33
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,626
I felt great!

34
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:53,417
Too bad no one was there
to witness it.

35
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:57,042
I humiliated him,
I deserved a standing ovation.

36
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,876
Did you hear about Mr Santoro?

37
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,042
No.

38
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:06,084
He had an accident.
He won't be here for the exams.

39
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,917
Guess who's taking his place?

40
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,126
- You're kidding.
- I never kid.

41
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:22,542
Nice hair,
come like that to the exams...

42
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,459
On the last day of
the last year of high school,

43
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,584
when the bell rings
after your last class,

44
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:34,626
you think it's the last second
of your adolescence...

45
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:37,292
Total bullshit!

46
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,334
THE NIGHT BEFORE FINALS

47
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:55,209
Good for you, Luca.
The biggest dork of the century.

48
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:59,626
If you pass,
Ascoli will win the Nationals.

49
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:03,709
Massimiliano, my best friend.

50
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:06,126
He has the record of
dead grandparents.

51
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:09,626
35 old people sacrificed
So he can get out of tests.

52
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:13,542
If The Prick sees us together,
he'll flunk me too.

53
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,959
Simona! Move your butt!

54
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:21,959
Sorry, the Nobel Prize winner
for manners is calling.

55
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:27,792
Simona, the only woman alive able
to put up with that idiot Massi,

56
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,834
she's a saint.

57
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:33,959
- See you at the party tonight?
- I don't feel like coming.

58
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,251
And we weren't even invited.

59
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,667
It's embarrassing when you have
a party and no one crashes it.

60
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:42,376
I'm the DJ, I say you can come.

61
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:44,751
I don't feel like it.

62
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,792
I doubt Martinelli got offended.

63
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:49,792
No, he just called him a dick.

64
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:54,209
- Be at my house at 8!
- No, I said no!

65
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:57,834
- Dress sharp!
- I said no!

66
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:01,584
Luca, tell me you didn't do it.

67
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:07,126
I have a female best friend too,
Alice.

68
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:11,334
Talking to her over a yoghurt drink
is the greatest.

69
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:16,167
Besides suicide, there are three ways
to avoid flunking.

70
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,376
What?

71
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,584
One: The hole in the ozone expands
and wipes us all out.

72
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,626
What's two?

73
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:28,251
Two: A giant meteor flies through
the hole in the ozone

74
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:31,126
and crashes into Martinelli's house.

75
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:34,959
Three: Vegan armies invade Earth
because Grendizer's on vacation.

76
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:38,584
No, number three is study,
it's the best way.

77
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:43,417
My last hope, the only one who'd
understand me, was Riccardo,

78
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:45,584
my best friend.

79
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:49,334
! know, I said that
about Maser and Alice, I have three,

80
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,376
there's no "Top 40" for friends.

81
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:55,959
Who gives a shit?
You were a year ahead anyway.

82
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:59,334
- So?
- You'll be back on schedule.

83
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:02,417
Just light a joint and it'll be fine.

84
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:07,584
- I haven't flunked yet.
- It's a matter of time.

85
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:14,126
It's so nice having friends.

86
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:24,376
"12 kilometres down
the Appia on the right."

87
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,626
A beige Renault outside a gate.

88
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:32,459
"Go past the oat field."

89
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:35,667
- What the fuck do oats look like?
- I don't know.

90
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:37,959
Like oatmeal.

91
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:41,667
"After two minutes
take the first or second left

92
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:44,292
and you'll hear dogs barking.

93
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:48,501
It might be the third left,
but I'm not really sure.”

94
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,709
Simona, your boyfriend
is so full of shit!

95
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,917
I'm leaving,
thanks for the great evening.

96
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:02,834
Let's go.
I bet they're going to the party.

97
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:06,042
And you're going to have fun too,
Mr Misery-Guts.

98
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,334
Hi.

99
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:31,542
Hi.

100
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,667
Does anyone know
whose party this is?

101
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:36,709
Yes, it's mine.

102
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:40,292
Oh, congratulations, then.

103
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:43,917
You're not on the list, are you?

104
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:48,334
No, I'm a friend of the DJ, Max.

105
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:52,459
He said...

106
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,501
Nice house, it's really pretty.

107
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,792
Especially the garden.
It's so... English.

108
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:02,292
Give it up. It's her party.

109
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,459
Princess Leila.

110
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,334
Today was my last day of school.

111
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,542
Mine too.

112
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,251
- I did the Science lyceum.
- Mine was Classics.

113
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:22,042
That was a good choice because
you get a broader education

114
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:25,334
and Greek will help at university.

115
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:28,042
Greek makes me throw up.

116
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:31,417
My father made me
go to the Classics lyceum.

117
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:33,251
I know what you mean,

118
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:36,084
extinct languages are pointless.

119
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:42,709
How many girls have you picked up
with this method?

120
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,209
2 or 3.

121
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:49,626
In Grade School.

122
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:03,626
Champagne!

123
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:07,042
- Mademoiselle... - Merci.
- II n'y a pas de quoi.

124
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:11,209
- You speak French?
- Yes, my mother is from Paris.

125
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:13,917
I studied it at school

126
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:16,417
and went to Paris for 2 months.

127
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,834
Your pronunciation is perfect.

128
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,459
Listen, it's your favourite.

129
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:24,501
- Favourite what?
- Your favourite dance.

130
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,167
Oh, right... That one.

131
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:31,001
Adieu, mon amour.

132
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:51,417
- Anyway, my name is...
- School's out!

133
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:54,584
That idiot!

134
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:58,584
- Does champagne stain?
- I can't go home like this.

135
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,084
Now what?

136
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:04,126
- Follow me.
- Where?

137
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,792
Here's the wardrobe,
close the door.

138
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,376
- What are you doing?
- Changing.

139
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:23,751
Not this one.

140
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,042
Do you like this? Put it on.

141
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:29,251
- We can't just...
- Why?

142
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:33,542
What? Change your shirt.

143
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,501
Right, right away.

144
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:40,751
We should have a shower first.

145
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:44,667
A shower? What do you mean?

146
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:54,709
- Stop making a scene!
- It was a kiss on the mouth!

147
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,001
It was a friendly gesture!

148
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:59,626
Do friends French kiss?

149
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:07,626
I wanted that argument
to last forever.

150
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,667
I know, Fonzie would have
kissed her there and then.

151
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:14,376
But I wasn't Fonzie,
I was Richie Cunningham.

152
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:17,209
- Are you smelling me?
- No.

153
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,501
I was checking for split ends.

154
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,792
Okay, I was smelling you.

155
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,126
And?

156
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:30,751
Nice, very nice.

157
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:43,042
How is it?

158
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:50,292
- What are they doing?
- Making up.

159
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:53,876
Never again, I love you.

160
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:58,542
I love my little buttercup.

161
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:03,209
You're my buttery buttercup.
You're so buttery!

162
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:18,792
Are you kidding?
You think she's right?

163
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:23,417
- You kiss friends on the lips?
- Sometimes. You don't?

164
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:27,126
- I dare them to try!
- Claudia, where the fuck were you?

165
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:29,334
Around...

166
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,959
Let's go,
your brother just puked in the pool.

167
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:37,459
- Who's that?
- No one.

168
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:43,292
Have you changed?

169
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:49,751
Claudia...
The love of my life is Claudia.

170
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,542
Are you drunk?

171
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:55,334
I've never been drunk.

172
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,959
But why is everything spinning?

173
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:13,917
9 June. Positive thought:

174
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:18,334
The party was crowded, the music cool
and sangria great.

175
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:25,084
Negative thought:
The same one... Cesare.

176
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:29,084
He's been really edgy lately.

177
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:33,709
Don't you caution me,
you little weasel!

178
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:42,042
The worst thing is 12 days,
6 hours and 23 minutes to exams.

179
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,959
Who invented final exams?

180
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,376
I want that bastard's name!

181
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:51,126
If I don't get top grade,
dad will kill himself.

182
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:54,876
But will this grade
ever make a difference in my life?

183
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,417
PS... I met a nice guy.

184
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,251
I can't even remember his name.

185
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,292
Too bad!

186
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:16,584
I liked Raf better
with "Self-Control".

187
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:20,292
Grandma, it was awful!
With his fake English!

188
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:24,126
What? "You take myself..."

189
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:27,542
Quick, listenable.
And most of all, international.

190
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,417
Hello?

191
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,626
Today is the first day of freedom.

192
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:41,376
I couldn't care less.
Dado and I broke up.

193
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,876
I swear on Tom Cruise
I'll never see him again.

194
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:48,709
- Then he makes that puppy-dog face...
- Tells you you're special

195
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,292
I couldn't care less.

196
00:16:52,084 --> 00:16:55,376
- How was the party?
- Crowded.

197
00:16:55,584 --> 00:17:00,001
- Tell her the best part.
- I met a guy.

198
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:03,501
- What's he like?
- There's something about him...

199
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:07,084
- Have you set a date?
- For what?

200
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:10,584
The day you dump Cesare for good!

201
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,334
I like him.

202
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:16,209
Like you would a goldfish.

203
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:20,209
You were 15 and he was 19
when you got together.

204
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:23,167
Now you're 19... and he's 15.

205
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:29,376
We're here for something important,
our final exams so...

206
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,834
- This one?
- Too frumpy.

207
00:17:34,376 --> 00:17:36,001
I'll just go naked.

208
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,626
- Do you think I'll pass?
- Of course!

209
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,501
Tell me the truth.

210
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:49,834
You're the only one who got an A,
it would be impossible.

211
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:53,251
I flunked Maths and Physics.

212
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:57,292
- I've got 43 absences.
- You could've avoided that.

213
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:01,251
- What about this one?
- No, too working-class.

214
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:06,709
Have you ever tried
reading Dickinson at 10 am?

215
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:10,084
In a park with the lifting fog...

216
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,834
"Had I not seen the sun,
I could have borne the shade.

217
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:18,876
But Light a newer Wilderness,
my wilderness has made."

218
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:20,667
What a drag!

219
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:26,167
- Claudia...
- Can't you knock?

220
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:29,376
What for?
Grandma was supposed to sew these.

221
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,834
- She's in the kitchen.
- No, she's not in her room either.

222
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,459
She hasn't gone out, has she?

223
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:38,334
- Did she take her medicine?
- How would I know?

224
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:14,376
Okay, guys. Five-minute break.

225
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:28,251
Hi, Claudia.

226
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:33,292
- So you joined.
- Don't tell your dad, though.

227
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:37,751
- Or the cardiologist either?
- He's such a pain.

228
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:43,334
- What about the physical?
- Well...

229
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:48,376
Adele! You never told me
you had such a pretty friend.

230
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,501
Cut it out!

231
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:53,209
- Claudia, meet Ludovico.
- Hello.

232
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:57,584
I know all about you,
you're about to graduate.

233
00:19:58,251 --> 00:20:00,501
You like the beach
but not the mountains.

234
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:05,001
And most of all,
you like men over 70.

235
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:07,251
Of course!

236
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:09,876
But I have some bad news.

237
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,792
My heart is already beating
for another dancer!

238
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:19,459
But I will dance with you.
Come on.

239
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:39,251
The most important thing
about the exams

240
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:41,459
are the photocopies.

241
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:46,084
An authentic US army cartridge holder

242
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:49,709
containing 72 miniaturized essays,
I repeat, 72!

243
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,876
Passing the written's your only hope.

244
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:57,084
Then even if you flunk the oral,
Martinelli can't do fuck all.

245
00:20:57,626 --> 00:21:01,001
- You're not normal.
- But the stroke of genius is...

246
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,792
This:

247
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,834
An engraved sticker containing

248
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:08,542
all the mathematical theorems
in the world.

249
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,459
You can't even read it!

250
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,792
Because I walked on it.

251
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:17,792
- Are you going to fly to the exam?
- You're so anal.

252
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:22,876
So what about this Claudia?

253
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,334
Claudia is...

254
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:33,751
Like a sunset on a sailboat.

255
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:37,709
Like Tardelli's goal against Germany.

256
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:42,209
Like a general strike

257
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:45,709
when you didn't do
your homework the night before.

258
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:47,876
Ouch...

259
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:50,417
We have to do something

260
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:53,251
or the lovebird
will ruin our whole summer.

261
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,084
Let's find this Claudia.

262
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:58,709
- Should I throw Simon out?
- Yes, do it.

263
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:02,167
Loredana, can't you see
we're having a meeting?

264
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:04,959
Sorry.

265
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,001
What do we know about her?

266
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:09,435
- She went to a Classics lyceum.
- She's got a boyfriend.

267
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:11,376
- That doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

268
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:15,209
He's a moron, she deserves better.

269
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,209
- And you're better?
- Yeah.

270
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:23,334
If you didn't lay her yesterday,
you've got no chance now.

271
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,792
Exactly. Is it even worth it?

272
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:30,751
This Claudia...
does she have nice buns?

273
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:34,459
Simona, how can you go out with him?
He's as sensitive as a toilet seat.

274
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,959
You get used to life's misfortunes.

275
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:41,792
But guys, the point is...
How do I find her?

276
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:45,459
Ask the girl who had the party.

277
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,834
What do I do?

278
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:52,042
"Hi, I crashed your party
the other night and..."”

279
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:54,251
- That's one way.
- Come on'!

280
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:59,042
I took down Spandau Ballet.
With that hair...

281
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:03,501
- What are you putting up now?
- Madonna and Nelson Mandela.

282
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:07,751
Nice couple!
But I'd even be racier.

283
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:10,209
Gorbachev and Cicciolina.

284
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:16,459
The time has come,
the legendary Santilli is here.

285
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:26,542
The reason I've been summoned?

286
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:29,959
First I'd like to apologize
for all the practical jokes.

287
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,209
I've always admired you.

288
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:35,251
As both student and... your look.

289
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:40,959
We called you to help us
study for exams.

290
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:46,584
You can sail right through
towards an A+.

291
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:49,917
- You want me to test you?
- Yes.

292
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:54,542
- And be ruthless, like a real exam.
- Okay, ruthless.

293
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:57,167
But not too much,
we'll get demoralized.

294
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:59,917
- In what subject?
- Italian.

295
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:02,917
Something that goes
for written and oral.

296
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,917
Let's start with
an elementary inquiry.

297
00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:11,126
Considering what we've studied,

298
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:13,626
in your opinion,

299
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,917
how much has Jansenism
influenced Manzonian Poetics?

300
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:28,292
- Back-up question?
- Wait, let me think.

301
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,584
- You think you know?
- I do.

302
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:33,626
Give him time!

303
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:36,834
- What was it? Jansen...
- Johnson who?

304
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:40,334
Get the dictionary!

305
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:45,459
Trick question!

306
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:48,292
Tell the truth:
There's no such thing as Jansenism.

307
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:50,917
There it goes... yes!

308
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:54,334
And Lothar Matth&us strikes again!

309
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:57,834
Again? It's one-nil.

310
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:01,876
Excuse me!
I have exams in ten days.

311
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,917
Good luck, babe.

312
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:08,042
What record?
Your team won by pure luck.

313
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:12,876
Luck? 26 wins, 6 ties, 2 losses,
that's luck?

314
00:25:13,584 --> 00:25:17,042
It's the start of a string
of wins for Inter.

315
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:20,834
Why don't you two go out?
You get on just great!

316
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:24,251
- Your sister's moody.
- Time of the month.

317
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:27,251
That's a penalty!

318
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,667
Some pie?

319
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,709
Thanks Grandma, not right now.

320
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:45,042
- What about you, Chicca?
- Sure, thanks.

321
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:50,792
When will you know
who got through to the exams?

322
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:54,626
- Tomorrow.
- Then I'll make a cake to celebrate.

323
00:25:55,459 --> 00:25:59,042
Let's hope
there's something to celebrate.

324
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:04,251
Up yours! Under the crossbar!
You black and blue bastard!

325
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:07,584
Looks like your boyfriend tied.

326
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:17,251
ADMITTED TO EXAM

327
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,834
ADMITTED TO EXAM

328
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,334
Yes!

329
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:35,959
All right!

330
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:58,042
NOT ADMITTED

331
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,251
Chicca...

332
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:21,501
- Hello?
- Claudia? It's Chicca's mom.

333
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:24,334
Hi, Mrs Salvatori.

334
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,251
Is she over there?
She hasn't come home.

335
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:29,667
No, she's not here.

336
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:33,334
Did they announce
exam admissions?

337
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:35,917
Yes.

338
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,292
They didn't let her through, right?

339
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,959
No, they didn't, I'm sorry.

340
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:46,751
All right.

341
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,834
- Thanks.
- Bye.

342
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:54,167
I still can't believe it,
he admitted me to the exams!

343
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:57,542
Your average grade is C.

344
00:27:57,751 --> 00:28:00,542
He'll get you on the oral,

345
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:03,542
that's when Martinelli
will get his revenge.

346
00:28:04,376 --> 00:28:06,584
Alice, stop freaking me out!

347
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:09,501
You're so...

348
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:12,459
Oh God, it's The Prick!
It's Martinelli!

349
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:19,001
- Let's go.
- Peppe! What happened?

350
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:22,042
Someone stole your teacher's
Simca 1000.

351
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:23,667
Great taste!

352
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,209
Let's go!

353
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:29,751
If he sees me, he'll think I did it.

354
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:35,042
- He saw us!
- Follow me.

355
00:28:38,209 --> 00:28:40,834
Hi, what happened?

356
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:43,959
You tell me.
In this screwed up country?

357
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:47,501
I was renting a movie
and my car got stolen.

358
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:50,084
And they're like
those 3 monkeys round here:

359
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:51,792
Hear no, see no, speak no evil.

360
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:56,209
Luca can take you to the police,
he's got his scooter.

361
00:28:57,334 --> 00:29:00,959
- No, I'll take the bus.
- The bus is a nightmare.

362
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,584
And Luca would be glad, right?

363
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,959
Sure, I'll take you.

364
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:11,584
- On your scooter?
- Yes.

365
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,751
So where is this road monster?

366
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:33,709
Luca Molinari,

367
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,126
claims
under his own responsibility

368
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:39,042
that he personally knows
Antonio Martinelli,

369
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:41,751
born in Asti, 16 July 1945.

370
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:43,167
Yes.

371
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,709
All right, sign and date. Legible.

372
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:53,959
Wait a couple of minutes
and I'll give you copies.

373
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,209
This is all I needed.

374
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:12,251
I don't care about the papers,
I've got copies.

375
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:15,667
It sounds weird,
but I'm upset about the car.

376
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:20,251
A Simca 1000 is a great car.

377
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:24,084
Fuck... Darn it.

378
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,584
How long does it take
to make a copy?

379
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:40,959
- It's 8:00!
- Your wife must be worried.

380
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:43,959
My wife...

381
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,834
She's been gone for a year.

382
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:53,292
I'm so sorry.

383
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:56,709
You never told anyone,
I would have come.

384
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:59,542
Come where? She's alive!

385
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:03,167
She left me for some yuppie,
a lawyer.

386
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:04,626
That's good.

387
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:09,417
I mean...

388
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,417
That's good she's still alive.

389
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:16,042
Not that she left you...
for a yuppie.

390
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:22,709
After graduation,
you should go into public relations.

391
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:39,042
- All right, thanks.
- No problem.

392
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:43,334
Sorry you had to pedal up that hill.

393
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:46,834
But don't think
this changes things between us.

394
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:48,459
No.

395
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:56,251
Since the 19th century is
nothing but a black hole to you,

396
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:59,501
come over Monday to revise.

397
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,376
Was this a trap, a set-up?

398
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:06,001
He pretends it's help,
then he humiliates me.

399
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:10,917
That's it, the slimeball!
How can I say no?

400
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:12,751
Well?

401
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:17,792
- All right, what time?
- 4:00.

402
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:20,751
Don't be late.

403
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:27,792
It's fate.
My only chance is to risk my hand

404
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:29,834
in the enemy's den.

405
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:38,001
- Hi everyone.
- Dad, where were you?

406
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:41,417
The police station,
my car got stolen.

407
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,042
Finally some good news!

408
00:32:44,251 --> 00:32:45,834
Hooray!

409
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:48,209
Some idiot actually stole that car?

410
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:53,542
I apologize if I work
to give my family

411
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:56,167
a home, clothes and an education

412
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:59,001
but forgot to buy a Ferrari!

413
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:03,251
- Where did it happen?
- Near the video store.

414
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:05,876
Did you get "Rambo III"?

415
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:12,209
I told you my car got stolen and
you ask about Rambo?

416
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:15,126
Want a reason to call
the child abuse hotline?

417
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,251
Talk about Rambo at your exam!

418
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:22,001
- I studied all day!
- You got up at 1:00.

419
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:25,042
- I studied from 1:00 on.
- Whatever.

420
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:32,626
Dad, Chicca and Valentina and I
want to go to Ibiza.

421
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,667
Did I hear the word Ibiza?

422
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:40,292
It's not planned. I wanted to know
how much money you can...

423
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:44,709
First of all,
I want all your teachers' scalps.

424
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:47,459
Then we'll discuss Ibiza, okay?

425
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:53,209
My potato gateau is delicious,
give me your plate.

426
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:55,917
No, my stomach's in a knot.

427
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:58,917
Ibiza... what's in Ibiza?

428
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,292
The closer I got
to my meeting with The Prick,

429
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:09,126
the more the nervousness
prevented me from studying.

430
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:11,167
I gave it my all,

431
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:14,459
but with the wrong friends,
it's hopeless.

432
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:17,834
History question.

433
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:19,917
Just remember...

434
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:23,626
If it's about World War I,
I don't know shit.

435
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,334
Listen:

436
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:28,542
Who was ltaly's third goalie
in the 82 championships?

437
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:31,376
- Castellini.
- No...

438
00:34:31,584 --> 00:34:33,417
Bordon.

439
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,792
The legendary Giovanni Galli.

440
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,501
He wasn't even on the bench,

441
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:42,542
how can you consider him
a world champ?

442
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,376
Existential questions like this

443
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,792
marked the end
of our study sessions.

444
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:52,959
I still don't know what you want.

445
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:56,084
You see, Princess...

446
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:59,501
- I... we wanted...
- Some information.

447
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:02,542
We snuck into your party.

448
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,376
You have a really nice house,
very "in".

449
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:08,959
- Luca fell madly in love with a girl.
- That's nice.

450
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:11,459
Madly is exaggerating.

451
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:15,292
- Her name's Claudia.
- She has dark, wavy hair.

452
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,876
She's about her height.

453
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:22,084
Claudia... Claudia...
Don't know anyone with that name.

454
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:25,584
She must have snuck in too.

455
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,417
Could be, I'd never seen
most of the people here.

456
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:32,459
They stole a lot of stuff,
including a ♪-shirt like yours.

457
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,001
Really?

458
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:41,417
I bought this one in a store...

459
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:44,459
Who cares? Thanks anyway.

460
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:47,459
- Let's go.
- Wait!

461
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:51,459
There was some old geezer
filming at the party.

462
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:54,876
- Yes, my father.
- I see...

463
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:58,501
He's hopeless.
Could we have a copy?

464
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:02,417
Sure, give me back my ♪-shirt.

465
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:14,709
That's her!

466
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:20,042
Pretty, isn't she?

467
00:36:20,751 --> 00:36:22,042
If you say so

468
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:51,251
I watched those 10 seconds
of Claudia all night long.

469
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,501
Alice says I'm a psychopath,

470
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:57,042
I think she's right.

471
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:04,209
12 June:
9 days, 8 hours, 14 minutes left.

472
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:09,792
I've read that, unlike men,
women can do two things at once.

473
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,251
And it's true.

474
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:17,626
That romantic night,

475
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:19,667
I was studying astronomy.

476
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:22,459
That's the Big Dipper.

477
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,959
SAD GIRL

478
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:59,042
You know what my dad said?

479
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:03,292
"So what?
You'll do better next year."

480
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:09,792
What must I do
to get a slap out of him?

481
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:11,917
What the hell must I do?

482
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:15,959
- I can lend you my dad.
- No, thanks.

483
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:20,209
I'll give you a good deal,
I'll throw in my nerdy brother.

484
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:23,626
- Then I want Grandma too.
- No, she's mine.

485
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:39,417
- Hi, Massi.
- Hi, Loredana.

486
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:41,334
- Come in.
- Where's Simona?

487
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:44,542
She'll be back in an hour.

488
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,417
In an hour...

489
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:51,417
- What are you up to?
- Killing time.

490
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:54,917
With a flight-attendant mother,
you're always alone.

491
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:58,126
Then get a boyfriend.

492
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:01,709
All the guys I like
are already taken.

493
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:08,084
- Really?
- Yes.

494
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:12,417
Once you pass 50 centimetres,

495
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:15,626
a kiss is automatic,
it's a scientific rule.

496
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:20,001
49... 48

497
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,584
47... 46...

498
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,834
Well? Then what?

499
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:30,876
Then

500
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:34,459
I took a deep breath...
and fought it.

501
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,084
Good job, Massi.

502
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,959
Up to 42, then I gave in.

503
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:43,334
Once, twice... okay.
But then I banged her.

504
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:47,917
You screwed her? You idiot!
Your girlfriend's sister!

505
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:52,042
- She's hot though.
- And fucks like hell!

506
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:54,334
She's a little girl!

507
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:57,042
She'll go tell everyone.

508
00:39:57,417 --> 00:40:01,792
Even write it in her diary and when
Simona finds out, you're dead.

509
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:05,292
We talked about it,
it won't happen again.

510
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:10,584
We're 18 now.

511
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:15,626
At our age,
it's our sacred duty to screw.

512
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:18,834
All right,
but wash the dishes first. Bye.

513
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,542
- Bye...
- Bye, Mom.

514
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:30,584
This story was a big deal,
but my mind was elsewhere:

515
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:33,167
My meeting with The Prick.

516
00:40:42,126 --> 00:40:45,334
Claudia, can you get that?
It's a student.

517
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:47,001
Okay.

518
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:54,792
Chicca!

519
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:57,626
- How much money can you lend me?
- Why?

520
00:40:58,209 --> 00:41:02,209
- I'm going to Berlin.
- Berlin? Are you crazy?

521
00:41:04,084 --> 00:41:06,501
What's this all about?

522
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:15,167
- Hello?
- Come in, Molinari.

523
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:39,001
That's my daughter, she's your age.

524
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:42,501
She's cute.

525
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,084
Have seat.

526
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:50,834
Thanks.

527
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:55,126
You're probably wondering
why I invited you.

528
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:56,751
No.

529
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,251
Okay, a little.

530
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:05,584
The things you told me at school
the other day

531
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:09,501
are the same things my wife said
when she left.

532
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:13,542
- With the yuppie?
- Yes.

533
00:42:13,751 --> 00:42:18,251
I ruined the last years of her life,
I'm a loser.

534
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:22,042
And she loathes the jackets
I love so much.

535
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:26,709
I didn't really think those things.

536
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:28,917
Yes, you did.

537
00:42:30,126 --> 00:42:32,042
So did she.

538
00:42:35,084 --> 00:42:37,917
Let's talk about Romanticism.

539
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:40,501
Okay...

540
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:45,042
Romanticism
is a cultural orientation

541
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:48,626
that comes from
the English word: "Romantic"

542
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:52,334
which was used in the 17th century

543
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:56,751
to refer to... in a bad way

544
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:01,376
- I'd even say derogatory.
- Yes.

545
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:05,084
the chivalric adventures
in the old "romances".

546
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,792
Nice.

547
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:10,834
It's fucking luck.

548
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:13,042
I mean... luck.

549
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:15,667
I studied it yesterday.

550
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:19,126
See, it's people like you
who piss me off.

551
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:24,167
You could get an A
using half your brain.

552
00:43:24,376 --> 00:43:28,042
But you don't study, you blow it off,
hang out with your pals...

553
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,667
And get an C at the exam.

554
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:32,876
A C+ if you're lucky

555
00:43:33,084 --> 00:43:35,167
fucking lucky.

556
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:40,584
But...

557
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:45,251
If I wasn't this fucking lucky...

558
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:47,292
Shit!

559
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,167
- Bye, we're going out.
- Bye, girls.

560
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:55,042
Bye.

561
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:58,959
I'm sorry.

562
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:02,917
A little glue
and it's brand new again

563
00:44:03,126 --> 00:44:04,751
almost new.

564
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:10,251
Are you sure Stefan can put you up?

565
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:14,084
We always write.
He's still head over heels.

566
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:21,251
He said Berlin
is full of opportunities for us.

567
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:25,292
He also says
they'll knock the wall down.

568
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:29,334
- Just to get you in bed!
- Even so!

569
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:36,917
I got something for you.

570
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:39,417
It's our favourite compilation tape.

571
00:44:42,542 --> 00:44:44,751
I can't believe it.

572
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:47,376
Dire Straits, The Cure, Vasco Rossi.

573
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:50,792
But most of all,
"Save A Prayer" live.

574
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:54,876
The stadium, June 1, 1987.

575
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:58,626
How could I forget?

576
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:04,167
The lights go down,
Simon starts singing...

577
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:07,792
We're holding lighters like idiots!

578
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,084
Thanks.

579
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:34,084
Good luck with your exams.

580
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:36,917
Bring me back a piece of the wall.

581
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:42,334
You will be back, won't you?

582
00:46:09,709 --> 00:46:11,334
I'm coming!

583
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:15,501
- What's wrong?
- We're supposed to study.

584
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:19,001
- When?
- Now, let me in.

585
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,834
Why?

586
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:25,417
Simona's here
and we're not studying.

587
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:29,959
- Sorry.
- Let me know how it goes.

588
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,834
He's insane...

589
00:46:48,876 --> 00:46:50,501
Open up!

590
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:53,709
Come on!

591
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:56,001
- What's your problem?
- Move it!

592
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:58,209
- You're such an asshole!
- What did I do?

593
00:46:58,417 --> 00:47:01,251
- Loredana... Simona's here!
- What?

594
00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:04,167
Simona's on her way up!

595
00:47:04,376 --> 00:47:06,376
- Shit.
- Don't let her in!

596
00:47:06,584 --> 00:47:10,209
- She's got a key!
- Are you crazy?

597
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:13,417
- Well, I always lose them.
- Good thinking!

598
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,709
- In the bathroom.
- No.

599
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:23,126
In your room, in the kitchen...
On the balcony!

600
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:26,459
- I'm naked!
- Big deal.

601
00:47:30,626 --> 00:47:32,626
Shit, a hickey!

602
00:47:34,834 --> 00:47:38,834
- You're here?
- I was in the bathroom.

603
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:42,834
- What happened?
- Stiff neck.

604
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:46,459
I caught a draft on the scooter.

605
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:50,042
- Look, we have to talk.
- Here?

606
00:47:50,376 --> 00:47:52,792
Let's go for a walk.

607
00:47:54,626 --> 00:47:58,834
So what's this about?
What's the mystery?

608
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:04,376
- I'm late.
- Well, I'm never on time myself.

609
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:07,167
Late?

610
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:11,209
- How late?
- One week.

611
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:14,917
Is that a lot?

612
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:17,959
Kind of, I'm always regular.

613
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:21,209
You're regular...

614
00:48:21,417 --> 00:48:25,042
Look...
In the remote possibility you're...

615
00:48:26,084 --> 00:48:29,292
What are your options?
Would you keep it or...

616
00:48:30,626 --> 00:48:32,459
You?

617
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:36,876
I don't know.
I'm 18, I've never considered it.

618
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:38,917
And I have?

619
00:48:48,209 --> 00:48:51,626
- Tell me you love me.
- Hell yeah.

620
00:48:52,084 --> 00:48:53,917
Like crazy.

621
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,251
What do I tell him now?

622
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:03,876
"Sorry my friend's an idiot.
Please flunk him too.

623
00:49:04,084 --> 00:49:06,709
No, pass him
so I won't see him anymore."

624
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:09,126
Massi, finally!

625
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:12,709
- We have to talk.
- I'm late.

626
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:15,542
- You too?
- I'll call you later.

627
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,792
Claudia!

628
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:47,459
Hey!

629
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:51,876
What are you doing here?

630
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:04,792
Molinari... Molinari!

631
00:50:05,626 --> 00:50:08,459
Planet Earth to Molinari!

632
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:11,459
Answer me!

633
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:14,584
Sorry,

634
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:16,792
I was daydreaming.

635
00:50:17,001 --> 00:50:19,417
I'm having trouble
concentrating lately.

636
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:22,626
You have for five years now.

637
00:50:24,209 --> 00:50:27,709
- I guess I should go.
- Stay there.

638
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:30,917
Family problems?

639
00:50:31,876 --> 00:50:35,959
No, I never see them.
They're always at the store.

640
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,667
A girl?

641
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:45,417
- You could say that.
- Want to talk about it?

642
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:49,042
There's nothing to say.
I don't even know where she lives.

643
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:53,084
She's the love of my life.

644
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:54,501
Wow!

645
00:50:56,584 --> 00:51:00,667
You're right,
I have to think about the exams now.

646
00:51:00,876 --> 00:51:03,959
- End of story.
- I didn't say that.

647
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,459
When there's something
you're interested in,

648
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:10,459
go after it and get it.

649
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,876
I drove all night long

650
00:51:13,084 --> 00:51:15,709
to tell my wife I loved her.

651
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:20,459
Two days later I took my last college
exam and got 30 out of 30.

652
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:26,834
Someday I'll score 30 too,
but it won't be a good enough grade.

653
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,876
30? You're an optimist?

654
00:51:31,876 --> 00:51:33,292
Exactly.

655
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:39,167
I'm starting to freak out.

656
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:43,751
How long is this going to take?

657
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:47,667
- Relax.
- I'd like to see you.

658
00:51:49,709 --> 00:51:53,792
- Well? Is it turning red?
- No, two more minutes.

659
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:57,417
- Relax.
- I'd like to see you.

660
00:52:03,334 --> 00:52:04,959
- Well?
- Nothing.

661
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:06,542
Nothing nothing?

662
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:10,376
It's a matter of hormones.
She could still be pregnant.

663
00:52:10,584 --> 00:52:13,084
If she doesn't have her period,
she has to get tested.

664
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:15,917
15,000 liras down the drain...

665
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:19,459
Sorry, I'm stressed out.

666
00:52:23,376 --> 00:52:27,584
You all call Mr Santoro "foam mouth"

667
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:29,792
and I can see why.

668
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:34,417
You call Miss Paternesi "Alien"
and she looks just like one.

669
00:52:34,626 --> 00:52:38,251
You haven't given me
some nickname now, have you?

670
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:43,334
No.

671
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:50,501
I have to go now.

672
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,917
Tell me, it won't hurt my feelings.

673
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:58,751
- It won't?
- Of course not.

674
00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:02,251
Well... I've heard...

675
00:53:03,084 --> 00:53:05,376
Some people say... But not me!

676
00:53:05,584 --> 00:53:07,209
Come on!

677
00:53:08,126 --> 00:53:11,209
They say: "The Prick".

678
00:53:13,376 --> 00:53:15,792
Thanks for everything, bye.

679
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:21,001
"The Prick"... that's gratifying...

680
00:53:21,959 --> 00:53:24,667
- What are you doing?
- Why aren't you studying?

681
00:53:24,876 --> 00:53:28,084
That thing you do
with books before exams...

682
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,709
Mom's right, you are boring.

683
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:37,209
Well, at least that's a step up
from being a prick.

684
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:40,584
I'm going to flunk.

685
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:43,292
I win, I'm going to be a father.

686
00:53:43,501 --> 00:53:45,917
You might be. I'll flunk for sure.

687
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:48,542
Guys, it's ready.

688
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:51,792
Massimo, I made pesto sauce,
your favourite.

689
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:53,834
Thanks, ma'am.

690
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:56,667
Right... as if you deserved it.

691
00:53:57,584 --> 00:54:00,292
Fate was being
totally ruthless with us.

692
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:04,334
There was only one thing
that could cheer us up that night.

693
00:54:24,251 --> 00:54:27,251
Man oh man, you guys are lame.

694
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:31,417
All right, I know.
Let's make this night worth it.

695
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:35,084
- Ever gone 200 km/hr?
- On a Vespa?

696
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:38,292
With Daddy's Porsche.

697
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:20,042
And now, the climax.

698
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:22,126
Let's go check out the whores!

699
00:55:22,334 --> 00:55:24,334
All right!

700
00:55:25,792 --> 00:55:29,209
- Can I drive?
- Are you crazy?

701
00:55:29,417 --> 00:55:32,042
Just once, what's the big deal?

702
00:55:32,959 --> 00:55:34,376
Come on.

703
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:37,667
Make one scratch
and my dad will break our legs.

704
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,876
Relax, at driving school
they called me Niki Lauda.

705
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:42,584
Whatever

706
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:45,876
I always ask
and you never let me!

707
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:49,501
Well, he's going to flunk school,
this is his last wish.

708
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:53,959
Thanks a lot.

709
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:09,376
Hey Niki Lauda... Go fuck yourself!

710
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:35,376
You did 1.5 million liras of damage!

711
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:40,251
Simona's going to wait a week
to go to the gynaecologist.

712
00:56:40,459 --> 00:56:44,084
My dad comes back Wednesday,
where will I find the money?

713
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:48,084
If she's pregnant,
my life has bit the dust.

714
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:49,584
Game over!

715
00:56:49,792 --> 00:56:52,501
We can't do a robbery
because we're not credible.

716
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:56,126
No one would ever loan us any money.

717
00:56:56,334 --> 00:56:59,376
We need a brilliant plan,
but I've never had one.

718
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:02,792
I'll never be able to play soccer
at 3 am again,

719
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:06,501
or Interrail around,
or get drunk at Oktoberfest

720
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:10,126
or play a two-day non-stop
game of "Dungeons and Dragons".

721
00:57:10,334 --> 00:57:13,709
Or screw your future-wife's sister.

722
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:17,542
- It was an accident.
- Twice?

723
00:57:17,751 --> 00:57:19,292
You're so anal.

724
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:21,251
Guys!

725
00:57:21,459 --> 00:57:24,292
Jokes are only funny for a while!

726
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:26,834
Give me back my trunks, please.

727
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:30,667
You don't want to upset me!

728
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:33,376
I'm going to count to three!

729
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:36,001
One, two

730
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:40,626
two and a half... three!

731
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,251
Chicca called me
from Berlin last night.

732
00:57:44,459 --> 00:57:47,459
She said they really might
knock down the wall.

733
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:50,876
Who cares?
It won't change anything for us.

734
00:57:51,084 --> 00:57:54,917
Plus that was stupid of her
to leave like that.

735
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:59,376
She acts all intellectual,
but she's really shallow.

736
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:04,209
Did you see that cute two-piece?
That coloured one? I want it.

737
00:58:06,251 --> 00:58:08,251
Sometimes I wish I could be like you.

738
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,167
Thanks!

739
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:26,459
Alice sure put on two melons,
she's developed since last summer.

740
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:30,084
Forget Alice,
check out that other one.

741
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:33,667
Check out those mushrooms...
Let's go foraging!

742
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:37,917
- Ready to study?
- After this.

743
00:58:38,126 --> 00:58:40,959
- Can you play goalie?
- Move over, Zoff!

744
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:44,001
I even brought
some used "Cliff Notes".

745
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:47,042
Cliff Notes won't get you very far.

746
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,876
Hey... concentrate!

747
00:58:51,084 --> 00:58:55,084
Anyway, when you don't know
the answer, "Cliff Notes" rule.

748
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:59,376
I'd even sell my mother
for the essay.

749
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,251
Are you blind or what?

750
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:06,292
- What did you just say?
- I'd do anything.

751
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,292
That's the brilliant idea
we needed for the car.

752
00:59:09,501 --> 00:59:12,334
What one thing
would we do anything for?

753
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:15,376
- Kim Basinger.
- Screw that. Our essay topics.

754
00:59:15,584 --> 00:59:19,584
- We don't know the topics.
- It doesn't have to be the real ones.

755
00:59:20,542 --> 00:59:23,459
- That's fraud!
- That's an exaggeration.

756
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:26,167
No, she's right this time.

757
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:29,251
You wrecked my dad's car,
so keep quiet.

758
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:34,084
"Move over, Zoff," huh?

759
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:36,709
Never mind, we'd better go anyway.

760
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:42,917
You're not leaving, are you?

761
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:45,126
I'm talking to you!

762
00:59:45,334 --> 00:59:48,542
- What about his suit?
- Bye!

763
00:59:52,334 --> 00:59:54,334
Come on now...

764
00:59:54,959 --> 00:59:57,251
Hit it high!

765
00:59:57,459 --> 00:59:58,542
Cesare!

766
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:02,959
- What a dive!
- Cesare.

767
01:00:04,084 --> 01:00:05,917
What is it, babe?

768
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:09,042
We're hungry, let's go.

769
01:00:09,251 --> 01:00:12,251
Wait,
two more points to break the tie.

770
01:00:12,459 --> 01:00:15,376
Pippo's dinner is tonight.

771
01:00:15,584 --> 01:00:19,417
- It's my mom's boyfriend's party.
- The one with the Ferrari?

772
01:00:19,876 --> 01:00:21,292
Unfortunately.

773
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:24,834
Thank you!

774
01:01:29,126 --> 01:01:33,334
Come and sing with us,
I've got all the Alan Sorrenti songs.

775
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:35,501
No, thanks.

776
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:39,334
Honey... Ottavio and I
have thought a lot about your future.

777
01:01:39,542 --> 01:01:41,959
And we've got a surprise for you...

778
01:01:42,501 --> 01:01:45,917
- You tell her!
- You do the honours.

779
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:48,251
Okay.

780
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:51,792
Guess who Ottavio called for you?

781
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,709
- The Pope?
- The Dean of LUISS University.

782
01:01:55,917 --> 01:01:57,417
He's a family friend.

783
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:03,542
So it's just a matter of paperwork
to get you into law school!

784
01:02:03,751 --> 01:02:07,001
Then in two years
you can come work for me.

785
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:09,501
You'll get your own office.

786
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:12,709
- I've got something to tell you.
- Go ahead!

787
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:16,792
I've thought about my future too.

788
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:21,417
I'm not studying Lit like dad wants,
or Law like this guy wants.

789
01:02:22,542 --> 01:02:25,376
- I'll do what I want.
- And what's that?

790
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:29,792
I don't know but don't worry,
you'll be the first to know.

791
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:33,917
So you can tell these assholes
who say they're your friends.

792
01:02:34,126 --> 01:02:36,334
Goodbye, have a nice party!

793
01:02:40,751 --> 01:02:43,042
How can Mom go out with him?

794
01:02:43,251 --> 01:02:46,167
- Maybe he's great in bed.
- Grandma!

795
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:48,376
What's wrong with that?

796
01:02:48,584 --> 01:02:52,001
Nothing, but...
Just picturing it makes me ill.

797
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:55,542
What about you and Cesare?

798
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:58,584
- What?
- In bed... I mean.

799
01:03:02,209 --> 01:03:05,209
- So so.
- Soso?

800
01:03:05,834 --> 01:03:08,542
"So so" at 18?
Are we kidding here?

801
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:13,584
Me and your Grandpa at 18
were already doing... Never mind.

802
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,792
Good thing I've got you.

803
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:21,001
- I feel so alone.
- But you're not!

804
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:25,042
- You've got me, your Dad...
- Dad, right...

805
01:03:25,251 --> 01:03:29,084
We can't talk about my sex life.

806
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:31,126
Maybe not.

807
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:33,751
But you could tell him

808
01:03:33,959 --> 01:03:36,751
you want
to go to Berlin to see Chicca.

809
01:03:38,126 --> 01:03:41,542
- How did you know?
- Grandma Superpowers.

810
01:03:43,709 --> 01:03:46,334
Hints of redemption for this country,

811
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:49,542
the police found the car.

812
01:03:49,751 --> 01:03:53,542
Missing a hood, wheel and a seat
but the rest is perfect.

813
01:03:53,751 --> 01:03:55,167
All right... Yahoo!

814
01:04:02,376 --> 01:04:04,376
- Dad?
- What?

815
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:09,667
- Chicca left for Berlin.
- Political asylum from flunking?

816
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:13,292
<i>No, she's traveling
and she's paying for it herself.</i>

817
01:04:14,084 --> 01:04:15,709
I'd like to see that.

818
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:19,709
Since I've been
kind of depressed lately...

819
01:04:19,917 --> 01:04:23,334
Royal jelly.
It's an amazing remedy.

820
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:26,376
I'll get some for you tomorrow.

821
01:04:29,792 --> 01:04:31,709
I told you it was pointless.

822
01:04:33,417 --> 01:04:35,251
What's pointless?

823
01:04:36,709 --> 01:04:39,417
Anyway, how did it go
with her and her mom?

824
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,834
You're asking me?

825
01:04:42,042 --> 01:04:46,126
Well, I could ask the scale.
Maybe I'll get a decent answer.

826
01:04:46,334 --> 01:04:50,251
In spite of the Great Wall of China
you're both erecting around me,

827
01:04:50,459 --> 01:04:55,084
until further notice
I'm still head of this family!

828
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:01,542
Antonio

829
01:05:02,209 --> 01:05:05,709
when will you stop being a teacher
and start being a dad?

830
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:12,501
Here... And don't make any lumps.

831
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:26,709
Dad, your student's here.

832
01:05:28,209 --> 01:05:30,834
- Let him in.
- In here.

833
01:05:34,084 --> 01:05:37,292
- Hello, Mr Martinelli.
- Hi, Molinari.

834
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:38,876
You can play?

835
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:42,167
I used to.

836
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:44,417
I used to play in a band,

837
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:47,334
or group, as they used to say.

838
01:05:47,542 --> 01:05:50,542
We named ourselves:
"The Dark Side of the Moon".

839
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:54,292
Like the Pink Floyd album,
I love that one.

840
01:05:54,501 --> 01:05:57,792
You've heard at least one
decent album in your life.

841
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:00,084
Molinari,

842
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:03,001
all this time
I knew nothing about you.

843
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:07,709
Then you surprise me.
You did exactly what I wanted to.

844
01:06:07,917 --> 01:06:11,751
Tell my teachers
what I thought of them.

845
01:06:11,959 --> 01:06:15,376
- What was that?
- That they were dicks.

846
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:19,459
Then why did you become a teacher?

847
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:23,667
I was a fool.
I thought I could change the system.

848
01:06:23,876 --> 01:06:25,876
Or at least try.

849
01:06:26,084 --> 01:06:28,792
But judging by my nickname,

850
01:06:29,001 --> 01:06:31,417
it doesn't look I succeeded.

851
01:06:32,376 --> 01:06:34,667
No, it's not that.

852
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:39,209
It's just that at school,
you act like you're 100.

853
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:43,042
But out here, like you're 20.

854
01:06:43,626 --> 01:06:45,042
I wish!

855
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:49,959
At your age, my friends
and I would come here

856
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:52,792
and drink, then at closing time,

857
01:06:53,001 --> 01:06:56,626
we'd get stoned out of our minds.

858
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:01,209
Don't try to kid me
that you've never got high.

859
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,626
It was different for us,
it was the Sixties.

860
01:07:04,834 --> 01:07:07,667
If you didn't get high,
you were a loser.

861
01:07:07,876 --> 01:07:11,501
Hash, marijuana, Pakistani

862
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:13,542
I smoked it all!

863
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:16,042
Now it's been

864
01:07:16,251 --> 01:07:18,876
fifteen years since I smoked a joint.

865
01:07:20,376 --> 01:07:22,209
Sure

866
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:26,209
with school, your family, your wife.

867
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,251
Yeah, that saint

868
01:07:28,876 --> 01:07:33,084
I was thinking...
If I should want to try it...

869
01:07:33,584 --> 01:07:36,001
Could you get some?

870
01:07:37,584 --> 01:07:41,251
I swear I only smoked once
on a field trip

871
01:07:41,459 --> 01:07:45,084
and I passed out.
But what could I say?

872
01:07:45,292 --> 01:07:47,584
Sure! Of course.

873
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:50,792
I'll take care of it, no problem.

874
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:52,084
I was set!

875
01:07:52,292 --> 01:07:56,126
The Prick would never flunk
his own pusher.

876
01:07:57,751 --> 01:08:01,959
So I came home and heard:
"bang, squeak, bang, squeak..."

877
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:05,376
In layman's terms...
I found them together.

878
01:08:06,334 --> 01:08:10,834
Guess what I said:; "No, pal.

879
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:13,876
You take her, wrap her up
and take her away."

880
01:08:14,084 --> 01:08:17,001
He accepted and
that ended my 4th marriage.

881
01:08:17,209 --> 01:08:20,417
Four weddings? That's insane!

882
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:24,626
What percent of that was a lie?

883
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:27,917
10%, to make it more interesting.

884
01:08:28,126 --> 01:08:31,334
It's all true!
Actually, if you want some advice...

885
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:33,709
Never get married.

886
01:08:34,584 --> 01:08:36,792
Are you going steady with anyone?

887
01:08:37,001 --> 01:08:40,376
You're so old-fashioned.
They don't say that now!

888
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:44,209
Anyway, I do have boyfriend.

889
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:49,376
Wait a minute... An eyelash.

890
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,792
Make a wish.

891
01:08:54,126 --> 01:08:56,834
Too bad!
You don't get the wish, I do.

892
01:09:02,126 --> 01:09:04,626
All right, essay topic brainstorming.

893
01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:07,917
Likely ones include
perestroika, hole in the ozone...

894
01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:11,209
- Who's hole?
- Be serious for once.

895
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:13,626
- Who votes for perestroika?
- I do.

896
01:09:13,834 --> 01:09:16,251
"Hole in the ozone" wins 3 to 1.
You start.

897
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:21,417
Okay, literature: Pirandello
vs. Ungaretti-Montale-Quasimodo.

898
01:09:21,626 --> 01:09:23,834
- Pirandello?
- Yeah.

899
01:09:24,042 --> 01:09:26,209
What's left?

900
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:28,917
The history topic.
But there's no contest,

901
01:09:29,126 --> 01:09:32,126
the Holocaust
beats Garibaldi, four to nil.

902
01:09:32,542 --> 01:09:34,542
- Objections?
- No.

903
01:09:34,751 --> 01:09:37,959
This is so you won't study
on an empty stomach.

904
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:41,084
Mom, I told you later!

905
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:44,917
But it's 3:00 and you haven't eaten,
your sugar will be low.

906
01:09:45,126 --> 01:09:47,751
Whatever, just get lost
SO we can concentrate.

907
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:50,792
Thank you very much,
that was nice of you.

908
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:55,292
You creep.

909
01:09:57,042 --> 01:09:59,459
Break. My mind's exhausted.

910
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,084
Break.

911
01:10:02,334 --> 01:10:05,334
- What flavour are they?
- Clams and chocolate, it's great.

912
01:10:06,334 --> 01:10:07,751
I'm joking.

913
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:09,751
Riccardo?

914
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:15,167
- I need a favour.
- What do you need?

915
01:10:15,376 --> 01:10:18,876
- Some hash.
- Since when do you smoke?

916
01:10:19,084 --> 01:10:23,084
It's not for me, it's for...
You wouldn't believe me.

917
01:10:24,292 --> 01:10:26,209
For The Prick.

918
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:30,126
The Prick? You get high together?

919
01:10:30,334 --> 01:10:32,542
No... not yet.

920
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:36,459
- Can you get it or not?
- Sure, sure.

921
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:39,667
You're not best buddies with
that rat now, are you?

922
01:10:39,876 --> 01:10:43,501
Are you crazy?
It's to save my ass at the exam.

923
01:10:43,709 --> 01:10:45,917
As long as you're happy.

924
01:10:46,751 --> 01:10:49,376
Okay, Chemistry question.
Listen carefully.

925
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:53,334
If you put a teaspoon of shit
in tomato sauce,

926
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:55,542
can you taste it?

927
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:58,376
- Get lost.
- I bet you do.

928
01:11:02,334 --> 01:11:04,542
Hi, it's Alice.

929
01:11:04,751 --> 01:11:07,626
I'm inviting you to a party tonight,

930
01:11:07,834 --> 01:11:10,834
an unusual one.
The special guest is

931
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:13,459
essay topics!

932
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:16,667
The authentic topics
for the written exam.

933
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:19,251
I'm serious! Straight from

934
01:11:19,459 --> 01:11:22,876
the Ministry of Education.

935
01:11:23,084 --> 01:11:25,084
That's right.

936
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:26,792
I can't tell you how

937
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:29,792
but this is the key
to scholastic success.

938
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:32,709
Entrance fee:
100,000 liras all inclusive.

939
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:35,542
Champagne, food and
the list of topics.

940
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:37,167
You in?

941
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:41,001
Make sure you spread the word.

942
01:11:43,626 --> 01:11:45,251
Fucking hell!

943
01:11:47,042 --> 01:11:49,542
- Where are you going?
- To study!

944
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:59,501
What does the word "Woodstock"
mean to you?

945
01:12:03,834 --> 01:12:08,459
- Oh, yeah... that bird in "Snoopy".
- See? You don't study!

946
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:11,792
The protest, the student movement,

947
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:15,834
Hendrix burning his guitar
as a symbol of American capitalism.

948
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:20,501
- All that's in "Snoopy"?
- Forget Snoopy!

949
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:23,709
It was the largest
youth gathering in history.

950
01:12:25,876 --> 01:12:27,292
August,

951
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:30,209
1969.

952
01:12:30,917 --> 01:12:35,001
800,000 people,
including yours truly,

953
01:12:35,209 --> 01:12:37,209
get together in a field

954
01:12:37,417 --> 01:12:40,792
80 km from Woodstock.

955
01:12:41,001 --> 01:12:45,459
They get naked
and practice free love

956
01:12:45,667 --> 01:12:48,501
listening to the best music ever.

957
01:12:49,751 --> 01:12:52,667
You mean you were... naked.

958
01:12:54,084 --> 01:12:56,292
The most naked one.

959
01:12:56,501 --> 01:13:00,334
My mother thought
I was studying English

960
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:04,376
but I met two Norwegian girls
on the plane

961
01:13:04,584 --> 01:13:07,001
with four beautiful tits...
Two each, of course.

962
01:13:07,209 --> 01:13:08,834
Totally uninhibited

963
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,459
and for three days

964
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:14,459
I tore them inside and out!
Inside and out...

965
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:18,376
- Antonio!
- Dad! Are you smoking pot?

966
01:13:20,417 --> 01:13:22,917
We were just...

967
01:13:23,126 --> 01:13:27,334
- We were...
- Going over Modern History.

968
01:13:27,959 --> 01:13:31,167
- The 1900's.
- Yeah!

969
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:36,959
- There's more food, who wants some?
- Me!

970
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:39,584
Here, now pay up.

971
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:42,792
Who else?

972
01:13:43,876 --> 01:13:46,709
- Me!
- You again, Santilli?

973
01:13:48,209 --> 01:13:50,042
Are you happy?

974
01:13:51,376 --> 01:13:53,584
Could the essays be fake?

975
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:56,001
Just be glad we invited you.

976
01:13:56,209 --> 01:13:58,417
If you don't trust us,
there's the door.

977
01:13:58,626 --> 01:14:02,042
Look Filippo,
they're envelopes from the Ministry.

978
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:10,959
"The Greenhouse Effect
and the Hole in the Ozone,

979
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:14,376
two hazards generated
by human wickedness.

980
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:18,292
Please explain how..."
They're really tough!

981
01:14:18,501 --> 01:14:22,501
There's a team of nerds
behind these topics! Tell him.

982
01:14:39,667 --> 01:14:41,876
No, I'm not going for this.

983
01:14:42,084 --> 01:14:45,501
Give me one good reason
why we have to break up.

984
01:14:47,834 --> 01:14:50,251
There are more than 100 here.

985
01:14:50,459 --> 01:14:52,667
- What is this?
- Read it.

986
01:14:52,876 --> 01:14:54,292
One hundred?

987
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:58,917
You thought of 100 reasons...

988
01:15:02,084 --> 01:15:04,084
You're not normal at all.

989
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:09,542
And I shouldn't have to read this,
out of male pride!

990
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:14,084
But out of curiosity,
I'll pick one out randomly.

991
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:18,917
"23: You're conceited."
Me? Conceited?

992
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:22,626
I don't like
this way of doing things.

993
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:26,251
Tell me to my face
instead of writing them because

994
01:15:27,959 --> 01:15:31,376
"48: You're too hairy."

995
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:35,709
I can fix that, I'll get waxed!

996
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:38,334
"56: Uncouth."

997
01:15:39,459 --> 01:15:41,751
Me? Uncouth?

998
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:44,167
You little bitch!
You fucking bitch!

999
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:47,376
Hey Claudia, go fuck yourself!

1000
01:15:48,834 --> 01:15:52,251
A good presenter has to be:

1001
01:15:52,459 --> 01:15:54,292
A: Ctor.

1002
01:15:55,834 --> 01:15:57,667
Actor.

1003
01:15:58,251 --> 01:16:01,667
B: Alive.
But who cares about that...

1004
01:16:07,084 --> 01:16:08,709
Grandma

1005
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:13,167
I broke up with Cesare.

1006
01:16:16,417 --> 01:16:18,417
Come on, I'll take you to bed.

1007
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,126
Grandma.

1008
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,584
Grandma!

1009
01:16:30,876 --> 01:16:32,709
Dad!

1010
01:18:09,126 --> 01:18:10,751
Claudia.

1011
01:18:10,959 --> 01:18:12,584
Ludovico.

1012
01:18:32,001 --> 01:18:34,001
Who was that guy?

1013
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:36,876
Grandma's boyfriend.

1014
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:43,834
Grandma's boyfriend?

1015
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:20,042
Can't you sleep?

1016
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:23,917
- I haven't played forever.
- Feels like longer.

1017
01:19:28,751 --> 01:19:31,751
I have to sleep
or I'll never study tomorrow.

1018
01:19:32,459 --> 01:19:33,876
Wait

1019
01:19:51,126 --> 01:19:53,751
36 hours to exams

1020
01:19:54,459 --> 01:19:56,376
and I'm no longer afraid.

1021
01:20:06,959 --> 01:20:10,959
- Hello?
- Luca, put on the radio!

1022
01:20:14,626 --> 01:20:18,542
From the Ministry of Education.
What's happening?

1023
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:21,834
A lot, unfortunately.

1024
01:20:22,042 --> 01:20:24,959
We aren't going to have
all the exams ready in time.

1025
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:29,334
So what will happen?

1026
01:20:29,542 --> 01:20:31,376
We have no other option.

1027
01:20:31,584 --> 01:20:35,209
We've passed a decree saying
all those admitted to their exams

1028
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:38,042
automatically pass.

1029
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:42,126
There is a God!

1030
01:20:43,834 --> 01:20:45,042
Yes!

1031
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:51,251
Italo Svevo... Fuck you!

1032
01:20:51,959 --> 01:20:55,042
Salvatore Quasimodo... Fuck you too!

1033
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:03,834
Alice!

1034
01:21:06,376 --> 01:21:07,459
Luca, look!

1035
01:21:08,084 --> 01:21:10,084
It's The Prick.

1036
01:21:10,626 --> 01:21:12,709
Guys, it's the Prick!

1037
01:21:12,917 --> 01:21:14,209
Prick!

1038
01:21:14,417 --> 01:21:15,917
You've got to die!

1039
01:21:17,792 --> 01:21:19,584
You've got to die!

1040
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:49,084
Now everyone to the beach!

1041
01:21:51,584 --> 01:21:54,001
- Guys, it's unbelievable!
- What do you want?

1042
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:57,584
- It was a joke.
- Fuck off, you nerd.

1043
01:21:57,792 --> 01:22:02,084
- Shut up, it's not true.
- They said it on the news.

1044
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,126
The ones who did it got suspended.

1045
01:22:06,917 --> 01:22:08,751
It's true.

1046
01:22:09,084 --> 01:22:10,501
No.

1047
01:22:17,042 --> 01:22:19,126
Your test results show

1048
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:24,167
you have a beta hCG level of 6309.

1049
01:22:24,917 --> 01:22:28,209
- So...
- So?

1050
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:32,084
So you're in your fifth week.
Congratulations!

1051
01:22:34,126 --> 01:22:35,542
Congratulations...

1052
01:22:36,626 --> 01:22:39,626
Now what? What do we do?

1053
01:22:39,834 --> 01:22:43,667
You wait 9 months, or less,

1054
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:45,876
and then a baby is born.

1055
01:22:46,084 --> 01:22:48,876
- Or...
- Or what?

1056
01:22:50,251 --> 01:22:52,667
Or you change gynaecologist.

1057
01:22:54,876 --> 01:22:57,292
We've decided to keep it.

1058
01:22:58,167 --> 01:23:02,001
- Both of you, or just her?
- We both decided.

1059
01:23:02,584 --> 01:23:06,417
She was more for it, but...
That's all right.

1060
01:23:07,126 --> 01:23:09,334
I'll start working for my dad

1061
01:23:09,542 --> 01:23:12,042
and screw being an engineer!

1062
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:16,334
So goodbye Massi the Bullshitter
and hello the new Massimiliano

1063
01:23:16,542 --> 01:23:18,334
in a suit and tie.

1064
01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:20,376
How sad...

1065
01:23:20,626 --> 01:23:22,709
Simona is here!

1066
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:26,709
- Honey!
- Honey, my ass!

1067
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:28,626
- Simona!
- Screw you!

1068
01:23:28,834 --> 01:23:32,126
- You both make me sick!
- Who?

1069
01:23:32,334 --> 01:23:35,709
You and my sister, for fuck's sake!
What's wrong with you?

1070
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:39,001
"11 June, Massi kept insisting...
I couldn't say no."

1071
01:23:39,209 --> 01:23:41,917
- It was her!
- Fuck you!

1072
01:23:42,126 --> 01:23:45,959
Shut up or I'll kill you!
First you, then her!

1073
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:47,542
You idiots...

1074
01:23:47,751 --> 01:23:51,042
No, I'm the idiot
because I'm pregnant with your baby!

1075
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:54,209
- Get way!
- Simona!

1076
01:23:54,626 --> 01:23:57,834
- Fuck off!
- Wait, come back!

1077
01:24:01,084 --> 01:24:04,084
Looks like Massi the Bullshitter
has risen from the dead.

1078
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:09,834
The night before exams is weird.

1079
01:24:10,042 --> 01:24:13,042
You have the feeling of failure.

1080
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:17,834
No matter what you study,
you can't absorb it.

1081
01:24:18,042 --> 01:24:21,667
You're so nervous
you can't even breathe.

1082
01:24:21,876 --> 01:24:24,292
You grab on to any sign of hope.

1083
01:24:24,501 --> 01:24:28,001
Ours was a certain Lorenzo Falaschi,

1084
01:24:28,209 --> 01:24:30,209
a serial flunker from the suburbs

1085
01:24:30,417 --> 01:24:33,126
who apparently has
the essay topics, the real ones.

1086
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,542
- Who's Riccardo?
- I am.

1087
01:24:35,751 --> 01:24:38,167
- Falaschi?
- That's what they call me at school.

1088
01:24:38,376 --> 01:24:41,584
- Call me Piranha.
- Okay, sorry... Piranha.

1089
01:24:42,501 --> 01:24:45,001
- Got the 500,000 liras?
- Yes.

1090
01:24:46,292 --> 01:24:47,709
Here.

1091
01:24:50,584 --> 01:24:54,001
- It's all there, we counted it.
- I trust you.

1092
01:25:01,709 --> 01:25:04,334
But, Piranha...

1093
01:25:05,626 --> 01:25:08,459
- The essay topics?
- They'll be here, chill out.

1094
01:25:15,001 --> 01:25:16,209
Yes?

1095
01:25:16,417 --> 01:25:20,917
It's Massi again.
Can you get Simona?

1096
01:25:21,126 --> 01:25:23,126
Hi, Mass..

1097
01:25:24,292 --> 01:25:26,917
She can't talk right now.

1098
01:25:27,876 --> 01:25:30,292
You don't get it, you have to...

1099
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:34,334
Sorry, I just need to talk to her.

1100
01:25:34,542 --> 01:25:37,459
I know, but you can't right now.

1101
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:43,084
Tell her I'm staying here
until she comes out.

1102
01:25:43,709 --> 01:25:46,334
- Will you tell her?
- All right.

1103
01:25:48,751 --> 01:25:51,751
- He won't leave.
- Who gives a shit?

1104
01:25:53,209 --> 01:25:55,834
- Simona, I'm sorry.
- Fuck off!

1105
01:25:56,501 --> 01:25:58,501
He started it!

1106
01:25:58,709 --> 01:26:00,126
Drop dead!

1107
01:26:09,334 --> 01:26:11,751
The bill, please.

1108
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:14,167
3 years ago,

1109
01:26:14,376 --> 01:26:18,084
the pizza your brother had the night
before exams was good luck.

1110
01:26:18,292 --> 01:26:20,126
Hopefully it works for you too.

1111
01:26:20,334 --> 01:26:22,542
That was middle school!

1112
01:26:22,751 --> 01:26:24,959
It was still hard.

1113
01:26:25,167 --> 01:26:27,876
- Compared to high school?
- Yes, why?

1114
01:26:28,084 --> 01:26:31,667
Stop acting up,
there's a student of mine.

1115
01:26:31,876 --> 01:26:33,709
Hi, Mr Martinelli.

1116
01:26:33,917 --> 01:26:36,834
Hello, Alice... Mr and Mrs Corradi.

1117
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:40,542
This is Alice,
she has her exams too tomorrow.

1118
01:26:42,459 --> 01:26:44,959
- Hi, I'm Claudia.
- Claudia?

1119
01:26:45,959 --> 01:26:49,459
- You're Claudia?
- Yes, why?

1120
01:26:51,126 --> 01:26:52,542
No reason.

1121
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:56,459
How can I explain this?
Listen up, fool!

1122
01:26:56,667 --> 01:27:01,042
Go and genuflect somewhere else!

1123
01:27:02,376 --> 01:27:04,292
I'm not moving.

1124
01:27:04,501 --> 01:27:06,584
She's obviously pissed off at you,

1125
01:27:06,792 --> 01:27:08,876
I'm sure she's got a good reason.

1126
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:11,917
How would you know?

1127
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:13,876
I'm a cop, not a pizza man!

1128
01:27:14,084 --> 01:27:17,584
You know how many genuflectors
I've had to remove? Tell him!

1129
01:27:20,917 --> 01:27:23,334
He's not budging...

1130
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:26,542
He's a fool in love.
He's taken up residence here.

1131
01:27:27,126 --> 01:27:30,542
Should I arrest him?

1132
01:27:31,751 --> 01:27:34,126
Shall we go for a drink?

1133
01:27:34,334 --> 01:27:37,751
All that talking you're doing
probably dried your throat out.

1134
01:27:37,959 --> 01:27:41,834
I wish I had a dog as a partner,
they talk more.

1135
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:49,251
He's still there.

1136
01:27:52,792 --> 01:27:56,792
Guys, the topics are here.
Hot off the Ministry press.

1137
01:27:58,542 --> 01:28:00,959
Go and call Alice and Massi.

1138
01:28:05,959 --> 01:28:09,584
- Hello?
- We've got the topics.

1139
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:12,084
Let's meet outside Simona's.

1140
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:15,917
- Massi's already there.
- Good. See you there.

1141
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:18,751
I'm not coming.

1142
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:23,376
- What's wrong?
- Luca

1143
01:28:25,709 --> 01:28:28,334
- I met Claudia.
- What? Where?

1144
01:28:28,584 --> 01:28:31,501
The question isn't "where",
it's "with who".

1145
01:28:32,251 --> 01:28:34,167
With who?

1146
01:28:34,376 --> 01:28:38,584
- With The Prick.
- Claudia with Martinelli?

1147
01:28:39,709 --> 01:28:41,626
He's 30 years older than her!

1148
01:28:41,834 --> 01:28:44,959
You idiot, she's his daughter!

1149
01:28:48,126 --> 01:28:49,417
Hello?

1150
01:28:49,626 --> 01:28:51,334
Did you hear me?

1151
01:28:52,042 --> 01:28:54,042
What do I do now?

1152
01:28:55,334 --> 01:28:57,751
He'll kill me if he sees me.

1153
01:28:58,501 --> 01:29:00,709
Do you really like Claudia?

1154
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:03,626
Yes.

1155
01:29:17,126 --> 01:29:19,417
Luca! Where are you going?

1156
01:29:21,292 --> 01:29:24,292
You can't leave me here!

1157
01:29:26,459 --> 01:29:28,292
Look at this...

1158
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:35,167
"Greenhouse Effect
and Hole in the Ozone Layer,

1159
01:29:35,376 --> 01:29:38,584
two hazards generated
by human wickedness..."

1160
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:40,834
"Wickedness"?

1161
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:44,501
These are ours!

1162
01:29:45,542 --> 01:29:46,959
These are our topics!

1163
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:42,001
- Mr Martinelli...
- Look what the cat dragged in

1164
01:30:42,209 --> 01:30:45,209
I messed up, as I always do.

1165
01:30:45,792 --> 01:30:48,001
Please don't kick me out.

1166
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:51,084
I'm tempted,
tell me why I shouldn't.

1167
01:30:51,751 --> 01:30:53,959
A crazy thing happened.

1168
01:30:54,167 --> 01:30:58,584
I told you about that girl...
And I knew nothing about her.

1169
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:01,084
And?

1170
01:31:01,626 --> 01:31:05,251
It's your daughter.
I'm in love with Claudia.

1171
01:31:05,459 --> 01:31:09,459
I did what you told me to do:
I ran over to tell her.

1172
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:15,334
Please, let me in.

1173
01:31:20,167 --> 01:31:22,376
Come in, trouble-maker.

1174
01:31:29,501 --> 01:31:32,709
Claudia! You've got a visitor.

1175
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:37,001
- Hi.
- Hi.

1176
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:44,709
- You're the guy...
- I'm Luca.

1177
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:47,334
Well, I'm going.

1178
01:31:54,001 --> 01:31:56,626
I can't stop thinking
about that night!

1179
01:31:56,834 --> 01:31:58,876
You're telling me.

1180
01:31:59,084 --> 01:32:03,292
I have something
really important to tell you.

1181
01:32:03,876 --> 01:32:05,584
Me too.

1182
01:32:05,792 --> 01:32:07,709
- You do?
- Yes.

1183
01:32:08,584 --> 01:32:11,001
Well, all right then... You go first.

1184
01:32:13,584 --> 01:32:15,417
I was wondering...

1185
01:32:16,751 --> 01:32:20,459
That cute friend of yours,
the French one at the party.

1186
01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:25,626
- Riccardo?
- Riccardo.

1187
01:32:26,334 --> 01:32:29,209
Can I have his phone number?

1188
01:32:31,709 --> 01:32:33,792
The oldest story in the book:

1189
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:36,626
He wants her, she wants another.

1190
01:32:36,834 --> 01:32:40,042
And the other one
is always your best friend.

1191
01:32:46,334 --> 01:32:48,751
Didn't work out, did it?

1192
01:32:49,959 --> 01:32:52,959
Sooner or later
it happens to everyone.

1193
01:32:55,417 --> 01:32:57,751
Yes, but when it's you...

1194
01:32:58,584 --> 01:33:01,001
You see, Molinari...

1195
01:33:01,209 --> 01:33:02,501
Luca.

1196
01:33:02,709 --> 01:33:06,417
It doesn't matter
what you find after your search.

1197
01:33:06,626 --> 01:33:09,459
It's what you feel
during your search.

1198
01:33:11,167 --> 01:33:14,001
And going back to us,
study Leopardi.

1199
01:33:15,792 --> 01:33:17,209
Leopardi?

1200
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:20,417
If you get stuck, I'll ask you that.

1201
01:33:23,459 --> 01:33:24,751
Thanks.

1202
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:33,751
Goodbye.

1203
01:35:08,417 --> 01:35:10,417
So that was that night.

1204
01:35:10,626 --> 01:35:13,542
I didn't kiss Claudia
and there was no happy ending.

1205
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:16,959
Yet I'll remember it forever

1206
01:35:17,167 --> 01:35:19,126
because it was a special night.

1207
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:37,751
And I never felt again,
as often happens in life,

1208
01:35:38,376 --> 01:35:40,459
the magic I felt that night.

1209
01:36:45,501 --> 01:36:48,501

01:37:47,959 --> 01:37:52,792
ATTORNEY, MARRIED RICCARDO

1220
01:37:54,459 --> 01:37:55,876
AND LUCA?

1221
01:37:58,417 --> 01:38:01,626
The name of this phenomenon is

1222
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:04,542
tectonic plaques.

1223
01:38:04,751 --> 01:38:07,959
It sounds like a bad word but...

1224
01:38:08,167 --> 01:38:10,376
No, it's scientific.

1225
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:13,417
Because, actually, these plaques

1226
01:38:14,626 --> 01:38:19,251
shift because they're...
very slippery and...

1227
01:38:20,542 --> 01:38:22,959
Molinari, you're getting stuck.

1228
01:38:23,167 --> 01:38:25,251
He's nervous.

1229
01:38:25,459 --> 01:38:28,292
- Can I ask him a question?
- Of course.

1230
01:38:28,917 --> 01:38:31,126
Let's try Italian.

1231
01:38:31,334 --> 01:38:34,626
I'd like you
to talk about a great poet

1232
01:38:34,834 --> 01:38:37,459
that we studied very carefully.

1233
01:38:38,334 --> 01:38:39,751
His name is...

1234
01:38:42,334 --> 01:38:43,751
Giosué Carducci.

1235
01:38:53,459 --> 01:38:54,667
Yes.

1236
01:38:55,167 --> 01:38:58,792
Carducci was born
near Lucca in 1835

1237
01:38:59,001 --> 01:39:01,501
and died in Bologna in 1907,

1238
01:39:01,709 --> 01:39:04,917
one year after winning a Nobel Prize.

1239
01:39:05,126 --> 01:39:07,417
He was a poet and literary critic.

1240
01:39:07,626 --> 01:39:09,501
As a republican,
he sided with the monarchy

1241
01:39:09,709 --> 01:39:11,042
and was named "National Poet".

1242
01:39:11,251 --> 01:39:13,251
His work as a critic...

1243
01:39:13,459 --> 01:39:16,542
One thing I learned
after five years of high school:

1244
01:39:16,751 --> 01:39:19,251
Never trust a teacher.

1245
01:39:19,459 --> 01:39:22,959
So I studied all Italian poets.

1246
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:25,376
All of them... except Leopardi.

1247
01:39:26,251 --> 01:39:29,417
