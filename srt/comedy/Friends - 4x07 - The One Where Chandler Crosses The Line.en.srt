1
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,256
I just saw Kathy naked.

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,676
It was like torture.

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:13,556
If we go to war and you're captured,
you're in for a surprise.

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,432
It keeps getting worse.

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,935
I'm in love with
my roommate's girlfriend.

6
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:24,066
Every time we're in the same room,
there's weird energy between us.

7
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,069
Call me crazy, but
I think she likes me too.

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,031
And now I have seen her naked.

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,366
At least with her clothes on...

10
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:38,497
...I could imagine her body
was covered in boils.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,542
But there are no boils.
She's smooth.

12
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,713
Smooth!

13
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,216
Could you see up his robe?

14
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,095
Oh, my God!

15
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,390
The One Where
Chandler Crosses the Line

16
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,604
- Here you go.
- I'll call you.

17
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,441
Great!

18
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,484
Hey, hey. Who was that?

19
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,987
Casey. We're going out tonight.

20
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:56,366
Going out? Wow!

21
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,287
It didn't work out
with Kathy? Bummer.

22
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,872
No, things are fine.

23
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:08,086
I'm having a late meal with her
after an early one with Casey.

24
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:13,759
The craziest thing is,
I just ate a whole pizza myself.

25
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,762
You're going out with Kathy!

26
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,013
Why are you upset?

27
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,890
Well, I'm upset...

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,517
...for you.

29
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:28,148
Sex with an endless line of women
must be unfulfilling.

30
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,360
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're exclusive.

31
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,446
Look, Joey.

32
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,616
Kathy's not fulfilling
your emotional needs.

33
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,076
But, Casey...

34
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,454
Granted, I just saw
the back of her head.

35
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,999
But I got this sense
that she's smart and funny...

36
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,004
...and gets you.

37
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,255
You got all that
from the back of her head?

38
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,550
It's time to settle down.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,927
Make a choice.
Pick a lane.

40
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,680
Who's Elaine?

41
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,601
<i>Little Tony Tarzan</i>

42
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:10,858
<i>Swinging on a nose hair</i>
<i>Swinging with the greatest of ease</i>

43
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,986
I don't know the next verse.

44
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,072
You could just go:

45
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,991
<i>Greatest of ease</i>

46
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,453
Then go right into it.

47
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,080
I like that.

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,333
How do you know about...

49
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,003
You know, I used to play.

50
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,214
That's right.
The keyboards?

51
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,134
A little in high school.
I got into it in college.

52
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:43,181
That's when
I really found my sound.

53
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:49,396
Juice just came out of my nose,
but it was worth it.

54
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,481
Oh, my God!

55
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,194
I completely forgot about
your sound.

56
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,613
He'd lock himself in the basement.

57
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:01,825
No one was ever allowed to hear
"the sound".

58
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,911
I want to hear "the sound".

59
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:10,042
No, I mean,
I haven't played in so long.

60
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,711
Well, it's really personal stuff.

61
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,756
Play that funky music, white boy.

62
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,176
- Yeah, come on.
- No, you guys.

63
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,847
My keyboards are all the way...
Yeah, okay.

64
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,437
Okay, guys.

65
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,900
All right! Bring it on, you!

66
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,821
Here we go.

67
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:49,205
You know, I've never played
my stuff for anyone before.

68
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,875
It's important that you understand...

69
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,836
...it's about communicating...

70
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:59,633
...very private emotions.

71
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:05,931
You know...

72
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:10,102
You should think of my work...

73
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:15,357
...as wordless sound poems.

74
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,698
- That's what...
- My God, play!

75
00:05:56,315 --> 00:06:00,152
Well, you know, that was...

76
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,947
...terrific!

77
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,865
Really...

78
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,076
...bitchin'.

79
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:12,039
Wow! It was so wow!

80
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,832
Really?

81
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:19,296
Yeah! I mean, you should
play in public.

82
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,965
Wow, thanks, you guys.
That's...

83
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,970
I want to play you another piece.

84
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:32,893
I left my helicopter sounds
on another disk. I'll be back.

85
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:38,565
This is so nice.
I mean, I am so...

86
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:46,072
God bless my dad
for soundproofing the basement.

87
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:51,036
I can't believe I ever let him
touch me with those fingers.

88
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,873
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it!

89
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,042
It was so moving.

90
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,712
It's so different
from the stuff you usually hear.

91
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:04,216
You mean, music?

92
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,387
I know what you think.

93
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:14,852
Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.

94
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,480
Come in.

95
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,650
Oh, God! Is that "Baywatch"?

96
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,071
Yes, but I just watch it
for the articles.

97
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,489
So is Joey around?

98
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,824
No, he's not back yet.

99
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,327
Come in, have a seat.
Bow or stern?

100
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,789
I don't have a preference. You?

101
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,416
I like it in the stern.

102
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,713
Of the boat.

103
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,218
It's me. Casey and I
had a little car trouble.

104
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,220
- What happened?
<i>- We broke down.</i>

105
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,555
I have to get transmission fluid.

106
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,476
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry
and I'll be there soon.

107
00:07:56,727 --> 00:08:02,816
- Why can't you tell her?
<i>- I think my time is about to...</i>

108
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,530
I thought your time ran out.

109
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,784
Me too, but I guess I do have...

110
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,873
Joey's running a little late,
and he says he's sorry.

111
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,960
I guess it's just you and me, then.

112
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,964
Yeah, I think it is.

113
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,052
So what'd you do today?

114
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,887
I had an appointment
to cut my hair.

115
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:36,558
- Looks great!
- And then it got canceled.

116
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,226
I could cut it.

117
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,436
Really?

118
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:44,482
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's
dog-grooming shop. What do you say?

119
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,693
Dog grooming?

120
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:50,573
Don't make my tail too poofy.

121
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,579
You have really great hair.

122
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,833
Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.

123
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,089
Joey also has great hair.

124
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,342
Yes, Joey has great hair.

125
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:16,556
I'm basically done here.
Let me get this hair off your neck.

126
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,862
What are you doing?

127
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,408
Checking if it's even.

128
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,413
Looks good.

129
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:46,253
The phone!
The phone's making sounds!

130
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,879
Hey, dude, it's me.

131
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,674
Hey, it's Joey!

132
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,052
It looks like we'll be stuck here.

133
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:57,389
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.

134
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,307
- What?
<i>- It fell out.</i>

135
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:03,479
I just figured we hit a dog.

136
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:08,109
<i>Could you put Kathy on?</i>
<i>I want to apologize to her.</i>

137
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,278
It's Joey.

138
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,489
No, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

139
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,660
Yeah, no, stop apologizing.
It's okay.

140
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,705
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

141
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,543
I should probably go.

142
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,601
I forgot my purse.

143
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:54,029
I really did.
I forgot my purse.

144
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,912
- This is bad! It's bad!
- Horrible!

145
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,666
Wait, the kiss or the situation?

146
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,251
The kiss was good.

147
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,837
- But that's bad!
- Here's what we do.

148
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,006
We forget it.

149
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:18,179
We swallow our feelings, even if
we're unhappy forever. Sound good?

150
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,138
Can you really do that?

151
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,517
I have to. He's my best friend.

152
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,686
And you're seeing him.

153
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,564
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.

154
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,232
But with you...

155
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,567
No, don't! Don't, see?

156
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:37,197
You're getting me confused.
I'm starting to yearn.

157
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,618
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:46,040
If you want to pretend that
nothing happened, I can try.

159
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,877
I think we have to.

160
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,895
Are you still out there?

161
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:22,534
<i>Electrifying</i>

162
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:27,748
<i>Infinite time</i>

163
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,460
There's a Starbucks
about three blocks down.

164
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,924
He's so inspired.
Just look at him. Look at him go!

165
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,524
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

166
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,861
Hey, aren't you up next?

167
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:02,198
- I'm not playing tonight.
- Why not?

168
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,077
I can't follow Ross.

169
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,664
It'd be like those
poor bicycle-riding chimps...

170
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:12,751
...who had to
follow the Beatles. No.

171
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,421
Ross sucks.

172
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:20,050
The place has emptied because of him.

173
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,429
My God, he's not even
appreciated in his own time.

174
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,019
I'd give anything to not be
appreciated in my own time!

175
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,527
You suck too.

176
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:44,950
You're awful.

177
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,913
You guys!

178
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,540
You suck too!

179
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,258
Man! I can't believe
I locked myself out again!

180
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,845
Hang on, buddy.

181
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,557
My God! What happened?

182
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,602
- Did you do all this? Why?
- I sure did.

183
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:16,482
It made me feel good to do
something nice for my friend.

184
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,317
You're amazing.

185
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:23,197
No, this is amazing.

186
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,576
A TV appears from nowhere!

187
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,037
The dream!

188
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,914
How did you afford all this?

189
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,376
I'm 29. I mean, who needs
a savings account?

190
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:38,712
You're the best friend
anyone has ever had.

191
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,006
I don't know.

192
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,424
No, you are.

193
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,051
You do this, you give me advice...

194
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:49,181
What you said about
focusing on one woman?

195
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,682
I'll do that.

196
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,892
With Casey?

197
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:55,646
I'll see how things go with Kathy.
She's cool.

198
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,190
- Or Casey.
- No, Kathy.

199
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,274
Could be Casey.

200
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,568
No, Kathy.

201
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,320
Consider Casey.

202
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,074
I think somebody's
got a little crush on Casey.

203
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:10,077
I'll fix you two up.
What do you think?

204
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:16,166
That all the pieces of my life
are falling right into place.

205
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:27,886
You were really great.
You were really, really great.

206
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,221
Thanks.

207
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:35,143
Monica tells me you don't want
to play anymore because of me...

208
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,647
...and, you know, my talent.

209
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,400
Is that true?

210
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,736
Well, kind of, yeah.

211
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:47,740
I was trying to be really okay
and upbeat about it...

212
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,078
...but I just feel so dwarfed
by your musical gift.

213
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:54,705
See, but...

214
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:59,710
Pheebs, that is the exact
opposite intent of my music.

215
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,130
You know, my music
is meant to inspire.

216
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,299
If it bothers you this much...

217
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:10,679
...then I won't play anymore.

218
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,056
No, don't do that.

219
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:19,980
How could I live if I knew I was
depriving the world of your music?

220
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,409
Hey, Chandler.
Saw the new furniture. Very nice.

221
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,371
Joey has the best boyfriend ever!

222
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:38,791
I kissed Kathy.

223
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,334
Are you serious?

224
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,419
- Does Joey know?
- No.

225
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,965
Is there any way you think
he will understand this?

226
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:50,720
You obviously haven't
screwed over your friends.

227
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,513
Which we all appreciate.

228
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:57,685
If you'd told him how you felt
before you kissed her...

229
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,604
...knowing Joey,
he'd have stepped aside.

230
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,608
Don't say that!
That's not true, is it?

231
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,401
Yeah, he loves you.

232
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,530
Then why didn't you
tell me to do that?

233
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,865
I said something to Phoebe.

234
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,743
And I thought it was
a really good idea.

235
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:18,413
- Yeah, I remember.
- Oh, my God!

236
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,374
What am I going to do?

237
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,292
You'll have to tell him.

238
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,253
Why do I have to?

239
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:28,549
- Because you do.
- Yeah, I know.

240
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:35,931
Would it be okay
if I wrote a song about this?

241
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,398
Sambuca Margarita?

242
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,150
It that a real thing?

243
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,821
Well, we only had sambuca,
so it is now.

244
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,823
Listen, Joe. I need to...

245
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,450
I need to talk to you.

246
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,037
What's up?

247
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:01,290
It's about Kathy.

248
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,334
I like her.

249
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,630
I like her a lot, actually.

250
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,257
You do?

251
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,759
Your timing couldn't be better.

252
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,347
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

253
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,893
- Yeah, she broke up with me.
- When?

254
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,270
Just now, after acting class.

255
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,817
I thought she was doing some scene,
so I let people watch.

256
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,738
Man, I am so sorry.
Are you okay?

257
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:37,242
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?

258
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,036
Yes, but I don't have to.

259
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:44,500
No, it's okay.

260
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:50,964
You know why?
Because you came to me first.

261
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:55,803
I thought that would be
the best thing to do.

262
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,806
You might have your work
cut out for you.

263
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:04,895
When I talked to her, I got
the feeling she's into some other guy.

264
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:09,900
See, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

265
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,944
I think I know who the other guy is.

266
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,989
Who?

267
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,616
It's me.

268
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,035
I'm the other guy.

269
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,496
What?

270
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:27,334
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...

271
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,295
...and one thing led
to another, and...

272
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,923
And what?
Did you sleep with her?

273
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,758
No, I just kissed her.

274
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,802
What? That's even worse!

275
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:41,682
- How is that worse?
- It's the same!

276
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,310
There's nothing I could do.
I'm in love with her!

277
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:46,562
Who cares?

278
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,857
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you!

279
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:53,360
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

280
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,448
You're so far past the line,
that you can't even see the line!

281
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,744
It's a dot to you!

282
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:06,248
Yes, right! And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.

283
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:10,377
Is that why you bought all this?

284
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,837
You know what?

285
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,506
I will not watch your TV.

286
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,549
I won't listen to your stereo.

287
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,054
And there's a loaf in the new
breadmaker I won't eat. Know why?

288
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,223
Because...

289
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:26,559
It's all tainted with your betrayal!

290
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:33,025
This apartment is empty to me!
I'm not happy about you, either.

291
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,157
And just so you know...

292
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:44,202
...I made that bread for you.

293
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:01,679
Oh, my God!
He's totally lost it.

294
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,892
This cannot get any worse.

295
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:11,730
Rats in the basement
are hanging themselves.

296
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:23,409
Thank you. Thanks.

297
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,455
I lost it.

298
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,498
I won't play anymore.

299
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:34,419
Would you...
Can you finish my set?

300
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,673
After that? Yeah.

301
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:42,177
No, I mean, if I can help.

302
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:50,186
Like I could lose it.

303
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:55,816
I played bad on purpose, guys.

304
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,903
You were playing bad
this whole time.

305
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,155
Just that last song.
