00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,130
Mom, would you relax?

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,175
That was 10 blocks from here,
and she was walking alone at night.

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,178
I would never do that.

6
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,847
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,392
This is a safe street. This is
a safe building. There's nothing...

8
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,646
Oh, my God! What are
you doing in here?!

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:24,191
Mom, I gotta go! I gotta go!

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,528
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,698
That's fine, you just read the paper.

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,076
I'm gonna get a pot.

13
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:37,704
It's not for you.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,545
Okay, that's fine.

15
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,257
Read the "Family Circus"...

16
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:52,928
...enjoy the gentle comedy...

17
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,601
Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God...

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,280
It's open, you guys.

19
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,198
Can I help you?

20
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,492
Does Phoebe still live here?

21
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,078
No, she doesn't. But I can get
a message to her.

22
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,206
Great. Just tell her
her husband stopped by.

23
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,417
Her what?

24
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,422
How did you do that?

25
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,010
The One With Phoebe's Husband

27
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,640
This is unbelievable, Pheebs.
How can you be married?

28
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,726
I'm not "married"
married, you know?

29
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,603
He's just a friend, and he's gay...

30
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,481
...and he was from Canada,
and he needed a Green Card.

31
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,733
I can't believe you married Duncan!

32
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,653
How could you not tell me?
We told each other everything.

33
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,533
I'm sorry, but I knew
if I told you, you'd get judgmental...

34
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:38,701
...and wouldn't approve.

35
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,870
Of course I wouldn't approve!

36
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,205
You were totally in love
with this guy who, hello, was gay.

37
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,208
What the hell were you thinking?

38
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:50,420
See? And you thought
she'd be judgmental.

39
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,799
I wasn't in love with him.
I was helping out a friend.

40
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,344
When he left town, you
stayed in your pajamas for a month.

41
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,098
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

42
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,102
Well, didn't you?

43
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,604
I might have.

44
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,107
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

45
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,775
Like you tell me everything?

46
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,194
What have I not told you?

47
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,904
I don't know.

48
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,075
The fact that the underwear out
on the telephone pole is yours...

49
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,828
...from when you had sex
with Bobby on the terrace!

50
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,496
What?

51
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,874
Wait a minute! Who told you?

52
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,755
You are dead meat.

53
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,591
I didn't know it was a big secret.

54
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,801
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

55
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,636
Kind of the same as, say...

56
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,808
...I don't know, having
a third nipple!

57
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:48,103
You have a third nipple?

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,024
You bitch!

59
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,569
Whip it out! Whip it out!

60
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,740
There's nothing to see! It's a
tiny bump. It's totally useless.

61
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,453
As opposed to your other
multi-functional nipples?

62
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:09,416
I can't believe you!
You told me it was a nubbin.

63
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,627
Joey, what did you think
a nubbin was?

64
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,840
You see something, you hear a word,
I thought that's what it was.

65
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,468
- Let me see it again!
- Yes, show us your nubbin!

66
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,598
Joey was in a porno movie!

67
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,853
If I'm going down,
I'm taking everybody with me!

68
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,023
- Oh, my God!
- You were in a porno?!

69
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,525
I was young and I just wanted a job.

70
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,861
But I couldn't go through with it.

71
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,989
They let me be the guy who fixes
the copier but can't...

72
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,453
...because there's people
having sex on it.

73
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,996
That is wild!

74
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,332
- What's it shaped like?
- Is it hairy?

75
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,002
What happens if you flick it?

76
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,762
So does it do anything,
you know, special?

77
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,098
Pressing my third nipple
opens the delivery entrance...

78
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,435
...to the magical land of Narnia.

79
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:15,191
In some cultures, having a third nipple
is actually a sign of virility.

80
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,902
You get the best huts,
and women dance naked around you.

81
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,365
Are any of these cultures,
per chance, in the Tri-State area?

82
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:29,663
You know, you are so amazing.
Is there anything you don't know?

83
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:34,209
Julie's so smart!
Julie's so special!

84
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,504
I wanted you to hook up
with Ross as much as you did.

85
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,174
But he's with her now.
You'll have to get over it.

86
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,178
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

87
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:49,516
I didn't know that's what I had to do.
I just have to get over it.

88
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,272
- Sassy lady!
- Where are you going?

89
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,692
I'm meeting Duncan.
He's skating tonight at the Garden.

90
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,028
He's in the Capades.

91
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,658
- The Ice Capades?
- No, the Gravel Capades.

92
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:11,246
The turns aren't as fast,
but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

93
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,164
I can't believe
you'd dress up for him.

94
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,792
You're setting yourself up
all over again.

95
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,546
Okay, no.

96
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:23,591
For your information, I'm seeing him
so I can put those feelings behind me.

97
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,346
The reason I'm dressed like this
is because I think it's nice...

98
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,600
...to look nice for your gay husband.

99
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,145
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

100
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,064
Chandler, will you fill me up here?

101
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,909
I see, I see. Because of
the third-nipple thing.

102
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,043
Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.

103
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:02,881
- See you later, Rach.
- Bye-bye, Julie.

104
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,394
Come on, cut it out!

105
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,942
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

106
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,194
What?

107
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,614
Come on, talk to me.

108
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:33,871
What's the longest you've been
in a relationship before...

109
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,958
...having the sex?

110
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,669
Why? Who's not...?
Are you and Julie not...?

111
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,464
Are you and Julie not having sex?

112
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,342
Technically?

113
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,096
No.

114
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,975
Is it because she's so cold in bed?

115
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:59,896
Or because she's kind of bossy,
makes it feel like school?

116
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:04,985
No! She's great. And it's not
like we haven't done anything.

117
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,697
We do plenty of other stuff.
Lots of other stuff like...

118
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:13,118
No! Don't need to know the details.

119
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,203
No, it's just...

120
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,872
It's me.

121
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,167
I've only been with
one woman my whole life...

122
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,712
...and she turned out to be a lesbian.

123
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:28,049
So now I've got myself
all psyched out.

124
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,178
It's become, like, this...

125
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,640
...this thing!

126
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,726
You must just think I'm weird.

127
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,812
No, I don't think it's weird.

128
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,524
I think, in fact...

129
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,694
- In fact, you know what I think?
- What?

130
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:50,239
I think it's sexy.

131
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,198
Sexy?

132
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,575
Let me tell you something.
As a woman...

133
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,870
...there is nothing sexier...

134
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,499
...than a man who does not
want to have sex.

135
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,709
No kidding?

136
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,378
You know what I'd do?

137
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,589
I'd wait.

138
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,009
- You'd wait?
- Absolutely. I would wait...

139
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,888
...and wait...

140
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,390
Then I'd wait some more.

141
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,309
Really?

142
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,564
I don't care if she tells you
she wants it, she begs, she pleads...

143
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:27,568
...she tells you she's gonna
have sex with another man...

144
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,946
That just means it's working.

145
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,075
Women really want this?

146
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,578
More than jewelry.

147
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,144
Look at you! You look great!

148
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,646
Do I? Thank you.

149
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:09,110
So do you. Sparkly!

150
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,284
This is pretty wonderful,
Mr. Major Capades Guy!

151
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:23,749
I remember when you were just
King Friday in Mr. Roger's "Ice Is Nice".

152
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,500
You always said I'd make it.

153
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:30,172
Well, you know,
I'm kind of spooky that way.

154
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,467
Gosh, I missed you!

155
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:39,056
- I'm gonna get changed.
- Okay.

156
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:43,019
Now.

157
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,897
Oh! Right. Okay.

158
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,901
What?

159
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,237
The Matador...

160
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:07,084
Sweetie, can you
hold this for a second?

161
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:19,388
Sorry, you had a
paleontologist on your face.

162
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,807
But it's gone now.
You're all right.

163
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,227
Hi, everyone.

164
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,940
I wanted to thank you
for our little talk before.

165
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,652
No problem! So you're gonna
go with the waiting thing?

166
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:38,865
I was going to, but after
I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

167
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,954
Good. What did he say?

168
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,457
He told me to get over myself
and just do it.

169
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,586
I thought about what you said
and about what he said.

170
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:55,674
And his way, I get
to have sex tonight, so...

171
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,806
What is this in my pocket?

172
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,810
Why, it's Joey's porno movie!

173
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,688
Pop it in!

174
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,190
I'm fine, if you're
okay watching a video...

175
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:16,320
...filled with two-nippled people.

176
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:21,158
People having sex.
That's just what I need to see.

177
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,995
What's wrong with people having sex?

178
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:30,793
Well, you know, these
movies are offensive...

179
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:37,049
...and degrading
to women and females...

180
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:42,179
And the lighting's
always unflattering.

181
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:48,268
- Monica, help me out here.
- Hell, I wanna see Joey!

182
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,653
So is there a story?
Or do they just start doing it right...

183
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,822
Oh. Never mind.

184
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:05,244
Wait a minute. That is the craziest
typing test I've ever seen.

185
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,871
All I say is, she'd
better get the job.

186
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,626
Looks to me like he's
the one getting the job.

187
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,628
Here I come.

188
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,671
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

189
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:22,219
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

190
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,348
So I just watch them have sex.

191
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,894
Then I say... Here's my line!

192
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,105
<i>You know, that's bad</i>
<i>for the paper tray.</i>

193
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,525
Nice work, my friend!

194
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:41,780
Wait, you see me again. Hang on,
the guy's butt's blocking me.

195
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,244
There I am. There I am.
There I am...

196
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,504
So what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.

197
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,302
I kind of need a divorce.

198
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:05,971
O...

199
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,681
...kay.

200
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,933
How come?

201
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,853
Actually, I'm getting married again.

202
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,313
What?

203
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:18,067
I don't know how to tell you this.

204
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,987
I'm straight.

205
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,826
I don't understand.
How can you be straight?

206
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,495
You're so smart and funny...

207
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,582
...and you throw
such great Academy Award parties!

208
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,168
That's what I kept telling myself.

209
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:41,006
But you reach a point
where you can't live a lie anymore.

210
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:45,010
How long have you known?

211
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:49,306
I guess on some level
I always knew I was straight.

212
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,600
I thought I was supposed
to be something else.

213
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,148
I'm an ice dancer, all my friends
are gay. I was just trying to fit in.

214
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,486
And there's actually a woman?

215
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,115
Her name's Debra.

216
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:12,705
Well, is she the first
that you've been with?

217
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,791
I've never told you this...

218
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,295
...but there were one
or two times back in college when...

219
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,590
...I'd get drunk,
go to a straight bar...

220
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,843
...and wake up with
a woman next to me.

221
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:32,016
I told myself it was the liquor,
and everyone experiments in college.

222
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,016
Sure.

223
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:38,606
Now I know I don't have a choice.
I was born this way!

224
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,818
I don't know what to say.

225
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:46,863
You're married to someone for
six years and you think you know him.

226
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:51,535
And then one day he says,
"Oh, I'm not gay!"

227
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:59,126
I'm still me.

228
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:04,673
Why couldn't you just have
figured this out six years ago?

229
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,887
You know, it still
smells like monkey in there.

230
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:14,474
That saves us the conversation.

231
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,519
This has been great,
but I'm officially wiped.

232
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,021
Me too. We should get going.

233
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:24,026
No! Come on, you guys!

234
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,487
Come on, it's only 11:30.

235
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:30,866
Let's just talk. We never just
hang out and talk anymore.

236
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:35,120
Rachel, that's all we do.

237
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,999
Maybe that's all we do.
What about Julie?

238
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,001
What about Julie?

239
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:45,464
You have been in our lives
for nearly two months now...

240
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,549
...and we don't really know you.

241
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,593
I mean, who is Julie?

242
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,971
What do you like?
What don't you like?

243
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,516
We want to know everything.

244
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,018
Well, that could take awhile.

245
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,979
So?

246
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:04,483
Who here does not have
the time to get to know Julie?

247
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:08,612
I got the time to get to know Julie.

248
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,950
I know her pretty well.
Can I go?

249
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,536
That's fine.

250
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:20,541
Let's start with your childhood.
What was that like?

251
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,294
In a nutshell...

252
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,299
So, have you told your parents?

253
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,511
No, but it'll be okay.
They're pretty cool.

254
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:36,348
My brother's straight, so...

255
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,016
Here you go.

256
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,978
You know what?
I just have one more question.

257
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:46,191
If you had figured this out sooner,
and I had been around...

258
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:50,695
...do you think I
would have been the one...?

259
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,198
No. Don't tell me.

260
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:57,953
I don't think either answer
would make me feel better. Here.

261
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,123
I love you, Phoebe.

262
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:18,766
So your brother's straight, huh?

263
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,518
Seriously.

264
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,815
- And my second-grade teacher
was Miss Thomas...

265
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:30,277
...and my first-grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb.

266
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,070
Mrs. Gobb?

267
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:36,492
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

268
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,161
What exactly is in a cobb salad?

269
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:43,373
I'm going home.

270
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,880
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

271
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:54,218
Good night.

272
00:18:56,303 --> 00:19:00,182
It's pretty late. You're
probably not still planning on...

273
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,726
No, I am.

274
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,855
Are you nervous?

275
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,859
I have done it before.

276
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,361
I mean, how are
you gonna handle it?

277
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:18,784
Are you gonna talk about it beforehand?
Are you just gonna pounce?

278
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,662
I don't know. I guess
I'm just gonna...

279
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:25,207
...see what happens.

280
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:28,835
Good luck!

281
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,088
What?

282
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,590
Nothing...

283
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:38,971
It is your first time with her,
and if the first time doesn't go well...

284
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:44,476
...well then, that's pretty darn
hard to recover from.

285
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,647
Okay, now I'm nervous.

286
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,692
Maybe you should put it off.

287
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:55,737
No, I don't want to put it off!

288
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:01,910
I spent last year being
so unbelievably miserable.

289
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,581
And now I'm actually happy.

290
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,334
You know, I mean really happy.

291
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,629
I just don't wanna...

292
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:16,175
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

293
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,511
I know.

294
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,014
I'm sorry.

295
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,017
It's not your fault.

296
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,853
Right.

297
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:31,440
Maybe it doesn't
have to be this tough.

298
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,862
Maybe you were on the right track
with that whole "spontaneous" thing.

299
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:41,617
- Women really like that.
- Really?

300
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:46,705
I mean if it were me,
I'd want you to...

301
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:51,168
I don't know, catch me off guard
with a really...

302
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:54,296
...good kiss.

303
00:20:55,547 --> 00:21:00,343
Really sort of soft at first.

304
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:05,766
And then maybe brush
the hair away from my face.

305
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:10,103
And then look far into my eyes...

306
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:14,024
...in a way that lets me
know something...

307
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:18,069
...amazing is about to happen.

308
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,035
And then, I don't know, then...

309
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,205
...you'd pull me
really close to you so that...

310
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:33,543
...so that I'd be pressed up
right against you.

311
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:38,132
And it would get kind of...

312
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,468
...sweaty...

313
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,180
...and blurry.

314
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:50,436
And then it's just happening.

315
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,403
Thanks, Rach. Good night!

316
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:05,450
Oh, God!

317
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,092
Good morning!

318
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:26,930
Well, somebody got some last night!

319
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,186
Twice!
