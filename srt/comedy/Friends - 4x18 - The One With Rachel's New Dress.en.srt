1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,423
It is true what they say:

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,968
Pregnant bellies look like a drum.

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,851
I'm so pregnant that
my guitar doesn't fit anymore.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,686
So I'm going to play my songs
on this drum.

5
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,772
It sounds really cool!

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,776
Listen, listen.

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,363
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

8
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:34,535
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,207
That sounds great!

10
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:45,379
I know! And I've only
been playing for an hour.

11
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:53,428
- What are you doing here?
- I came to ask you a big favor.

12
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,184
Don't tell me you want to keep
more stuff in my uterus.

13
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,521
Okay. Now, see.

14
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,940
I want to name the girl baby Leslie.

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,902
And Frank wants to name
one of the boy babies...

16
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,364
...Frank Jr., Jr.

17
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,241
Wouldn't that be Frank III?

18
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,703
Don't get me started.

19
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,997
Anyway, since there
are three babies...

20
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,667
...and we both got
to put our names in...

21
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:29,256
...we would be truly honored
if you would name the other boy baby.

22
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,883
That's so nice!

23
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,553
Cougar.

24
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,889
Think about it.

25
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,770
The One with Rachel's New Dress

26
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,985
I left a bra drying in there.

27
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,489
Will your son think it's yours
and be traumatized?

28
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:40,494
Mommy can have a wife.
Daddy can have a bra.

29
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,287
It's time to go.

30
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,124
See, that clock's a little fast.

31
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,710
We still have 17 minutes.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,754
What can we do in 17 minutes...

33
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,089
...twice?

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,969
Well, that's ambitious.

35
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,679
You can ignore that.

36
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,139
That's your son.

37
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,894
Believe me, when he's older,
he'll understand.

38
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,647
I'll be right there.

39
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,572
This is Carol and Susan.

40
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,868
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- You too.

41
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:25,664
- Susan will be in London next week.
- I've never been there.

42
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,791
- I'll show you around.
- Great!

43
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,211
Also, I was hoping to catch a show.
Any suggestions?

44
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,713
There's tons of terrific stuff.

45
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,009
I'll go with you.

46
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,095
Look at you two bonding.

47
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,764
Making us late for the airport.

48
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:43,807
Are you all right?

49
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,394
It's just us getting along
is difficult for him...

50
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,313
...because he doesn't like me.

51
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,066
Come on. That's...

52
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,069
It's true.

53
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,492
Do we have a baby name yet?

54
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,078
No. It's so hard!

55
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,580
I went through this book
and found nothing.

56
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,292
I want a name that's
really strong and confident.

57
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,334
You know? Like...

58
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,088
...Exxon!

59
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,550
It certainly worked
for that Valdez kid.

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,471
You want a strong name?
How about The Hulk?

61
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:29,519
I'm not sure about Hulk,
but I like a name starting with "The".

62
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,981
You want a good name,
go with Joey.

63
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,191
Joey's your pal, your buddy.

64
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,070
Where is everybody?
They're hanging out with Joey!

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,991
If you're going to name him Joey,
you should name him Chandler.

66
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:46,537
Chandler's funny, sophisticated,
and very lovable...

67
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,707
...once you get to know him.

68
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,417
Joey's lovable too.

69
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,212
But with Joey, if you need him,
he'll be there.

70
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,675
Chandler will be there too.
He might be a little late...

71
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,678
...but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you cold soda...

72
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,932
...if what you need him for
is that you're really hot.

73
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,850
What do you say?

74
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:13,522
I like the idea of naming him
after someone I love.

75
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:18,568
Joey and Chandler
are both great names.

76
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,949
All right, I don't...

77
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,994
Maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.

78
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,792
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
I wanted to name my kid that.

79
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:40,424
If you hoped to sleep with Joshua,
which one would you wear?

80
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:45,012
It creeps me out choosing
other people's sex clothes.

81
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,931
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited.

82
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,102
I've been waiting for months.
I got my hair colored.

83
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,896
I got new sheets.
I'm making him a very fancy meal.

84
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,066
What am I making him, by the way?

85
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,824
...wild rice, roasted asparagus
and salmon en croute.

86
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,286
I thought I was making him
filet mignon.

87
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,331
You decided to make salmon
because you had some left over.

88
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,710
Then you realized if you bitched,
then you would stop cooking...

89
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
...and you would have to make your
famous baked potato and Diet Coke.

90
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,927
I really get crabby when I cook.

91
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,892
So Emily called last night.

92
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:36,146
And now you're giving me the message?

93
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:42,778
Turns out that Emily is
just crazy about Susan.

94
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,697
They're going
to the theater together.

95
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,200
They're going to dinner.

96
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,411
They're going horseback riding!

97
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:55,457
God, Susan is so fun!

98
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,253
Look, this is just
a little too familiar.

99
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,632
For six months
before Carol and I split up...

100
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:08,011
...all I heard was,
"My friend Susan is so smart."

101
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:13,100
"My friend Susan is so funny.
My friend Susan is so great."

102
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,520
You think something could happen
between Emily and Susan?

103
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,191
Hey, they're going
to the gym together!

104
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,818
Two women...

105
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,612
...stretching!

106
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:30,034
They take a steam, things get playful.
Didn't you see "Personal Best"?

107
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,704
No, but I'm gonna!

108
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,666
Hi! You're crazy.

109
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,709
Emily is straight.

110
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,298
How do you know?
We thought Carol was straight.

111
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:48,927
Yeah, definitely.
I don't like the name Ross.

112
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,016
What a weird way to kick me
when I'm down!

113
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:58,187
No, I meant for the baby.

114
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,024
What's wrong with Ross?

115
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:07,946
Something like this would never
happen to The Hulk, you know.

116
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,073
That's not true.

117
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:16,413
In "The Incredible Hulk", number 72,
Dr. Bruce Banner found...

118
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,539
You know...

119
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,876
Never mind.
My girlfriend's a lesbian.

120
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,675
I'm definitely going to go
with either Joey or Chandler.

121
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,718
You gotta pick Joey!

122
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,679
Name one famous person
named Chandler.

123
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,889
Raymond Chandler.

124
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,975
Someone you didn't make up.

125
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,479
There are no famous Joeys.
Except for...

126
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,649
...Joey Buttafucco.

127
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,986
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.

128
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,406
How about a compromise then?
What if it's...

129
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,658
...Chan-no-ey?

130
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:56,203
Joey? Think about it.
He'll never be President.

131
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,456
There will never be a President Joey.

132
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,750
I didn't want to bring this up.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,004
Chandler is the stupidest name
I've heard in my life!

134
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,091
It's not a name!
It's barely even a word.

135
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,886
It's like chandelier
but it's not!

136
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:19,643
It's a stupid, stupid, non-name!

137
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:28,985
You're right.
I have a horrible, horrible name.

138
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:34,533
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

139
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:38,203
So I guess it's Joey then.

140
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,297
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.

141
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:52,801
Please! Cooking soothes me.

142
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,973
So dig in!

143
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:02,602
It all looks so good.

144
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,230
Oh, my God.

145
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,941
I know.
My God, this rice is so...

146
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,611
I am so good!

147
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,113
Behind you.

148
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:18,410
They used to live here,
and sometimes they migrate back over.

149
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,372
Is there some way
that they could not be here?

150
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:27,002
Farm birds really
kind of freak me out!

151
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,633
Here we go.

152
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:39,098
There you go!

153
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:50,776
Hey! How'd you do that?

154
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,238
All gone.

155
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,156
So, farm birds, huh?

156
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,159
It's my only weird thing, I swear.

157
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:04,789
I would have told you.
I didn't know that they'd be here.

158
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,423
Can I serve you a little...

159
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:14,925
What?

160
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,134
Nothing.

161
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:21,015
It's just that I know
that they're still out there.

162
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,309
They're across the hall.
That's two doors away.

163
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,940
It'll take them a long time
to peck their way back over here.

164
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,735
That's not funny.

165
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:38,908
Would you feel better
if we went someplace else?

166
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,994
We could pack this stuff up
and go to your apartment.

167
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,330
They're working on it.
It's a mess.

168
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:49,335
I'm staying at my parents' house.
We could go there.

169
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,129
They're out of town.

170
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,966
It's a huge place,
and it's got this gorgeous view.

171
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,176
It'd be very romantic.

172
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:03,349
- What do you say?
- Yeah, that works.

173
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:08,145
They can smell the fear.

174
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,274
How's Ben?

175
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,735
I asked if he wanted to eat.
He said no.

176
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,321
I asked if he wanted to sleep.
He said no.

177
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,365
I asked what he wanted to do.
He said no.

178
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,911
So he's sweeping.

179
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,083
Any word from Susan?

180
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:33,921
She said she's having
so much fun with Emily.

181
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:39,385
By the by, did it
ever occur to you that...

182
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:43,681
...maybe they might be having
a little too much fun?

183
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,182
What's too much fun?

184
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,937
The kind of fun you and Susan had
when we were married.

185
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,314
Oh, my God!
You are so paranoid.

186
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,024
Am I?

187
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,067
Am I?

188
00:12:56,318 --> 00:13:00,405
Susan is in a loving,
committed relationship.

189
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,325
Carol, so were we.

190
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,411
Just imagine for a moment...

191
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:10,249
...that Susan meets someone,
and they hit it off.

192
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:14,920
They're coming back from the theater,
and they stop at a pub for drinks.

193
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,422
They're laughing.

194
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:20,676
Someone innocently
touches someone else.

195
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,302
There's electricity.

196
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,388
It's new. It's exciting.

197
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,142
Are you saying there isn't
the slightest possibility...

198
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:31,770
...of something happening?

199
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,188
- Maybe.
- Oh, my God!

200
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:38,443
I didn't really believe it
until you just said it!

201
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:47,410
None of the other kids believed me,
but I swear that duck pushed me.

202
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,621
This place is fabulous!

203
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,666
This is the downstairs living room.

204
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,626
There's two living rooms?

205
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:59,423
Growing up here, this place
must have been a real babe magnet.

206
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:03,177
It would have been,
but my parents just moved here.

207
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:06,847
You should know this place
is a real babe magnet.

208
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:10,142
Want to make out?

209
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,896
Why don't I put the food
in the fridge...

210
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,566
...and we can eat it later?

211
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,776
That sounds like a plan.

212
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,905
Is there a place
that I could go freshen up?

213
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:29,161
Just down the hall
and second door to your left.

214
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,749
- Hi, darling.
- What are you doing here?

215
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,879
- We cut the trip short.
- France sucks!

216
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,716
This may be a little weird,
but I've got a date here.

217
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:43,967
Say no more.

218
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,638
We'll grab some food, go upstairs
and be out of your hair.

219
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,474
That'd be great.
So you didn't get to Italy?

220
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,353
Yep. Sucks!

221
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,252
Hi, you!

222
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,213
Oh, my God!

223
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:26,093
I know. I can do more than cook.

224
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,853
I like her. She seems smart.

225
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:42,234
Rachel, my parents.

226
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:46,071
So nice to meet you.

227
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:53,621
Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

228
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:58,500
What, this? Oh, no.
That's not what it is.

229
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,044
Okay, I work in fashion.

230
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:05,341
And this is a real dress, actually.

231
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,843
They're wearing it in Milan.

232
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:12,222
Part of my job is to wear the clothes
and see how people respond.

233
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:17,644
Then I report back to my superiors
at Bloomingdale's.

234
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,188
Obviously, in this case...

235
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,983
...I am going to report back:

236
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,903
"U.S.A. Not ready."

237
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,114
Maybe in L.A.

238
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,365
There you go!

239
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,409
Have you kids eaten yet?

240
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:37,330
We were going to do that after.
I mean, next.

241
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:41,794
Why don't we all
get something to eat?

242
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:49,009
No use wasting this baby
just lying around the house.

243
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,011
So we'll go eat.

244
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,138
You'll wear that.

245
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:58,226
We'll be eating and,
of course, you'll be wearing that.

246
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,313
I am sorry about what I said.

247
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:05,358
Nope, you're right.
It is a ridiculous name!

248
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,401
It's not bad.

249
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,737
Yes, it is!

250
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:13,450
From now on, I have no first name.

251
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:17,621
You're just Bing?

252
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,416
I have no name.

253
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,210
So what are we supposed to call you?

254
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,172
Okay, for now, temporarily,
you can call me...

255
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,841
...Clint.

256
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:33,137
No way are you cool enough
to pull off "Clint".

257
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,599
What name am I
cool enough to pull off?

258
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,226
Gene.

259
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:41,645
It's Clint.

260
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,147
It's Clint!

261
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,067
Bye, Gene.

262
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,779
It's Clint!

263
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:56,618
What's up with Gene?

264
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,373
You wore your nightie to dinner?

265
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:05,335
The best part was when the waiter
spilled water down my back.

266
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:09,965
I jumped up and my boob popped out.

267
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,136
It's all right.
I got nice boobs.

268
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,639
I just picked up
a message from Emily.

269
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,935
She and Susan are going
to a poetry reading together.

270
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,270
So?

271
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,355
Poetry?

272
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,650
Susan's gay.

273
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,986
They're being gay together!

274
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,154
Emily's straight.

275
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:35,908
Oh, wake up!

276
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,953
Carol really messed you up.

277
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,497
Excuse me?

278
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:45,751
She turned you into
this untrusting, crazy, jealous...

279
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,587
...sycophant!

280
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:55,260
So I don't know what "sycophant" means,
but the rest is right.

281
00:18:55,511 --> 00:19:00,599
What are you talking about?
I am not a crazy, jealous person.

282
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,102
She's right.

283
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:08,232
When we were together, you got upset
about Mark, and there was nothing.

284
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,650
This makes sense.

285
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,402
It does not!

286
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,238
In high school,
you weren't jealous at all...

287
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:18,993
...even though all your girlfriends
cheated on you.

288
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,204
So up until '92, '93,
he was very trusting.

289
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:27,334
Then '94 hit, Carol left him,
and bam! Paranoid City!

290
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,919
Absolutely!

291
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,837
This is so fun!

292
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:34,550
This is not fun!

293
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,261
All we're trying to say is...

294
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:43,225
...don't let what happened with Carol
ruin what you've got with Emily.

295
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:47,020
The '92 Ross wouldn't.

296
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:55,237
I still think I was right
about that Mark thing.

297
00:19:55,487 --> 00:20:00,283
Well, you know what?
I hope Emily is a lesbian.

298
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,374
Drumroll.

299
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,627
All right.

300
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,004
Help!

301
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,841
Am I a Mark or a John?

302
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,177
You're not tall enough to be a Mark.

303
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:23,432
But you might make a good Barney.

304
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,975
Look, I am serious.

305
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,477
Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm going
to the courthouse.

306
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,313
You're going through with this?

307
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,066
This name has held me back
my entire life.

308
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:36,195
It's why kids picked on me
and why I never do well with women.

309
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:41,742
So tomorrow, I'll either be
Mark Johnson or John Markson.

310
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:46,371
You've got problems because of you,
not your name!

311
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:50,626
This has got to stop!
Chandler is a great name.

312
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,879
In fact...

313
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,134
I'm sorry, I know you wanted me
to name the baby Joey.

314
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:04,431
I'm going to name the baby Chandler.

315
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:06,850
Really?

316
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,185
But you have to keep the name too.

317
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,563
Okay, thanks!

318
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,941
You want to hug it out?

319
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:21,657
I'm going to go tell
Frank and Alice right now!

320
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,284
Bye, Pheebs!

321
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:48,809
- Nice luggage.
- I was going to say.

322
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,731
I missed you too.

323
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:59,987
- Thanks, I had a great time.
- So did I.

324
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,741
No tongue.
