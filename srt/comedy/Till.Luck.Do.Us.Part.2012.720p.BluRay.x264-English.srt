1
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,645
-Hey, Adelson!
-My man, Tino!

2
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,730
-Give me the usual.
-Thanks.

3
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,653
-Hey guvnor!
-Hi Tino.

4
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,668
-Let's eat?Let's eat?
-Honey, I'm home!

5
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,753
-You're here early, Tino!
-Yeah, well. I..

6
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,214
My only client cancelled
his workout.

7
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,382
But he paid, right!

8
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,761
Saved our light bill and dinner.

9
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,680
Yummy.

10
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:48,145
Hi baby, my little princess. Hi.

11
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,982
Want some more, huh?

12
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,777
Honey, I think she's got a little
surprise for you in her diapers.

13
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,155
Tino, it's not her, it's you.

14
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,781
Jeez, sure is.

15
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,783
My little princess
is smelling sweet,

16
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,579
ready to give her mommy some luck,
huh, TetÃ©?

17
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,414
-Aww, <i>the</i> lottery <i>again, honey?
-One hundred million reais.</i>

18
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,708
Aww honey, it's accumulated.
One hundred million.

19
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,419
Doesn't cost anything
to dream, you know.

20
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,713
Look, they're beginning.

21
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,631
<i>Number thirty-seven.</i>

22
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,468
Honey, I got the first one.

23
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,303
<i>Fifty-eight.</i>

24
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,721
Honey, two!

25
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,724
Great baby, you've set
a new record!

26
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,728
<i>And the third number is nine.</i>

27
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,772
Three, love!

28
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,607
Four!

29
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,775
Four?

30
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,067
Four!

31
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,110
Four?

32
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:37,736
Four!

33
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,278
Four?

34
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,779
Four!

35
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,488
Four?

36
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,655
Four, honey!

37
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,239
Four!

38
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,618
Four! Four! Four!
Four! Four! Four! Four!

39
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,619
Fifty-four.

40
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,330
The fifth! The fifth!
The fifth! The fifth!

41
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,540
One more! One more!
What's your number honey?

42
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,209
Thirteen!

43
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,460
Go Thirteen! Come on Thirteen!

44
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,628
<i>...worth one hundred million reais.</i>

45
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,507
Thirteen! Thirteen! Thirteen!
Thirteen! Thirteen! Thirteen!

46
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,513
<i>And, the number is: thirteen!</i>

47
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,365
UNTIL LUCK DO US PART

48
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,493
<i>Whatever happens,</i>

49
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,829
<i>we're always going
to trust one another.</i>

50
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,123
And not let this money
change us, OK?

51
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,709
You promise?

52
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,713
We'll always be our same selves.

53
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,675
I promise, Tino.

54
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,554
15 years later

55
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,350
CALL ME! GUILHERME

56
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,737
Good morning, Dona Matilde.

57
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,738
Good morning, senhor Tino.

58
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,740
Hi honey.

59
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,201
A nice breakfast...

60
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,218
So, you'll change mine?

61
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,386
I'll change yours, honey.

62
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,221
Dad, I want that one.

63
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,780
Son, you remember that
car in the video game?

64
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,285
And this one's just
fantastic! How do I look?

65
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,245
Polish it man.

66
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,706
Hey handsome!

67
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,660
All down the drain!

68
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,291
Beer all around!

69
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:25,296
<i>Tino! Tino! Tino!</i>

70
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,433
That's right, here at home,
Christmas is all year round,

71
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,978
Just help me get this stuff inside.

72
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,231
Here, take these two, there.

73
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,631
The video game is mine, not yours.

74
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,216
It's just for a minute, stingy.

75
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,426
Dad, tell him.

76
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,263
Hold it just a sec...

77
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,225
Listen, you guys have got to
learn to share your things,

78
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,478
Just what I said, tell him dad.

79
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,691
Son, Juninho.
Take daddy's card,

80
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,360
and go buy one for yourself
and left this for your sister.

81
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,112
Wow, alright.

82
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,449
But dad, that's not
learning how to share!

83
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,576
I just can't get any rest.

84
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,495
It sure is learning how to share.

85
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,663
The card is mine and I share
it with whoever I want.

86
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,372
No way.

87
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,665
Oh, look, it's ringing...

88
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,792
ALARM AMAURY

89
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,670
I've got things to do, honey,
excuse me, daddy's got to go.

90
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:03,686
Hello.

91
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,188
<i>Hey, neighbor!</i>

92
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,566
How's it going, man?

93
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,609
What's up, Faustino.

94
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,277
<i>I was just thinking,</i>

95
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,738
wouldn't you like
to come over for a barbecue, huh?

96
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,742
Barbecue, pool, drinks,
take a little break.

97
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,704
Tino, thank you for your
invitation, but I've got to work.

98
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,414
Again? Bad news man,

99
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:27,627
<i>days like these are good
for lazing around.</i>

100
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,171
Sloth is a sin,
did you know that?

101
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,090
Yeah, and envy too, right?

102
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,558
<i>Honey!</i>

103
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,184
What kind of soap opera is this?

104
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,187
Who would treat their
mother like that?

105
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,439
It's because
she was poor and got rich,

106
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,567
and now
she's ashamed of her mother.

107
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,444
They make it look like whoever
gets rich mistreats their family.

108
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,738
Dona Jane? Your mother,
from Miami.

109
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,615
Aww, let it ring, Jesus.

110
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:02,453
Not like poor folks, honey,
because poverty educates you.

111
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,788
I know what I'm talking about,

112
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,456
I'm not just saying this, no way,

113
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,625
I know what I'm saying,

114
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,003
it's true, I know,
I was poor once myself,

115
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,338
and no big deal,
I could be poor again,

116
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,090
and I wouldn't have any
problem with it at all.

117
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,595
I'm not like those other
futile broads you see, like...

118
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,471
Hi friend!

119
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,348
Hi! Debinha!

120
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,017
Hi honey.

121
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,019
Why, what happened there?

122
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,021
Something's not right there!

123
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,608
A medical error,
two hundred milliliters,

124
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,235
Aren't you going
to get that fixed?

125
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,238
Of course I am, it's just that my
lawyer told me to wait, you know?

126
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,366
Because he said I'm going to
make a fortune off of this.

127
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,703
And, speaking of fortunes,

128
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,704
how is Faustino?

129
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,664
Working like crazy, honey.

130
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,252
Way to go kid!

131
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,129
Hey!

132
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,505
Nice!

133
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,382
Great.

134
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,383
You got the idea.

135
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,177
Now you're pumping.

136
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,723
Tino, no way man.

137
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,059
What? You wanted a piece?

138
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,185
No, Tino.

139
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,686
Tino, you shouldn't even be here.

140
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,063
What are you doing here anyway?

141
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:14,150
Listen, Nelsinho,
I own this place too, right?

142
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,529
We need a partner who is like
this, look, like us, you get me?

143
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:23,159
But, I am like you guys.
I'm old Tino from...

144
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,621
Sure miss those days!

145
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,208
I'm the same old Tino,
and besides,

146
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,753
I bet I can still lift more
weight than you two.

147
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,420
When getting out of bed?

148
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,674
Exactly. When I get out... hey!

149
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:42,470
I used to knock you out on the
treadmill, and I still can,

150
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,554
you wanta bet?

151
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,764
Your part of the gym.

152
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,726
I don't have
to prove nothing to nobody.

153
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,563
Ahh, chickening out, fatso?

154
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,315
Nobody calls me fatso.

155
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,110
Tino, are you sure you
want to do this, man?

156
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,738
Listen bro, let's do it,

157
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,490
I'm not even going to
put on sneakers,

158
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,200
it'd make it too easy.

159
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,328
Listen man,
I know what I'm doing.

160
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,705
Let's go!

161
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,496
What?

162
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,622
What is it?

163
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,707
What was my time?

164
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,791
Three minutes on the treadmill.

165
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:54,625
Yeah?

166
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,169
Yeah, and twenty on the floor.

167
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,050
Tino, it doesn't have
to be like this, right?

168
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,717
Let me tell you something,

169
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,428
this gym here is going
to miss me more

170
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,055
than I'm going to miss it, right?

171
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,806
This here, for me, is crumbs.

172
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,558
How much does this place
make a month?

173
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,976
Fifty, sixty grand?

174
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,144
Six hundred.

175
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,313
Lot's of crumbs, I'd say,

176
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,398
but, I could care less,

177
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:19,442
screw it!

178
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,568
I don't need this place for nothing.

179
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,819
And besides, I have to go.

180
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,737
Hey, honey!

181
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,322
No way, you don't have
to pay the bill, go on.

182
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,782
This is stupid, stop it.

183
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,408
Hold it, Nelsinho, you crazy?

184
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,202
He's going to pay,
he eats too much.

185
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,787
Nelsinho, I'm talking to Nelsinho,

186
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,412
I'm talking to Nelsinho.

187
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,664
Nelsinho, I insist on paying.

188
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,792
Here honey, OK, OK?

189
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,210
What's wrong?

190
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,670
Your card was cancelled.

191
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,589
What? My card, refused?

192
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,673
Are you crazy? My card...

193
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,217
I've never had a card
refused in my life, honey.

194
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,343
But this one was.

195
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,677
Forget it, Tino, forget it,
you're not paying.

196
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,972
Nelson! Nelson, formally now,

197
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,557
we're here, signing a contract.

198
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,600
Nelson, I insist,

199
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:56,437
I'm not leaving till
I pay every cent.

200
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,231
Use this card then, please.

201
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,109
What is it now, huh?

202
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,443
No credit.

203
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,362
Smiling, are you, huh?

204
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,030
Well then honey,
take your pick here,

205
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,615
let's try another card.

206
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,576
If there's one thing I have,
it's credit cards.

207
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:15,123
I've got them in black,
gold, silver, purple...

208
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,459
I've got a whole rainbow
of cards here, OK?

209
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,336
Rainbow! You know
what a rainbow is?

210
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,463
Refused.

211
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,257
Refused.

212
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:24,841
Refused.

213
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,386
Refused, and, refused.

214
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,597
Just a minute.

215
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,017
CALL ME! GUILHERME.

216
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,477
Guilherme, what's going on here?

217
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,396
I tried to use my credit cards
and they're all maxed out.

218
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,148
Dona LÃºcia that's fine
for now, please.

219
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,607
Excuse me,
I have to hang up.

220
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,067
How are you,
senhor Faustino?

221
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,152
I'm just fine, just fine.

222
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:48,739
Please, sit down,
we have to talk.

223
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,741
No, we have to settle this, right,
Guilherme, settle this.

224
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,075
What's going on?

225
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,077
Listen, I had a credit card
refused once.

226
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,289
One, but fourteen?
Is this some kind of joke?

227
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,290
A lack of respect.

228
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,501
Let me tell you,
I even felt like I was poor.

229
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,505
Faustino,
your account is in the red.

230
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,508
You're kidding, right?

231
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,302
No, I'm not.

232
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,263
I could have done a couple
extravagant things, OK,

233
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,557
spent more than I should
have, once or twice,

234
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,517
small excesses, right?

235
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,311
But, spend it all?

236
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,437
Let me tell you
something my friend:

237
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,399
Nobody is able to spend
one hundred million reais, no way!

238
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,776
Well, you did.

239
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,112
HOW?

240
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,114
You really want to know?

241
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,703
Five trips per year,

242
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,790
spending an average of 2 hundred
thousand dollars each one.

243
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,668
But, trips are culture,
right, Guilherme.

244
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,462
Yeah, all of them to Disney.

245
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,671
Yeah, I like Mickey, I really do.

246
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,675
Two million for a sailboat
to go round the world.

247
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,720
The Schijrmann family does it.

248
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,805
You sunk the boat
in half an hour.

249
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,474
Because of some big rock,

250
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,019
And, no insurance.

251
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,813
Nobody had told me about
the insurance,

252
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,815
how we needed it,
it wasn't in the manual, I...

253
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,193
You bought out
all of Rock in Rio

254
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,111
for your 30th birthday.

255
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,197
Thirty years old, man,
that's historical,

256
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,199
a couple friends,
what's wrong with that?

257
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,828
Only you invited Hulk and
lvete Sangalo to liven up the place.

258
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,581
They let me pay in installments.

259
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,833
Your cotton wedding anniversary

260
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,753
at the Chantilly Castle, in France,

261
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,214
for three hundred guests.

262
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,466
Ronaldinho FenÃ³meno
did the same thing

263
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,634
and nobody said anything.

264
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,720
Three hundred thousand
dollars per year

265
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,722
on zero gravity flights.

266
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,850
But, that was a dream of mine,
Guilherme,

267
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,769
can you imagine,
to fly, it's amazing.

268
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:52,655
Faustino, lottery winners
lose fortunes,

269
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:56,033
everyday, around the world.
It's not unusual.

270
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,536
But, unhappily,

271
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,540
the bank isn't going
to be able to do anything for you.

272
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:03,624
Great...

273
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,627
Faustino, don't worry.

274
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,629
I called in a big friend of mine,

275
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,048
who works with
an investment company,

276
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,258
to help you.

277
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,511
He should be getting
here any moment now,

278
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,387
Amauri?

279
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,680
Amauri!

280
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,265
Guilherme.

281
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,393
-You?
-You?

282
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,271
You know each other?
That's great!

283
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,400
No way.
This guy is my neighbor.

284
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,194
I know,
I wanted somebody close by.

285
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,154
But, that's not all,
there's something much worse,

286
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,655
something above and beyond that.

287
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:35,698
What?

288
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,825
The guy's a jerk.

289
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,703
Hey, I'm still here!

290
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,455
I know.

291
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,082
Faustino, please.

292
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,585
You got any cookies?
To go with the coffee?

293
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,299
Amauri, I need your help,

294
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,718
the board is on my back.

295
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,723
You let the guy hang himself
and then you go looking

296
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,476
for somebody to get rid of the body,
I know how that works, Guilherme.

297
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,685
No way.

298
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,730
I would never
deny doing you a favor,

299
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,315
you've always helped me,

300
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,691
but I just can't help you here.

301
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,734
I'm not going to help this guy.

302
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,825
You won't or you
just don't know how?

303
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,335
I didn't find any cookies.

304
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,511
Listen, Tino, I'm not happy
with this situation at all.

305
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,596
Yeah, and I'm jumping for joy,
really.

306
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,597
Yeah, but for your own good,

307
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,640
we're going to have to get
along with each other.

308
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,767
Listen, Amauri,
I ain't no kid, OK?

309
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,643
I know how to take care
of myself,

310
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,520
without anybody having to
tell me what I have to do.

311
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,614
You come by car?
Can I get a lift?

312
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,622
<i>Faustino, I'm going
to need your financial</i>

313
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,790
<i>records for the
last three years.</i>

314
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,624
<i>Forget it.</i>

315
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,792
<i>Tino, you're going
to have to collaborate.</i>

316
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,378
There are five steps
to get rich:

317
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,212
I could give a shit.

318
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,798
Organization, planning,

319
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,677
equilibrium, security, investment.

320
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:22,805
It's all here.

321
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:34,400
Amauri, what you got a
doll in your car for, huh?

322
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,194
To keep robbers away.

323
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,823
Really? The doll works for
SWAT or something?

324
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,534
No.

325
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,413
Surveys indicate that 62%
of car thieves

326
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,207
avoid cars with kids
in the backseat.

327
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,712
I'd rather have my
car stolen, really.

328
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:59,216
That doll is horrible.
It looks like the son of Chuck.

329
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,678
Numbers don't lie, Tino.

330
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,598
And besides, from the outside,
it look like a real kid.

331
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,434
Yeah, but up close he
looks just like Chuck.

332
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:09,727
I get this feeling it's
going to jump me at any

333
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,063
moment with a knife
in his hand and...

334
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,067
He's not Chuck.

335
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:21,238
But he looks alike like him,
must be related.

336
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,615
Yeah, but he's not Chuck.

337
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,449
That doll is evil, for sure.

338
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,117
No, it isn't Chuck.

339
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,827
No way, let me tell you.

340
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,830
Got you nervous, huh?

341
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,756
OK. First step:

342
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,009
you're going inside and
tell your family the truth.

343
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:42,635
The truth?

344
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,096
Yeah. You're going to tell
them you were negligent,

345
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,849
how you squandered your money,
were irresponsible,

346
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,393
that you are bankrupt,
you failed them and

347
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,478
that you are all going to
have to tighten your belts.

348
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,270
That's all?

349
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,482
Yeah. Why?

350
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,275
You can't do that?

351
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,278
Good night, Amauri.

352
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:09,495
Amauri, what were those five
steps again in the book, huh?

353
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,540
Organization, planning,

354
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,625
equilibrium, investment,

355
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,293
what was the fifth one again, huh?

356
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,755
Tino, grow up.
You're broke.

357
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,053
Squanderer my ass.

358
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,448
No way.

359
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,333
Surprise!

360
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,543
What's this?

361
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,419
What is going on...

362
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,796
What is this all about?

363
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,048
Take it easy, honey,

364
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,967
it's just a little get-together.

365
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,553
You now, like, on the spot.

366
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,556
But... a little get-together, Jane?

367
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,682
Just a minute honey,

368
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,684
turn on the music everybody,
for God's sake.

369
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,059
No, don't turn on the music,
hold it!

370
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:14,685
Turn it up.

371
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:15,686
What's the party for?

372
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,688
-To celebrate what?
-Celebrate what?

373
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,357
The day we met my love.

374
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,442
Ohh, the day we...

375
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,193
How long ago?
Sixteen years.

376
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,695
Six years, sixteen years.

377
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,364
Sixteen years ago,
I love you.

378
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,115
Sixteen years, me too.

379
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:28,699
I love you.

380
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:28,824
I love you too, love,
I love you.

381
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,825
I love you too, love,

382
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:30,701
I love you too.

383
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,746
But, honey,
are you sure you

384
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,582
didn't exaggerate a bit, huh?

385
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,750
Tino, honestly,

386
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,084
you're not acting
like my old Tino.

387
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:39,585
Why?

388
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,379
Because you,
for much less,

389
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,091
threw a mega party just because
your team won the championship.

390
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,595
I'm Botafogo,
it doesn't happen everyday, right?

391
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,596
It's very rare.

392
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,348
Lobster.

393
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,432
I'm going to go fill up.

394
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,600
Right, go fill up honey.

395
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,225
I love you.

396
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,605
I love you too, only just take
it easy because... Jane...

397
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,107
Hi, Faustino, hi, Faustino,
congratulations!

398
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,275
Oh, thanks.

399
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,152
What? I'm sorry.

400
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,780
What happened there?

401
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,614
This here?

402
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:08,781
Yeah.

403
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,493
It was, an error.
An error, a medical error.

404
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,036
A big error for sure.

405
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,038
Jane invited both of them,
I guess, huh?

406
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,428
Bye Bia, see you tomorrow.

407
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,304
Bye!

408
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,433
Nasdaq!

409
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,770
Down!

410
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,397
Let go, let go!
You bad dog!

411
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,815
Do something!

412
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,650
Look what he's doing!

413
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,318
He's going to tear it.

414
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,697
Let go, Nasdaq!

415
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,701
I'm sorry,
this is all I could save.

416
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,473
Hey, Juninho, 3D for everybody,
is that it?

417
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,183
How much did all this cost, huh?

418
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,728
Aww dad, I don't know.

419
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,689
My God,
I'm creating a congressman.

420
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,570
Amauri, another party
at the neighbor's.

421
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,572
The last royal ball.

422
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,574
Oh yeah? Why's that?

423
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,324
Forget it.

424
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:39,621
And us? Let's have our
own little party?

425
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:48,714
Oh no, I just found out that
I have to correct a statement...

426
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,592
What was that for, Laura?

427
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,594
You don't fool me, Amauri.

428
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,720
Fool you?

429
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,348
You're the one who's doing
everything you can to get pregnant.

430
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:03,771
Aww, Amauri,
you're being unfair...

431
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,524
your favorite brand.

432
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,490
Come here.

433
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,432
Don't blame me if
it's a lousy brand.

434
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,768
Forget it, Laura.

435
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,438
Aww, Amauri...

436
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,024
Amauri, our son is
already 15 years old,

437
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:53,070
there's still time for
me to have another one.

438
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,406
Laura, we haven't even
paid for the house yet,

439
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,283
Bruno will be going to
college in three years,

440
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,952
we don't have any money
set aside for a rainy day.

441
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:00,786
No.

442
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,540
No Amauri, don't start on
that again, no way.

443
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,668
OK then, I'll just give
you one number.

444
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,044
Seventy.

445
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:09,962
Seventy what?

446
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:14,216
Seventy percent of all couples get a
divorce after their second child.

447
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,676
Think about that.

448
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:19,429
Right. So I'll give you another
number: thirty-seven.

449
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,556
Thirty-seven what?

450
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:25,060
Years old!
I'm thirty-seven, Amauri!

451
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,355
I don't have
a whole lifetime to wait.

452
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,441
My inner clock is ticking away,
and it isn't stopping.

453
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,569
Think about that.

454
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,993
Attention everyone,
let me see what is

455
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,495
happening here, with
this microphone...

456
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,623
well, I would like
to thank you all for

457
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,710
coming here
to my and Tina's party.

458
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,086
Thank you.

459
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,380
Today, me and Tino, we...

460
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,717
we've been married
now for 16 years.

461
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,512
And this party is to celebrate
this special moment.

462
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,264
This wonderful moment.

463
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:06,685
And I'd like to say that...
that I love you so much, honey,

464
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:10,105
and that you're the
best husband in the world.

465
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,611
The best husband, the best father,
the best friend,

466
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:20,115
the man who has always
been standing by my side.

467
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,660
It's true, really.
All these years.

468
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,413
In which we've always
had everything we ever needed,

469
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,123
affection most of all.

470
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,708
Oh, I'm so nervous!

471
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,796
You are the man I love,

472
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,673
the love of my life, Tino.

473
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,761
Thank you so much.

474
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,512
Long live us.

475
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:44,765
Viva!

476
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,650
Good evening.

477
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,694
How's it going, Tino?

478
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,695
Here, take this.

479
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,697
That's all I've got.

480
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,742
How'd your family react?

481
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:07,329
They didn't, funny isn't it?

482
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,456
You know
why they didn't react?

483
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,293
Because I didn't tell them.
I didn't tell them.

484
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,087
You have to tell them, Tino.

485
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,464
Look, Amauri,
let me tell you something,

486
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,340
I don't want to argue.

487
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,593
Right this moment, at home,

488
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,596
there's a party going on.

489
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,098
Interesting, huh?

490
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:31,353
People,
because the other half didn't come.

491
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,190
So, it just wasn't the right moment
to say anything tonight.

492
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,359
But, I promise you:

493
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,779
first thing tomorrow.

494
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,491
Poor?
What do you mean, poor?

495
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,076
Poor, like with no money.

496
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,577
Broke.

497
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,745
Let me get this straight,

498
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,623
you're telling me that you
spent all of our money?

499
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,208
The money
I won in the lottery?

500
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,210
We spent, Jane, we...

501
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,753
But, no big deal, honey,

502
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,796
no problem, no sweat,

503
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,215
you always told me
you weren't afraid

504
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,384
of being poor
again one day, right?

505
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,721
Of course, because I never
thought we'd be poor again,

506
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,515
I don't want to be poor,
you understand?

507
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,517
I've forgotten what
it's like being poor.

508
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,728
No way! Nobody ever forgets
what it's like being poor.

509
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,771
Being poor is like
riding a bicycle.

510
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,649
Of course, because bicycles
are for poor people.

511
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,776
Listen here, do you have
life insurance?

512
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,527
Yeah.

513
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,654
With me and the kids
as beneficiaries?

514
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,239
We both do, why?

515
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,992
Does it cover murder?

516
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,661
Hold it Jane, for God's sake,
I'm your husband.

517
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,663
So? I'll get another one.

518
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,374
I'm still pretty sexy.
God bless silicone!

519
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,792
But, I'm your lovey-dovey.

520
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,128
So start running,
lovey-dovey.

521
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,009
Faustino, Faustino,

522
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,552
you want
to scare me to death?

523
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,429
You want to kill me,

524
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,181
you want to kill me!

525
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,390
For God's sake, Faustino,

526
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,808
why would I want
to kill you for?

527
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,687
Why? Oh, nothing, nothing,

528
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,772
nothing, forget it.

529
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,440
Delete it, just delete it.

530
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,068
Let's get some rest, huh?

531
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,819
Sorry, let's get some rest.

532
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,697
Try to calm down, honey,

533
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,824
get some rest,

534
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,659
Yeah, great.

535
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,580
Auction?

536
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,792
ART AUCTION

537
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,423
Dad, give me money
for ice-cream?

538
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,716
How much is it, huh?

539
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,677
Huh? What kind of question
is that dad?

540
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,721
What's wrong,
can't I ask how much it cost?

541
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,723
You act like I never asked for
the price of anything before.

542
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,682
No, you haven't.

543
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,810
You're acting weird dad.

544
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,811
I don't even feel like
ice-cream anymore.

545
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,313
Not me, I want one,
give me the money.

546
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,567
Bring me a coconut Popsicle.

547
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,322
Amauri.

548
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,698
Hi, Amauri, what's up.

549
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,492
Tino, where are you?

550
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,202
I'm at an... auction.

551
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,497
You're where? An auction?

552
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,084
Tino, you can't
spend one more cent,

553
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,085
do you understand?

554
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,462
I know Amauri,
but my wife doesn't know.

555
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,714
So, I think you'd better
tell her quick,

556
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,717
<i>because your situation is
a lot worse than you think.</i>

557
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,345
<i>You're not only down to zero,
you owe money.</i>

558
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,263
<i>And lots of it.</i>

559
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,474
<i>You're probably going to have
to sell lots of your things.</i>

560
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,518
But, in the meantime,
do me a favor:

561
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,769
Don't spend
any more money.

562
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,855
Not one cent,
you get me?

563
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,733
Our next item is a very
delicate piece,

564
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,361
a rare collector's item.

565
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:30,740
An Imperial Persian Kahr rug from
the early twentieth century,

566
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,411
made by master rug
maker Abu Zahid...

567
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,745
I have to tell you something,

568
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,122
very important.

569
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,248
Not now, baby,

570
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,749
just look at that
scandalous rug!

571
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,042
I could care less
about the rug,

572
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,794
I don't even want to know
how much it costs.

573
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,546
Only ninety thousand.

574
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,131
Ninety thousand?

575
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,010
Ninety thousand for a rug, why?
Is it a flying rug by any chance?

576
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,137
The gentleman bids ninety-five.

577
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,805
What you talking about, buddy?
This some joke?

578
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,183
Oh honey,
I don't think this rug is

579
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,018
all that special,
no need to bid.

580
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,144
But, I didn't.

581
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,562
One hundred thousand
for the gentleman.

582
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,688
Listen buddy,
you don't understand,

583
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,439
when I do like this...

584
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,149
One hundred and five
for the gentleman.

585
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,984
For God's sake,
somebody make a bid,

586
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,653
Look at the rug from Yemen,
all the way from Yemen.

587
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,654
I'll give one hundred and six.

588
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,573
One hundred and six, great.

589
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,783
I'll give one hundred and fifty!

590
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,785
Why? Why bid that?

591
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,329
You didn't like the rug,

592
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,413
why bid more?

593
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,664
I didn't like
the rug all that much,

594
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,791
but I didn't like the looks
of that old hag even more.

595
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,168
I'll give one hundred fifty-one.

596
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,711
Way to go, old hag!

597
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,795
I'll give two hundred.

598
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,713
Two hundred, but why,

599
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,798
two hundred thousand
for a rug, guys?

600
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,176
Honey, what is wrong with you?
You're acting very weird.

601
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,303
Honey, I've got to talk
to you right now!

602
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,596
I can't right now.

603
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,722
Yes you can.

604
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,307
What is the gentleman's offer?

605
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,184
I'll offer you a smack in the face.

606
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,311
Two hundred thousand for a rug,

607
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,188
you gotta be out of your mind.

608
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,189
Are you crazy?

609
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,066
They're still going to
auction the vase I want.

610
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,318
Jane, honey, I have to tell
you something right now.

611
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,196
Just a moment.
I feel kinda dizzy,

612
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,489
I don't know what it is.

613
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,990
I stood up too quick inside.

614
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,116
My pressure must have dropped.

615
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,619
Wait, let me talk first,
then you can feel bad, OK, Jane?

616
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,622
Our family,
constituted with so much love, isn't...

617
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,331
Water.

618
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,334
Water? You want water?
OK, but in a plastic cup.

619
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,126
What can I do?

620
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,086
OK, I'll get you it.

621
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:06,836
My.

622
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:12,175
Honey, you are a warrior,
a woman full of spirit,

623
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,428
a woman that won't let
any old thing knock her down?

624
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,846
So, honey...

625
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,139
Jane?

626
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,275
Senhor Faustino.
Please come with me.

627
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,490
Mom!

628
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,200
Hi, kids.

629
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,410
Hi, honey...

630
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,744
And so? You feel alright?

631
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,207
Yes honey, I'm alright, just fine.

632
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,625
Thank God, honey,
you gave us a fright.

633
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,459
It was nothing.

634
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,713
Nothing, no.
She has news.

635
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,464
What news?

636
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,096
I'm pregnant.

637
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,765
What?!

638
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,522
What is it, honey?

639
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,773
It's happiness.

640
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,195
Mommy is pregnant.

641
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,744
Mommy is...

642
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,750
Mommy is pregnant.

643
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,506
Mommy is... mommy is...

644
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,508
And I'll set up my lipo
at the same time,

645
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,760
because when I get pregnant

646
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,720
I usually put on a couple pounds,
right honey?

647
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:39,095
What do you think?

648
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:39,512
What do I think?

649
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,473
You happy?

650
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,724
So HAPPY-

651
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:48,563
Look at me, look.
I'm, I'm...

652
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,733
Perfect timing...
fits like a glove.

653
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,526
-A glove, like...
-I knew it!

654
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,153
...in the middle of my head.

655
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,240
I'm going outside,
I'm a little...

656
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,117
I need some air,

657
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,495
I'll be outside,
to celebrate.

658
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,038
OK, give me a kiss, honey.

659
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,081
A kiss here.

660
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,082
A kiss honey.

661
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,799
It's like normal,
he is very effusive.

662
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,051
Oh, my God.

663
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:23,556
My wife is pregnant,
dear God.

664
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,730
My wife is pregnant.

665
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:36,820
Why? Why?

666
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,240
Senhor Faustino,
could I have a word with you?

667
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,158
Right.

668
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,582
I talked to your wife,
she and the baby are alright.

669
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,375
Thank God.

670
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,585
But, she's sort of exaggerated
with her plastic surgeries.

671
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,337
Twenty-eight, twenty-eight.

672
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,422
Right, senhor Faustino,

673
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,673
Tino, just call me Tino.

674
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,175
Tino, I can't hide my concern,

675
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,303
I don't know just what this
has done to her body,

676
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,597
I mean, this could be
a difficult pregnancy,

677
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,142
so I think it would be better
if you avoided any kind of trauma.

678
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,144
Trauma? What trauma?

679
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,603
There is no trauma at all.

680
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,563
Do you see any trauma?

681
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,021
Calm down, no, of course not.

682
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,231
Did anyone say anything
about a trauma to you?

683
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,190
Of course not,
I just mean, like,

684
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,193
bad news, arguments, or...

685
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,611
financial problems...

686
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,615
She needs peace.

687
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,576
For hers and the baby's good.

688
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,119
The baby's?

689
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,287
The baby's most of all.

690
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,621
Me, when I attend to a client,

691
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,373
the first thing I do

692
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:35,044
is try to set them at ease,
make them feel safe..

693
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,421
Amauri, I'm screwed!

694
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:40,049
I'm screwed good this time,
Amauri, totally screwed, Amauri.

695
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,259
Oxygen.

696
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,431
This is not one of our clients.

697
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:47,182
Yes I am!

698
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,099
No you're not.

699
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:48,683
Yes I am.

700
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:59,235
OK. Tino,
the only thing I can say is:

701
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,613
Cut down on expenses.

702
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,158
How, Amauri?
Jane like drains away money.

703
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,327
Look, if Jane were
married to Eike Batista,

704
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,370
he'd be selling coconuts
on the beach in no time.

705
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,080
I can't tell her anything, nothing,

706
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,664
do you get what I mean?

707
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,291
Don't you have any relatives,

708
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,667
who you could ask for help?

709
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,085
No, her mother lives in Miami,

710
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,378
I'm the one who sent her there.

711
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,255
And then there's Uncle Olavinho,

712
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,381
but that guy, let me tell you...

713
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,382
Who is this Olavinho?

714
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,676
Forget him. He's an uncle of
hers who has some money,

715
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,428
but I'm not getting
anywhere near the guy,

716
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:26,721
you understand, no way.

717
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:35,188
OK, then. Tino, I can't
believe I'm going to say this,

718
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,688
What?

719
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,192
Yeah, you just tell her
change.

720
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,778
I'll call the bank,

721
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,738
and ask them to not
cancel her cards just yet.

722
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,406
But only her cards.

723
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,701
You're going to control yourself,
not spend any money,

724
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,329
you'll probably have to
sell some of your things.

725
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,123
She'll understand
later that it was

726
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:58,127
The most important thing now
is to tell your kids.

727
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,797
But, do you think
they'll understand?

728
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:02,715
No harm in trying.

729
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,721
Son, don't scream like that,

730
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:12,058
you'll wake up your mother,
he sure likes to make a scene, huh?

731
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:15,436
I knew this was going to
happen one day. I knew it.

732
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,398
Honey, it isn't
the end of the world.

733
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,525
Just almost.

734
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,736
The important thing right now,

735
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:28,324
is to not let your
mother know anything.

736
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,701
But, dad, she'll notice.

737
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,329
TetÃ©, you're the smartest
one in this house,

738
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,999
if you can't do it,
nobody can.

739
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,169
The smartest?
Father you live me criticizing.

740
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:46,384
Honey, I'm just saying that you
didn't come out anything like me.

741
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:51,347
And, believe me, honey,
that's a compliment.

742
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:57,729
So cancel ballet,
france, only ingles.

743
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:58,688
OK.

744
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,441
Hi.

745
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,483
Hi, Bruno.

746
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,363
I just wanted to apologize
for the other day.

747
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:10,783
I bought you this.

748
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,785
Thanks, but you shouldn't have.

749
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,537
Come on, I'm just
trying to be nice.

750
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,081
You going to get all upset just over
a small bear worth three reais?

751
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,541
Man, the day I was born,

752
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,252
my father was so broke he
had to walk to the hospital

753
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,379
to not pay the three
reais for the bus fare,

754
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,299
which he used
to buy that bear.

755
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,636
My mom said it
was my lucky bear.

756
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,721
Can you buy that back?

757
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:39,562
No, but, look at the good side,
you guys were real lucky.

758
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,314
You're kidding me, right?

759
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,525
I can't believe that
you don't know.

760
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,401
Know what?

761
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,620
Dad, why didn't you tell me?

762
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,039
I made a fool of myself
at school today.

763
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,583
Professional secrecy, son, and,

764
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,170
please, don't go spreading
it around, OK?

765
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,339
Yeah, well thanks for the help.

766
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,425
Son, listen, what your
father is saying is

767
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,428
that their life is theirs
and ours is ours.

768
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,764
We don't have to know about
what happens to them.

769
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,267
Oh yeah, mom? Did you know
that Dona Jane is pregnant?

770
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:28,361
<i>Laura, Laura, Laura!</i>

771
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,780
Laura, don't have a fit, Laura!

772
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,825
You said yourself that they don't
have anything to do with us.

773
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,451
I'm not talking
about them Amauri,

774
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,704
I'm talking about us! Us!

775
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,832
OK, you want to talk about us?

776
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,834
OK then, let's talk about us.

777
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,087
What do you want
to say about us?

778
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,592
She's younger than me!

779
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,055
That's not talking about us.

780
00:41:56,305 --> 00:42:01,144
Amauri, I know that you think you're
the most rational man around,

781
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:07,191
the most intelligent,
but let me tell you,

782
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,736
I envy that family.

783
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,613
They're vulgar, crass,

784
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:18,995
give the worst parties
in the world, but they live.

785
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,499
They have friends at their house,
laugh, have fun.

786
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,377
Their life has nothing
to do with ours,

787
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,672
except for the way in
which they rub it into

788
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,508
our face and show us
how unhappy we are.

789
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,510
Speak for you.

790
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,516
Way to go Tino, nice shot!

791
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,393
Right on man, nice!

792
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,729
Listen, how 'bout paying
a round of drinks for us,

793
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,105
just one, no big deal.

794
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,441
Don't get me wrong...
but stop bumming drinks all the time.

795
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,484
Just one drink, man.

796
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:53,279
No, let me tell you something,

797
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,530
Things aren't easy,

798
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,240
and I'm kinda broke,
you know?

799
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,742
But, then I thought, right?

800
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,369
Like: "Shit, who can help me?
My friends, of course".

801
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,706
What? Where is every...?

802
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,420
Things aren't looking
very good, man.

803
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,632
Couldn't you lend me
some money, huh?

804
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,758
A little cash?

805
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,721
Sure, how much you need, Tino?

806
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:22,308
I don't know,
two, three hundred grand.

807
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,269
Come on Tino, seriously, Tino.

808
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,020
Who do you think I am?

809
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,438
Some millionaire
or something?

810
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,190
You always successful
in whatever you did,

811
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,733
ever since your hot-dog stand,
a big success.

812
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,530
If you knew just how much I miss
those days with my hot-dog stand...

813
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,240
If you miss them,
Why'd you quit then?

814
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,242
Because you gave me the
money to buy this bar here.

815
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,745
And I accepted because
I thought it would be good for me,

816
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,291
but, really, I still haven't
found myself here yet, Tino.

817
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:54,006
Adelson, no joking man,

818
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,009
you're the only real friend
that I have, you know that?

819
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,095
So then I feel like it's
my duty to give

820
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,180
you some advice,
some friendly advice.

821
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,098
Sure man, tell me.

822
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:06,602
Tino, why don't you start
working again, huh?

823
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,611
And so guys? I was always
a good coach, huh?

824
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,282
And like they say, once a king,
you never lose your majesty.

825
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,325
Nor your belly.

826
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,452
Listen man, what did I
ever do to you, huh?

827
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,746
Tino, let us talk here a minute,

828
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,248
let me talk to him.

829
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,795
Nelsinho, I can't believe you're
going to give in to this guy.

830
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,464
He left us here doing
all the hard work for years.

831
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,800
But if it weren't for him
we'd still be doing all

832
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,052
the hard work in that flea-ridden
joint over in Vila Isabel.

833
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:41,804
Do you really think you
don't owe him anything?

834
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,106
This isn't going to be easy.

835
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,733
OK, girls, let's get started...

836
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,819
Today a new coach
will be helping you all.

837
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,280
Coach Tino.

838
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,782
Alright!

839
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,743
I don't want to see any
lazybones around here!

840
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,620
This is about health.

841
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,288
I want to see fit bodies.

842
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:11,083
I don't want to see any
bellies bouncing around.

843
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,502
What about yours honey?

844
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,673
I see!
We have a difficult group here!

845
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:21,677
No problem, big Tino knows how
to deal with people like you,

846
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,679
I'll lay it on nice and heavy.

847
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,099
Everybody up on the trampoline!

848
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:35,107
Richard, this one is broken, look.

849
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,525
It wasn't before.

850
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,613
Right. So everybody
off the trampoline,

851
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:41,781
get off the trampolines.

852
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:43,115
You want to play with Tino?

853
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:50,164
I'll show you what a high impact
aerobic exercise is all about.

854
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:52,393
Again a again!

855
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,395
Oh, God.

856
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,606
Nelsinho! Hi, Richard!

857
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,108
What happened?

858
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,401
Where am I, guys?

859
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,610
What happened here?

860
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,737
Beat it!

861
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,119
Tino.

862
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:12,788
Tino wait.

863
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,374
Nelsinho.

864
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,963
Here. Your payment.

865
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:25,509
Payment? Five thousand
for 15 minutes of class?

866
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,221
It's the best I can do right now.

867
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,724
And the least too.

868
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,019
Don't tell Rick
anything about his, OK?

869
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,773
Don't worry, thanks, buddy.

870
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:45,529
Who is the woman who wouldn't
love a pair of earrings like these?

871
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:50,034
The time is now.

872
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,327
Pick up the phone and call.

873
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:52,578
Right, I want the earrings...

874
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,454
Merely four thousand
nine hundred and ninety...

875
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,498
Right, I confirm the purchase.

876
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,249
No!

877
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,303
Tino, what are you doing?

878
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,013
What did you do that for?

879
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:16,018
It's just... the earrings
are horrible.

880
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,063
They'll make your face look fat.
That's it.

881
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,817
Faustino, I don't care,
they're diamonds!

882
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,569
And I love jewelry.
I love jewelry.

883
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,113
You know that.

884
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,364
I have loads of jewelry.

885
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,034
Yeahâ.

886
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,496
Come on Tino,
stop saying that,

887
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,748
I don't do
nothing like that, man.

888
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,250
Everybody knows what you do.

889
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,709
Everybody here knows
you're an in-and-out man,

890
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,545
that you like to lift
things once in a while.

891
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,587
Everybody knows that here.

892
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:47,007
And you want to
spread it all around?

893
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,218
And I'm on parole,

894
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,804
you know I can't go doing
no kind of scam man.

895
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,140
This ain't no scam, you jerk,
I'm not talking about a scam.

896
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,307
Stop fussing with that,

897
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,767
that's a real nasty
habit you have.

898
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:57,810
Then you go round
touching other people.

899
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:02,773
I'm not talking about no scam,
this is the deal,

900
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,734
I just want you to go
and get all the jewels

901
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,404
I have at home,
so Jane won't know.

902
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,822
I'll settle things
with her later.

903
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:14,326
For God's sake, give me a hand here,
I'm desperate.

904
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,661
Shit, you put me down in
front of everyone, Tino!

905
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:19,331
I was just talking, sorry,
I didn't mean anything, really.

906
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,083
No, now you're alright,

907
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,751
I'll do this to help you out.

908
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,545
I'm real sorry if I was too...

909
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,338
you do this for me then, right?

910
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,089
No problem, no problem.

911
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,757
So, this is what
we're going to do...

912
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,136
But I liked the movie,

913
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:35,806
I just didn't get that
part about the arm,

914
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,566
Go get some shuteye, go on.

915
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:48,110
No, no shuteye before whoopie.

916
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,290
<i>Vander, and so,
you get the jewels?</i>

917
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,334
Tino, I haven't finished yet, man,

918
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,462
I can't read
the numbers you wrote, Tino.

919
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,630
What do you mean,
you're not through?

920
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,297
<i>No, Tino.</i>

921
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,090
Man, beat it right now!

922
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:11,217
Why?

923
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:14,803
Tino!

924
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,596
Hi, Jane.

925
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,640
There's a burglar in our room.

926
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,183
No, no, no, no, no, no.

927
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:19,600
Yes there is!

928
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,102
I think you're judging
people before you

929
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,479
No, I'm not judging anyone.

930
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:24,104
There's a man.

931
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,564
A burglar inside our room

932
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:29,652
standing in front of the safe
with a crowbar in his hand!

933
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,820
Yeah, well that is a very
revealing, for sure.

934
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,405
That's really hard to doubt,

935
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,741
but for God's sake,
you can't get stressed out.

936
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,409
My father was a cop, did you
forget about that, honey?

937
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,412
Ohh, I had forgotten about that.

938
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,666
And I just love it when the
adrenalin starts pumping,

939
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,251
And I am raring to teach
this guy a lesson.

940
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,585
No, you're not going to
teach anyone a lesson,

941
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:50,089
the kids are downstairs and you
have another one here. Please.

942
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:50,714
Yeah, that's true.

943
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,259
Please, calm down,
take care of your offspring,

944
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,594
Wow, go on, alpha male.

945
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,187
Shit, what was that, Tino?

946
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,731
Tino my ass,
stop saying my name,

947
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,649
are you stupid
or something, huh.

948
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:09,483
Listen,
pretend we're fighting, go on,

949
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,276
and I'll open the safe.

950
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:11,443
How am I supposed
to do that, Tino?

951
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,444
I don't know,
make believe man.

952
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,448
Are you crazy?
I told you to pretend.

953
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,409
Well your wife
wasn't pretending, shit.

954
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,205
I've opened it,
get the stuff, go on.

955
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,708
Honey, you want me
to call the police?

956
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:26,500
No.

957
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,503
<i>My God...</i>

958
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,682
What happened here?

959
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,475
Jane!

960
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,060
Honey, what happened?

961
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,645
Oh my love, it's you!

962
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:50,482
How glad I am to see a friendly
face at a time like this.

963
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,694
This place was a battlefield.

964
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:58,240
It was pure chaos,
let me tell you,

965
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:01,410
all hell broke out,
with fingers in the eyes,

966
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:04,747
fisticuffs, half-nelsons,
whole nelsons, blood,

967
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,206
it was just gushing,

968
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,754
listen, it was terrible,
and then, suddenly,

969
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,090
he hit me over the head
and I thought:

970
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,260
"Man, my family,
my family, my family".

971
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,511
And he got away.

972
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,140
But, how did that happen honey,
if I knocked him out cold.

973
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,435
I don't know, but he got a way,
terrible, he got away.

974
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:29,772
What is it?

975
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:33,025
He didn't get away!

976
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,070
He's just plain stupid!

977
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,740
No, that is worse than stupid,

978
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,533
he deserves to be
committed for that!

979
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,535
But, honey, leave this
to me, go on outside

980
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,793
Hate in my eyes,
I'm going to destroy him.

981
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:52,294
Leave him to me, no problem,

982
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:56,298
'cause now I'm going to be attack,
like a mad dog.

983
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,591
Yeah, a mad dog.

984
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:58,550
Yeah, and a crowbar.

985
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,595
A crowbar, get the crowbar.

986
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,472
Don't you think that's
a bit too lethal?

987
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,015
Follow me, come on.

988
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,767
I'm coming,
behind the crowbar.

989
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,769
I like it when they don't move.

990
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,401
You want my jewels?

991
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:16,652
You dirty crook!

992
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,738
Could you lend me a hand, Faustino?
Or you'll get some you too!

993
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:19,822
But, he's had enough now, honey, Could you lend
me a hand, Faustino? Or you'll get some you too!

994
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,407
But, he's had enough now, honey,

995
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,283
that's enough now.

996
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,035
You got him good.

997
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:29,748
Go and call the cops then, honey,

998
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,834
that's it.

999
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,045
I'll call the cops,
and you keep hitting him.

1000
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:38,090
Call the cops, leave him to me now,
I'm hitting him,

1001
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,676
call an ambulance.

1002
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:49,643
Vander, let me help you here.

1003
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,769
You OK?

1004
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,604
No way...

1005
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,149
That wife of yours is worse
than the devil, huh?

1006
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,609
It sometimes depends
on the time of the month,

1007
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,404
right, but Vander, you'd better go,
because, really,

1008
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,531
the cops will be here
any moment now...

1009
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,408
try avoiding any
sudden movements, OK?

1010
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,827
And if you can,
put a splint on at home...

1011
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:10,581
This isn't going to be cheap, no way.
Caribbean here I come!

1012
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,206
Caribbean, no way, huh?

1013
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,625
I'm Brazilian, I never give up.
Tino. I'm gone.

1014
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,210
Don't go running off with them...

1015
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,255
Vander, hey Vander...

1016
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,218
I can't believe this!

1017
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,472
<i>You don't have any more
credit cards, no more checks,</i>

1018
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:27,139
<i>you're broke.</i>

1019
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,641
<i>Nobody... will give you
any more credit,</i>

1020
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,852
<i>yes, you're going to
have to sell everything.</i>

1021
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,688
No, Tino,
I don't want to buy your Ferrari.

1022
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,403
Tino, sell it all.

1023
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,668
Let's go shopping?

1024
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:01,590
I need to buy a whole
bunch of things...

1025
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,260
You have to sell everything,
and that means everything.

1026
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,771
How long can I stay
in the house?

1027
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,982
Three months, Amauri?

1028
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,151
But Jane is going to have
her baby before that.

1029
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:24,780
I know Tino, it's just
that the house belongs to...

1030
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,697
I'm sorry.

1031
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,340
Laura, my dear neighbor.

1032
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,216
Jane!

1033
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,053
How are you dear?
What are you doing here?

1034
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,473
Don't waste your breath,
I know already!

1035
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,476
You've got something baking
here in your oven too.

1036
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,728
No, no, it's not that.

1037
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,439
I'm just looking for
a present for my niece...

1038
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,524
for my niece.

1039
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:04,570
Well, as long as
you're here, maybe.

1040
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,366
If you had to pick,
for your niece,

1041
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,743
between these two,
which one would you choose?

1042
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,705
You're going to have a girl?

1043
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,503
I never thought a mall
could be so boring!

1044
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,172
If you can't buy anything,
what'd you expect?

1045
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,467
Come here, you two
going to sit around talking?

1046
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,678
I brought you here to help
me find your mother, OK?

1047
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,762
So, get moving.

1048
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,181
If it had been up to Tino,

1049
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,183
this one is beautiful.

1050
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:38,186
Poor Juninho,
if it hadn't been for me,

1051
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,772
And you guys?
Don't you ever another one?

1052
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:42,441
Us...

1053
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,108
Yeah.

1054
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:46,194
Well, I do, sometimes,
you know? But...

1055
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,033
Ohh, no way, it's like my
grandmother used to say,

1056
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,702
you can't give the guy time to think,
you get me,

1057
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,537
you have to just
go up and, bang!

1058
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,289
Bang?

1059
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:01,293
That's it. Why do you
think animals don't have.

1060
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,503
Because they just
go up and, bang,

1061
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,422
grab them and bang.

1062
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:06,465
Bang.

1063
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:11,637
Bang.

1064
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,305
Where could she be?

1065
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,558
And I'll take...

1066
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,478
Hold it, don't move,
give me this.

1067
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,563
Tino, what are you doing here?

1068
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:25,067
It's just that I want to...
participate in this moment

1069
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,654
picking out the furniture
of my daughter's room.

1070
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:29,571
How nice.

1071
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,323
Oh no, that is impossible,

1072
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,325
you don't even know
the color of Tete's room

1073
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,660
and now you're saying
that you want to

1074
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:38,330
help pick out
the baby's furniture.

1075
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,583
I've changed.
I've changed and I want

1076
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:49,174
I'm not going to let
you buy our daughter's.

1077
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,509
This is an award-winning store.

1078
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,134
Yeah?

1079
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,596
Just a minute dear,
I think you're acting so strange,

1080
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,556
really.

1081
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:57,265
No, I'm not...

1082
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,558
Because I have to tell you,

1083
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:02,521
I really want
to give this baby here,

1084
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:06,358
the room that TetÃ© didn't
have when she was born,

1085
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:10,362
for sure, and the only place
better than this store here

1086
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,532
would be to hire some
designer, right, someone...

1087
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:16,118
A designer! A designer!

1088
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,119
A designer.

1089
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:17,661
Yes.

1090
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:24,292
I know one who we can hire...

1091
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,586
You want me to do what?

1092
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,380
Adelson,
let me explain it to you.

1093
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,382
You're the only one
who can help me.

1094
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,467
I'm not asking for any money,

1095
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,846
I just need you to do this,
for my wife,

1096
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,056
to pretend you're a designer.

1097
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:38,598
A what?

1098
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,433
A designer.

1099
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,101
What's that?

1100
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,396
A designer is a guy who...

1101
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,981
somebody who...

1102
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,649
works with design,
you understand?

1103
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,317
Listen, let me tell you something.

1104
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,738
My wife doesn't know you,
it'll work.

1105
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:57,659
No, no, no, no and no way.

1106
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:09,671
You look great.

1107
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,339
Look, if you start bugging me,
I'm leaving,

1108
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,174
I'll leave, you get me?

1109
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,676
Did you read the magazines?

1110
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,554
Yeah, looks like everything
today is vintage, vintage is in.

1111
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:18,346
Vintage.

1112
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,515
Right, and what else, what else?

1113
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:23,560
I'm going to have to ask
you to play the fruitcake.

1114
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,688
Now, wait a minute,
you didn't say anything about that!

1115
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,025
You have to be gay.

1116
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,736
Look Tino, not every
designer is gay man,

1117
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,362
that's just prejudice on your part.

1118
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,655
And you know
anything about design?

1119
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,741
The first thing about design?
No, you don't.

1120
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:41,203
You have to be gay,
hold your hand back.

1121
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,413
Tino I'm not going to hold my
hand back, I won't do it, no way.

1122
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,457
I'm asking you, help me!

1123
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,208
I'm not going to do it.

1124
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,167
For God's sake!

1125
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,754
You have to be gay.

1126
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,380
I'm never going to do
anything like that.

1127
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:56,551
You have to make
Jane believe that you are a designer,

1128
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,720
if not it's all over.

1129
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,556
Tino, is he here, is that him?

1130
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,729
And who's got
that lovely belly?

1131
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:11,691
The designer.

1132
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,202
And so, Jaques?

1133
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:28,667
This room is fabulous!
Simply fabulous. F-A-B.

1134
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,709
Fabulous.

1135
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,546
But, it's still empty.

1136
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:39,594
Yes, but I can see it all in
my head, something very simple,

1137
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,556
used furniture.

1138
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:50,647
Right, but I'm not going to buy
used furniture for my daughter.

1139
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,275
Listen, Jane, I think, really...

1140
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,526
No, you shut up.

1141
01:00:55,193 --> 01:01:00,448
Jane, darling,
that's exactly why it is chic.

1142
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,742
It's vintage.

1143
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:03,618
Vintage.

1144
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,452
Vintage.

1145
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,079
True vintage.

1146
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:12,043
Listen to me Jane,
people spend fortunes

1147
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:17,799
Old. Repeat please.

1148
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:18,800
Old.

1149
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,302
Yeah, old.

1150
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,052
Old.

1151
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,555
But, only those who are truly chic,
like you, right?

1152
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:29,561
Use furniture that is truly old,
used, you get me?

1153
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,607
No, but...

1154
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,779
Tell me something,
I have a question, a question,

1155
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,157
tell me something,
for you, for you,

1156
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,117
who is, like, the chicest
person in the world

1157
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,077
Oh, you know that actress?
I have a couple...

1158
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,245
The one from the plane, the jet?

1159
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,372
No, she's second rate.

1160
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,499
Kate, Kate Middleton.

1161
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:53,710
Kate?

1162
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:54,711
Who is that?

1163
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,088
The English Princess!

1164
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:04,304
Jane, darling, where does
Kate Middleton live?

1165
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,265
The princess...
does she live around here honey?

1166
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,558
I can't remember right now...

1167
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,726
No, she lives...

1168
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,728
Excuse me.

1169
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:17,609
She lives
in the Palace of Buckingham.

1170
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:19,110
Oh my God!

1171
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,279
The Buckingham Palace.

1172
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:22,739
Really? My...

1173
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:24,366
And... what do you think?

1174
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:33,124
That in the Buckingham Palace
the furniture only looks old?

1175
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:35,627
No!

1176
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:37,128
Hey, hey.

1177
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:41,091
The furniture there is truly old.

1178
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,135
It just isn't older
than the queen mother.

1179
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:56,147
I simply loved you, Jaques!

1180
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,149
No, really,
you have style, right,

1181
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,151
not everybody has that,
no way.

1182
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:04,322
So everything today
is vintage then?

1183
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,783
Right, vintage, a must.

1184
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:11,621
Listen, I have to recommend
you to my friends.

1185
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:14,249
Of course, of course I do.

1186
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:14,749
Of course!

1187
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:18,211
No, but, I mean,
I don't know if I can,

1188
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,422
I don't have my card,
and with all my clients, no time...

1189
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,757
Imagine.
I'll get your number later with Tino,

1190
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,175
he'll give it to me,
no problem,

1191
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,012
you have to meet my friends,
right honey?

1192
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,596
For sure, you have to.

1193
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,180
OK then.

1194
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,683
Before you leave, wouldn't
you like a cup of jasmine tea?

1195
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,476
Jasmine is a m-a-s-t.

1196
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,812
For sure, m-a-s-t, a must!

1197
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:42,694
Jasmine is a must, m-a-s-t.

1198
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:43,361
A must.

1199
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:45,697
That lipstick suits you, Tino.

1200
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,990
What? Want a kiss?

1201
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,950
Listen Tino,
you know I always carry a gun,

1202
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,452
Show some respect.

1203
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:55,623
Laura?

1204
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,459
Meow.

1205
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:02,797
Laura, I'm home.

1206
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,059
Meow.

1207
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:19,481
Meow.

1208
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:20,523
Meow.

1209
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:25,653
Meow.

1210
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:30,450
Meow.

1211
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:32,243
Meow.

1212
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,499
The kitten wants milk.

1213
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,459
Great.

1214
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:40,668
The kitten wants milk.

1215
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,757
Amauri, Amauri,
if you're checking out

1216
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,009
my fertile days
on the phone...

1217
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,682
Meow.

1218
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,775
And this is the first order?

1219
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:05,235
No.

1220
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,532
What's wrong with you,
why you walking like that, huh?

1221
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,742
I sprained a muscle...

1222
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:19,749
Tino, I know you don't
like to talk about this,

1223
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,501
but your situation
is getting worse...

1224
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,211
and you said
that Jane had an uncle...

1225
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,254
I'm not going to talk to...

1226
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,047
Sorry.

1227
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,300
I'm not going to talk
to Uncle Olavinho, OK?

1228
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:30,552
No way.

1229
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:32,512
You're just going to have
to swallow your pride.

1230
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:37,559
Sometimes, it's better
asking a relative...

1231
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:41,771
What does this uncle...

1232
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:42,605
Olavinho.

1233
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,400
What does he do?
What's his line of business?

1234
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:49,654
He's got this store,
a chain of stores I think.

1235
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:51,739
A chain of stores?

1236
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:52,323
Yeah.

1237
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:53,658
Really
<i>7</i>

1238
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,535
What's his name?

1239
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:59,539
Olavo Mendes.
Your wife is niece of Olavo Mendes

1240
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,040
and you don't tell me?

1241
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,376
Tino, forget the doll.

1242
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,087
I can't, it gives me the creeps.

1243
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:08,840
Tino, focus.

1244
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,845
Olavo Mendes has stores
everywhere in the world.

1245
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,556
He makes more money
than Uruguay's GDP.

1246
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,183
Why not talk to him?

1247
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,267
Because he's a skinflint.

1248
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,686
A cheapskate,
who doesn't help anyone.

1249
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,690
And when I got rich
I told him to eat shit.

1250
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,359
That's wonderful.

1251
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,654
But he was the one who began it, OK?
He called me an imbecile.

1252
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:33,990
A man of vision.

1253
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:34,782
Yeahâ.

1254
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:36,284
Oops

1255
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:41,789
Thank you.

1256
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:49,088
Tino, Olavo is 104 years old,
he doesn't have kids,

1257
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,090
Jane is his only niece,

1258
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,135
I know how rich folks think,
he'll help you,

1259
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,055
but, he's going to want
something in exchange.

1260
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,141
He's going to play with you.

1261
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,726
This is just a waste of time,

1262
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,478
he won't even see me.

1263
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:10,401
It's up to you now.
Good luck.

1264
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:49,232
Well, Uncle...

1265
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,714
Can I talk now?

1266
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,135
Yeah, Gesundheit.

1267
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,138
So, Uncle Olavinho...

1268
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,682
are you going
to be able to help me, sir?

1269
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:30,023
You, no. Janine yes.

1270
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:35,528
Did you forget that you
offended me here,

1271
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,739
inside my own house?

1272
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,700
I, really, I...

1273
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:45,413
it's been so long I can't
even remember what I said.

1274
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:52,337
You told me to eat shit,
which I'm doing still today.

1275
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:57,550
Good memory you have.
Good memory.

1276
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:03,806
For God's sake, forgive me,
forgive me,

1277
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:06,809
I'm desperate, Uncle Olavinho,

1278
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,730
I'll do anything I have to do,
Uncle Olavinho,

1279
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:11,814
anything.

1280
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:16,110
You used to play tennis,
didn't you?

1281
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:23,326
Me, yeah... I was an athlete,
right, I played all sports,

1282
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,329
I was good in any sport, right?

1283
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:34,379
How about a game
of tennis worth...

1284
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:46,349
Worth one hundred
thousand reais, a set.

1285
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:47,725
Me and you?

1286
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:48,434
Yeah.

1287
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:49,769
One hundred thousand, playing.

1288
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:50,520
Right.

1289
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,604
Me against you.

1290
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:52,563
Right.

1291
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,735
Help me up here, SabarÃ©,
give me a hand.

1292
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:01,531
Uncle Olavo, of course,
of course I will,

1293
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,783
one hundred thousand,
me and you, in a game?

1294
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,578
Uncle Olavinho, it's your idea,
I'll take the bet!

1295
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:10,289
But don't be
too hard on me, OK.

1296
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:24,804
Uncle Olavinho,
are you sure you want to do this?

1297
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,806
Don't forget,
you're 104 years old,

1298
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:30,268
wouldn't you rather we play bridge,
dominos, checkers?

1299
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:38,067
Listen here boy,
I do orthomolecular therapy.

1300
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:42,697
An active mind,
an active body.

1301
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,076
So, don't be too hard
on me then, OK.

1302
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:50,788
Keep on dreaming boy,
dream on.

1303
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:01,048
Well, OK then, Uncle Olavo,
let's do it then,

1304
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,009
let's start the game then,

1305
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:07,805
try to get the ball over
the net at least, OK?

1306
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,349
And hit this here, OK?

1307
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:16,314
One hundred grand, in the till.

1308
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,357
You caught me off guard.

1309
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:23,029
Another hundred thousand in the till.

1310
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,031
So now it's my turn.

1311
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,797
Never seen such a lousy player...

1312
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,726
Have a drink boy.

1313
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,604
Have a drink, relax a bit.

1314
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:41,357
No thanks,
I want to spare my liver,

1315
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:43,484
I'll probably have
to sell it soon.

1316
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:48,114
I'm not going to hold you
to the bet, don't worry.

1317
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,616
What, so what was this
all about then?

1318
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,076
You just want
to humiliate me?

1319
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:53,494
Yeah, to humiliate you,

1320
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:56,163
because money isn't everything
in the world, no way.

1321
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,164
Listen, why don't you eat s...

1322
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,499
Again, huh?

1323
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,042
Listen, Uncle Olavinho,

1324
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,546
it's easy for you to say that,
you hear me?

1325
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,006
You're filthy rich,

1326
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:09,552
a billionaire,
living in this mansion.

1327
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,057
But not me,
I'm 38 years old, two kids,

1328
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:21,439
a pregnant wife, unemployed,
without a cent to my name.

1329
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:24,442
Want to trade?

1330
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:36,746
Boy, I'd give up all this,
everything, to be poor,

1331
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:41,584
just to be 38 again.

1332
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:48,049
I'd give every cent I had just
to have a young wife,

1333
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:52,386
pretty, and kids that loved me.

1334
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:57,683
I'd trade my life with yours,
like this.

1335
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:05,399
It's not me, nor Jane, who puts
money before everything else, no,

1336
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:10,696
it's you, you Tino.

1337
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:17,036
And you'd better tell Jane soon,
you hear me,

1338
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:21,666
because a woman can forgive
a man without money,

1339
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,710
but a liar no,
you understand.

1340
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:52,071
That's right, send the taxi to 415,
El Salvador St.

1341
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,616
Jane, I...

1342
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,078
Stefani and Junior,
you both go on outside and,

1343
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,289
as soon as the cab gets
here you tell me, OK?

1344
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:23,269
Why did you do this?

1345
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:34,280
The doctor, he told me
you couldn't get upset,

1346
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:35,990
What trauma?

1347
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:39,702
Of being poor again.

1348
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:44,707
Tino, look at me.

1349
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,794
Here, look into my eyes.

1350
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:54,800
Do you really think that being
poor again is a trauma for me?

1351
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,344
Look, honey...

1352
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:02,683
I can even forgive you for
having made the kids lie to me,

1353
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:06,562
for you having
made us all poor again,

1354
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:15,696
I can even forgive you for
thinking I'm some futile.

1355
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,739
Please, Jane.

1356
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:17,823
I can forgive you all that,

1357
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,327
but, the only thing
I can't forgive you is

1358
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:28,959
for not knowing who I am,
after being

1359
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:32,338
married to me
for 16 years, Tino.

1360
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:37,635
Not that,
that I can't forgive you.

1361
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:40,763
Jane.

1362
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:42,681
Let's go guys.

1363
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:43,349
Jane.

1364
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:44,642
Get in honey, get in.

1365
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,644
Jane, just a minute, honey...

1366
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,313
Where are you going?

1367
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:52,358
To the place I never
should have left, Tino.

1368
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,005
Things have gotten
pretty heavy next door.

1369
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:22,221
Son, look and learn,
that's what.

1370
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,765
Better not talk too fast dad.

1371
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,773
Son, I'll be by to
get you tomorrow, OK?

1372
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,276
I'll be staying at this
address here.

1373
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,236
Give me a call
if you need anything.

1374
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:45,119
Laura, let's talk.

1375
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:46,996
No, Amauri.

1376
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:48,289
Why not?

1377
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,624
Because you know how to talk,

1378
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:54,253
you're good the logica
and Mister of the reason.

1379
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,089
I always lose any
conversation with you,

1380
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:02,720
I just don't need to lose
my life with your talking.

1381
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,605
Laura! Laura!

1382
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:16,025
Laura! Laura!

1383
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,121
Laura, I...

1384
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:48,766
Hi.

1385
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:52,311
Hi.

1386
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,482
Hard day, huh?

1387
01:18:58,817 --> 01:18:59,735
Very.

1388
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,617
Wanta go have a drink?

1389
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:09,787
You paying?

1390
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:25,052
Four years looking
for the perfect girl.

1391
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,805
Four years?
Shit, you were one finicky guy, huh?

1392
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,351
I even had
this chart at college,

1393
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:37,648
where I'd take note of all
the girls I had slept with.

1394
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:45,489
And then Laura showed up
and I threw the chart away.

1395
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,534
I planned everything just
for her to in the end

1396
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:51,120
come up and tell me that
I plan things out too much.

1397
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:53,664
And you and Jane,
how'd you meet her?

1398
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,542
We met at school,

1399
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,711
began dating, the condom leaked,
and we got married.

1400
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:05,092
That's real nice.
Beautiful.

1401
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:06,385
Thanks.

1402
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:11,348
Bye, Wonder Woman!
Fabulous!

1403
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,391
<i>Bye Adelson honey!</i>

1404
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,392
See you Friday!

1405
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,102
<i>Until Friday, kisses!</i>

1406
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:24,653
Adelson, you still playing the part,
huh?

1407
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:26,697
I sure am.
And it's all your fault, right?

1408
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,115
My fault?

1409
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:28,991
Yeah.

1410
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:29,658
Why?

1411
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:34,580
Because I never made so
much money in my life man,

1412
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,165
and I even came out in
a magazine, look.

1413
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:36,749
Let me see.

1414
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,127
Well look at this,
the man himself!

1415
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:40,753
VINTAGE HOUSE

1416
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,004
Look at the guy,
looking good, huh?

1417
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:45,549
I don't know how, but it seems
I was born for this kind of work, man.

1418
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:46,050
Really
<i>7</i>

1419
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,760
You're the...

1420
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:48,594
Designer.

1421
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:49,636
Designer.

1422
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,013
Designer of this...

1423
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:53,682
Yeah, my bar,

1424
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:54,725
Vintage.

1425
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:55,684
Say it: vintage.

1426
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,187
Vintage.

1427
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,438
Vintage.

1428
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:00,439
Vintage.

1429
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:01,607
That's it!

1430
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:04,109
Man, I can't believe it, huh?

1431
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,624
Whose apartment is this mom?

1432
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:19,792
It's grandma's.

1433
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:23,754
Mom, are we going to be
staying here for long?

1434
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:51,532
Amauri

1435
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,459
What is it man?

1436
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:08,090
I think it's much easier
for you to get back with Jane

1437
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:11,135
than for me to get Laura back.

1438
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:15,681
Of course, no doubt about it,
you're such a jerk man.

1439
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,645
Yeah, well thanks
for your kind words.

1440
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:22,688
No, no, really.

1441
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:23,397
Thanks.

1442
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:33,699
Amauri, when was the last time
you told Laura you loved her?

1443
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:36,493
The last time I told her...

1444
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,537
that I loved her?

1445
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:39,413
Yeah. Declared your love,
I love you.

1446
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:45,210
Jeez, when I met her,
I told her I loved her.

1447
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:48,505
Are you crazy man?

1448
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:49,131
Why?

1449
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:50,799
You can't do that.

1450
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:51,717
Why?

1451
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:57,806
You have to tell
her everyday

1452
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:02,728
that she's special.
Every day, Amauri.

1453
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:07,274
But why?
Why, for God's sake, why?

1454
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,569
Because they're special,
Amauri,

1455
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:16,074
they are very special,
Amauri.

1456
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:22,456
Right. Right.

1457
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:29,338
I'm going to go get a pillow...

1458
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:33,091
Tino?

1459
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:37,763
Tino?

1460
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:47,189
<i>Honey, may I suggest something?</i>

1461
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:49,775
<i>Why don't you come here
with the kids?</i>

1462
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:51,568
Live in Miami?

1463
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:53,779
The apartment here
is too big just for me.

1464
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:56,031
My store is doing great,

1465
01:23:56,073 --> 01:24:02,037
and we have the best
hospital in the world.

1466
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:05,749
Aww, I don't now mom,

1467
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:11,296
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

1468
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:14,341
<i>Honey, what have
you got to lose?</i>

1469
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,394
Naughty dog, very naughty.

1470
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,021
Sometimes it's the dog food,
you know?

1471
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:36,655
Jeez!

1472
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:40,742
Dad, how long is senhor Tino
going to be staying here?

1473
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:49,126
Not too long I hope.

1474
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:01,805
You're using this?

1475
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:03,473
Yeah.

1476
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:06,518
A teddy bear keychain,
worth three reais,

1477
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,061
It's worth a lot to me.

1478
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:12,524
And my dad,
how's he doing?

1479
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,527
Alright.
And you guys?

1480
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:16,486
Alright too.

1481
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,822
I mean, my mom is
kinda flipping out,

1482
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:22,075
can you believe she is thinking
to move to Miami together.

1483
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,790
She's going where, Amauri?

1484
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:30,709
Bruno told me now,
during lunch,

1485
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,336
and I thought
you should know.

1486
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,462
<i>You'd better give her a call.</i>

1487
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:35,464
But, I call and
she doesn't answer.

1488
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:39,468
Tino, after all you've done,
to leaving now.

1489
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:42,012
If she doesn't answer your calls,
go after her.

1490
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:44,723
You think so?

1491
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:49,728
Of course. Fatso.

1492
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:53,065
<i>Jane! Jane!
Open the door, Jane.</i>

1493
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:54,566
Jane, I have to talk to you,
honey,

1494
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,485
open the door,
TetÃ©, Juninho!

1495
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:57,402
Senhor Tino!

1496
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,280
Senhor Severino,
help me out here.

1497
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:01,531
Where's Jane, huh?

1498
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,700
She's not here,
senhor Tino.

1499
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:05,202
What do you mean?
Not here?

1500
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:06,286
Where'd she go?

1501
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:10,749
I think I heard her talking on the
phone that was going to the airport.

1502
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:12,250
The airport?

1503
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:14,211
-Yeah.
-That can't be.

1504
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,340
Senhor Severino,
do you still your car?

1505
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:19,466
Old faithful?

1506
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:20,842
Sure do.

1507
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,552
I can't believe this, no way.

1508
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,180
For God's sake, why?

1509
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:10,100
Hold it, hold it right there,
I need you bike.

1510
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:13,228
Sorry about this bro,
sorry man.

1511
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:16,064
Come back here, man!

1512
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:24,197
Not now, not now!

1513
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,807
Oh God.

1514
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:53,101
Oh God.

1515
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,396
Jane!

1516
01:27:58,148 --> 01:28:04,613
Lady, lady, I need a ticket,

1517
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:07,616
fast, to any place,

1518
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:11,745
as long as I get into
the boarding area,

1519
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:16,291
because I have to
save my family, lady.

1520
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:19,252
I have to save my family,

1521
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:23,757
I spent all my money,
spent it all!

1522
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:27,093
The only thing
I have left are

1523
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:33,308
was the clothes with me

1524
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:35,852
and a bicycle, worth around $250
that it is outside,

1525
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:38,480
that I stole from its owner.

1526
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:41,650
Please, you have to help me!

1527
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:43,527
Don't you have mileage?

1528
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:48,532
Yeah, mileage, those I have.

1529
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:55,080
I didn't have to expose
my life with a stranger.

1530
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,251
<i>Jane'. Jane'.!</i>

1531
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:00,669
Don't close yet, mister,

1532
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:04,089
mister, don't close the door,
look here, I have my ticket here.

1533
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:05,757
<i>Jane, Jane'.!</i>

1534
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,052
Open the door!
Open the door!

1535
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:12,055
BOARDING CONCLUDED

1536
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:18,645
Tino?

1537
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:23,525
Jane?

1538
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:26,027
Tino, what are you doing here?

1539
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,738
Well, Janinha, it's because...

1540
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:35,245
I came to tell you, if you decide
to go to Miami, I support.

1541
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:38,123
I guess you're right, you're

1542
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:41,334
and I just came
to say goodbye,

1543
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:46,506
and tell you
all that I love you...

1544
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:50,552
Dad.

1545
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:51,553
What?

1546
01:29:51,678 --> 01:29:53,305
We're not going to travel.

1547
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:55,724
Flo?

1548
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,476
Of course not, Tino.

1549
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:01,771
I just brought the kids here
to knowing our store.

1550
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:03,690
Our store?

1551
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:09,571
Uncle Olavo gave us this store,
is that it?

1552
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:12,741
No, there's no "us" here,

1553
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:18,288
no more,
there's no more "us".

1554
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:26,671
And, in reality,
I like to open a store for me.

1555
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:30,175
But Uncle Olavinho said they
don't make any money.

1556
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:32,469
I love you.

1557
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,227
I love you too, Tino.

1558
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:50,612
Jane, I know we both said,
long ago,

1559
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:51,655
Yeah.

1560
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:56,493
But, we do change, don't we?

1561
01:30:57,535 --> 01:30:58,203
A lot.

1562
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:04,042
Time and money makes
us change even more.

1563
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:11,800
Listen,
I would do anything, even,

1564
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:20,725
eat hot dog at lunch
and dinner every day.

1565
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:27,232
But I just can't
live without you.

1566
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:32,737
I can't go on
living without you, honey.

1567
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,622
Let me fill in a form?

1568
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:47,752
You're getting
in the way here,

1569
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:49,504
-Why?
-you know that?

1570
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:50,797
Why?

1571
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:54,467
Because you think
that all you have.

1572
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:54,801
No.

1573
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:56,344
It's not that easy.

1574
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:59,264
But, I'm good working
with people.

1575
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:01,266
That's not the only thing, Tino,
there's a lot of things.

1576
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:04,394
-I'm always well groomed.
-It's too small here!

1577
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:05,437
It's too small here!

1578
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:06,646
I'll sleep on the premises...

1579
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:08,773
I just said that
they're too small.

1580
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:09,607
I know, look...

1581
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:11,609
And then, you won't fit...

1582
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:14,487
You won't even
fit into a uniform.

1583
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:19,492
We only have small and medium.
You won't fit.

1584
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:20,994
Give me a chance?

1585
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:35,467
I'll go get...
I'll get a form.

1586
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,487
Don't worry ma'am,
I've already bought the stocks.

1587
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:56,738
Look guys, Amauri.

1588
01:32:57,322 --> 01:32:59,032
Someone turn it up please.

1589
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:01,326
No need for that guys.

1590
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:06,164
<i>Well, Roberto, I usully say that
inteligent couple rich together.</i>

1591
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:07,624
I can't believe you guys
are going to make me listen to this.

1592
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:08,750
<i>And what do you base
yourself on when you say that?</i>

1593
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:13,505
<i>Based on my own experience.
On my marriage.</i>

1594
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:22,722
<i>I have... I had an incredible wife,
who helped me a lot.</i>

1595
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:23,723
<i>Laura.</i>

1596
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:34,192
<i>Laura, I know you're watching
right now and a friend tell me</i>

1597
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:40,657
<i>that we have to say the
feelings for our wife always.</i>

1598
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:44,744
<i>But, I'm not very good
at that, really,</i>

1599
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:47,997
<i>so I'm going to soy it the
only way I know how.</i>

1600
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:52,585
<i>I always talk about the
five steps to getting rich,</i>

1601
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:56,047
<i>today I'm going to talk
about the five things</i>

1602
01:33:56,172 --> 01:34:01,344
<i>more important without her
getting to not rich.</i>

1603
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:05,098

1610
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:31,434
Hey kid, where's Jane?
Where's the baby?

1611
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,686
Take it easy senhor Tino,
Jane is in her room with the baby.

1612
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:35,146
So come with me then,
come on.

1613
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:39,275
She keeps on gurgling...

1614
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:45,657
Mommy's little darling,
look at your brother and sister, honey.

1615
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:48,117
Honey, I'm sorry.

1616
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,662
Hi honey,
look at how beautiful she is!

1617
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:52,080
Beautiful.

1618
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,373
Sorry I was late,

1619
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:54,123
it's just that the store is so far...

1620
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,084
No problem,
isn't she wonderful?

1621
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:57,085
Wonderful.

1622
01:35:57,085 --> 01:36:02,131
No problem honey.
But, at least you brought...

1623
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:05,718
Yeah... it's... ahh... right...

1624
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:08,513
Did you bring it or not?

1625
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:09,722
Yeah, sure.

1626
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:10,223
Well?

1627
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:14,102
It's right here,
a little surprise.

1628
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:17,522
Tino, it's wonderful,
and I can't believe it,

1629
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:20,483
That's the same that you broght
for Teteia when she born.

1630
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:24,696
-What a beautiful thing.
-Really? Yeah, I remembered.

1631
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:29,742
Honey, we're going to have to take
very good care of ourselves too,

1632
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,452
We will, honey.

1633
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:32,704
I'm serious, Tino.

1634
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:37,792
And you are way over weight,

1635
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:43,006
No way,
a heart attack, imagine.

1636
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:48,761
THE END

1637
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,016
You lose all you have.

1638
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,184
Just joking!

1639
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,407
Congratulations, triplets!

1640
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:18,791
Triplets.

1641
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:32,764
Three.

1642
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:38,728
Three.

1643
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:43,691
Doctor, three of them.

1644
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:46,611
Three.

1645
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:55,703
No way guys, lilac?
Lilac, you want lilac? No way!

1646
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,205
She knows that
you're not gay.

1647
01:37:58,164 --> 01:37:58,790
She does?

1648
01:37:58,831 --> 01:37:59,415
Yeah.

1649
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,042
And you didn't tell me?

1650
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:03,419
But lilac?
Lilac will look horrible.

1651
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:07,131
Lilac my ass,
that's what I say.

1652
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:13,471
A-ha, a-hu,
I'm going to eat Uncle Olavo's cake!

1653
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:15,723
Come on guys, no?

1654
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:17,767
Blow out the candles,
Uncle Olavo.

1655
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:20,019
I'm going
to eat your cake...

1656
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:23,481
I don't think he's enjoying this,
but no problem.

1657
01:38:23,523 --> 01:38:29,153
Wealth is living a well-balanced
and happy life.

1658
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:32,073
If it comes accompanied
by lots of money, better still.
