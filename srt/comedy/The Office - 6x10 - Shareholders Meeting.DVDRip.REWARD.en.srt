Boom! Boom! Boom!

Once a year, Dwight holds
a seminar updating us

5
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,846
on the newest developments
in the world of karate.

6
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,437
<i>Because,
as we all know,</i>

7
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,279
the one thing that thousand-year-old
martial arts do all the time

8
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,613
is change.

9
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:23,745
How can I pose this to
you in a relatable way?

10
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,656
You are all members
of the Yakuza,

11
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,695
and you happen to be visiting
the Lackawanna Trolley Museum,

12
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,357
and you are attacked
by Triads.

13
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:36,061
How can you hold them off
until your clan arrives?

14
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,866
You cannot go wrong
with a throat punch.

15
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,363
(YELLS)

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,670
Okay, so there's no defense
for that. Good to know.

17
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,575
No, there is a defense for
that. Let me demonstrate.

18
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,237
Someone attack me.
Kevin, go!

19
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,610
No way.

20
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,808
Last time, you pulled
my pants down,

21
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,250
and then you tried to
choke me with my shoelace.

22
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:57,050
False. I did choke you with
your shoelace. Now come at me!

23
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,784
Okay, with all due respect
to everyone here,

24
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:02,521
I think the most worthy
opponent of you is you.

25
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,689
That is correct, unless there
happen to be measles present.

26
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,360
So let's just say that Dwight has
come at you with the throat punch.

27
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,802
Now, how would you, Dwight,
defend against it?

28
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,862
Easy. Allow me
to demonstrate.

29
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,376
I am attacking myself with a
throat punch. Here it comes.

30
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,572
Block. Grasp wrist as such.

31
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,739
And what if he comes at
you with the other hand?

32
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,146
Because he does have two.

33
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,183
Good point. Second throat
punch. Absorb the blow.

34
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,450
Groin punch. Hit,
block, elbow to the gut!

35
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,788
Uh-oh! Up to the nose!
No, you're not!

you look like such a fool.

38
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,323
He really is,
but not for long.

39
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:46,202

Not again!

You let go! You let go! I can't hold on!

42
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,172
You two are so
evenly matched,

43
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,339
I don't know how one of you
is gonna get the upper hand.

44
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,144
The important thing
to remember, Jim,

45
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:01,381
we always have what is called
the element of surprise.

(SCREAMS IN PAIN)

47
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,936
But I would say
my favorite art form

48
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,278
is a tie between sculpting
and stand-up comedy.

49
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,476
I did stand-up comedy once.

50
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,916
You did?
Yeah, I killed.

51

That sounds like
it was hilarious.

Yes?

What is the meaning of this
e-mail that everyone got?

55
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,115
You'll have to be
more specific, Dwight.

56
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,252
I get like
eight e-mails a day.

This one. "From David Wallace
to all Dunder Mifflin."

58

Whoo-hoo! Shout-out.

<i>"Hello, everyone. I'm sure you've

it's all conjecture.

61
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,335
"If there's any concrete

62
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,396
<i>Erin, do we have

63
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,464
Your "feelings journal"?

64
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,703
You told me to put it
in the time capsule.

65
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,404

Michael,

66

Oh, "The wall."

68
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,147
I found the article.

69
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,953

it was gonna say.

"It is rumored that they will

00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,371
No, no. That doesn't
make any sense.

Oh, Lord, we're all
gonna lose our jobs.

80
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,708
Not necessarily. Bankruptcy
could mean a lot of things.

81
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,342
Maybe they're just
restructuring to get out of debt.

82
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,114
Right.
Oh, that sounds awful.

83
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,950
Or it could mean
the end of Dunder Mifflin.

Oh, God! Well, that's
an interesting theory.

No, just pooping.

panned out on that front,

00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,830
Co-managing is
a give and take.

156
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,431
You have to
pick your battles.

157
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,237
One of the battles
that I picked

158
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,608
was to stop Michael
from running plastic tubes

159
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:30,513
<i>all over the office and
placing hamsters inside of them.</i>

160
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,676
<i>He was gonna call it
Tube City.</i>

161
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,354
So, yes,
I do owe him one...

162
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,788
<i>MAN: August 5th, 1955.</i>

163
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,455
<i>It's a sad day
down here in Savannah.</i>

164
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,465
<i>Local magnate Bill Bourbon
was killed last night,</i>

165
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,761
<i>and all y'all have
congregated tonight for a meal</i>

166
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,896
<i>to celebrate Bill as he
passes on to his great reward.</i>

167
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,270
<i>But you're not just here
to pay your respects.</i>

168
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,606
<i>You have to figure out which of y'all is
the no-account scoundrel who killed him.</i>

169
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,010
This is ridiculous.

170
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,241
There will be food. You
leave, you do not get food.

171
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,943
What kind of food?
Sandwich platters.

172
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,008
I'm in.
Baby carrots.

173
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,985
Okay, here are your
character cards.

174
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,255
Take one, pass it down.
Here is your prop box.

175
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,922
Some of your characters
will have props.

176
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,489
Now, on your character card,
it tells you who you are

177
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,966
and what your alibi is.

178
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,128
Everything else is
up to your imagination.

179
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,640
So if you talk slowly
in real life,

180
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,405
your character could, say, have
been kicked in the head by a horse.

181
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:33,638
Cool. I'll try it.

182
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,113
Okay. Use your
imaginations.

183
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,342
Who did you get?

184
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,713
"Naughty Nellie Nutmeg,

185
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,810
"a vivacious young socialite
with a penchant for scandal."

186
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,014
BOTH: Ooh!

187
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,522
Saucy.
How about you?

188
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:50,495
"Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local
bartender and Nellie's brother."

189
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,061
Michael, I don't like
this game. It's scary.

190
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,430
It's not scary.

191
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,695
I don't like
my character.

192
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,827
Who are you?

193
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:01,362
"Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch
doctor of the Savannah swamps."

194
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,668
I'm not comfortable
with this.

195
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,936
Well, how do you
think I feel?

196
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,379
I mean, I have to play "Caleb
Crawdad," handsome playboy.

197
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,109
Every night
a different woman,

198
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:16,314
being ogled, having to
hug and kiss and spoon.

199
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,717
I make them
feel beautiful.

200
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,657
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Well, well, well!

201
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,855
What is this contraption,
I do declare?

202
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,422
It's my BlackBerry, Michael. I'm
trying to get updates on the company.

203
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,027
Who's Michael? I'm Caleb
Crawdad, I do declare.

204
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,764
You don't have to keep
saying, "I do declare,"

205
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,396
anytime you say something,
it means you're declaring.

206
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,997
That is the way
Southern people talk.

207
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,043
And what designing woman
are you basing that on?

208
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,476
Delta Burke, I do declare.

209
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,980
Now, shall we get
to the mystery?

210
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,277
I'll go.

211
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:50,251
"My name is Deborah Utante,
Deb for short."

212
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,457
That's clever.
Debutante.

213
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,124
"Bill Bourbon
was my uncle.

214
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:01,860
"I would have never hurt him any
more than I'd hurt a June bug."

215
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,266
Nice accent. You sound
like Forrest Gump.

216
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,395
I do not.

217
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,768
Well, you do, actually.

218
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,536
You got this kind of like
Florida Panhandle thing going,

219
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,807
whereas what you really want
is more of a Savannah accent,

220
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,872
which is more like molasses just
sort of spilling out of your mouth.

221
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,815
Oh, now do
the Swedish Chef.

222
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,217
I'm not familiar.
What province is he from?

223
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,086
<i>He lives on Sesame Street,
dumbass.</i>

224
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,591
You know, I think I'm supposed
to say something to Pam,

225
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,355
I mean, Deb. Okay.

226
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:35,801
"I overheard you asking the
butler where the pistol was kept."

227
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,665
(GASPS) Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

228
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,262
I'm the butler. What, you
were listening in on that?

229
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,738
Oh, you rich people,
you think you can do

230
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,365
whatever you want
to the servant class!

231
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,034
No, no, no. Don't turn
this into a political thing.

232
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,136
I will poison your food.

233
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,113
I reckon I got
something to say

234
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,843
to Miss Beatrix Bourbon,
if she don't mind.

235
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:55,080
Ooh, doggy!
We got a party now!

236
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,248
I do believe that
the game is a big hit.

237
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,155
People are really diving
into their characters.

238
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,919
Y'all...

239
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,333
I made a mistake.

240
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,893
Sorry, I'm late, boss.
What's going on?

241
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:16,340
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) Sir, there has
been a murder, and you are a suspect.

242
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,175
Okay. Hang on just a second. Let me
settle in, and I'll be right back.

243
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,009
Very good! Very good!

244
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,414
Now, no one was there
in the wine cellar.

245
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,818
(TIRES SQUEALING)

246
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:39,925
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Hey there, young lady.

247
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,159
Hello.

248
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:45,727
I would be remiss if I did
not ask the pretty young lady

249
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,569
out on a date
for this weekend.

250
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,109
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Sounds like a plan, sugar.

251
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,340
All right!
A plan it is.

252
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,682
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

253
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:03,150
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your
dalliance with the dark arts.

254
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,191
<i>It's not my fault. I was
exposed to Harry Potter.</i>

255
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,790
I know you did it!

256
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,489
I know she didn't do it. It's
never the person you most suspect.

257
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,931
It's also never the
person you least suspect,

258
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,265
<i>since anyone with half a brain
would suspect them the most.</i>

259
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:22,330
Therefore, I know the
killer to be Phyllis,

260
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:29,342
a.k.a. Beatrix Bourbon, the
person I most medium suspect.

261
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,543
Do you want to go out
on a date with me?

262
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,020
We can make out
by the horses.

263
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,490
Well, you know old Nellie is
always up for a romp in the hay.

264
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,687
How about
a threesome?

265
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,926
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
My boudoir's always open.

266
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,193
Nice.

267
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,500
I'm a little worried I might have
asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.

268
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,731
Which would be a whole
lot less appealing,

269
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,639
because Naughty Nellie
says yes to everyone,

270
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,609
and she might be
a murderer.

271
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,201
Follow before...

272
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,873
I just got an e-mail
from corporate,

273
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,917
specifically for Accounting, to
stop all payments to our vendors.

274
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,418
What does that mean?

275
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,852
Well, maybe nothing, but it could
be a problem with liquidity...

276
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,254
Whoa! What's this
strange Yankee accent

277
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,848
coming out of
your mouth, son?

278
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,951
This here is Savannah.

279
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,220
Phyllis...

280
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,266
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)
This... Plan...

281
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:27,897
This plantation, we're
running low on greenbacks,

282
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,965
and we're having problems
paying the people

283
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:34,774
who give us the seeds and
the dirt. We can't pay them.

284
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,179
Michael, I can't...

285
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,548
Basically, it could mean a lot of
things, but it is unprecedented,

286
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,643
so it's cause for concern.

287
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,244
Okay, I'm going back
to work.

288
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,949
No. No, no, no.
No. No, no.

289
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,754
I'm gonna skip forward to a
really big clue. Here we go.

290
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,593
<i>MAN: Well, by now, you figured out
that old Beatrix Bourbon was the killer.</i>

291
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,756
PAM: What?

292
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,356
Michael, I was
doing so well.

293
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,995
Are you going to believe
that? That is a...

294
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,663
That's a misdirection.

295
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,036
We still don't know
who the murderer is.

296
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,078
Nellie Nutmeg, come back in
here! I can't do this myself.

297
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,986
Voodoo Mama Juju.
What am I gonna do?

298
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,991
Okay, so corporate is
still in their meeting.

299
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,393
That could be
a good sign.

300
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,193
Hey, everyone, Kevin's gonna
give us his take on the situation.

301
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,631
Let's listen up.

302
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,896
All right, guys, it's a
workday, and you guys work here,

303
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,562
so let's go
do some work.

304
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,198
Now, Jim telling us
all to work,

305
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,606
I think that is
a very good sign.

306
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,268

mistaken. My name is Caleb Crawdad.

Y'all skedaddled way too soon.
We need to reopen this case.

310

No, you're not re-opening
the case. The case is closed.

No, it ain't.

I'm not surprised.

about our date this weekend?

Of course, Nathaniel.

319

Okay.

a real date?

No.

Did you?

327
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,597
Totally not.

328
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,876
I thought
it was for real.

329
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:57,019
So I was excited, but
it was part of the game.

330
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,987
You're sure it was water?
It couldn't have been acid?

I already declared you,
it was too dark to tell!

332

Stop playing games
with me, Crawdad!

333

This is not a game!
This is my life!

may have snapped.

Or maybe he's just
stuck in character.

338

Well, which is worse?
Snapped or stuck?

339
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,772
Both.
They're both worse.

It's gonna be all right.
We're a good company.

Jim, what if we both
lose our jobs?

343
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,687
I'm trying to think of a way
that this all ends up fine,

Do you have the vapors?

Michael, can I...

Okay, I'm just gonna skip right
past the what and go with why?

354

Because this is the

You're not gonna
answer the phone?
