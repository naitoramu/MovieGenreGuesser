I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,885
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:14,514
You should see the size
of his Christmas balls!

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,477
How much did you tip the super?

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:23,023
We were gonna give 50,
but we don't wanna look bad.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,151
This year we made him cookies.

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,112
And 25 it is.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,573
You gave cookies?

10
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,657
Money is so impersonal.

11
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,203
Cookies says someone cares.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,748
We're broke,
but cookies do say that.

13
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,916
I can see that.

14
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,795
A plate of brownies told me a limerick.

15
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:50,217
Pheebs, let me ask you something.
Were these "funny" brownies?

16
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,469
Not especially.

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,598
But I think they had pot in them.

18
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,270
So who else did you tip
with cookies?

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,189
The mailman, the super...

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,692
And the newspaper delivery guy.

21
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,403
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:10,779
What?

23
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,533
You're not gonna like this.

24
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,038
These are cookies smashed
to the sports section.

25
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,874
He did my crossword puzzle.

26
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:26,503
Yeah, but not very well, unless
14 across, "Gershwin musical"...

27
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,590
...actually is "Bite me,
bite me, bite me."

00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,268
I can't believe
it's Christmas already.

31
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,313
One day you're eating turkey,
the next thing you know...

32
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,734
...Iords are a-leaping
and geese are a-laying.

33
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:35,739
Which is why geese are
so relaxed this time of year.

34
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,700
Hey, guys.

35
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,161
Hey, Rach.

36
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,790
I got you a little present.

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,003
I'll open it.

38
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,546
It's a Slinky!

39
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:52,798
Remember?

40
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,259
<i>Walks downstairs</i>
<i>Alone or in pairs</i>

41
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,929
<i>Everyone knows it's...</i>

42
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,599
Just a big spring.

43
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,101
You're still mad
because of the whole...

44
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,645
Horrible list of reasons
not to be with me?

45
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:11,775
How about we just call it
the "unfortunate incident"?

46
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:16,488
Hey, Gunther.
You got stairs in your place?

47
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,783
Go nuts.

48
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,786
Hey, guys.

49
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,372
What's in the bag?

50
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,623
Some presents.

51
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,085
Come on, show us what you bought.

52
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,546
You know you want to.

53
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,636
This is a picture frame
from Ben to my parents.

54
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,389
Oh, that's cute.

55
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:46,184
Some "Hers" and "Hers" towels
for Susan and Carol.

56
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,148
And I got this blouse for Mom.

57
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,233
Ross, that is gorgeous!

58
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,236
Look at these authentic fake metals!

59
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,571
Mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"...

60
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,951
...at the make-believe
military academy!

61
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,082
Happy "Christmas Eve" Eve.

62
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,167
Oh, my God!
Where did you get this?

63
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,253
Macy's, third floor,
home furnishings.

64
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,755
This is my father!

65
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:19,009
This is a picture of my dad!

66
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,679
That's the guy
that comes in the frame.

67
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,349
No, it's my dad.
I'll show you.

68
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,518
I thought your dad was in prison.

69
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,311
No, that's my stepdad.

70
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,023
My real dad's the one that
ran out on us before I was born.

71
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,610
How have you never been on "Oprah"?

72
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,945
Look, see? This is him.

73
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:44,368
My mother gave me this picture
before she died. Same guy!

74
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,122
This is a picture of the frame guy...

75
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,709
...posing in front of
a blue screen with a collie.

76
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,837
It's not a blue screen.
It's just...

77
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:59,383
Maybe it was just
really clear that day.

78
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,178
Okay, I have to talk
to my grandmother.

79
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,348
Wait a minute, honey!

80
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,773
I'm trying to get my boss's
ex-wife to sleep with me.

81
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:20,403
But when Phoebe has a problem,
everyone's all ears!

82
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:25,618
Esther Livingston.

83
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,453
Gone!

84
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,873
Hi, Pooh.

85
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,208
Hi, Gram. What you doing?

86
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,170
Just updating the phone book.

87
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,465
Gram?

88
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:43,469
Can I see the pictures
of my dad again?

89
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,722
Sure, sure.

90
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:47,764
How come?

91
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,601
Just, you know, to see him.

92
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,771
Sure. Here.

93
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,108
This is the one
of your father in a meadow.

94
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,279
And helping a little boy fly a kite.

95
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,825
And here he is at a graduation.

96
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,037
Another graduation.

97
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,750
Another graduation.

98
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,211
Is this really my father?

99
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,714
Is it really your fa...?

100
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,258
Well, of course it is.

101
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,431
I smell smoke. Maybe because
someone's pants are on fire!

102
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,184
In all the years we've been
grandmother and granddaughter...

103
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,853
...you've never lied.

104
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:40,984
All right, that's not your father.
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

105
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,403
Oh, God.

106
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,739
It was your mother's idea.

107
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,366
She didn't want you
to know your real father...

108
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,869
...because he hurt her so much.

109
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,704
I didn't want to do it.

110
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:57,835
But then she died
and it was harder to argue with her.

111
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,296
Not impossible, but harder.

112
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:06,594
All right. So he's not
a famous tree surgeon?

113
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:14,351
And I guess he doesn't live in a hut
in Burma where there's no phones?

114
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,646
Last I heard, he was
a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

115
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,481
That makes no sense.

116
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:24,361
Why would the villagers
worship a pharmacist?

117
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,614
Honey.

118
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:34,037
Anyway, that's all I know.

119
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,666
That...

120
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,336
...and this.

121
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,923
This...

122
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,594
...is the real him.

123
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,225
I remember my father
all dressed up in the red suit...

124
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,561
...the big black boots
and the patent leather belt...

125
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,773
...sneaking around downstairs.
He didn't want us to see him...

126
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:06,654
...but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash
into something and wake everybody up.

127
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,990
That doesn't sound like
a very merry Christmas.

128
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,869
Who said anything about Christmas?

129
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,998
Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

130
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,541
No, nothing.

131
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,084
I hope she's okay.

132
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,796
I know exactly
what she's going through.

133
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,006
How do you know that?

134
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,176
She told us.

135
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,763
What do you got there, Monica?

136
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,181
Stuff for the party.

137
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,267
Aren't you guys
supposed to be shopping?

138
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,103
You didn't buy presents yet?

139
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,064
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!
What are you gonna do?

140
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:46,735
Don't you have to be
Claymation to say that?

141
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,988
I don't think the mailman
liked your cookies.

142
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:53,617
The ornaments your mom sent.

143
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:00,708
Maybe the mailman liked the cookies.
We just didn't give him enough.

144
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,337
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

145
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,220
Hey, Rach.

146
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,348
I think I know what will
make you feel better.

147
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,267
How about you make a list about me?

148
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,729
Forget it.
I'm not gonna stand here...

149
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,105
...and make a list...

150
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,274
Okay, you're whiny...

151
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,736
...you are obsessive,
you are insecure...

152
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,321
...you're gutless.

153
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,615
You don't ever just "seize the day".

154
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:36,869
You liked me for a year
and you didn't do anything about it.

155
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:41,832
And you wear too much
of that gel in your hair.

156
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,544
See, there...

157
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,463
All right, you did what I said.

158
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,759
And you know what?
You're right. I do feel better.

159
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,553
Thank you, Ross.

160
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:04,479
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have
the number of Frank Buffay?

161
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,525
Okay. In lthaca?

162
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,403
All right, Saratoga?

163
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,822
Oneonta?

164
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:18,952
You know what? You shouldn't
call yourself Information!

165
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:28,003
Hello, Grandma. If that is,
in fact, your real name.

166
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,549
Come on now, Pooh.
Don't still be mad at me.

167
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,303
- How's it going?
- Not so good.

168
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,682
Upstate's pretty big.
He's pretty small. You do the math.

169
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:44,353
Well, I think you're
better off without him.

170
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,688
Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.

171
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:50,067
But to me, he's still
the irresponsible creep...

172
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:55,155
...who locked up your mom
and stole her Gremlin.

173
00:10:55,405 --> 00:11:01,077
I know. I just wanted to know
who he was, you know?

174
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,623
Yeah, I know.

175
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,836
I wasn't completely honest with you
when I said I didn't know...

176
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,423
...exactly where he lived.

177
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,258
What do you mean?

178
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:20,097
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive
in Middletown.

179
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,392
If you hit the Dairy Queen,
you've gone too far.

180
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:27,020
You can take my cab.

181
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,065
Thank you.

182
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:34,987
- Nobody else drives that cab.
- Got it.

183
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,447
I'm gonna see my dad!

184
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,159
Thank you.

185
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,498
Wish me luck, Grandpa.

186
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,841
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

187
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,176
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

188
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,262
Hop in!

189
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,140
She'd better get here.
The stores close at 7.

190
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,143
It'll be two hours
to Phoebe's dad's house...

191
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,437
...they'll meet, chat,
swap life stories.

192
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,899
We'll have plenty of time.

193
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,319
Hey, here she comes!

194
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,494
Can you believe this?

195
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,581
In, like, two hours
I'm gonna have a dad.

196
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,374
Yeah, big stuff!

197
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,835
Okay, let's go!

198
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,588
Here, you have to hold this.

199
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,135
"Brake, left. Gas, right"?

200
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,220
That's my cheat sheet.

201
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,351
- Where's my seat belt?
- There isn't one.

202
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,396
The paramedics had to cut through it.

203
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,910
Come on, just tell me.
Please, please!

204
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,582
For the 16th time:
No, I do not think you're obsessive!

205
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,585
- It's hot in here!
- Rach, get the heat.

206
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:16,380
Ross, turn the heat down, please?

207
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,757
The difference between obsessive...

208
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,091
Ross, the heat!

209
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:25,806
Okay! Heat, heat, heat!
And I'm the obsessive one?

210
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,434
This way is on.

211
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:32,479
So this is...

212
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,108
...off.

213
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,402
Did you just break the radiator?

214
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,488
No, I was turning the knob and...

215
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,782
...here it is.

216
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,494
Well, put it back!

217
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,830
It won't go back.

218
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,124
I'll call the super.

219
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,709
Here, let me try.

220
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:58,255
That's right. I forgot about
your ability to fuse metal.

221
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,132
Hey, it's Funny's cousin...

222
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,633
...Not Funny!

223
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,177
Hi, Mr. Treeger?

224
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,346
It's Rachel Greene from upstairs.

225
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,599
Yes, somebody broke our knob
on the radiator...

226
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:12,019
...and it's really hot in here.

227
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,398
Yes, it's hot enough
to bake cookies.

228
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,277
Could we have a new one by 6?

229
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,904
Tuesday?
We can't wait until Tuesday.

230
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,698
We're having a party tonight.

231
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,408
Okay, tip the man.

232
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,910
If he doesn't like
our cookies, too bad.

233
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,412
I won't be blackmailed.

234
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,914
Look, if it gets a little warm...

235
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,792
...it can be a theme party.

236
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:39,380
Here's a theme:
"Come on in, live like bacon!"

237
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,257
This is it!

238
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,136
Seventy-four.

239
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,514
So that's what this is for!

240
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,643
This is it.
I'm gonna meet my dad.

241
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,562
This is like
the biggest thing ever.

242
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,230
Sure is.

243
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,108
Here I go. I'm going in.

244
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,234
All right!

245
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:03,654
Good luck, Pheebs.

246
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,948
Here I go.

247
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,285
Here I go.

248
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,413
I'm going.

249
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,928
Welcome to our tropical
Christmas party.

250
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:33,266
Put your coats, sweaters,
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

251
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,561
It's hard to tell
because I'm sweating...

252
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:41,400
...but I use exactly
what the gel bottle says.

253
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:48,323
An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?

254
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,035
Ice?

255
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:56,373
Ice? Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin.

256
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,752
Monica!

257
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,338
Your guests are turning into jerky.

258
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:05,299
Really?
I'm perfectly comfortable.

259
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,553
Hey! Get in line, buddy.
I was next.

260
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:13,891
Mr. Treeger.

261
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,102
You said there was a party.

262
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,479
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

263
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,816
Is it hot?
My body always stays cool.

264
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,236
Probably because I have so much skin.

265
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,739
Hey, cheese!

266
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,576
Here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash.

267
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,912
Rachel, give him your earrings.
Something. Anything!

268
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,706
No, I will not cave.

269
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:38,832
I'm with Mon.

270
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:42,419
All right. You know how you say
I never seize the day?

271
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:47,507
Even though he's your super,
I'm seizing.

272
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,135
Mr. Treeger?

273
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:54,514
Here is $50.
Merry Christmas.

274
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,767
I didn't get you anything.

275
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,520
Here's five back.

276
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,523
No, that's your Christmas tip.

277
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:07,236
Do you think there's a chance
you can fix that radiator now?

278
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,738
No can do.
Like I told the girl...

279
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,365
...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

280
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,118
Ross?

281
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,995
He's playing baseball.

282
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:19,373
You mean hardball?

283
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,043
Whatever.

284
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,294
What you gonna do?

285
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,630
Excuse me. I'm seizing.

286
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,216
Mr. Treeger?

287
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,218
Here's another 50.

288
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,970
Happy Hanukkah.

289
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,891
Will this help
with the knob-getting?

290
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,019
No, the place is not open
till Tuesday.

291
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,440
Am I not saying it right?

292
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,067
So you really did like my cookies?

293
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:52,656
Yeah, they were so personal.
It really showed you cared.

294
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,287
Nice seizing...

295
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:01,707
...gel boy.

296
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:08,297
Is this mistletoe?

297
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,424
No, that...

298
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:14,011
That is basil.

299
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:20,767
If it was mistletoe,
I was gonna kiss you.

300
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,730
No, it's still basil.

301
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:31,945
<i>Chestnuts roasting on an open fire</i>

302
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:38,202
<i>Jack Frost nipping at your nose</i>

303
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,829
- How far did you get?
- Mailbo x.

304
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,292
All right, we're getting closer.

305
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,294
What's going on?

306
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,255
It's just like
a whole mess of stuff.

307
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:55,052
Like yesterday, my dad was
this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

308
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,680
And you know, now he's
a pharmacist guy and...

309
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:03,018
Well, maybe he's this
really cool pharmacist guy.

310
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:07,564
Yeah, maybe!
And I'll knock on the door...

311
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,026
...and he'll hug me,
and I'll have a dad!

312
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,946
I'll go to his pharmacy and
everyone will be nice to me...

313
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,950
...because, you know,
I'm Frank's daughter.

314
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,120
So why not go knock?

315
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:28,793
Because, I mean, what if
he's not this great-dad guy?

316
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:35,133
What if he's still the dirtbag
who ran out on my mom and us?

317
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,430
You know what?

318
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,643
I've already lost
a fake dad this week.

319
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:48,897
I don't think I'm ready
to lose a real one.

320
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:55,112
Pheebs, that's okay.
You took a big step today.

321
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,992
Someday, when you're ready,
you'll make it past the hedges.

322
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,871
And when you do,
he'll be lucky to have you.

323
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:07,166
You guys...

324
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,337
Sorry about your shopping.

325
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:16,008
Oh, that's okay.
We'll figure something out.

326
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,345
I know you're not going in there...

327
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:23,808
...but you think it's okay
if I go in and use his bathroom?

328
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,477
That's fine, never mind.

329
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,188
Cool, snow!

330
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,900
Kind of like a blank canvas.

331
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:46,080
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap,
is it hot in here!

332
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,916
You mind if I turn the heat down?

333
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,544
We could have used
that kind of thinking earlier!

334
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,629
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

335
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,049
Oh, I couldn't go in.

336
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,218
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

337
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,179
Yeah, it's okay,
because I know he's there.

338
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,306
So that's enough for now.

339
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,684
Hey, it's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

340
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:12,398
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

341
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,316
The knob was broken...

342
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:19,613
...so I turned it off from underneath.
I hope that's all right.

343
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,335
Rach, these are for you.

344
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,629
Wiper blades!

345
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,547
I don't even have a car.

346
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:43,387
No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do!

347
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:48,392
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

348
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:54,190
Toilet-seat covers!

349
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:58,568
Is that what you did
while I got gas?

350
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,280
You guys!

351
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,698
And for Ross...

352
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:06,160
...Mr. Sweet Tooth.

353
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:11,290
You got me a cola drink?

354
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,877
And a lemon-lime!

355
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:21,800
Well, this is too much! I feel like
I should get you another sweater.

356
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,138
And last, but not least...

357
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,767
They're ribbed for your pleasure!
