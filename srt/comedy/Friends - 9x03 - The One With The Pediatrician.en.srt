1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,968
So, what's the big news you had us
rush all the way over here for?

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:13,222
Our news. My company has asked me
to head up our office in Tulsa.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,807
So as of Monday,
I'm being officially relocated.

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,726
- Oh, my God!
- What? Monday?

5
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:21,271
- How long do you have to go for?
- They said it could be up to a year.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,774
- A year?
- Well, do you have to go?

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,445
Well, I kind of have to, don't I?

8
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,574
Because of this stupid thing.

9
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,996
There's nothing like the support
of your loving wife, huh?

10
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,499
Wait a minute.
Wait, you can't go to Tulsa.

11
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,628
Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets
to the Jets game next week!

12
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,590
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'll be able to make it.

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,926
But we were gonna go see the Jets!

14
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:57,141
You can't go. I mean, you're the glue
that holds this group together.

15
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,018
- Really?
- Not you.

16
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,649
I can't believe you guys are moving.

17
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,613
- I call their apartment!
- No!

18
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,991

21
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,362
- Here you go, Rach.
- Thank you, Joey.

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,990
You know what?
I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.

23
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:59,245
I went through this with Ben and Carol.
One coffee won't affect your milk.

24
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:03,332
Just to be sure,
I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.

25
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,380
Every time?

26
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,175
You don't have to call him
whenever you have a question, okay?

27
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:18,138
- Trust me. I know this.
- All right. I trust you.

28
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,058
I can see you dialing.
I don't understand why...

29
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,770
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?

30
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:30,443
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel
with a baby. It's just so grownup.

31
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,947
I know, yeah.
I feel like we're all growing up.

32
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,824
A person named "Wiener."
God, that kills me.

33
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:43,038
- Look at you all grownup.
- Well, actually, you know what?

34
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,957
I am, you know?

35
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,001
Well, that whole thing
with Rachel made me realize...

36
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,839
...that maybe I'm ready for a more
serious relationship, you know?

37
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,551
Like, I'd like to meet a nice,
mature, commitment-minded lady.

38
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,804
And looks aren't as important as...

39
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,764
Nah, she's gotta be hot.

40
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,767
You know, I might know somebody.

41
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,729
How about you set me up
with someone, and we double-date?

42
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,189
I can do that. Yeah.
How's Friday?

43
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,399
- Done!
- All right.

44
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,734
Good, really?
Okay, let's see.

45
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,987
All right.

46
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,991
You know who's great?
Sandy Poopack.

47
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,494
"Poopack"?

48
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,501
Yeah. All right.
Well, that rules out Lana Titwyler.

49
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,093
- I've got good news.
- You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?

50
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,763
Okay, I have news.

51
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,850
You don't have to move to Tulsa.
You can stay here and keep your job.

52
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,434
That's great! How?

53
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:50,064
My boss and I worked out a deal
where I'm in Tulsa four days a week.

54
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,357
So the other three,
I can be here with you.

55
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,195
So you're gonna be gone
four days a week?

56
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,238
No.

57
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,700
I'm sorry, are you just
used to saying that?

58
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,164
No. I can't be away
from you for that long.

59
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,541
- Really?
- Yeah, you're my husband.

60
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,046
I won't live in a different state
than you for 208 days out of the year.

61
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:19,301
That's fast math.
We could use you in Tulsa.

62
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:26,183
Thanks for trying to figure out a way,
but if you go to Tulsa, I go with you.

63
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,602
You said that without gagging.

64
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,563
I know!

65
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,901
Well, excuse me?

66
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,946
Oh, yeah?
Well, up yours too!

67
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:44,034
- Who the hell was that?
- Dr. Wiener.

68
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,581
Rach, you can't call people
at 3:00 in the morning.

69
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,002
You know what?
You sound just like his wife.

70
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,504
Was there anything
even wrong with Emma?

71
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,758
Yes, of course there is!
Okay? I'm not insane.

72
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,510
What was it?

73
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,429
Hiccups.

74
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,851
I told you, you can't call him
every time any little thing comes up.

75
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,979
Well, not anymore I can't.
He fired us!

76
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,734
What are we gonna do?
We have to find a pediatrician.

77
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,529
Wait, Monica said that
when you guys were growing up...

78
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,948
...you liked your doctor.
What was his name?

79
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,283
Dr. Gettleman?

80
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,161
Yeah, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

81
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,622
In fact, I think he's dead.

82
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,875
Why does everything happen to me?

83
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,379
I promise, first thing tomorrow,
we'll find another doctor.

84
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,091
But I gotta get up early,
and I'm not feeling well.

85
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,219
You're not feeling well?
What do you have? Rubella?

86
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,513
Because don't go near Emma,
she has not had that shot.

87
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,642
You know, come to think of it,
it does feel rubella-like.

88
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,447
Wiener!

89
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,616
Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

90
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,825
Rachel!

91
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,204
Great! Now he's gonna
know it was me!

92
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,839
So how is this
for our big double date tonight?

93
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,341
Oh, my God.

94
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,055
Great. Just the reaction
I was hoping for.

95
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,892
Yeah, so you found someone for me?
You didn't forget?

96
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,519
Of course not.
And you'll love Mary Ellen.

97
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,273
She's really smart and cute
and funny and...

98
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:43,821
I can't tell you how I know this,
but she is not opposed to threesomes.

99
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,031
All right.

100
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:50,869
- So tell me something about my guy.
- No.

101
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,457
Come on, give me something.
What's his name?

102
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,294
- Mike.
- Mike. Okay, what's his last name?

103
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,715
Damn it! Is there no mystery left
in romance anymore?!

104
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,094
We'll see you and Mike
at the restaurant in a couple hours.

105
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:11,223
All right, great.
See you. Bye-bye.

106
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:16,102
Why'd I have to say Mike? I don't know
a Mike! Why couldn't I have said...?

107
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,149
There's no guys in there!

108
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:27,072
It's impossible to find a good doctor.
How do you know the good ones...

109
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,868
...from the ones who'll push
their penis against your knee?

110
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,329
Excuse me?

111
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,706
I know what she's talking about.

112
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,339
Well, we've gotta find
a new pediatrician.

113
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,550
Ross was getting sick last night,
and Emma may have caught it.

114
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,678
- Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?
- Ross said he died.

115
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,931
He didn't die.
I just saw his daughter last week.

116
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:58,520
She said he was fine.
Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.

117
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,356
Great. Well then, I'm gonna
take Emma to see him.

118
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,358
I wonder why Ross said that he died?

119
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,361
Maybe he confused him
with his childhood therapist.

120
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,654
He saw a therapist?

121
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,783
He used to have a recurring nightmare.
It freaked him out.

122
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,035
Wow, what was it?

123
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,953
That I was going to eat him.

124
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,219
Mike!

125
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,264
Yeah?

126
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,060
Okay.

127
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,275
I can't believe
I'm doing this with you.

128
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,903
Although I did just end
a nine-year relationship...

129
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,155
...so I should be open
to taking some risks.

130
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,074
It'll be fine.
Follow my lead, okay?

131
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,242
All you have to do is
pretend to be Mike.

132
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,411
- I am Mike.
- Attaboy.

133
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,041
Here they come.

134
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,418
- I'm Phoebe.
- Phoebe. Mike. How you doing?

135
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,588
- Nice to meet you.
- Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.

136
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:10,217
So, Mike, how do you and Joey
know each other, anyway?

137
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,889
How do Joey and I know each other?

138
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:20,227
If I had a nickel for every time
somebody's asked me that.

139
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,314
- From school.
- We met in college.

140
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,527
I mean high school.

141
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,116
You guys go way back, then.
So, what are you up to these days?

142
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:38,496
- Well, I'm a lawyer.
- Mike, attorney at law!

143
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,248
- Actually, I just gave up my practice.
- What?

144
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:45,418
That's the kind of thing
you usually run by me.

145
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:50,257
I want to play piano professionally.
If I don't do this now, I never will.

146
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,842
Great. I like that better
than the lawyer thing.

147
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,930
Which is why I waited until now
to introduce you to Mike.

148
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,099
You thought he was still a lawyer.

149
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,478
No, that's not what I meant.
Let's get you a cocktail.

150
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,233
What are you doing?

151
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,111
Looking for restaurant jobs
for you in Tulsa.

152
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,322
That's so sweet.
Did you find anything?

153
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,199
- Slim Pickins.
- Nothing, huh?

154
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:20,370
No. Slim Pickins.
It's a barbecue joint.

155
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,208
They're looking for a cook. Actually,
"cook" may be a bit of a stretch.

156
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,919
They're looking for somebody
to shovel mesquite.

157
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,797
"Slim Pickins"? That is so cheesy.

158
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,842
Well, So Cheesy also has an opening.

159
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,804
Honey, that's okay.
I know this woman, Nancy...

160
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:40,015
...who's a restaurant biz headhunter.
She may know something.

161
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,851
Can I say how much I appreciate
you coming with me?

162
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:47,898
When we get to Tulsa, I am taking you
for a great dinner at Slim Pickins.

163
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:49,525
So Cheesy?

164
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,737
Whole Hog?

165
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,283
It's gonna be tough
to keep kosher in Tulsa.

166
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,248
Hi, Nancy?
Hi, it's Monica Geller.

167
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:10,963
I'm good. Listen, I'm looking
for a job in Tulsa.

168
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,842
Yeah, well, my husband's
been relocated.

169
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,553
Because I love him.

170
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,388
No, I don't want a job in New York.

171
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,767
Javu's looking? Oh, my God!

172
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:27,938
He asked for me personally?
Oh, my God!

173
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,566
Wow, this is really,
really flattering.

174
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,611
But I'm moving to Tulsa.

175
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,364
So, just, if you would tell Javu...

176
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,909
...I'll take it!

177
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:44,288
My name's Rachel Greene.
I have an appointment for Emma.

178
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:48,417
Dr. Gettleman is finishing up
with a patient. He'll be out shortly.

179
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,212
I think you just have a cold.
It's definitely not strep.

180
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,714
Thanks, doctor.

181
00:11:56,592 --> 00:12:00,805
- Would you like a lollipop?
- Do you even have to ask?

182
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,894
He is alive!

183
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,403
It's so surprising that you and Joey
have known each other for so long...

184
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,239
...and I've never heard about you.

185
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:22,785
That's because we had
a bit of a falling out.

186
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,954
Mike hit my mom with a car.

187
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:32,378
- No, I didn't.
- That's okay. I have forgiven you.

188
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,838
Now we're friends again,
and everything's great.

189
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,757
Well, wait. Is your mom okay?

190
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,802
Please, we're trying
to have a conversation.

191
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,139
You're a lot nicer
on "Days of Our Lives."

192
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,892
"Days of Our Lives"!
That's why you look so familiar!

193
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,184
- What?
- What?

194
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,478
What?

195
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,816
Do you not know each other?

196
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,572
Of course we do. He's playing a game
we used to play in high school.

197
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,076
We pretend we don't know each other.
We played all kinds of games.

198
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,747
You remember that one where I punch
you in the face for not being cool?

199
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:14,127
Let me ask you something:
How many sisters does Joey have?

200
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:18,465
- Six.
- What are you doing? I said seven!

201
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:24,346
Joey, why did you set me up
with a stranger?

202
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:28,517
Because I forgot about our date.
I'm so sorry.

203
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,104
I'm sorry too. And just to be clear,
I didn't hit his mother with a car.

204
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,401
You are unbelievable. I spent so much
time finding the perfect girl for you.

205
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,613
Mary Ellen is really smart
and cute and loose.

206
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,452
Who are you kidding?

207
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,792
You find some guy
off the street for me?

208
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,961
God, this is humiliating!

209
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,299
I'm so sorry. If you don't like this guy,
I can find you a better one.

210
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,218
Mike? Mike?

211
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,387
I'm out of here.

212
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,723
It was nice meeting you.

213
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,226
- You're leaving too?
- I'll stay if you can tell me my name.

214
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,603
Have a good night.

215
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,735
We leave tomorrow,
and you still have a lot to pack.

216
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,028
You're right.

217
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,697
Maybe I shouldn't go.

218
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,867
What?

219
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:31,747
So Nancy told me about this job
at this great restaurant, Javu?

220
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,166
But it's just
a little outside of Tulsa.

221
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,667
Well, how far outside?

222
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,045
Manhattan?

223
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,259
And you're thinking of taking it?

224
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,597
Before, you said that being with me
was more important than any job.

225
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:53,685
But I guess now it's
old job, me, new job.

226
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,189
I'm gonna miss this hand!

227
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,942
I know this is a lot to ask...

228
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,154
...but, my God, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

229
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:07,366
What happened to "you can't live
without me four days a week"?

230
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:12,663
Well, if you really think about it,
I mean, four days is not that long.

231
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,623
I see you Monday
before you go to work...

232
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,541
...and Thursday when you get back...

233
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,420
...and I always work late on Tuesdays,
so really if you think about it...

234
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,005
...it's really just one day.

235
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:27,177
And well, if we can't make it one day,
we got real problems, my friend.

236
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,476
- I think you should take the job.
- Really?

237
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:38,731
I know it must be important to you
when you start chattering like a monkey.

238
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,985
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

239
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,785
- How was the pediatrician?
- I really liked him.

240
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:56,624
Yeah, yeah.
It was really, really, really good.

241
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:00,419
- You promised not to say anything.
- I know.

242
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,839
Ross still sees his pediatrician!

243
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,634
I don't care.

244
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,806
Are you serious?
You still see Dr. Gettleman?

245
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,933
He is a brilliant diagnostician!

246
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,853
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

247
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,315
Seriously, you gotta go
to an appropriate doctor.

248
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:25,652
Why? I know it's a little weird,
but he is a great doctor, okay?

249
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,571
He knows my medical history.

250
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,615
And every time I go in there,
he makes a big deal.

251
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,327
You know,
"Look, it's my favorite patient."

252
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,247
Does he say that before he sticks
his thermometer in your tushy?

253
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:42,002
I seem to remember someone bringing
his security blanket to college.

254
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:45,131
That was not a security blanket.
That was a wall hanging.

255
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,341
It didn't spend much time on the wall!

256
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,353
Excuse me.

257
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,565
Hi. I was hoping to run into you.
Can we talk?

258
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,025
Sure.

259
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:08,863
I'm sorry, really.
I'm so embarrassed...

260
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,073
...that our...

261
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:17,496
Really, I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just ask my parole officer.

262
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:23,877
Apparently, I'm not a funny guy.

263
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:29,007
Well, why did you go along with that?

264
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:34,430
Because I was told that I'd get
a free dinner, which I didn't.

265
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,808
And that I'd meet a pretty girl,
which I did.

266
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,312
That's true.

267
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,026
Well, is anything you told me
about yourself true?

268
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:51,196
My name is Mike.
And I do play piano.

269
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:55,159
- Prove it.
- There isn't a piano here.

270
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:58,912
That wouldn't stand in the way
of a true pianist.

271
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,081
Okay.

272
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,099
You are really good.

273
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:27,024
- I play a little guitar myself.
- Really? That's great.

274
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,861
- What kind of music do you play?
- Like acoustic, folksy stuff, you know?

275
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:35,865
But right now I'm working on
a couple Iron Maiden covers.

276
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:43,081
Do you think that, maybe,
sometime, I could...

277
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,709
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

278
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,839
Okay. You think, maybe,
sometime I could take you out?

279
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,717
You just caught me off guard.

280
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,678
Yeah, that would be nice.

281
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,473
Look at this! My two best friends!

282
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,606
Excuse me.
I don't mean to be a jerk...

283
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,318
...but the baby with the rash
came in after me.

284
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:15,280
The doctor will be right with you, sir.

285
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,869
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.

286
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,664
What, the circus?
He's behind the elephant.

287
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:27,584
Wow. So your child's a big fan
of the Waldo books too?

288
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:32,965
Yeah, that's how I know.

289
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,718
- I'm Ross, by the way.
- Hi, I'm Sally.

290
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:40,639
So no ring. Can I assume
you're also a single parent?

291
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:44,602
- I am a single parent.
- It's hard, isn't it?

292
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,272
There's no time for a social life.
Where are you gonna meet someone?

293
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,028
Let's say, I don't know, you met
someone in the pediatrician's office.

294
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,615
Rossie? We're ready for you.

295
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,625
Yeah...

296
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,757
Come on, Ross Jr.
It's time to go in.

297
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,051
Mommy.

298
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,099
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?

299
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,644
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!

300
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,237
- Good, you haven't left yet.
- Where have you been?

301
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,824
I got held up
at Dr. Gettleman's office.

302
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:45,704
There was some guy
that freaked everybody out.

303
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:48,582
You got here just in time.
I really have to go, buddy.

304
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,791
Oh, man.

305
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,795
- Promise to call me when you land?
- Of course I will. I love you.

306
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,130
I love you too.

307
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:04,181
Watch the tongue, people.
We got a baby over here.

308
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:07,559
- Bye, Chandler.
- Bye.

309
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,020
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

310
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:18,278
- What's the matter, Joe?
- I'm mad at you for leaving.

311
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:22,241
You know, you're nothing
but a big leaver.

312
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,952
A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.

313
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:32,668
Any chance you're trying to pick
a fight to make all of this easier?

314
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,674
Dude, you see right through me!

315
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,976
Okay, well... Bye, Mon.

316
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,688
Bye, Ross. Rachel.

317
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,441
- Bye, Emma.
- Okay, bye-bye.

318
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,820
Have a good trip. Okay.
Oh, my God.

319
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,784
Wait.

320
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:10,164
It goes old job...

321
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,416
...new job...

322
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:13,792
...and you.

323
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,963
This is just something I have to do.

324
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,591
I know.

325
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,093
I love you so much.

326
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:25,888
I know that too.

327
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:40,193
Don't worry.
I'll be back before you know it.

328
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,112
Yes, it will be the same.

329
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,490
