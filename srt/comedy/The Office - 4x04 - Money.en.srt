1
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:06,124
Coat!

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,027
Michael just rent <i>The Devil wears Prada</i>.

3
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:12,806
He has his netflix
sent here to the office

4
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:16,177
and he watches them in pieces
when things are slow.

5
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:18,315
Steak!

6
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:22,074
Where's my steak?

7
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:24,820
He's a big Meryl Streep fan,
so I shouldn't be surprised

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,780
that he's identified with her character.

9
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:28,386
Get me Armani.

10
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:29,756
A suit?

11
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,022
On the phone.

12
00:00:31,182 --> 00:00:33,303
The main company number?
'Cause I'm gonna have to...

13
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:34,555
Where's Armani?

14
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:36,498
He's on the phone.
Too slow.

15
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:38,417
You're not going to Paris.

16
00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:40,693
I'm so much better than you are.

17
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:55,851
I owe you an apology.

18
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:58,894
- You finished the movie.
- Yeah, it was awesome.

19
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:00,981
Big surprise ending.
Won't ruin it for you.

20
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:02,618
No, go ahead.

21
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:05,939
Meryl Streep is the bad guy.
You never see it coming.

22
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:10,991
Anyway, if I was mean
in any way to you, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,881
I just want what's best for you,
Minushka.

24
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:21,577
Macushla.

25
00:01:21,737 --> 00:01:23,730
He's watching <i>Million Dollar Baby</i>.

26
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,517
He's gonna try to kill me.

"MONEY"

62
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:04,761
So this one goes with my eyes
and this one goes with your eyes.

63
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,908
People said I have very pretty eyes.

64
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:09,007
- You do.
- I haven't heard the same about you.

65
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:10,789
So let's just go with mine.

66
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,546
Well they both go
with the carpet that I've ordered.

67
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:16,348
And if we go with the brown
leather sofas, they go with that too.

68
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:19,150
- We already have a sofa, so why d...
- A futon's not a sofa.

69
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,979
It folds up.
You've only seen it flat.

70
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,311
- I know what a futon is, Michael.
- I... Okay.

71
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:25,752
How much is it gonna cost?

72
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,921
- It costs what it costs.
- No...

73
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,487
- It doesn't even mean anything.
- We've gone through this.

74
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:31,594
Yes!

75
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,833
Money has been
a little bit tight lately.

76
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:35,924
But at the end of my life,

77
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:38,403
when I'm sitting on my yacht,

78
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:40,734
am I gonna be thinking
about how much money I have?

79
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:45,626
No, I'm gonna be thinking about
how many friends I have

80
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:49,040
and my children
and my comedy albums.

81
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:53,945
I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously
did pretty well, money-wise.

82
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:58,567
It's just, you know,
you say it's gonna cost what...

83
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,435
- Yeah?
- <i>Michael, it's Ryan for you.</i>

84
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,353
Conniving little runt...
Put him through.

85
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:06,609
Put him through.
Yes? Ryan, my man!

86
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,049
- <i>I email you about the new Powerpoint.</i>
- Yes, thanks for sending that to me.

87
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,910
<i>I had I.T. install the updated
Powerpoint on your computer</i>

88
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,283
<i>so you can use it for the presentation.
I really want people use Powerpoint.</i>

89
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,529
Okay, yeah.
No, I don't know.

90
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:20,821
I don't know.
I think those I.T. guys messed up.

91
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,999
- <i>Hold on, I get them on the phone.</i>
- Wait, no, here it is... Found it.

92
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,930
Sure, I can hold.

93
00:03:27,494 --> 00:03:29,444
Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute.

94
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:30,804
Please hold.

95
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:44,978
Schrute farms.
Guttentag.

96
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:46,429
How can help you?

97
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:49,107
Yes,
we have availability on those nights.

98
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,981
How many in your party?

99
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:54,071
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
No king beds.

100
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,447
No queen either.

101
00:03:57,234 --> 00:04:00,857
We make our own mattresses that
don't conform to the traditional sizes.

102
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:03,037
Closest would be twin.

103
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:05,566
Thank you so much for calling.
Call back again.

104
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:07,008
Auf wiedersehen.

105
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:12,130
- Hey Dwight.
- None of your business, Jim.

106
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,758
- You running a bed and breakfast?
- It's not a B & B.

107
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,975
Agro-tourism is a lot more
than a bed and breakfast.

108
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:21,280
It consists of tourists
coming to a farm,

109
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,040
showing them around,

110
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,770
giving them a bed,

111
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:26,715
giving them breakfast.

112
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:32,253
- Department of Health know about this?
- I am not telling you anything.

113
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:34,046
Permits are pending.

114
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,229
Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.

115
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,532
- I'm looking for a room.
- Okay, this is a misuse

116
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:39,954
of company phones.

117
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,494
It says here you cater to the elderly.

118
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:44,981
- Where did you read that?
- Trip Advisor.

119
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:50,544
Trip Advisor is the lifeblood
of the agro-tourism industry.

120
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:53,715
A couple of bad reviews there,
you may as well close up shop.

121
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,839
That's what took down the Stalk Inn,

122
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:58,385
one of the cutest little asparagus farms
you'll ever see.

123
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:01,638
How many in your party?

124
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,336
Two.

125
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:05,976
We offer our tours of the fields
and of the barn.

126
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:11,022
Perhaps you'd be interested
in Mose's table-making demonstration.

127
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,869
So, I forgot to tell you
that I need the car tonight.

128
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:16,987
Actually, I need the car.

129
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:18,947
Why?
For improv?

130
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:21,032
Why don't you just

131
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:23,168
pretend that you have a car?

132
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:25,120
Good practice in case you ever

133
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,581
do a scene where you need
to pretend you have a car.

134
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:29,256
Used to have two cars.

135
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,680
Tred 'em in.
Now we're down to one.

136
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:33,807
Good economic sense.

137
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:36,504
Although the new car's a Porsche...

138
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:37,664
For her.

139
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:39,666
One cardigan.

140
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:43,067
One sleeping cardigan.

141
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:46,602
One sleep apnea mask.

142
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,724
What about my cherub figurine?

143
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,065
You took that with you.

144
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:55,449
No, I left it on my night tab...

145
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:57,694
Your night table by the lamp.

146
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,332
You are incorrect.

147
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:03,508
I was recently scrubbing my room
of memories and I didn't see it there.

148
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:05,541
Fine.

149
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:07,829
My girlfriend and I broke up recently

150
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:10,412
and I must say I am relieved.

151
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:12,417
Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats.

152
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,171
In the Schrute family,
we have a tradition where

153
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:20,300
when the male has sex with another woman
he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats

154
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,705
left on his doorstep by his parents.

155
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,659
You can use those oats
to make oatmeal, bread...

156
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,661
Whatever you want.
I don't care, they're your oats.

157
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:31,520
The bar uses an applause meter.

158
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:33,824
That is why it is so important

159
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:38,777
that you all come and applaud
only for my band, Scrantonicity 2.

160
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,822
Not Scrantonicity,
which I am no longer a part of.

161
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:46,826
- Michael, can I count on you?
- You cannot, I have a thing tonight.

162
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,759
Damn it.

163
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:53,470
- What?
- That reminds me.

164
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:57,625
If the invitation still stands, Pam
and I would love to have dinner tonight.

165
00:06:58,588 --> 00:06:59,548
Oh, no.

166
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,594
I've a thing tonight.

167
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:03,760
- That stinks.
- Darn it.

168
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:04,970
Shoot.

169
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,238
- How about this weekend?
- No, can't.

170
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:11,262
We only had tonight free and
we really wanted to spend it with you.

171
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,156
Damn it to hell!

172
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:16,565
- All right.
- What do you got going on tonight?

173
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:19,553
You wouldn't understand.
It's a secret.

174
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:22,869
I wouldn't understand or it's a secret?

175
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:24,364
You wouldn't understand, Jim.

176
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:25,943
It's a secret.

177
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:36,568
I'm sorry, Mr. O'Brien.
I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner.

178
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:38,317
I just have a very exciting offer.

179
00:07:38,477 --> 00:07:42,443
My records indicate you've expressed
interest in losing some weight.

180
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:44,554
What if I told you that I have a pill

181
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,160
that will make you 50 pounds lighter
in five minutes?

182
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,569
How would that sound?

183
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:49,755
Amazing, right?

184
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:53,106
Well,
it won't be that fast but it will...

185
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,429
It will be that easy.

186
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:00,066
I can't believe this place is real.

187
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,967
I'd heard about his beet farm for years,

188
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:05,010
- but I never thought...
- The beets motel.

189
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,629
The beets motel?

190
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:09,451
- That is...
- Thank you.

191
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:11,912
Borscht Hotel.

192
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,540
The Embassy Beets.
Radish Inn.

193
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,960
- How are you doing this?
- I don't know.

194
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,791
Oh, my gosh.

195
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,052
I just love sales.

196
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:40,018
I love it to death.

197
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:41,815
It's as simple as that.

198
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:46,290
And I don't get to do enough of it
as a manager, so I took this second job,

199
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:48,650
kind of as a hobby.

200
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:50,905
Some people have golf or...

201
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:52,550
relaxing.

202
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,347
- What's going on here?
- Hey, I just got off the phone

203
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:58,497
and I was gonna make another call.

204
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:02,179
We're a legit operation with a license
from the city. I can show you.

205
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,341
We pay minimum wage against commission.

206
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:05,862
They're with me, so...

207
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:09,719
This is Nick Figaro,
manager to the stars.

208
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:13,261
We have three rooms,
each with a different theme.

209
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:14,557
What are the themes?

210
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:17,644
America, irrigation, and night time.

211
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:20,313
- Irrigation.
- Yes.

212
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,539
I'll put you down for irrigation.

213
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:26,152
Now then, do you have any special needs
or dietary restrictions?

214
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:28,822
Yes, we will be requiring
a bedtime story.

215
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,691
No.

216
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:33,159
- Not even Harry Potter?
- Jim, come on.

217
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,811
- But you promised.
- Mose, bags, now.

218
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:43,503
Here we are, irrigation room.

219
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:45,104
A very special room.

220
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:47,844
So I'll come get you
before the table-making demonstration.

221
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,988
And as of this morning, we're completely
wireless here at Schrute farms.

222
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,555
But as soon as I find out

223
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:56,245
where Mose hid all the wires,
we'll get that power back on.

224
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:57,451
All righty.

225
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,250
Everybody in the conference room
in five minutes.

226
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:11,216
These meetings are useless.

227
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,215
I just want to remind you
to stick to the script.

228
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,994
Been proven to work.
So...

229
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:17,472
make the call,

230
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,267
say the lines,

231
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,750
make the sale.
Got it?

232
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:23,818
Very inspirational.

233
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:30,467
We're offering a $50 bonus tonight
to the guy with the most sales, okay?

234
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:32,865
- Or woman.
- Or a trained seal.

235
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,889
You can make jokes
when you've made a sale there, rookie.

236
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,054
Okay?

237
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:46,024
I'd say one in six.

238
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:48,064
What?

239
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:51,840
I thought you asked me what are chances
were of being murdered here tonight.

240
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:53,893
You know, I just realized

241
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,011
this is Pam's
and my first night away together.

242
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,128
I used to play it over in my head
and it was just a little bit different.

243
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:03,894
Maybe a...

244
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:06,169
nice hotel or a romantic dinner.

245
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,471
Wine...

246
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,049
but wine that wasn't made out of beets.

247
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,196
Didn't think Dwight
would be involved at all.

248
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:15,360
And...

249
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:18,056
I always imagined less manure.

250
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:19,821
I mean, some manure.

251
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:21,896
Just... less.

252
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:24,196
This is beet food.
Mose, what are you doing?

253
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:26,637
No, Mose!
Put the... Put the manure down.

254
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,969
Put it down.
Do not throw it! Do not...

255
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,382
Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?

256
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,808
<i>Yeah, who is this?</i>

257
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:35,856
Well I'm just calling
because you responded positively to...

258
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:39,484
Stanley?

259
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:42,431
Why are you calling me here at home?

260
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:45,532
<i>Señor</i>, are you happy
with your long distance, sir?

261
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:47,126
<i>Michael, I know that's you.</i>

262
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:49,383
<i>Why are you calling me here at home?</i>

263
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:50,805
Have you con...

264
00:11:51,063 --> 00:11:52,884
Have you considered
satellite television?

265
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,306
<i>Michael, I know that's you.
I know your voice.</i>

266
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,842
- All right.
- <i>Why are you calling me here at home?</i>

267
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:02,421
<i>When I'm at home at night
in my own house in my sweats,</i>

268
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:05,096
<i>drinking some red wine,
watching my mystery stories,</i>

269
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,842
<i>the last thing in the whole
godforsaken world I want to hear</i>

270
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:10,066
<i>is the voice of Michael scott.</i>

271
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:12,000
Your son sounds like
he's really motivated.

272
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,968
I think it's crazy
that the coach won't play him, frankly.

273
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:17,212
My office.

274
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:18,372
You bet.

275
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,036
Just dial the number on the sheet
and stick to the script.

276
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:24,256
Say the words exactly.
Got it?

277
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:26,532
I don't know
why we keep having this conversation.

278
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:30,665
Look, I know sales and I had that sale.
I just needed a few more minutes.

279
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:32,560
A few more minutes
is a waste of our time!

280
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,809
- It's not a waste of time.
- It's a trading game.

281
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:37,832
You give a quick pitch.
You make the sale and move on.

282
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:40,513
- That's how Vikram does.
- He doesn't have my people skills.

283
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,974
Good for Vikram
'cause he out-sells you every night.

284
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,146
Well, I hope
this conversation has helped.

285
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:54,528
"And Harry saw
"the white hand raise its wand

286
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:57,097
"and felt Voldemort's surge
"of vicious anger.

287
00:12:57,262 --> 00:13:00,227
"Saw the frail old man on the floor
"writhe in agony.

288
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:01,307
"Harry.

289
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:03,772
"It was over as quickly as it had come.

290
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:07,254
"Harry stood shaking in the darkness,
"clutching the gate into the garden,

291
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:08,708
"his heart racing."

292
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:13,146
What did you get tonight?

293
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:16,925
Oh, it looks like mixed marsala,
eggplant, and rice.

294
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:18,480
Oh, that looks good.

295
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,346
And what about you?
A peanut butter flavor again?

296
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:25,562
I am going
with the vanilla crisp this evening.

297
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:28,311
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

298
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:33,371
I was a surgeon back home.

299
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:34,609
- Really?
- Yeah.

300
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:37,426
- Wonder what I would've been back home.
- This is your home.

301
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:40,957
I know, but I mean,
it's so competitive here.

302
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,420
What's the dollar worth in your land?

303
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:48,164
Medical school must've cost,
like, 40 bucks or a donkey or something.

304
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:49,998
No.

305
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,702
I would've been chief of surgery.

306
00:13:58,248 --> 00:13:59,348
Or a cowboy.

307
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:07,510
- Wait, you're going out there?
- Yeah.

308
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,726
Coward.

309
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:26,857
Oh, my god!

310
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,897
What century is this?

311
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:32,761
Here's the thing about <i>Die Hard 4</i>.

312
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,744
<i>Die Hard 1</i>, the original,

313
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:38,358
John McClain
is just this normal guy, you know?

314
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:43,380
He's just a normal New York city cop
who gets his feet cut, he gets beat up.

315
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:46,766
But he's an everyday guy.
In <i>Die Hard 4</i>,

316
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:50,685
he is jumping a motorcycle
into a helicopter in the air.

317
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,259
You know?
He's invincible.

318
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:55,167
It's just sort of lost from <i>Die Hard 1</i>.

319
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,570
It's not <i>Terminator</i>.

320
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,110
Dude, you should review movies.

321
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,306
Oh, my god, yes!

322
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:04,085
- Yeah, you should!
- I actually wrote a movie.

323
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:05,738
- Really?
- Well I'm writing one.

324
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:08,863
- What's it about?
- Sort of spy thriller.

325
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:10,889
Hey, what's so captivating?

326
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,606
I love captivating things.

327
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:18,555
And this must really be captivating
because it's keeping you off the phones.

328
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:22,138
I mean, time is your money.
That's how I know how captivating it is

329
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:24,701
because of how much time
you've spent talking.

330
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,060
He returned.

331
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:49,724
Come in.

332
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:51,869
Did you have another nightmare?

333
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:04,923
- I thought you were Mose.
- Does Mose have nightmares?

334
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:06,561
Oh, yes.

335
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:08,574
Ever since the storm.

336
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:15,519
Is everything satisfactory
with your stay?

337
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,443
Yeah.

338
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,252
- Yep.
- Great.

339
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,506
Just that I'd heard crying or...

340
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,302
moaning or something in here.

341
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:30,244
Well I'll look into that in the morning.

342
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:35,562
Thank you for bringing that
to the attention of the staff.

343
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:39,099
Good night, Dwight.

344
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:59,049
Hey,
so we're all gonna go out for a beer.

345
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,290
- You wanna come?
- We'd love for you to come.

346
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,832
Thanks, no.
I've to work in the morning, so...

347
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,725
- All right, next time.
- Okay.

348
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:06,929
See you guys.

349
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,954
Hey, how are you doing?

350
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:13,336
You drive.
I had too much wine.

351
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,706
Okay.

352
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:18,082
- How was yoga?
- I didn't go.

353
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:20,967
- Why? Why not?
- I just didn't.

354
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:23,799
How was improv?

355
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:28,060
- Good night, Vikram.
- Night.

356
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,178
- Congrats on the bonus.
- Thank you, Michael.

357
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:31,783
I'll nab it one of these nights.

358
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:34,599
If you concentrate
and make your calls faster, yeah.

359
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:39,605
- Good night.
- Good night.

360
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:53,256
- Morning.
- Hi.

361
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:03,044
Hey Dwight, how are you?

362
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:04,346
Pam.

363
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:07,340
You okay?

364
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:11,510
I'm better than you have ever been
or ever will be.

365
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,603
Hey guys what's happening?

366
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:20,060
How's my favorite branch doing?

367
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:23,314
Michael, why don't you start us off.

368
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:27,318
That wasn't much of an introduction.

369
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:31,197
Ladies and gentlemen,
your boss Michael scott.

370
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,925
Still lame.
Okay.

371
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:35,577
All right...

372
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:41,062
Thank you, Ryan,
for that wonderful introduction.

373
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,823
Okay...

374
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:47,169
Today, we're going to be talking...

375
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,423
about...

376
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:51,761
Powerpoint.

377
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:56,636
Powerpoint, Powerpoint, Powerpoint.

378
00:18:56,796 --> 00:18:58,790
Yes, I forgot about Ryan's presentation

379
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,230
and yes, it would have been nice

380
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,208
to do well with the first presentation
that he'd given me.

381
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:06,656
But you know what else
would've been nice?

382
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:08,150
Winning the lottery.

383
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,817
And the best way to start
is to hit "start".

384
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:17,451
And up comes the tool bar.
That's what she said.

385
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:20,538
What we have to do here

386
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:22,456
is go to "run".

387
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:23,859
And then,

388
00:19:24,982 --> 00:19:26,806
you look up to...

389
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:29,237
Powerpoint

390
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:33,635
and we are in.
We are going to register.

391
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,415
You hit "register".

392
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:38,540
"Updates are ready."
I should update.

393
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,978
"Estimated time 12 minutes."
So it should take about 5 or 7 minutes.

394
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:46,761
Is this the first time
you've opened Powerpoint?

395
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:47,879
Why?

396
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,598
You didn't prepare it, did you?

397
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:53,378
Know what? I had really rough night.
And my boss can back me up on that.

398
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:55,906
- I'm your boss.
- My other boss, Mr. Figaro.

399
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,616
You've another job?

400
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:01,929
What I do beetween 5:30 pm and 1:00 am
is nobody's business

401
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:04,206
but mine and my other businesses.

402
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,833
Are you a cocktail waitress?

403
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:09,371
You cannot have a second job

404
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:11,297
- if it affects your work here.
- It won't.

405
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:12,882
- It did already.
- Okay.

406
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,453
Honestly,

407
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:18,095
it is unlikely
that I was gonna figure this out anyway.

408
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:22,802
- You're so funny.
- Why is Darryl here?

409
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:24,810
- He works in the warehouse.
- I invited him.

410
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,272
It's not a party. Darryl, downstairs,
this isn't information you need.

411
00:20:28,496 --> 00:20:32,132
This information here?
Yeah, you're right. I don't need this.

412
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:37,538
Hey, come on.

413
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:41,243
- See you later tonight.
- I got plans later.

414
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:42,722
Okay, bye honey.

415
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:51,266
How long to get this presentation ready?

416
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:52,942
Why don't you do the presentation?

417
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:55,660
- I mean, you know how to do it.
- What I really want...

418
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,511
honestly, is for you to know it
so that you can communicate

419
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:00,976
to the people here,
to your clients, to whomever.

420
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:02,890
What?

421
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:05,267
- It's whoever, not whomever.
- No, it's whomever.

422
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:07,436
No, whomever is never actually right.

423
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:09,021
Well, sometimes it's right.

424
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:12,113
Michael is right. It's a made-up word
used to trick students.

425
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:15,983
No, actually whomever is
the formal version of the word.

426
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:19,073
Obviously, it's a real word, but
I don't know when to use it correctly.

427
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:21,242
- Not a native speaker.
- I know what's right.

428
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:22,737
But I'm not gonna say

429
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:25,871
because you're all jerks
who didn't come see my band last night.

430
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,797
- You know the correct one?
- I don't know.

431
00:21:28,112 --> 00:21:31,502
It's whom when it's the object of the
sentence, and who when it's the subject.

432
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:33,546
- That sounds right.
- It sounds, but is it?

433
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:35,515
- Ryan use it as an object?
- As an object.

434
00:21:35,675 --> 00:21:36,924
Ryan used me as an object.

435
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:39,635
- Is he right about that?
- How did he use it again?

436
00:21:39,795 --> 00:21:41,855
It was Ryan wanted Michael,
the subject,

437
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:44,108
to explain the computer system,
the object.

438
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:45,683
- Thank you.
- To whomever,

439
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:49,719
meaning us, the indirect object,
which is the correct use of the word.

440
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:53,923
No one asked you anything ever,
so whomever's name is Toby,

441
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,694
why don't you take a letter opener
and stick it into your skull.

442
00:21:56,877 --> 00:21:59,613
Hey, this doesn't matter.
And I don't even care.

443
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:02,478
Michael, you quit the other job
or you're fired here.

444
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:11,994
I've never done this before.
I've never quit anything...

445
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:14,110
in my life,

446
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:15,870
so...

447
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,460
You are filming history.

448
00:22:18,782 --> 00:22:22,529
Nick, I had a dream last night
that I had two full-time jobs.

449
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,973
One here
at the lipaphadrazone diet pill company.

450
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,475
- Lipaphedrine.
- The other,

451
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,979
I was regional manager of a small paper
supply company called Dunder Mifflin.

452
00:22:32,402 --> 00:22:34,418
- Never heard of it.
- In this dream,

453
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:37,234
I did both of these jobs beautifully.

454
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:40,201
And I loved it.
And everybody loved me.

455
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,864
The truth is...

456
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,284
- I can't do this.
- Are you quitting?

457
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:48,241
I am.

458
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:51,866
Come back anytime.
Don't forget to disinfect your headset.

459
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:55,998
I was never in this for the money.

460
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:02,176
But it turns out that the money
was an absolute necessity for me.

461
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:04,497
I tried to live the dream.

462
00:23:04,722 --> 00:23:06,972
I trieto have a job,
a girlfriend,

463
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,768
another job,
and I failed.

464
00:23:12,535 --> 00:23:14,647
But the good thing
about the American Dream

465
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:18,006
is that you can just
go to sleep.

466
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:22,247
And try it all again the next night.

467
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,371
So...

468
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:34,227
What's up?

469
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,962
Me, all night, dreaming
about Angela's smoking hot body.

470
00:23:38,146 --> 00:23:40,913
- You're being gross.
- Not from a male perspective.

471
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:42,633
You need to set me up with her.

472
00:23:42,873 --> 00:23:47,068
I know she told you she's looking and
she's totally not responding my moves.

473
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:48,229
What moves?

474
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:51,100
I've moonwalked past accounting,
like, ten times.

475
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:53,815
- Can't believe it's not working.
- Yeah.

476
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,344
I don't know
if I really see you two together.

477
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:02,695
Really? Well maybe you should look
in the small part on your brain.

478
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:04,530
- She's very religious.
- Okay,

479
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:09,067
well I come from a line of W.A.S.P.S.
so long it leads back to Moses.

480
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:11,792
Okay, well she takes
her convictions pretty seriously.

481
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,266
She could be kind of severe.

482
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:14,999
Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.

483
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:16,959
- That's right, you did.
- Yeah.

484
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:21,651
Now that I think about it, Angela and
Andy might actually make a good couple.

485
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:24,692
But I couldn't do that to Dwight...

486
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:26,199
or Angela...

487
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:28,754
or Andy.

488
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:33,861
Hey Kevin,

489
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,507
you're a gambler, right?

490
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:41,993
A rounder.
You play the ponies, tall horses.

491
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:44,560
I do gamble, Michael.

492
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:47,764
I was thinking
about doing some gambling myself.

493
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:51,160
You know, just a little bit of money.
Maybe doubling it and then doubling it,

494
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,822
several more times.

495
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,720
I don't know. Kind of just for fun.
I was thinking...

496
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,711
Do you have any tips or ideas
about sure things?

497
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:03,346
Like a boxer...

498
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:08,677
who is gonna throw the big fight,

499
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:13,057
you know, like he's tied in
to some crooked dealings

500
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:16,268
and maybe his kid is sick or something.
Like, who do I call about that?

501
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:19,457
The mob.

502
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,259
Do you know anybody in the mob?

503
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:27,067
Okay.

504
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:31,336
Oscar...

505
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,453
I'm gonna need
another advance on my salary.

506
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:39,166
- What do you mean you've plans tonight?
- I have my daughter tonight.

507
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:40,831
We're renting <i>Charlotte's Web</i>.

508
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:42,388
Well you have to make a choice.

509
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:44,630
- It's either your daughter or me.
- My daughter.

510
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:47,363
Okay.

511
00:25:48,358 --> 00:25:49,510
I see how it is.

512
00:25:57,178 --> 00:25:58,328
That was cold.

513
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:06,962
He's always been terrible with money.

514
00:26:07,122 --> 00:26:09,782
I bet it's Jan
spending him straight to the poorhouse.

515
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:11,761
Yeah, women be shoppin'.

516
00:26:12,255 --> 00:26:14,427
I can't believe he has a second job.

517
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:17,127
- He's not even good at his first one.
- Hey guys.

518
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:22,392
Whatcha talking about?

519
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:25,645
Okay, I know what's going on.

520
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:27,446
Talking about Jim and Pam.

521
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,959
If they're having sex,
what it looks like... I know.

522
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:36,098
Michael,
are you having money problems?

523
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:38,782
Monkey problems?
No, I'm not having monkey problems.

524
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:40,561
Why would I have monkey problems?

525
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,063
- I know you heard me correctly.
- Oh, I hate monkeys.

526
00:26:43,577 --> 00:26:46,077
What's going on?
Why do you have a second job?

527
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,027
I don't have a second job.

528
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,893
Maybe
I am having an affair

529
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:52,605
with Suzanne Sommers.

530
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,034
- Jan has no money?
- I don't talk to my girlfriend

531
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:57,486
about money.
It's rude and unsexual.

532
00:26:57,646 --> 00:27:00,456
True, it's best to hide
our money problems from women.

533
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:02,180
I totally agree with you.

534
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,876
But I don't have money problems.

535
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,859
All right, you know what?

536
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,208
Watch this.

537
00:27:10,485 --> 00:27:12,117
If I had money problems,

538
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:14,384
would I do this?

539
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:25,559
- You just put it back in your pocket.
- Yeah.

540
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:28,692
Yeah, but I destroyed it.
It's not even usable anymore.

541
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,324
Hey, let's call this what it is.

542
00:27:37,484 --> 00:27:40,692
It's like she only wants to hook up
when Ryan comes around.

543
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:44,075
It's gotten to the point where I get
excited everytime I see that little dude

544
00:27:44,235 --> 00:27:45,793
walk through the door.

545
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:49,004
Well I just need to know
where this is going.

546
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:50,641
Hey,

547
00:27:51,591 --> 00:27:52,508
I like you.

548
00:27:53,816 --> 00:27:54,816
All right?

549
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,506
Why's not to like?

550
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:01,225
But you need to access
your uncrazy side.

551
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:04,679
Otherwise
maybe this thing has run its course.

552
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,454
Don't you dare walk away from me,
Darryl Philbin.

553
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:11,545
You're the most selfish person
I've ever met...

554
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:12,771
Slow down.

555
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:14,421
Think it over.

556
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:17,491
Darryl Philbin

557
00:28:17,651 --> 00:28:20,364
is the most complicated man
that I've ever met.

558
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:23,297
I mean,
who says exactly what they're thinking.

559
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:27,003
What kind of game is that?

560
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:31,334
Hey, cuz.

561
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,800
- Heard you're having money problems.
- No, you didn't.

562
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,218
Listen, I got the answer.

563
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:39,429
You declare bankruptcy,
all your problems away.

564
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:41,555
Creed Bratton
has never declared bankruptcy.

565
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:45,430
When Creed Bratton gets in trouble,
he transfers his debt to

566
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,280
William Charles Schneider.

567
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:48,939
How would that help, Creed?

568
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:51,316
In monopoly,
you go bankrupt, you lose.

569
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:53,425
You don't go by monoly, man.

570
00:28:53,585 --> 00:28:54,877
That game is nuts.

571
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:58,305
Nobody just picks up
"Get out of jail free" cards.

572
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,346
Those things cost thousands.

573
00:29:01,063 --> 00:29:02,178
That is a good point.

574
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:05,122
Bankruptcy, Michael,
is nature's do-over.

575
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:07,887
It's a fresh start.
It's a clean slate.

576
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,852
Like the witness protection program.

577
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:11,802
- Exactly.
- Not at all!

578
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:15,708
I've always wanted to be
in the witness protection program.

579
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:18,147
Fresh start.
No debts, no bagage.

580
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:22,574
I've already got my name picked up:
"Lord Rupert Everton."

581
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,201
I'm a, uh, shipping merchant
who raises fancy dogs.

582
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:29,301
That's the life.

583
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:37,494
I declare...

584
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:40,922
bankruptcy!

585
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:56,179
Hey, I just wanted you to know that
you can't just say the word "bankruptcy"

586
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:57,725
and expect anything to happen.

587
00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:00,010
- I didn't say it, I declared it.
- Still...

588
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,137
That's...
That's not anything.

589
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,410
This is a lot of credit card debt.

590
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,825
Yeah, tell about it.

591
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:09,831
You know,
Jan has my credit cards and she's...

592
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:12,189
using 'em as if I'm made of money.

593
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,566
She thinks I'm a human ATM machine.

594
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,527
Okay.
$125, Amazon.

595
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:21,014
Oh, <i>Best of the Muppet Show</i> on DVD.

596
00:30:21,174 --> 00:30:22,194
Classic.

597
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:25,410
$1200.
What's a "Core-Blaster Extreme"?

598
00:30:25,694 --> 00:30:29,334
That is by far,
the best way to strengthen your core.

599
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:30,919
This machine...

600
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:32,834
You sit on a stabilizer ball.

601
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,671
You put your feet
into the power stirrups, you reach up

602
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,330
and you grab onto the super rod.

603
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,175
And you twist
and you twist and you twist.

604
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:42,552
It strengthens your entire core.

605
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:47,489
Your back core,
your arm core, your...

606
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:50,310
The marine corps actually uses it.

607
00:30:50,943 --> 00:30:52,562
I think that's how they got "corps."

608
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:59,969
I left a little present for Angela.

609
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:02,444
I think she's going to like it

610
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:05,733
'cause I found it
outside vance refrigeration all alone.

611
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:09,816
And I told her in the note
that the cat came to find her.

612
00:31:10,186 --> 00:31:13,122
That they were
destined to be together.

613
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,337
I got game.

614
00:31:23,311 --> 00:31:26,513
Okay, the green bar is what you spend
every month on stuff you need.

615
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,660
Like a car or a house.

616
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:32,193
That is so cool
how you have my name at the top.

617
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:37,768
The red bar
is what you spend on non-essentials,

618
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:40,277
like magazines, entertainments,
things like that.

619
00:31:41,196 --> 00:31:44,948
This scary black bar
is what you spend

620
00:31:45,108 --> 00:31:47,882
on things that no one
ever, ever needs,

621
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:50,949
like multiple magic sets,
professional bass fishing equipment.

622
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,458
How do you do this so fast?
Is this Powerpoint?

623
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:05,772
Oh, man.

624
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:09,298
Angela really had a hold on him.

625
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:11,636
Angela.

626
00:32:12,094 --> 00:32:14,666
Michael, I'm gonna set you and Jan
up with a debt consolidator.

627
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:17,898
- You meet with this guy...
- No. We're leaving Jan out of this.

628
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,318
- She has to know.
- We will find another way.

629
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,362
We'll ask Powerpoint.

630
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:25,447
Michael, this is a presentation tool.

631
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:28,613
You're a presentation tool, if you think
I'm gonna tell Jan about this.

632
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:30,194
- I'm done.
- No, you're not...

633
00:32:30,354 --> 00:32:31,870
Just...
You're not a tool.

634
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,236
Look, I'll tell her that it's bad.

635
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:36,149
But it could've been a lot worse

636
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:40,854
but due to some fancy financial footwork
I was able to cut it in half.

637
00:32:42,617 --> 00:32:43,918
Jan is smart.

638
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,334
She poses.

639
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:50,472
Dwight, how's the hotel business?

640
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,393
Stupid.

641
00:32:53,914 --> 00:32:55,477
You checked Trip Advisor recently?

642
00:32:55,977 --> 00:32:56,778
No...

643
00:32:58,728 --> 00:32:59,993
Maybe you should.

644
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:01,903
Maybe you should...

645
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:04,008
Whatever.

646
00:33:07,245 --> 00:33:09,491
We wrote a good review.
Under comments,

647
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:12,035
we wrote:
"The natural aroma of the beets

648
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:15,431
"drifts into the bedrooms
and makes you dream of simpler times."

649
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:19,000
"The dawn goose walk
will tug at your artstrings."

650
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,748
"Table-making never seemed so possible."

651
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,912
"You will never
want to leave your room."

652
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:29,094
"The architecture reminds
one of a quaint Tuscan beetfarm."

653
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:35,392
I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.

654
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:36,846
We really did.

655
00:33:37,006 --> 00:33:38,109
It was fun.

656
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:48,566
So due to Michael's
clever financial maneuvering,

657
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:51,226
he finds himself tremendously in debt.

658
00:33:51,877 --> 00:33:52,945
<i>You're bro?</i>

659
00:33:54,781 --> 00:33:57,751
How did you get that
from what Oscar's saying? That's not...

660
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,001
<i>I mean Michael, how did this happen?
Where exactly did your money go?</i>

661
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:04,162
<i>I...
I don't...</i>

662
00:34:04,695 --> 00:34:06,979
<i>I don't get this.
I really don't. I don't...</i>

663
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:09,073
<i>I don't understand how</i>

664
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:10,961
<i>you could be so...</i>

665
00:34:12,257 --> 00:34:13,504
<i>irresponsible.</i>

666
00:34:13,664 --> 00:34:14,695
<i>I mean...</i>

667
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,852
<i>It is astounding to me, really.</i>

668
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,621
- <i>I don't know what more to say...</i>
- Jan?

669
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:24,009
- <i>Yeah, what?</i>
- Michael left.

670
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:28,629
- <i>Okay, where did he go?</i>
- I don't know.

671
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:31,897
<i>Well is he coming right back?</i>

672
00:34:32,297 --> 00:34:33,649
I don't think so.

673
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,637
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

674
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,168
What am I doing?
I'm...

675
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:02,075
blowing dodge.
I'm getting out of town.

676
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,099
Whatever you'll call it.
I'm running away from my responsibilies.

677
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:09,761
And it feels good.

678
00:35:14,783 --> 00:35:16,326
You may ask me out to dinner.

679
00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:22,226
Nothing fancy or foreign.
No bars, no patios, no vegetables.

680
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,680
And no seafood.

681
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:32,592
Dwight.

682
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:58,972
Did I ever tell you
why I left Scranton?

683
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,031
Yeah, I didn't think I had.

684
00:36:04,882 --> 00:36:05,886
Well...

685
00:36:06,894 --> 00:36:08,439
It was all about Pam.

686
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:12,150
Yeah, I mean...

687
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,819
she was with Roy, and...

688
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:18,579
I just couldn't take it.

689
00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:22,620
I mean, I lost it, Dwight.

690
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,760
I couldn't sleep,

691
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:28,776
I couldn't concentrate on anything.

692
00:36:31,346 --> 00:36:32,944
And then weird stuff, like,

693
00:36:33,363 --> 00:36:36,309
food had no taste.

694
00:36:38,248 --> 00:36:40,886
So my solution was to move away.

695
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:43,861
It was awful.

696
00:36:45,964 --> 00:36:49,303
And it is something
that I would wish on my worst enemy.

697
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,824
And that includes you.

698
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:32,438
Hey, I was thinking about dinner...

699
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:39,542
Dinner...

700
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:42,296
Let's see, maybe we should try the...

701
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:44,265
new italian place
where was the dry cleaner.

702
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:45,564
- Okay.
- Yeah?

703
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:46,725
Yeah.

704
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:47,934
Okay.

705
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:53,175
Jim's just really passionate
about italian food.

706
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:56,349
Yeah,

707
00:37:56,664 --> 00:37:59,296
I'm very passionate about italian food.

708
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:02,528
In fact...

709
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:05,610
I'm in love with italian food.

710
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:17,122
- Jan, he went running that way...
- Okay, great. Thanks.

711
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>Runaway train never coming back</i>

712
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:28,462
<i>Runaway and I'm never coming back</i>

713
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:29,622
Michael?

714
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:31,935
Hey, Jan.

715
00:38:34,373 --> 00:38:35,623
What's going on?

716
00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:38,188
Not much.

717
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:41,507
- What's up with you?
- Why are you sitting on a train?

718
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:44,189
- Where are you going?
- I'm out of answers, Jan.

719
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:45,744
What does that mean?

720
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,025
I told you, no more answers.

721
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,965
This is who I am now.

722
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:55,241
A guy on a train with no answers.

723
00:38:56,257 --> 00:38:57,776
I hope that can be enough for you.

724
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,347
Michael, come on.

725
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:03,261
Running away from your problems
won't solve anything, you know that.

726
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:05,472
- I don't know that.
- Creditors can follow you

727
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:08,402
anywhere with ease.
Your debt follows you around the world.

728
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:10,640
- Electronically.
- I'll stay off the grid.

729
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,549
Michael, come on.

730
00:39:12,856 --> 00:39:15,803
Come on, you can deal with this.
It's not that bad.

731
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:18,692
Yeah, it is.

732
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:21,509
It is.

733
00:39:21,936 --> 00:39:23,390
I really messed up.

734
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:26,379
Well...

735
00:39:28,186 --> 00:39:29,191
When...

736
00:39:30,288 --> 00:39:33,014
When my life fell apart and they...
And they screwed me in New York

737
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:35,461
and I felt like my whole world
was collapsing around me,

738
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:36,725
I didn't have anyone.

739
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:40,482
I mean, my whole family still won't even
talk me on the advice of council

740
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:43,802
and my friends...
were just waiting for this to happen.

741
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:46,471
- That's really nice of you to say.
- Michael, no.

742
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:50,724
What I want to say is
you were there for me.

743
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:53,202
By my side.

744
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,232
Without even a thought.

745
00:39:57,884 --> 00:39:59,472
That's just who you are.

746
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,035
I mean...

747
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:09,712
No matter
how badly I treat you or...

748
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,665
what l'm going through you just...
You are there for me.

749
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,109
And that is a guy
worth staying beside.

750
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:22,621
So where's this train taking us?

751
00:40:27,408 --> 00:40:28,514
I don't...

752
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:30,847
I think the engineer left.

753
00:41:03,492 --> 00:41:05,858
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute
calling from Dunder Mifflin,

754
00:41:06,018 --> 00:41:09,797
and according to our records,
you appear to be low on office supplies.

755
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:13,224
Okay, sure,
I can take care of that right now.

756
00:41:16,718 --> 00:41:18,559
Don't sell your implants, please.

757
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:21,332
I'm keeping them.
I know you like them.

758
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:27,047
- They're kind of uncomfortable though.
- It's nice though.

759
00:41:27,207 --> 00:41:30,283
- My nipples aren't as sensitive now.
- Looks cute though.
