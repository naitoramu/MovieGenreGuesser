1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,925
This kitty is Mittens.
This one is Fitzhugh.

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,011
And this little guy
in the cat condo is Jinkies.

3
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,517
That's a lot of cats, Jo Lynn.

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,809
Single, are you?

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,772
Chandler Bing.

6
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,568
<i>How come you're answering your own</i>
<i>phone? Where's your crazy assistant?</i>

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,447
What's up, Joe?

8
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,783
What have we always wanted
to do together?

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,620
Braid each other's hair
and ride horseback on the beach?

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,206
No. No. No. When you get home
tomorrow night...

11
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,751
...you and I are gonna be
at the Wizards-Knicks game, courtside!

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,420
- Courtside? Oh, my God!
<i>- Yeah!</i>

13
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,423
Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for
the ball and break my jaw with his knee!

14
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,926
That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.

15
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,098
- Hello?
- Joey just called.

16
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,310
He's got courtside Knicks tickets
for him and me tomorrow night.

17
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,896
But tomorrow night's the only night
I get off from the restaurant.

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,649
If you go, we won't have
a night together for a week.

19
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:10,070
But honey, it's courtside!
The cheerleaders will be right in...

20
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,115
That's not the way to convince you.

21
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,451
I don't wanna be one
of those wives that says:

22
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,537
"You can't go to the game.
You have to spend time with me."

23
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,081
So if you could just realize
it on your own...

24
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,293
I know. You're right.
I wanna see you too.

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,630
I gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.
He's looking forward to it.

26
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,300
<i>Tell him you haven 't seen</i>
<i>your wife in a long time.</i>

27
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,345
Tell him that having a long-distance
relationship is really difficult.

28
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,641
Tell him that what little time
we have together is precious.

29
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,478
I'll think of something.

30
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,316
The One With Rachel's Phone Number

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,276
You look...

34
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,615
I mean, it's just...
That dress...

35
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,743
Well, I hope the ends
of these sentences are good.

36
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,122
They're good. It's just been a while
since I've seen you like this.

37
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,290
You clean up good.

38
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,544
Really? Well, thank you.

39
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,633
Okay, stop looking at me like that.

40
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,720
- Last time that happened, that happened.
- Right, right.

41
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:07,187
So are you excited about
your first night away from Emma?

42
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,857
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I
are gonna have so much fun.

43
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,943
- Thank you for watching the baby.
- It's fine.

44
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,237
Actually, I invited Mike over.

45
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,447
- Phoebe's Mike?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,740
- I didn't know you hung out.
- We don't...

47
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,742
...but I'd like to get to know him.

48
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,870
Maybe have a little dinner,
drinks, conversation.

49
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,790
That's so cute.
Ross and Mike's first date.

50
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,420
Will that be awkward?
What are you gonna talk about?

51
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,923
I don't know. But you know, we have
a lot in common, you know?

52
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,135
He plays piano.
I played keyboards in college.

53
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,474
He's been divorced.
I have some experience in that area.

54
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,853
- Yeah?
- Hi!

55
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,692
Girl's night out indeed.

56
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,320
So I think Emma is probably
down for the night...

57
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,697
...but if you need anything...
- We'll be fine.

58
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,783
- You go have fun.
- Okay, you too.

59
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,326
- Thanks.
- And I hope you score.

60
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,079
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

61
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,832
So, welcome.

62
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,794
- I got beer.
- I got bottled breast milk.

63
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,632
- Why don't we start with the beer.
- Okay.

64
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:25,557
- So Phoebe tells me you play piano.
- Yeah.

65
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,518
You know, I used to play keyboards
in college.

66
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,395
Do you have one here?

67
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,607
No.

68
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,736
Okay.

69
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,464
You know, I'm divorced.

70
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,843
Phoebe... Phoebe says you're...
You've been divorced?

71
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,220
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,306
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't really like
to talk about it.

73
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:13,230
That's okay. We'll talk about
something else.

74
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,533
- So you're a paleontologist, right?
- Yeah.

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,702
My cousin's a paleontologist.

76
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,544
Well, he and I would probably have
a lot to talk about.

77
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,301
- Welcome home.
- Well, look at you.

78
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,136
Yeah. What do you think?

79
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,556
Well, it looks great. It's just...

80
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:51,018
I'm wearing the same thing
underneath, so...

81
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,687
You see what I mean?

82
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,317
Hey! How come your door's locked?

83
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,443
- Just a second!
- No, no, no!

84
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,279
- Joey can't know I'm here.
- Why not?

85
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,865
I didn't want to say
I couldn't go to the game...

86
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,244
...so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.
- So you lied to him?

87
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:12,247
It's always better to lie than to have
the complicated discussion.

88
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,584
Except with you.

89
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,589
Hey, open the door! What's going on?

90
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,720
- What are you...?
- Hi.

91
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,514
Why are you dressed like that?

92
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,226
Because Chandler's gonna be home
in a couple of days...

93
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,229
...so I thought I would just, you know,
practice the art of seduction.

94
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,565
I thought I heard a man's voice before.

95
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,485
No, I was just doing Chandler's side
of the conversation.

96
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,988
You know, like, "Hi, how do I look?"

97
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:48,450
"Really sexy. Could I be any more
turned on?" You know?

98
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,744
Okay. Wait a minute.

99
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,871
Why are there two glasses
of wine out?

100
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
Because one of them is for you!

101
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,798
Cheers! Okay, bye-bye.

102
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:09,262
You know, it's funny. I've been
practicing the art of seduction myself.

103
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,101
- You might wanna keep practicing.
- Yeah.

104
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,022
- It's Joey.
- What?

105
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,192
- Hey, Joe.
- Dude, come home!

106
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,447
- What? Why?
- Come home!

107
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,491
Look, I can't. What's going on?

108
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,495
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I think Monica's cheating on you!

109
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,623
I told you, you shouldn't have married
someone hotter than you!

110
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,171
If you can't deal with this,
then I'm gonna.

111
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,715
- No!
- I just heard him!

112
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,635
Can you hear him now?

113
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,182
No. All right, I'm going in.

114
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,975
- No, wait!
- I heard him again!

115
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,730
All right, just stay there.
I'm coming home.

116
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,441
I'll see you when you get here.

117
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,860
I'll wait out in the hall
in case he comes out.

118
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,530
- Is that really necessary?
- Absolutely. You'd do it for me.

119
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:13,327
Not that you ever have to, because
I know how to keep my women satisfied.

120
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,299
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?

121
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:33,097
I mean, they said 30 minutes or less.
Well, how long has it been?

122
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,641
Eleven minutes.

123
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,192
And now 12.

124
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:52,449
- So you like the beer?
- I do. I do.

125
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:56,370
Although, it's actually a lager.

126
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,541
What's the difference
between beer and lager?

127
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,294
I don't know.

128
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,214
We could look it up.

129
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:12,428
Things are about to get wild.

130
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,394
Oh, God, remember the girls' nights
we used to have...

131
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,688
...sitting around talking
about you and Ross?

132
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:25,274
Oh, God! It seems like forever ago.

133
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,483
I know.

134
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,279
So, what's going on
with you and Ross?

135
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:36,118
Well, I don't know. I mean,
for a long time, nothing.

136
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:40,080
But you know, actually,
right before you picked me up...

137
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,791
...Ross and I had a little thing.

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,961
Oh, my God! I love things!
What happened?

139
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,465
Well, first he told me
he liked how I looked.

140
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,510
And then we had a little...

141
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,888
...eye contact.

142
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,517
Eye contact?

143
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,477
I hope you were using protection.

144
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:09,151
Excuse me, these are from
the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.

145
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,155
Should we send them something back?
Let's send them mashed potatoes!

146
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,698
No, wait! Don't do that!

147
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,867
That'll make them think
they can come over.

148
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,368
So, what if they do?

149
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:23,999
We're not here to meet guys. You have
a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.

150
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,753
Yeah, but nothing has to happen.
We're just having fun.

151
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,967
You know, not everything has to go
as far as eye contact.

152
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,637
Chandler, you have to tell Joey
you're not in Tulsa.

153
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,557
Isn't it better for him
to think you're cheating on me...

154
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,560
...than for him to think
I'm cheating on him?

155
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,562
I heard it.

156
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,524
I don't want him to think
I'm having an affair.

157
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,985
All right, I've got a plan.
I'll go down the fire escape...

158
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:55,364
Because all good plans start with,
"I'll go down the fire escape."

159
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,948
Hear me out, woman!

160
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,827
I'll go down the fire escape and wait.

161
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,539
Then it'll be like I just got back
from Tulsa.

162
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,708
Joey and I will come in
and see that there's no guy in here.

163
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:10,337
Aren't you afraid that Joey's
gonna figure all this out?

164
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,133
I heard it.

165
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,019
- I'm gonna wait.
- The scary pigeon's back?

166
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,312
It's huge.

167
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,558
I can't believe you live in that building.
My grandmother lives in that building!

168
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,144
Ida Greene? No sense
of personal space...

169
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,814
...kind of smells like chicken,
looks like a potato.

170
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:12,733
- "Spuds" is your grandmother?
- That's my "bubbe"!

171
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,989
So we're on our way
to a couple of parties.

172
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,451
Maybe we could get your numbers
and call if we find something fun?

173
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,496
Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't really
looking for anything to happen...

174
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,207
...with you guys. I have a boyfriend.

175
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,543
- All right.
- It's no big deal.

176
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:38,050
So she has a boyfriend.
What is your situation?

177
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:42,012
Well, it's complicated.
I don't actually have a boyfriend, but...

178
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,724
Then can I have your number?

179
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,059
I'm sorry, no.

180
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:48,602
Okay.

181
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,396
Oh, sure!

182
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:56,067
Oh, my God, you're giving
your real number!

183
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,197
Okay, thanks. I'll give you
a call later tonight.

184
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,282
- Great.
- Bye.

185
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,700
Bye.

186
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,371
So that's great.

187
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:11,250
You, Bill, Ross and Emma are
gonna be so happy together.

188
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,834
What were you thinking?

189
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,463
I don't know. He was cute,
and he liked me. It was an impulse.

190
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,882
But what about Ross?
What about your moment?

191
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,093
- Don't you wanna talk to Ross about it?
- No.

192
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,388
No, because I know exactly
how the conversation's gonna go.

193
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,600
"Hey, Ross, you know, I think
we had a moment before."

194
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:31,061
"Yeah. Me too."

195
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,606
"Well, but I'm not sure I really want
to do anything about it."

196
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,943
"Yeah. Me neither."

197
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,778
"Should we just live together...

198
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,114
...and not tell each other
how we're feeling?"

199
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:45,201
"Yeah, that works for me."

200
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,871
Yeah, I see what you mean.

201
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,332
By the way, nice Ross imitation.

202
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,042
Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

203
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,711
- Well... Hey!
- Better.

204
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:02,342
The point is maybe I should just stop
waiting around for moments with Ross.

205
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,721
You know? I should just move
on with my life.

206
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,807
So really, you're moving on from Ross?

207
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,310
I don't know.
Do I have to decide right now?

208
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,437
You kind of just did.
That guy is gonna call you tonight.

209
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,608
Ross will pick up the phone,
and that's a pretty clear message.

210
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,526
Oh, my God, Ross!

211
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,820
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

212
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:25,032
I have to get my number back.
Oh, my God, he's gone!

213
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,744
"Oh, I have to get my number back!
Oh, my God! He's gone! " Dead on.

214
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,970
- You know, I'm gonna take off.
- So soon?

215
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,513
- Yeah.
- Okay.

216
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,224
Well, thanks... Thanks for the beer.

217
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,061
- You mean lager?
- Yeah. Good times.

218
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,869
- Hello?
- Hey, Mike, it's me.

219
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,955
Listen, is... Is Ross near you?

220
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,706
No, I just left.

221
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,667
Well, you have to go back in.

222
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:22,089
What? Go back? To the land
where time stands still?

223
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,425
I'm so sorry, honey, but...

224
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,593
Okay, Rachel gave this guy
her number...

225
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,096
...and she doesn't want Ross
to answer the phone.

226
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,265
So you have to intercept all his calls.

227
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:32,975
I can't do that!

228
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:36,186
- He says he can't do that.
- Give me the phone.

229
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:40,023
Hi, Mike. Hi, listen, I know that this
is a lot to ask, but you know what?

230
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,570
If you do this, Phoebe will do
anything you want.

231
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:49,950
- Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
- All right. Thank you. Hello?

232
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,996
Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actually,
she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

233
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,582
All right, I'll do it.

234
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,463
But really, how much dirtier
can it get?

235
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,174
Oh, Mike.

236
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,094
Bye.

237
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,849
Hey, buddy.

238
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:18,979
Hi.

239
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,149
- Can I come back in?
- Why?

240
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:29,198
Well, I was just thinking about
how much more we have to talk about.

241
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,743
But you left.

242
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,874
That didn't take long.

243
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:42,669
I thought you said Tulsa was,
like, a three-hour flight?

244
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:47,216
Well, you're forgetting
about the time difference.

245
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,475
Yeah.

246
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,769
Chandler, you're home!

247
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:04,567
That's right! Your husband's home!
So now the sex can stop!

248
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,031
What are you saying?

249
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,075
Joey said you're here
with another man!

250
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:17,037
There's no man in here!
How dare you accuse me of that!

251
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:25,212
All right. Then maybe you won't mind
if me and my friend take a look around.

252
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,592
What's he doing?

253
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,345
I arranged some pillows on the bed
to look like a guy.

254
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:39,810
Bedroom's clear. Although you might
need some new pillows.

255
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:43,147
All right, well, I'll check
the guest room.

256
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,032
Why do I smell men's cologne?

257
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,411
I think that's you.

258
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazine
on myself earlier.

259
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,795
There's nobody here, Joe.

260
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,631
I guess not.

261
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:13,427
I can't believe you thought I was
cheating. You owe me an apology.

262
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,555
- You're right. I'm so sorry.
- It's an honest mistake.

263
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,849
It could happen to anybody. See you.

264
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,435
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

265
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:25,773
If you just got back from Tulsa,
how did your suitcase beat you here?

266
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:32,821
I climbed down the fire escape,
and you can't put that in the closet?

267
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,703
So, with the exception
of the fermentation process...

268
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,290
...beer and ale are
basically the same thing.

269
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,877
Fascinating, isn't it?

270
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,506
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."

271
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,717
I'll get it!

272
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:02,809
Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.

273
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,104
It's for you.

274
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,361
I don't understand
what just happened here.

275
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,449
What's going on?

276
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:18,742
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:23,038
I told you I was in Tulsa because I
wanted to spend the night with Monica...

278
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:27,042
...and I didn't know...
I didn't think you'd understand.

279
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,921
You think I'm too dumb to understand
a husband needs to be with his wife?

280
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:35,217
You think I'm, like...

281
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,347
- Joey?
- Yeah.

282
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,892
I don't know what to say.
We shouldn't have lied to you.

283
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,354
I feel so bad. Is there anything
I can do to make it up to you?

284
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,193
You could go to the game with me.
Even though you said you couldn't.

285
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,823
But then you lied to me and tricked me
and gave me a bump on the head.

286
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,910
I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can't
do. I promised I'd be with Monica.

287
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:03,829
All right.

288
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,373
- You can go.
- What?

289
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,376
You should go to the game.
It's okay. I want you to.

290
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:12,504
- Really? You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

291
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:16,508
You know, maybe I'll stay here
and practice the art of seduction.

292
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:21,304
- You're gonna put sweats on and clean.
- It's gonna be so hot!

293
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:22,932
- Bye.
- Bye.

294
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,266
Thanks.

295
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,602
Here's your ticket.

296
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,979
Thanks. Hey, listen...

297
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,774
...I'm never gonna lie
to you again, okay?

298
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:35,235
And I want you to know
that nobody thinks you're stupid.

299
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,113
Thanks, man.

300
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,744
- Where you going?
- Game's tomorrow night, Joe.

301
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,960
Oh, God!

302
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,005
So glad you're back!

303
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,758
So, what did you guys do?

304
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,760
You know, we just drank some beer.

305
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,639
Mike played with the boundaries
of normal social conduct.

306
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,726
It's true, I did.

307
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:09,645
- Well, goodbye.
- Okay.

308
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,439
- Bye. That was fun, Pheebs.
- I know. It was fun.

309
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,399
See you, guys.

310
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,777
Lock the door!
Lock the door, seriously.

311
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,114
Shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe
for the drinks.

312
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,536
Wait, wait. Wait, sorry.
Did he call? Did that guy call?

313
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,205
No, just his mom.

314
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,623
Around 8:30?

315
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,416
- Yeah.
- Then again at 9:00?

316
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,836
Yeah.

317
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,384
Hello?

318
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,055
No, she's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

319
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,809
Bill from the bar?

320
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,482
Okay, Bill from the bar,
I'll make sure she gets your number.

321
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,954
So... So how was it?

322
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,248
Did you guys...?
You guys have a good time?

323
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:15,920
We had so much fun.
It felt so good to be out.

324
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,341
Rach?

325
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,592
Yeah?

326
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,555
Never mind.

327
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,899
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey!

328
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:40,610
I'll be right back.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

329
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,586
Stout. That's a kind of beer.

330
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,348
