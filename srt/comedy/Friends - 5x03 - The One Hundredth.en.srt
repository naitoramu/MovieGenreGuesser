1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,176
I'm Phoebe Buffay and I have
babies coming out.

2
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,887
Have you started having contractions?

3
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:16,058
Not yet. I heard they really hurt.
Do they?

4
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,602
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,354
Which of you is the father?

6
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:25,150
None of them are.
The father is my brother.

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:31,239
I'll miss watching you
freak people out like that.

8
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,076
This is for the babies
to look at someday.

9
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:38,497
Do you want to say anything
before it starts?

10
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,042
Hi, kids! It's me, Aunt Phoebe.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,963
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me!

12
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,549
What took you so long?

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,554
Your cab left when ours did.

14
00:00:55,764 --> 00:01:00,060
We went back because
I forgot my jacket.

15
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,607
You're not wearing one.

16
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:09,528
Oh, man!
I did it again!

17
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,989
Someone has to call
Frank and Alice.

18
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,450
My mom might...
What are you doing?

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,370
I've got to get the "before" shot!

20
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,748
The One Hundredth

21
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,800
We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late...

22
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,845
...is because she's not coming.

23
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,723
She hit her head in the shower.

24
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,101
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!

25
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,229
Pheebs, it's going to be okay.

26
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,818
I don't see three kids
coming out of your vagina!

27
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,905
Listen. The nurse said
the doctor is wonderful.

28
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,991
He's head of the department.

29
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,786
All right. Oh, dear God, save me!

30
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,705
I'm having my first contraction!

31
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:47,001
Oh! It's not bad.

32
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:52,131
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And I...

33
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,466
You okay?

34
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,717
Something hurts.

35
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,263
It's sympathy pains.
That's so sweet!

36
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,933
I didn't know I cared that much.

37
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:09,273
I'm Dr. Harad.
I'll be delivering your babies.

38
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,818
You'll be in good hands.
I've been doing this a long time.

39
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,445
I'll be back to do your internal.

40
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,865
Just relax, everything looks great.

41
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:22,244
And also, I love Fonzie.

42
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,581
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?

43
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,168
That's what it sounded like.

44
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,046
All right.

45
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,009
Am I late?
Nobody came out yet, right?

46
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,846
No, we haven't started yet.
Where's Alice?

47
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,474
Delaware. Until she gets here,
I'll be your coach.

48
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,354
Don't worry. She told me
about the LaMazda stuff.

49
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,107
If you get the babies out
by month's end...

50
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,776
...you get two percent financing.

51
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,033
Monica, you're going to be
very proud of me.

52
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,870
I just got us dates with two
unbelievably cute nurses.

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,623
Oh, my!

54
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,917
They're male nurses.

55
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,252
Not in my head.

56
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:18,134
They want to take us out
Saturday night! What do you say?

57
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,889
I don't think so.

58
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,599
What're you talking about?

59
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,561
You've been telling me to
get over Ross and move on.

60
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,855
I'm moving on and so are you.

61
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,150
Why don't you want to go?

62
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,612
Why don't you give me
a good reason...

63
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,741
...and I'll tell you if it's true.

64
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,245
- What?
- Harder than it sounds, isn't it?

65
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,956
You're coming.
And when they get off...

66
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,292
...we'll go get some Jello with them.

67
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:56,797
There's always room for Jello.

68
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,634
How do you make that dirty?

69
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,179
It's easy.
I can do it with anything.

70
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,808
Grandma's chicken salad...

71
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,985
Get a shot of this.

72
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,030
These are the headlines
when you were born.

73
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,035
Now girl baby, turn away.
And boy babies...

74
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,579
...check it out!

75
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,332
This is what naked women
looked like when you were born.

76
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,377
Now let's dive into the good stuff.

77
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,130
Okay, I'm having another one!

78
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,801
This one doesn't hurt eith...
Yes it does!

79
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,600
I was kind of hoping that was it.

80
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,979
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?

81
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,149
A couple of nurses asked them out.

82
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,817
Really? Male nurses?

83
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,153
Yeah, I was bummed too.

84
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,239
So they're going on dates?

85
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,368
- When?
- I think Saturday.

86
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,497
- What's with him?
- Sympathy pains.

87
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:17,628
It was sweet at first, but now I think
he's trying to steal my thunder.

88
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,131
Let's see what we got here.

89
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,969
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.

90
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,931
This Fonzie person you
keep referring to...

91
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,225
...is that another doctor?

92
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,434
Oh, no, no.

93
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:36,646
Fonzie is the nickname of
Arthur Fonzerelli.

94
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,483
"The Fonz."

95
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,237
All right.

96
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,242
It's not that weird, is it?

97
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,910
It's very weird!

98
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,416
I don't want some guy down there
telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo".

99
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,087
He doesn't seem to be
impersonating Fonzie...

100
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,631
What are you doing?

101
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,134
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor...

102
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,846
...who isn't crazy
and doesn't Fonzie!

103
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,682
Again, it's not...

104
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,940
Hey, there you are!

105
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,983
There's something you should know.

106
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,237
Is this about you dating the nurse?
Joey told me.

107
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:30,158
I am so fine. You and I,
we're just, nothing.

108
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,329
Just goofing around.

109
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,500
I was about to tell you
I was getting out of it.

110
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,545
But if we're just "goofing around",
maybe I will go out with him.

111
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,425
Fine. Maybe I will too.

112
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,930
Hey! Look what I found
in the gift shop...

113
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,017
Get up! Get up! Get up!

114
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,815
This is Dr. Oberman.

115
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,693
He has no strong feelings
about Fonzie...

116
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,864
...or any of the "Happy Days" gang.

117
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,075
You're going into what grade?

118
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm actually a first-year resident.
I graduated early.

119
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,540
Me too.

120
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,627
I should have specified
I'd need a grown-up doctor.

121
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,505
Really, I'm fully qualified...

122
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,341
"Doogie!"

123
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:33,096
Doesn't anybody understand that
I'm going to be having babies soon?

124
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,851
Go, little boy! Go!

125
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,065
Oh, cool. You made him cry!

126
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:51,365
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid
you've got kidney stones.

127
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,408
Well, what else could it be?

128
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,495
It's kidney stones.

129
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,579
Or...

130
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,957
Kidney stones.

131
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,254
You're getting there.

132
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,756
These babies are very, very lucky.

133
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,007
They are? Why?

134
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:13,888
They'll be born
on the Fonz's half-birthday.

135
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,766
Happy Birthday.

136
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,934
Just to clarify.

137
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,396
I'm not Fonzie.

138
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:33,949
It's a terrific thing you're having
these babies for Frank and Alice.

139
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,451
I know, it is.

140
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,371
Can I tell you a secret?

141
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,041
I want to keep one.

142
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,923
Oh, I'm going to be on the news.

143
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,927
You must be kidding.

144
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,764
You know you can't keep
one of these babies.

145
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,974
Maybe I can. You don't know.

146
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:03,228
I do. Frank and Alice will
want to keep all their children.

147
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,106
Maybe not. You know?

148
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,400
Three babies are a handful.

149
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,445
Maybe they'll want to unload one.

150
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:18,201
I hate to miss an opportunity
because I didn't ask.

151
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,996
Phoebe, no.
This is insane.

152
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,330
Just ask him.

153
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,249
What? Me?

154
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,458
I can't ask him!

155
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:30,130
Do you know how inappropriate
that would be?

156
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,841
All I'm saying is,
just talk to Frank.

157
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,384
Just feel him out.

158
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:39,765
No. I will not ask Frank
to give you one of his kids.

159
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,726
You're right.

160
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:50,484
Tell him it's for you.

161
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,903
Feeling better, sweetie?

162
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,863
Maybe a little.

163
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,158
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

164
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,244
Me too.

165
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,247
I just heard. What's up?

166
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,918
Kidney stones!

167
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,590
Ordinarily, we try to break
the stones up with shock waves.

168
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,177
But they're too close to the bladder.

169
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:22,015
Either we wait for you to pass them
or else go up the urethra...

170
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:28,063
No, no, no, no.
Nothing is going "up", okay?

171
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:33,151
"Up" is not an option.
What's a urethra?

172
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,531
Are you crazy?

173
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,118
Did you ask him?

174
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,203
No, I haven't had a chance yet.

175
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,665
I'm kind of on a clock here.

176
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,128
Oh, Fonzie.

177
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:57,051
You know who I always liked?
Mork.

178
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,222
Undo it. Undo it.

179
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,684
Fonzie met Mork.

180
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,395
Mork froze Fonzie.

181
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:16,778
But Fonzie was already cool.

182
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:20,157
So he wasn't hurt. Right?

183
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,327
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,288
How you doing?

185
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,915
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.

186
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,711
You know, Alice is going
to be here so soon.

187
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:39,384
You couldn't just do me a favor
and, like, hold them in?

188
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,723
Sorry, I'm in the middle of
the last favor you asked me to do.

189
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:52,397
This is Dan, one of the guys
we're dating on Saturday.

190
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,234
Nice to meet you.

191
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:03,451
I'm really looking forward
to Saturday night. Really!

192
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,328
So Dan...

193
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,039
Nurse, not a doctor, huh?

194
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,292
Kind of girlie, isn't it?

195
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:19,717
That's okay. I'm doing this to
get through medical school.

196
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,179
And it didn't feel "girlie"
during the Gulf War.

197
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,223
Sure.

198
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,897
Thanks for doing that for us,
by the way.

199
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,027
Why wait till Saturday?
Are you free tomorrow?

200
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,112
Sure.
I'll get somebody to cover me.

201
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,905
Great!

202
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,074
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?

203
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,869
- No.
- All right, very good!

204
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,666
This is a big one.

205
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,337
Get these things out of me!

206
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:02,301
Breathe! Breathe through the pain.

207
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,971
I want the drugs, Ross!

208
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:10,392
I do too! I do too!

209
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:16,440
Yeah, I love you.
Okay, bye.

210
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,111
That was Alice's mom.
Alice left five hours ago.

211
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,611
She should be here.

212
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,115
She'll make it on time.

213
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,743
So Frank...

214
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:31,413
Three babies.
That just seems like a lot, huh?

215
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,791
Not to me.

216
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,753
Fair enough.

217
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,468
You're at ten centimeters.
Time to start having babies.

218
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,054
I want only the father here.

219
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,641
- We love you.
- Good luck.

220
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:59,066
I need a clamp, a sterile towel
and Channel 31.

221
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,319
What is that?

222
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,530
Oh, my God!

223
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:10,494
Oh, no, no! It's a good one.
Fonzie plays the bongos.

224
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,579
Ready? Time to try pushing.

225
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,207
Ready? Time to try peeing.

226
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:24,717
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's almost time to try peeing.

227
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,011
Push. Concentrate on pushing.

228
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,388
I see the head.

229
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,975
Yes, it is a head!

230
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,393
Keep pushing. Come on.

231
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,104
I can't believe somebody's coming out!

232
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,065
There's somebody coming out of you!

233
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,191
It's my son!

234
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,486
All right.

235
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,115
Here's your first baby!

236
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,330
Yes! We got a baby boy!

237
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,040
Frank Junior, Junior!

238
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,501
How does he look?

239
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,670
So gross!

240
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,590
Okay. You ready to push again?

241
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,093
I already had a baby.
Leave me alone!

242
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:13,223
Come on, you can do it!
You can do it!

243
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,818
Little Leslie's here!
We got another one!

244
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:29,364
Oh, my God! I can't believe
I have two children.

245
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:33,035
How scary is that?

246
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,292
Come on, little Chandler,
it's time to be born.

247
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:44,504
He's coming!
Yes, he's coming!

248
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,552
Hey, where's his thing?

249
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:56,308
Chandler's a girl!

250
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:00,312
Oh, God! Kindergarten flashback.

251
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:04,232
They read the sonogram wrong,
because they thought it was a boy.

252
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,485
But Chandler's a girl!

253
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,613
Okay, keep saying it.

254
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,824
- Am I too late?
- No, no. Everything's okay.

255
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,744
There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.

256
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,705
We have our babies?

257
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,209
We have our babies.

258
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,140
Oh, my God!

259
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,894
You did it, man.

260
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,521
Would you like to see them?

261
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:49,152
They're so small.

262
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:58,537
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Great.

263
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,918
Are you really going to date
that nurse man?

264
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,463
You and I are just
"goofing around".

265
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,884
I thought, why not
"goof around" with him?

266
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:17,431
I don't know if you've looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

267
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,266
Well, I have...

268
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:23,520
...and the technical definition is...

269
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:28,525
..."two friends who care a lot
about each other...

270
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,904
...and have amazing sex...

271
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:38,202
...and just want to spend
more time together."

272
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:42,373
But if you have this new
dictionary that gets you mad at me...

273
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:46,877
...then we have to get you
my original one.

274
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,756
I am so bad at this.

275
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,885
- You're better than you think you are.
- Really?

276
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:55,969
Okay. So if...

277
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,307
- Know when to stop.
- I sensed that I should stop.

278
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:03,101
So we're okay?

279
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:07,564
I'm gonna go tell Dan that
it's not going to happen.

280
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,986
- Don't do the dance.
- Right.

281
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,824
You're my favorite.

282
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:22,580
- Which one do you have?
- I don't care.

283
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:29,586
Frank and Alice want me to tell you
they're making phone calls.

284
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:34,258
Did you talk to them
about, you know...

285
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:40,556
No, honey.

286
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,770
It was a long shot.

287
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:53,235
You guys? Can I just have
a second alone with the babies?

288
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,509
So here you are.

289
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:23,056
Seems like yesterday I was talking
to you in that petri dish.

290
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,522
Everyone said labor was
the hardest thing.

291
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:34,317
But they were wrong. This is.

292
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:40,241
Well, I had the most fun
with you guys.

293
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,161
I wish I could take you home
and see you every day.

294
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:51,210
I'll settle for being
your favorite aunt.

295
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:56,631
I know Alice's sister has a pool,
but you lived in me.

296
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,638
Okay, so we're cool.

297
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:07,267
We're going to be great.

298
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,812
Little high-fives.

299
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,908
Well, if you're going to cry...

300
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:41,551
Phoebe, we are so proud of you.
You're amazing!

301
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,305
I know.

302
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,765
Does it hurt as bad as they say?

303
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,644
You won't be able to take it.

304
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:54,273
Now that little Chandler is a girl,
what'll they name her?

305
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:56,775
They'll call her Chandler.

306
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:01,404
Kind of a masculine name,
don't you think?

307
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:04,075
It works on you.
