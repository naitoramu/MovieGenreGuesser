1
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:14,552
Hey, sleepy head!

2
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,951
- You up?
- What time is it?

3
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:21,254
Almost noon.

4
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:23,761
I'm afraid you've got to go.

5
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,625
- Excuse me?
- You've got to go.

6
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:29,736
I have friends coming over
for brunch.

7
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:32,830
What? In My apartment?

8
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:43,040
Sorry.

9
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:47,554
3 years and you still treat me
like a one-night stand!

10
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:07,134
Babies! Sorry, I'm late.
I had to deal with James.

11
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:08,935
James? I thought you
broke up with James.

12
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:11,738
I did. He's just not
taking it very well.

13
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,347
What? All alone in his big,
empty castle?

14
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:15,642
Be nice.

15
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:18,047
Anyway, I had to give
his ego CPR.

16
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:20,053
How tiresome.
What did you say?

17
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:21,552
Oh you know, how great he is,
how he's going to make

18
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,452
the right girl so happy,
how it's really not him,

19
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,456
- it's blah blah blah...
- And he believed you?

20
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:28,357
Of course not!
So then I had to fuck him.

21
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:29,554
Right.

22
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:31,455
Where's Peter?

23
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,541
Babies, we missed you
at brunch!

24
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,945
Sorry, I had to finish
1500 words for Empire.

25
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:51,745
- Talullah sends her love.
- How is she?

26
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:54,354
In love! With this Jamaican model
I set her up with.

27
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,752
Apparently, he shags her
4 times a day

28
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:58,859
and inspires her to write
volumes of new poetry!

29
00:02:58,993 --> 00:03:01,461
- Isn't that great?
- No, I hate Talullah's poetry.

30
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,961
Speaking of shags,
how was your date with Doug?

31
00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:06,332
- Fine.
- Fine? Just fine?

32
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:07,434
Look, Jacks!

33
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:09,832
I really appreciate you
trying to set me up with Doug

34
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,335
And Phil and John.

35
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:13,531
- What's wrong with Doug?
- Nothing, I just...

36
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:14,936
I just don't see much of
a future together.

37
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:16,838
How do you know that
after one dinner?

38
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:18,638
Maybe because we have
nothing in common?

39
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,644
That's not true.
You're an artist, Doug's an artist.

40
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:21,748
Doug's a florist!

41
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:23,349
He's a horticultural designer.

42
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:25,645
Yeah, whose 'life goal' is
to create a sculpture of

43
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:28,346
Princess Diana entirely of
bougainvillea.

44
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:29,547
You are such a snob!

45
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,555
I am not a snob!
I have hay fever.

46
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:32,750
I'd be allergic to Doug's work.

47
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,656
Look, Doug deserves better
than me.

48
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:36,956
You're never going to find
anyone with that attitude.

49
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:38,962
What attitude?
I'm just being realistic.

50
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,432
If you're realistic,
then I'm the Queen of England.

51
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:44,129
Hey! I'm the Queen of England!

52
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:46,637
Hello, your Majesty!

53
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:22,633
Oh Daphne, you poor thing!

54
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,539
Of course, I'll deal
with the shoot.

55
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,746
I can handle Sasha.

56
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:31,144
OK. Lots of love, big kiss.
Bye bye.

57
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:35,546
Since when do you say 'lots of
love, big kiss' to your boss?

58
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,953
Since Daphne's going through
a nasty divorce.

59
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:39,957
She needs positive affirmation.

60
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:42,153
Babies, what's wrong?

61
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,763
Nothing.
I'm just a little nervous.

62
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:45,364
He's meant to have
a ferocious temper.

63
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:46,431
Who?

64
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:49,331
Marvin Bernstein.
The man I'm interviewing today.

65
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,734
Since when do you get nervous
about celebrity profiles?

66
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:54,841
Since we're not talking about
some two-bit British TV presenter.

67
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:57,535
Marvin Bernstein is
a living legend!

68
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,339
The man's produced some of
the best films

69
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,538
in the last 20 years!

70
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:02,649
He's a giant among
the film industry!

71
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:05,149
- A giant?
- Maybe I should call in sick.

72
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:06,752
Maybe that's what's
bothering you.

73
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:07,854
That I'm not feeling well?

74
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:09,853
No, that Marvin Bernstein
reminds you

75
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,550
that these celebrity profiles
are meant to pay the rent.

76
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:14,661
While you're focusing on
your screenplays.

77
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:17,263
Can we not talk about my
nonexistent film career right now?

78
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:19,127
I'm feeling small enough
as it is.

79
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:27,130
Babies? Just remember.

80
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:32,041
Marvin Bernstein may be a giant.
But You are a giant in waiting.

81
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:34,044
Yes, yes I am.

82
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:36,240
- I have no idea what that means.
- Neither do I.

83
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:49,958
I'm here to see
Mr. Marvin Bernstein.

84
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:51,564
- Your name?
- Peter Simon.

85
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:56,231
Peter Simon.
Any relation to Neil?

86
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:56,927
Excuse me?

87
00:05:57,071 --> 00:06:00,438
Neil Simon! Great writer.
You a great writer?

88
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:01,836
Oh, I don't know.

89
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,340
You'd know if you were great.

90
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:06,738
Mr Bernstein?
Kenneth Branagh on line 2.

91
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,643
Kenneth Branagh!
Another great writer!

92
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:09,840
Kenny B!

93
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:13,353
I loved the script!
I loved it!

94
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:14,545
Fuckin' brilliant dialogue!

95
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:19,957
Well, hat's off to
Shakespeare then!

96
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:21,857
- No answer.
- What?

97
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:26,728
I said no answer in
Mr. Bernstein's room.

98
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,528
Oh, right.

99
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,329
Fine. I'll just wait.

100
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:33,531
Please.

101
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:47,451
OK, ladies, arms around
each other.

102
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:49,954
OK, now, Jade look into
BenG's eyes, please.

103
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,354
Thank you very much, OK.
No! With love.

104
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:53,858
Pandora. How's it going?

105
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:57,054
Oh, you know, BenG hates Jade.
Jade hates BenG.

106
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:58,755
And Sasha hates everyone.

107
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,230
Nothing like a happy set.

108
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,632
Hello? I'm waiting!

109
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:08,040
Paolo, when I have to ask for it,
it's too late!

110
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,439
Who's the cutie?

111
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,144
Sasha's latest squeeze.
Argentinean.

112
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:18,740
Apparently, Sasha picked him up
at lpanema Beach.

113
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:22,049
Amazing how Sasha always finds
his 'assistants' at the beach.

114
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:23,156
Isn't it?

115
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,350
I suppose it allows him to
examine their 'qualifications'.

116
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:38,835
Talullah? What's wrong?

117
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:41,031
Oh God! I just had
a huge row with Freedom

118
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:42,039
and I think it's over.

119
00:07:42,176 --> 00:07:43,939
OK, I'm in the middle of
a shoot...

120
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,045
Oh God! I feel like dying!

121
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,546
OK. Tell me exactly
what happened.

122
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:50,741
Well, he came over
and we shagged.

123
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:52,943
And then I asked him
what he thought about monogamy.

124
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:55,247
You don't talk about monogamy
After you shag a guy...

125
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,653
- No, no but he said he liked monogamy.
- He did?

126
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:02,057
Then he said he also likes
oak and pine and maple...

127
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:03,561
So he's got a sense of humour.

128
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:04,959
Monogamy is not a laughing matter.

129
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,623
If Freedom ever cheated on me,
I don't think I could go on!

130
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:09,429
Talullah! You've known
the guy for a week.

131
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,731
Stop talking like you're
in some kind of a movie.

132
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:13,533
I can't help it.
I'm naturally dramatic.

133
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:15,335
Excuse me.
Sasha needs you.

134
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:17,739
Oh, right.
I'll be right there.

135
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,947
- Who is that?
- Sasha's assistant. He's gay.

136
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:23,947
- What?
- Gay!

137
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:25,745
- How can you tell?
- Trust me.

138
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,148
I have the best gaydar
in London.

139
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:28,948
That boy gay as a goose.

140
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:32,352
Lucky fucking geese.

141
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:36,654
Excuse me, sir.

142
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:40,233
We've just got word Mr. Bernstein
had to fly back to New York.

143
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:43,734
Oh, right. Thank you.

144
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:58,747
I'm so sorry!

145
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,148
I'm so sorry.

146
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,754
Now you love her!
Feed a grape.

147
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,954
With love! Real love!
Excellent!

148
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:11,564
And crush a grape on her mouth.

149
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:14,832
Excellent!
Make it sexy! More sexy!

150
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,128
Make the grape sexy!

151
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,433
Yes! Yes! And kiss her.
On the mouth.

152
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:23,031
Excellent! Sexy love!
Yeah, I think we have it!

153
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:33,449
Jacks, would it be all right
if I borrowed an outfitjust for tonight?

154
00:09:33,587 --> 00:09:34,747
I kind of have a date.

155
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:37,152
- A date? With who?
- Oh, just this guy.

156
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,849
I mean, I'm not sure
it's even technically a date.

157
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:39,856
It's just dinner.

158
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:43,258
Pandora. Pick out the sexiest
outfit and go home immediately!

159
00:09:43,397 --> 00:09:45,661
- But what about the wrap?
- I'll cover for you!

160
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,131
What's more important?
True love or fashion?

161
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:48,234
It's just a dinner...

162
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:49,232
OK. Let me rephrase that.

163
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:51,530
What's more important,
anything or fashion?

164
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:52,639
Thanks, Jacks.

165
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:54,831
Paolo, querido.

166
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:56,943
Dinner, 9 o'clock, Nobu.
Don't be late.

167
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:58,339
I can't face them on my own.

168
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:00,446
- No problem.
- Gracias, carino!

169
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,444
Katie from Purple will be
picking these up in the morning.

170
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:08,645
Alright.

171
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:12,449
James!

172
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:16,653
How was your day?

173
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:29,233
- Anybody home?
- In here!

174
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:31,742
So how'd it go with
the legendary giant?

175
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,545
- It didn't. He stood me up.
- I'm sorry, Babies.

176
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,046
Why are you reading
a cookbook in the nude?

177
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:37,241
It's 'The Naked Chef.'

178
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:39,750
- What? You're keeping him company?
- I'm waiting for the shower.

179
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:42,150
You're almost out of shampoo
so I had to use soap.

180
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,054
- Oh hi, Peter.
- Hello, James. How are you?

181
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:49,560
- Good, yes. You?
- Yes, good. Thanks.

182
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:52,626
Well, I better be off.

183
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,426
My flight's at 9
and I've still got to pack.

184
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,528
Right.

185
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:00,034
- I'll call you when I land.
- Have fun in New York!

186
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,140
Thank you.

187
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,935
- Bye, Peter.
- Bye, James.

188
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:12,142
Jacks?

189
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:15,247
What are you doing?

190
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,857
Reading this delicious recipe
for Beetroot Salad

191
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:19,856
with marjoram
and balsamic vinegar dressing!

192
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:22,359
- What are you doing with James?
- Nothing.

193
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:24,361
You broke up with him
a month ago!

194
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:26,830
I know, it's just sex.
He fills a void.

195
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:27,729
Literally.

196
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:29,335
I don't see how you expect
to meet someone new

197
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,334
if you spend all your time
with your ex.

198
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:32,529
Good point!

199
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:34,037
Maybe I should get back
together with James

200
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:35,835
so I spend less time with him.

201
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,043
I don't think it's funny.

202
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:39,338
Neither do I.

203
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,743
What's the point of shagging
someone ad nauseam

204
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:43,144
if you know you're never
going to love them?

205
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:44,443
It's not so simple.

206
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,950
He's in love with you, Jacks.
You're not in love with him.

207
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:48,145
It doesn't get more simple than that.

208
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:51,451
That's not fair! I happen to
care about James. A lot.

209
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:53,559
And I hate the fact
that he feels more than me.

210
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,558
And I hate the fact
that I'm not in love with him.

211
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:56,957
Because I know I should be.

212
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:59,725
Because he's smart and sweet
and decent

213
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,424
and I don't want to hurt him.

214
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:03,627
So I keep hoping that
I'll grow into it.

215
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,534
That maybe one day
I'll wake up and I'll feel...

216
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:08,641
- What?
- In love!

217
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,141
You know, dizzy and
feverish and nauseous...

218
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:12,836
That's not love, Jacks.
That's the flu.

219
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:14,844
Well, at least I'm trying!
You big cynic.

220
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:16,141
I'm not a cynic!

221
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,046
When's the last time you even
considered falling in love?

222
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:19,345
Today!

223
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:22,353
I'm not talking about some
character in a novel or a movie.

224
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:23,547
Neither am I.

225
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,356
- What?
- What?

226
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:29,553
What? Peter!

227
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:32,162
So, tell me everything!
What's his name?

228
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:34,231
David Williams.

229
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:37,825
- David Williams, and?
- And what?

230
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:41,429
And, who is he?
Where'd you meet him?

231
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,236
How'd you meet?
Tell me everything!

232
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:45,736
Well...

233
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,541
I was on my way out of the hotel.
And he was walking in.

234
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,745
He had these two paintings under his arm
and a Sotheby's catalogue

235
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:55,855
and we just sort of bumped
into each other.

236
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:57,752
I can't explain it, but...

237
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:00,352
It was amazing.

238
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:03,861
Because it was like I was
finally seeing the person.

239
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:06,329
I'd been waiting for
my entire life.

240
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:10,428
Oh my God!
That's so romantic!

241
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:13,940
So when do I get to meet him?

242
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:17,138
Right after I do?

243
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:19,636
- What?
- Well... We didn't actually meet.

244
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,440
Per se. As it were...

245
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:23,747
But you know his name.

246
00:13:23,884 --> 00:13:26,148
Yes, it was on
the Sotheby's catalogue.

247
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:29,152
He dropped it
and I picked it up.

248
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,453
And you didn't say anything?

249
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:34,553
You didn't speak?

250
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:45,531
And this is the person you
think you could be in love with?

251
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:48,539
Someone that you've never
even spoken to?

252
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:49,733
Someone that you've
never even met?

253
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:51,741
Look, Jacks, I know
it sounds crazy.

254
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:53,345
I just...

255
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:56,340
I really think he's the one.

256
00:13:58,485 --> 00:13:59,850
Of course he is...

257
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:12,057
I don't think I can face this.

258
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:14,724
Of course you can!
We're here to support Finlay!

259
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:16,426
Besides, you can't stay
at home every night,

260
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,629
pining for someone
you've never even met!

261
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:19,830
Thank you.

262
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:33,346
I thought this whole dead
animal thing was 10 years ago.

263
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,249
In formaldehyde, yes.

264
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,549
But Finlay says this stuff
isn't preserved.

265
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:40,455
- It rots right in front of your eyes!
- Nice!

266
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:44,357
Where is Fin anyway?
Say our hellos before I turn vegan.

267
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,725
Hello? Hello.

268
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:49,528
I'm Finlay McMillan
and I would like to

269
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:52,229
welcome all of you
to Unicorn & Gallagher's

270
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:53,430
LIFE IS DEATH exhibit.

271
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:56,235
Freedom, get me a glass of champagne.
My throat's parched.

272
00:14:57,177 --> 00:14:58,144
Do I look like a slave?

273
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:00,041
Before I introduce
the artist himself,

274
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,844
Talullah Wentworth has very kindly
agreed to read one of her poems.

275
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:06,350
Talullah Wentworth!

276
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,454
God help us!

277
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,457
I think it's sweet.
Talullah wanting to be Sylvia Plath.

278
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:15,652
Well, she should fast forward
and find an oven.

279
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:18,064
Thank you, Finlay.

280
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:23,932
And thank you Unicorn for
this truly moving exhibit!

281
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:29,037
I'd like to dedicate this poem
to Finlay's lover

282
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:31,837
and my best friend,
Troy Johnson,

283
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:34,037
who's birthday it is today!

284
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:37,445
Troy would have loved
to come tonight,

285
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:40,849
but thanks to the conspiracy
of silence

286
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:43,353
between the Catholic Church
and the Tories

287
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,856
in the face of Aids, he can't.

288
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:47,960
Because he's dead.

289
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:50,961
- I'm not drunk enough for this.
- Neither is Finlay.

290
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:54,925
MEAT.

291
00:15:56,269 --> 00:16:00,933
Big black dick
in nice soft chick.

292
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:03,736
I never knew
the thrill I'd feel,

293
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:06,539
knowing how you had to steal.

294
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,843
You dangled your worm,
I took the bait.

295
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,043
This fish is caught.
It's only fate.

296
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:18,952
DIE DIE DIE
White lmperialist Pigs.

297
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:22,755
Aristocracy is pale and weak.

298
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:25,558
You can't kill my love.

299
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:29,533
He's black.
He's MEAT.

300
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,846
Jacks! What are you doing here?

301
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:47,953
I just came back to
make sure you're OK.

302
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:50,249
- I'm fine. Sure.
- Yeah?

303
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:52,558
Yeah! Absolutely.

304
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:56,958
I just hate this day,
you know?

305
00:16:57,097 --> 00:16:58,359
10 years.

306
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:00,926
How come I still miss
him so much?

307
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,729
Because you are an amazing
human being.

308
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,338
And because he was
an amazing human being.

309
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:08,839
And because I'm a silly
old queen.

310
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:10,033
That too.

311
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:14,042
- Thanks, Jacks.
- For what?

312
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,647
For always remembering.

313
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:17,943
And for being there for me.
For all of us.

314
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,644
I'm a superficial assistant
at a major fashion magazine.

315
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:22,550
You'll ruin my reputation.

316
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,247
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.

317
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:25,449
Besides, I need your help
with Peter.

318
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:27,059
He's fallen madly in love.

319
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:29,559
- Yeah? With who?
- I don't know. Neither does he.

320
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:30,754
Right!

321
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:34,833
Speaking of boyfriends,
how's what's his name?

322
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:36,526
- You mean Freedom?
- Freedom.

323
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,933
- What kind of name is Freedom?
- Jamaican, darling.

324
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:41,939
- Why didn't he come to brunch?
- We had a row about his car.

325
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,838
I told him I don't generally
get into vehicles

326
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:45,444
that cost less than my handbag.

327
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:47,341
And he accused me of
being a spoiled bitch

328
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,345
who's only in love
with his skin color.

329
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:50,949
Which is surprisingly
insightful for someone

330
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:52,949
who's stoned 24 hours a day.

331
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:56,249
- Oh, and the creep keeps calling.
- What creep?

332
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:58,755
From the phone company.
His name's Tony.

333
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:01,656
He calls me 5 times a day
begging me to go out with him.

334
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:03,763
Apparently my voice haunts him.

335
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:06,331
You have an obscene caller
from British Telecom?

336
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:08,627
I told her she should
report him to the police.

337
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:12,534
I would, but he promised me
free broadband.

338
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,230
- What is broadband?
- Hi, guys, sorry I'm late.

339
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:15,841
- Hi, Fin. How are you?
- Hello, darling!

340
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,533
Hi, just a cappuccino please.

341
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:19,645
So, I made a few calls
and I'm pretty certain

342
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:20,541
it's who I thought.

343
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,442
Are you serious?

344
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:24,345
Well, he was definitely at
the Chancery Hotel last Monday.

345
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:26,145
- Oh, my God!
- What are we talking about?

346
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:27,651
Finlay's figured out
who Peter fell in love

347
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:28,446
with last week.

348
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:31,250
He was at the Chancery Hotel,
monday morning, seeing a client!

349
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:32,858
- Who was?
- David Williams!

350
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:35,358
- You know the guy I bumped into?
- I know David!

351
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:36,860
I love biblical names.

352
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:39,328
I used to have a cat
named David. King David!

353
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,730
- What's he like?
- He's dead, fell out of a tree.

354
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:43,836
He's head of Sotheby's
Contemporary Art Department.

355
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,337
He's smart, charming, kind.
Attractive, as you know.

356
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:49,237
All the rich ladies
have crushes on him!

357
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,842
During his auctions,
they all try and outbid

358
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:51,944
each otherjust to impress him!

359
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:53,739
I bet my Mother's one of
those rich old women.

360
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,142
- Is he gay?
- He's gay!

361
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:56,145
So was my cat.

362
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:58,842
Actually, I can't believe
I haven't tried to fix you up ages ago.

363
00:18:58,985 --> 00:18:59,952
He's perfect for you!

364
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:02,554
And he was very intrigued by
what I told him.

365
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:04,748
What you told him?
What did you tell him?

366
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:05,949
Nothing.

367
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:08,958
OK, everything.

368
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:10,357
- But he was really flattered.
- Oh God!

369
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:12,431
- There's no way I can meet him now.
- What? Why not?

370
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:13,623
Because it's too set up!

371
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,927
There's no way he'll be
into me knowing I'm so into him.

372
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:17,832
David's not like that!
Trust me!

373
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:19,529
I have to agree with Peter.

374
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,537
I think accidental meets
are much better.

375
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:24,438
Take me and Freedom.
We met in a launderette.

376
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:27,045
After I told you
he was going to be there!

377
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,447
Which isn't to say
accidents can't be planned.

378
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:47,325
Are you OK?

379
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,225
I'm fine.

380
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:51,628
I'm always like this
when I have to see my mother.

381
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:53,136
Would you rather not go?

382
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:55,540
No, don't be silly!

383
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:57,336
This is your big night!

384
00:19:57,477 --> 00:20:00,344
Besides Mother loves you.
She loves this David.

385
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,643
Her theme song is
'Matchmaker, Matchmaker.'

386
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:09,050
Do you want a brownie?
I made them myself.

387
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,348
Thank you.

388
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:14,958
These are very good.

389
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:17,358
Yes, they've got quite
a lot of hash in them.

390
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:23,633
Talullah! What's wrong?

391
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,540
Freedom's having an affair.

392
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:30,040
An affair?
You've only been going out for 2 weeks!

393
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:31,734
Who's he having an affair with?

394
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,639
Me, I just found out
he's married.

395
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:53,827
- Are you OK?
- Oh! Yes, fine.

396
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:57,528
I just lost my keys
and they're playing hard to get.

397
00:20:58,571 --> 00:20:59,629
Tada!

398
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:02,639
We haven't met properly.
I'm Paolo Sarmiento by the way.

399
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:03,833
Emily Jackson.

400
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:05,945
But all my friends
just call me 'Jacks.'

401
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,242
OK. All my friends
just call me Paolo.

402
00:21:10,383 --> 00:21:11,441
OK.

403
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,643
You look very beautiful.

404
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:18,248
Oh! Well, I'm going to this
black tie thing for my roommate.

405
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:20,359
Well, it's not exactly
for my roommate.

406
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:23,053
But... I mean, thanks.

407
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:25,555
Take care.

408
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:27,127
Can I give you a lift?

409
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:28,426
Oh! That's OK.

410
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:30,229
I have to meet Sasha
in Bloomsbury so...

411
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,530
That's where I'm headed!

412
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,433
OK.

413
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:35,334
- Get in!
- Thank you.

414
00:21:44,484 --> 00:21:46,645
Oh, Talullah! There you are!

415
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,754
This is Klaus Fassbinder.

416
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:50,651
Klaus, this is
my daughter Talullah.

417
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,257
And this is her best friend, Paul.

418
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:54,656
- It's Peter, Mother!
- It's all right.

419
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:57,354
Darling, you could have
worn something nicer.

420
00:21:57,497 --> 00:21:59,624
You could have worn something.
Full stop.

421
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:04,228
Sorry, Fassbinder, are you
related to the director?

422
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,430
- Who?
- Oh, never mind.

423
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,837
Mrs. Wentworth, thank you
so much for this invitation.

424
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:12,240
Oh please! Call me Felicity!

425
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:13,936
David is perfect
for you, darling!

426
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,049
I can't think why I didn't
set you two up earlier!

427
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:19,549
So, you're Felicity's daughter?

428
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,847
Only by birth.
So don't hold it against me.

429
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:24,047
Donatella!
Excuse me.

430
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:30,153
Whoever designed those heels
must really hate women.

431
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:32,731
I designed those heels.

432
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:35,124
And thank goodness you did!

433
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:38,237
Otherwise Mother's arse
would be dusting the floor.

434
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:46,244
So how long have you
and Sasha been together?

435
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:47,243
3 months.

436
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,245
Really?
How did you two meet?

437
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:53,841
- It's a bit embarrassing actually.
- Oh go on. Tell me.

438
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:57,353
We met at a beach party
at lpanema.

439
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,959
Sasha wanted to take my picture.
I said no.

440
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:04,154
He pestered me.
And one thing led to another.

441
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:05,457
And...

442
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:07,627
Well, here I am.

443
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,826
Sasha's a wonderful photographer.

444
00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:11,334
Yes. So everyone says.

445
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:13,234
You're not interested in
photography?

446
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:16,739
Oh, very much.
I studied it at university.

447
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:20,642
But I'm more into reportage.
Capturing real moments.

448
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,645
Sasha's brilliant at capturing
real moments.

449
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:23,840
Don't you think?

450
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,446
Not really.

451
00:23:26,586 --> 00:23:29,749
I think Sasha's brilliant
at creating moments.

452
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:31,447
Most of which aren't real.

453
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:33,354
But then again,
fashion isn't real,

454
00:23:33,493 --> 00:23:36,360
so maybe he's capturing
reality after all.

455
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:37,463
What do you think?

456
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:42,733
I think people shouldn't bite
the hand that feeds them.

457
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:45,127
Excuse me?

458
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:48,434
I mean, thanks to a chance
encounter at a beach party,

459
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:51,441
you hook up with one of
the world's top fashion photographers.

460
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:53,636
First class travel,
exotic locations.

461
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,044
You really hit quite the jackpot.

462
00:23:56,182 --> 00:23:57,342
You think that's why I'm with him?

463
00:23:57,483 --> 00:24:00,145
Well, it's obviously not
out of respect for his work.

464
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:02,855
Do you always judge people
so quickly?

465
00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:03,956
I'm notjudging you.

466
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,057
No?

467
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:07,056
Then maybe you're judging Sasha.

468
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:08,353
You seem to think
the only reason

469
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:11,054
someone might be with him is
for this 'jackpot.'

470
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:15,825
This is fine.

471
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:22,232
Thanks for the ride.

472
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:32,940
I would like to welcome you
all to this year's

473
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:36,953
'Fashion Against the lmpending
Threat of Global Warming.'

474
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:44,562
There is nothing more important
right now, than global poverty.

475
00:24:44,697 --> 00:24:48,224
I mean in the warming sense.

476
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,835
Actually, I was just talking
to Donatella.

477
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:54,540
- Sorry, I'm late. So is he here?
- Not yet.

478
00:24:54,674 --> 00:24:56,335
- Where's Talullah?
- In the bathroom.

479
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:58,739
She's been eating large
quantities of hash brownies.

480
00:24:58,878 --> 00:24:59,845
- Again?
- Yeah.

481
00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:04,143
So with no further ado,
I would like to introduce

482
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:06,148
any available
British celebrity!

483
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:11,345
I mean...
Angus Deaton!

484
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:24,937
- Bitch!
- Wanker!

485
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:27,335
Thank you and thank you
to Felicity for all her.

486
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:32,035
Jacks! You look so pretty!

487
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:35,238
I think you're very,
very pretty Jacks.

488
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:36,746
Thank you, Talullah.

489
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:38,646
I think you're very pretty too.

490
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:41,344
But not as pretty as
Freedom's wife!

491
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:43,546
I'm sure you're far prettier
than Freedom's wife.

492
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:46,055
You're just saying that
because you're a POOF!

493
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:48,160
Talullah!
What's wrong with you?

494
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:49,454
Genetics.

495
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:53,224
- Hello, Jones.
- It's Jacks, Mother!

496
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:56,631
- You look lovely!
- Thank you. So do you!

497
00:25:56,769 --> 00:25:57,827
I don't!

498
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,631
I'm pasty white.

499
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:03,041
Why wasn't I born black?

500
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:06,036
OK, first up then
we have an outfit called

501
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:10,046
Ice Dream donated by
Klaus Fassbinder!

502
00:26:12,485 --> 00:26:15,852
Let's start the bidding.
If you would at 1,000 pounds.

503
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:16,647
Thank you, sir.

504
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:19,155
David's flight from New York
must have been delayed.

505
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:21,351
But he should be here
at any minute.

506
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:24,354
He was very intrigued by
what I told him!

507
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:26,124
What, what you told him?

508
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,028
You know, about how you saw
him at the hotel

509
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:31,136
and it was love at first sight!
And what a catch you are.

510
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,239
How it's about time you found
yourself a nice boyfriend!

511
00:26:36,075 --> 00:26:37,440
You told him all that?

512
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:40,643
He seemed very flattered Paul!

513
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,441
1,500 pounds.

514
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:46,642
Any advance on 1,500 pounds?

515
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:49,653
Going once, going twice...

516
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:52,257
10,000 pounds!

517
00:26:53,993 --> 00:26:57,759
10,000 pounds!

518
00:26:57,897 --> 00:26:59,330
Don't touch the dress!

519
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,927
Any advance on 10,000 pounds.

520
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:04,831
No?

521
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:07,337
Going once. Going twice!

522
00:27:08,474 --> 00:27:09,839
10,000 pounds!

523
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:18,949
I was only joking.
I was just kidding!

524
00:27:20,286 --> 00:27:24,746
I was only joking.
It was a joke.

525
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:26,849
Charity!

526
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:39,233
Hello?
Oh, hi James.

527
00:27:39,372 --> 00:27:42,136
- Do I live here?
- No, I live here.

528
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:43,935
Oh, how do you do?

529
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,642
Oh, Peter, I feel so bad.

530
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:53,945
C'mon, drink this.

531
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:55,348
No, I mean about you.

532
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:58,946
Not getting to meet
Robbie Williams because of me.

533
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:00,149
It's OK.

534
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:15,031
<i>#I'm loving angels instead...</i>

535
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:17,335
- How's our patient?
- She'll live.

536
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:20,536
- Well, I have great news!
- Oh yes, what?

537
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,546
- You know James is in New York.
- Yes, that is great news.

538
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:27,140
Who guess he ran into at one of
the Art Auctions over there.

539
00:28:27,887 --> 00:28:30,549
- Who?
- David Williams!

540
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:33,453
OK! Please, please tell me
he didn't say anything!

541
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:35,651
- Was he not meant to say anything?
- Oh, my god!

542
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:37,160
News of my crush has just
travelled across

543
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:38,456
the Atlantic Ocean!

544
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:41,327
David Williams must think
I'm a needy, desperate freak!

545
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:44,231
Well, there's no point in pretending
to be something you're not!

546
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:47,336
Where do you think you're going?

547
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:50,435
I just remembered.
I need a pedicure.

548
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:54,535
Talullah. I think just this once,
you should paint your own toenails.

549
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,147
Don't be ridiculous!

550
00:28:56,282 --> 00:28:59,843
I need a lot more incentive
to bend over that far.

551
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,957
There's nail polish here.

552
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:09,653
- Oh, are we at the salon?
- Yes.

553
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:33,647
- Ready for lunch?
- Sure am!

554
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:35,947
Is everything OK?

555
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:38,454
Oh yeah. Fine.
T-cells unchanged.

556
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:39,956
Liver holding up.
Everything's great.

557
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:42,458
So despite your fragile beauty,
you're actually built like an ox.

558
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:43,562
Go figure.

559
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:45,459
Did you hear the news
about David?

560
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:47,623
Yes. Talullah's Mother told me
he never even showed.

561
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,529
Which actually proves
my theory he must think

562
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:50,532
I'm a stalker freak.

563
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:52,830
I'm sure he doesn't think that.

564
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:55,736
Fin, in 3 short weeks he's heard
about my desperate obsession

565
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,139
from you, from Talullah's mother,
and now from James,

566
00:29:58,277 --> 00:29:59,642
all the way in New York!

567
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:00,836
Read this!

568
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:04,346
David didn't show because
he had to stay in New York.

569
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:07,350
Because he was promoted to
Sotheby's New York office.

570
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:08,453
Satisfied?

571
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:11,948
I can't believe I drove him
out the country.

572
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:13,149
Come on.

573
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:23,426
Jacks.

574
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,337
Have you ever thought
this whole 'true love' thing

575
00:30:26,472 --> 00:30:27,530
might be a conspiracy?

576
00:30:27,673 --> 00:30:30,141
- A conspiracy?
- Yeah, a capitalist conspiracy.

577
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:33,837
A lie concocted by the Film,
Publishing and Music industries.

578
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:36,743
All pushing this thing, this
concept that doesn't even exist!

579
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:38,747
True love doesn't exist?

580
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:40,152
Well, think about it.

581
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:42,254
Where is it besides songs,
books and films?

582
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:45,357
I mean, who can honestly say
'I will always love you? '

583
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:47,550
- Whitney Houston?
- Yeah, when she's high on crack.

584
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:50,059
The point is, Everyone's miserable
because they're looking for

585
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:52,164
this nonexistent 'thing,'
or else they're miserable

586
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:54,232
because they think they've
settled for less.

587
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:56,834
I'm not miserable.
And I believe in true love.

588
00:30:56,969 --> 00:30:59,529
Yeah, which is why you're still
sleeping with your ex-boyfriend.

589
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:01,936
'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is on.
Wanna watch?

590
00:31:02,074 --> 00:31:05,237
I just told you films have
destroyed my ability to love.

591
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:06,844
I thought that was your mother.

592
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:09,242
Good point. Shove over.

593
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:19,050
This is your favorite film?

594
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:20,658
Look at me. Can't you tell?

595
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:50,553
- Where's Daphne?
- Out.

596
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,247
Can I give her a message?

597
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:54,450
These are the contact sheets
from the shoot.

598
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:55,560
I've marked my selects.

599
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:57,753
Tell Daphne my assistant
Paolo is handling the retouching,

600
00:31:57,896 --> 00:31:59,727
so if she needs any other prints,
she can call him at the lab.

601
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:00,524
OK.

602
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,430
And if she needs me,
I'll be at my boyfriend's in Paris.

603
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:06,037
- Paolo?
- What about him?

604
00:32:06,472 --> 00:32:08,235
Paolo isn't your boyfriend?

605
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:11,036
Why would you think
he was my boyfriend?

606
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:13,838
I just assumed.
Talking to Paolo.

607
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:15,742
- Really?
- I'm sorry.

608
00:32:16,682 --> 00:32:18,445
No need to be sorry, carino!

609
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:21,348
You're not the first person
who gets this impression from Paolo.

610
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:25,048
To be honest, I think maybe
he had a little crush on me.

611
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:29,149
I'm very flattered of course,
and if I wasn't already involved.

612
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,956
But, you know,
it's all about timing, no?

613
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:34,031
And right now, I have a train
to catch! Ciao ciao!

614
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:38,236
Ciao, ciao.

615
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,941
These look great.

616
00:32:50,082 --> 00:32:51,242
Paolo.

617
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:54,949
Look, I'm sorry about
the other night.

618
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:58,147
Sasha told me everything
and I feel like an idiot.

619
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:00,649
Could you please forgive me?

620
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:03,352
Yes.

621
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:04,860
You don't know me.

622
00:33:04,997 --> 00:33:07,227
If you did, you'd know
I'd never take advantage of Sasha.

623
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,429
Anyway. I should go.

624
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:11,327
Have a good weekend.

625
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:13,829
You, too.

626
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:26,651
- So how do I get to know you?
- What?

627
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:29,345
- How about over a cup of coffee?
- A cup of coffee?

628
00:33:29,488 --> 00:33:31,046
It's the least I could do
after the other day!

629
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,455
Besides, we can't have you all
alone in London on a Friday night!

630
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:36,356
You make me sound like
an exchange student.

631
00:33:36,495 --> 00:33:38,463
- I didn't mean it like that.
- No?

632
00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:41,725
Then why else would someone like
you want to have a coffee with me?

633
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:42,925
Someone like me?

634
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:45,229
It's OK. Really.
I forgive you.

635
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:48,932
So you can stop feeling sorry
for me or guilty or whatever.

636
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:51,235
I'm sure you have better things
to do on a Friday night.

637
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,539
Actually, 'someone like me' has
nothing to do on a Friday night. OK?

638
00:33:58,684 --> 00:34:01,653
Oh, but wait, now you're going to
say 'someone like me'

639
00:34:01,787 --> 00:34:05,348
only wants to have
coffee with you

640
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:08,051
because I've got nothing
better to do.

641
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:12,323
I just can't win can I?
Never mind.

642
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:16,525
To tell you the truth,
'someone like me' hates coffee.

643
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:18,533
I hate coffee too.

644
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:21,029
Este...

645
00:34:21,173 --> 00:34:22,936
Where did you learn to
speak Spanish like that?

646
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:25,635
What? Not what you'd expect
from 'someone like me? '

647
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:27,743
I find you very confusing.

648
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,849
So does my boyfriend.
My ex-boyfriend.

649
00:34:32,885 --> 00:34:34,352
Do you want to get a drink?

650
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:35,953
There's this amazing place
near here.

651
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:37,851
Tonight's South American night.

652
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:44,260
OK. But only because I feel
sorry for myself,

653
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:46,330
and I know you must feel guilty.

654
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:51,831
I really appreciate you
seeing me on such short notice.

655
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,335
Finlay thinks the world of you.

656
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:55,940
And I think THE WORLD of Finlay!

657
00:34:59,178 --> 00:35:00,645
Yes, well...

658
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:03,748
He said you really sorted him
out on the relationship front.

659
00:35:03,882 --> 00:35:06,043
And I could certainly use
some help there.

660
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:09,848
You see I've never actually
been in a relationship

661
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:11,148
except in my own head.

662
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,757
And how long did that last?

663
00:35:13,392 --> 00:35:15,860
- What?
- The relationship in your head.

664
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:18,253
No. I mean,
it's an ongoing problem.

665
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:22,128
They only last in my head.
For varying amounts of time.

666
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:24,326
So you have a problem
with monogamy?

667
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:29,136
No, no that.
No, that's not my problem.

668
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:33,040
Denial is not a river in Egypt!

669
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,137
Not a river in Egypt.
D'you see what I did there?

670
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:40,740
Just that's a little therapistjoke.
Doesn't always work.

671
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:42,854
- OK, right. Paul?
- Peter.

672
00:35:42,988 --> 00:35:44,546
- Sorry?
- Peter.

673
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:47,853
Peter. Peter. Yes, it is.
You're absolutely right. Peter.

674
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:51,360
That's a good start.
Well done you!

675
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:52,930
I think I can help you.

676
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:55,033
- You do?
- I do.

677
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,829
I think you are stuck in
that pre relationship

678
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,133
moment of infatuation
and you need to be reminded

679
00:36:01,273 --> 00:36:05,039
that a real relationship has
many, many, many more stages.

680
00:36:05,177 --> 00:36:06,940
Stages. I like that.

681
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,539
Relationships are best measured
by farting.

682
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:13,952
Excuse me?

683
00:36:14,086 --> 00:36:17,647
The stages of a relationship
can be defined by farting.

684
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:20,656
Stage 1 is the conspiracy of silence.

685
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:24,660
This is a fantasy period
where both parties pretend

686
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:27,424
that they have no bodily waste.

687
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:30,228
This illusion is very quickly
shattered by that first shy

688
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:35,033
'ooh did you fart? ' followed by
the sheepish admission of truth.

689
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:38,336
This heralds a period of
deeper intimacy.

690
00:36:38,477 --> 00:36:42,243
A period I like to call
the 'fart honeymoon'.

691
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:46,442
Where both parties find each
other's gas just the cutest thing

692
00:36:46,585 --> 00:36:48,052
in the world.

693
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:51,952
But of course no honeymoon
can last forever.

694
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:57,551
And so we reach the critical
fork in the fart.

695
00:36:57,696 --> 00:37:01,325
Either the fart loses its power
to amuse and embarrass,

696
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:04,833
thereby signifying
true love or else,

697
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,428
it begins to annoy and disgust.

698
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:13,637
Thereby symbolizing all
that is blocked and rancid

699
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:15,337
in the formerly beloved.

700
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,038
Do you see what I'm getting at?

701
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:21,147
Peter? Peter?

702
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:22,344
Earth to Peter?

703
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:23,044
- What?
- Sorry I'm late.

704
00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:25,554
I was talking to Tony.

705
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:26,658
Who's Tony?

706
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:29,659
You know. Tony.
From the phone company.

707
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:31,660
You're seeing your
obscene phone caller?

708
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:33,526
Of course I'm not
'seeing him', darling.

709
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:36,725
We're having a strictly
phone-based relationship.

710
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:38,028
So what's going on?

711
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:41,335
Finlay thinks I should
see his therapist.

712
00:37:41,473 --> 00:37:42,633
Finlay sees a therapist?

713
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:45,538
Yeah, some woman he says is
really good with relationships.

714
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,042
Maybe I should see her.

715
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:50,148
I think I need to get in touch
with my inner child.

716
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:52,443
Talullah, if you get in touch
with your inner child

717
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:54,051
you're going to need
an inner nanny.

718
00:37:54,186 --> 00:37:56,746
Oh, I don't trust nannies.
They're all whores!

719
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:59,152
- What about Mary Poppins?
- Slut!

720
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,952
What are you talking about?

721
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:03,061
She left the convent,
married Christopher Plummer,

722
00:38:03,195 --> 00:38:05,254
and then took all his children
up the Alps.

723
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:08,929
Speaking of The Sound of Music,
where's Jacks?

724
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,740
The riots completely
shut down Buenos Aires.

725
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,433
It was unbelievable!

726
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:20,943
The whole country,
rich, poor, young, old,

727
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,240
everyone for this one moment,
came together.

728
00:38:23,382 --> 00:38:26,351
- These are incredible!
- The moment was incredible.

729
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:28,248
You captured the moment.

730
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:31,447
My friend Finlay owns an art gallery.
I'd love to show these to him.

731
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,649
- That's very kind of you but...
- Very kind of me? What?

732
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,453
You think you're some
kind of charity case?

733
00:38:35,594 --> 00:38:38,757
- No, but... I just...
- Don't tell me you're afraid.

734
00:38:39,765 --> 00:38:40,823
I'm afraid you're drunk.

735
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:42,228
Because I think you're talented?

736
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,927
Because you've had
3 caiperinhas.

737
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:49,829
- Do you know how to tango?
- Yeah. Why?

738
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:51,943
Because, everyone knows
you can't be drunk and tango.

739
00:38:52,077 --> 00:38:53,942
So if I can tango,
then I'm not drunk.

740
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,742
And I get to show your pictures
to Finlay.

741
00:38:57,883 --> 00:38:59,851
Well, then you're right
and I won't tell a soul.

742
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:03,746
Tambien...

743
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:33,642
So about my friend Finlay.

744
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,058
- So tell me your secret.
- What secret?

745
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:16,558
How an American can speak
like a Spaniard and dance

746
00:40:16,695 --> 00:40:17,957
like an Argentinean.

747
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:21,022
- I'm not American.
- No?

748
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:24,329
Well, not technically.
I was born in England.

749
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:27,029
My Father was English.
My Mother was Spanish.

750
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:30,733
I grew up with my Mother's
family in America.

751
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:32,741
After my parents died.

752
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:40,547
How old were you
when you moved to America?

753
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:41,743
Five.

754
00:40:41,887 --> 00:40:44,355
- I'm sorry I didn't mean to pry.
- It's not that.

755
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,056
It's just I don't want to be
one of those awful characters

756
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:53,824
out of a movie that gushes out
their past while the violins play.

757
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:58,430
I mean I had a bad age five.

758
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,038
I had a terrible age five,
actually.

759
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:06,537
But all in all, since then,
my life's been pretty blessed.

760
00:41:20,392 --> 00:41:22,758
- So do you live alone?
- No, I live with Peter.

761
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:25,829
- Oh? Your boyfriend?
- Oh God no! He's my best friend.

762
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:29,331
We went to college together.
He's gay.

763
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:30,934
All the good ones are...

764
00:41:33,872 --> 00:41:36,636
You should meet him actually.
He's a brilliant writer.

765
00:41:36,775 --> 00:41:38,743
Screenplays.
Well, that's the goal at least.

766
00:41:38,877 --> 00:41:41,846
He's just the sweetest,
funniest, kindest guy I know.

767
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,948
If he wasn't gay, I'd have
married him years ago.

768
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:45,947
- He sounds wonderful.
- He is!

769
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:49,544
What are you doing tomorrow?

770
00:41:49,688 --> 00:41:52,452
Tomorrow? Nothing.

771
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:53,853
You wanna have dinner?

772
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:55,651
Oh, sure!

773
00:41:55,794 --> 00:41:57,955
Great!
Come over at 8!

774
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:02,226
Ta da!

775
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:05,036
Well, I had an amazing
time tonight.

776
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,228
Me, too.

777
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:08,730
Bye!

778
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:20,844
<i>I've never been for a walk</i>
<i>in the morning before.</i>

779
00:42:20,986 --> 00:42:22,647
<i>At least, not since I've been</i>
<i>in New York...</i>

780
00:42:22,988 --> 00:42:24,250
- Hey, babies!
- Hi!

781
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:26,357
- What are you doing?
- Watching 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.'

782
00:42:26,491 --> 00:42:28,356
- Again?
- Yeah, I'm doing research.

783
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:29,858
Stop doing research
and would you write

784
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:31,462
your goddamn screenplay!

785
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:34,030
Did you realize, in the book,
the male character's gay?

786
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:35,723
That's why they have such
an amazing friendship.

787
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:37,425
Because she feels safe with him.

788
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:41,027
Whereas in the film, he's straight
and she just wears gorgeous hats.

789
00:42:41,172 --> 00:42:45,131
Speaking of gorgeous, I just met
the cutest Argentinean boy.

790
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:46,539
Oh, yeah?

791
00:42:46,678 --> 00:42:48,441
He's absolutely gorgeous.

792
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,344
And sweet and smart.
And an amazing tango dancer!

793
00:42:51,483 --> 00:42:52,950
That's very useful
in today's world.

794
00:42:53,084 --> 00:42:56,053
Who also happens to be
an exceptionally talented photographer.

795
00:42:56,187 --> 00:42:58,849
Oh! Does this mean
we're finally over James?

796
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,356
- James? He's gay!
- James is gay?!

797
00:43:01,493 --> 00:43:03,654
No, Paolo.
Paolo is gay.

798
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:06,730
He's been assisting for Sasha,
you know the fashion photographer

799
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:09,026
and I thought that they were,
you know, sleeping together

800
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:10,134
but now they're not.

801
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:12,532
And he really wants to meet you.
He doesn't know anyone in London.

802
00:43:12,671 --> 00:43:14,332
And I told him that you'd
have dinner with him...

803
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:16,235
- What?
- Tomorrow. It'll be good for you.

804
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:17,841
It'll take your mind off.

805
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:20,444
Jacks! There is absolutely
no way I am going

806
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:22,045
on another blind date.
The answer's no!

807
00:43:25,183 --> 00:43:26,343
Paolo! Hi!

808
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:27,849
Come in! Come in!

809
00:43:28,987 --> 00:43:30,648
I'm afraid I'm running late!

810
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:33,656
Oh, these are lovely,
but Peter hates flowers.

811
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:34,656
We'll pretend they're for me.

812
00:43:34,793 --> 00:43:36,158
Can I get you something to drink?

813
00:43:36,294 --> 00:43:37,556
Champagne?

814
00:43:37,696 --> 00:43:39,027
Sure.

815
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:40,631
So, how was your Saturday?

816
00:43:41,366 --> 00:43:42,424
- Paolo?
- What?

817
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:44,330
What did you do today?

818
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:46,630
Oh, yeah.
I went to the Tate.

819
00:43:46,771 --> 00:43:49,137
The Museum.
The Tate Modern Museum.

820
00:43:49,274 --> 00:43:51,139
- Your first time?
- Yep.

821
00:43:51,276 --> 00:43:52,834
And? What did you think?

822
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:56,038
I mean, it's pretty
amazing visually. Right?

823
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:57,739
The way it's built.

824
00:43:57,882 --> 00:44:00,350
Isn't itjust visually stunning?

825
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:01,747
Don't you think, Paolo?

826
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:03,549
Yeah!

827
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:06,054
Paolo, I can't hear you.
Can you come back here?

828
00:44:06,191 --> 00:44:07,658
I don't want to have to scream.

829
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:16,733
So what else did you?
After the Tate Modern?

830
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:19,132
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I'll just close the door.

831
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,032
Oh, it's fine!

832
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:21,832
Peter and I always have
our best conversations

833
00:44:21,973 --> 00:44:22,837
when I'm in the bath.

834
00:44:22,974 --> 00:44:24,236
- Peter?
- Jacks?

835
00:44:24,376 --> 00:44:25,536
Shit!

836
00:44:25,677 --> 00:44:27,542
- Jacks!
- I'll be right out!

837
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:30,045
- Is that Peter?
- No. James. Do me a favour.

838
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:31,341
Go out and tell him
I'll be out in 5.

839
00:44:31,483 --> 00:44:32,848
And close the door behind you.

840
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,549
Hi, sorry, I...
Jacks is in the bath.

841
00:44:40,692 --> 00:44:42,159
She says she'll be out in 5.

842
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:44,158
- Who are you?
- Paolo Sarmiento.

843
00:44:44,295 --> 00:44:45,728
I, I work with Jacks.

844
00:44:47,465 --> 00:44:49,729
- James!
- Peter. Hi.

845
00:44:49,868 --> 00:44:52,428
- Hello?
- Hi, Peter. I'm Paolo.

846
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:53,434
Paolo. Hi.

847
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:55,630
Hi! I've heard so much about you.

848
00:44:55,774 --> 00:44:56,832
Really?

849
00:44:57,575 --> 00:45:00,544
- Where's, where's Jacks?
- In the bath, apparently.

850
00:45:00,678 --> 00:45:03,442
Right. Excuse me for a second?

851
00:45:13,091 --> 00:45:15,252
- What's he doing here?
- He just flew back from New York.

852
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:16,360
Not James. Paolo!

853
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:19,429
- He's having dinner with you.
- No! No. No way.

854
00:45:19,564 --> 00:45:20,826
Why not?
Give me one good reason.

855
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:22,626
- It's too soon.
- Too soon?

856
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:25,031
- I'm still not over David.
- You don't even know David.

857
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:25,932
That's a technicality.

858
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:27,436
Besides, after everything
everyone's said,

859
00:45:27,572 --> 00:45:28,630
I feel like I know him very well.

860
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:31,037
Babies, David doesn't even live
in London anymore.

861
00:45:31,176 --> 00:45:32,234
Oh, so you're saying
I should forget about him

862
00:45:32,377 --> 00:45:33,435
purely for geographic reasons?

863
00:45:33,578 --> 00:45:35,443
I'm saying that I don't think
it's healthy for you to have

864
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,638
a long distance relationship
with someone

865
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:38,544
you've never even met!

866
00:45:38,683 --> 00:45:40,344
How does that look?
More blush?

867
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:42,146
- No, you're good.
- Thank you.

868
00:45:43,988 --> 00:45:47,651
I'm afraid Jacks sort of
surprised me with this.

869
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,350
Yes. She surprised me too.

870
00:45:49,494 --> 00:45:52,429
Yeah, well, that's our Jacks!
Full of surprises!

871
00:45:53,465 --> 00:45:57,026
So is James...
Are they together?

872
00:45:58,970 --> 00:45:59,937
Well, technically no.

873
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:02,130
But for all practical purposes, yes.

874
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:04,036
- I don't understand.
- Join the club.

875
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:07,235
When it comes to love, Jacks is
completely incomprehensible.

876
00:46:07,879 --> 00:46:10,643
So does she love him?

877
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:13,050
I suppose, in a way, she must.

878
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:15,948
I just don't think
she likes him very much.

879
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,850
But come to think of it,
Jacks never goes out with men

880
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:19,251
she actually likes.

881
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:22,757
You're insane.

882
00:46:22,894 --> 00:46:24,862
Why, because I don't like you
having strange men with you

883
00:46:24,996 --> 00:46:25,928
while you're in the bath?

884
00:46:26,064 --> 00:46:30,125
- Jams, he's gay, for God sakes!
- Great, another poof.

885
00:46:30,268 --> 00:46:31,633
Since when did you
become homophobic?

886
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:34,329
Since I realized being gay is
the only way to be intimate with you.

887
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:35,939
Don't be absurd.

888
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:41,338
I can't believe I've just
vomited the entire saga of

889
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:43,845
my imaginary love life
with David Williams.

890
00:46:43,982 --> 00:46:45,449
I enjoyed it.
It's like a movie.

891
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:48,245
- Yeah, but you must think I'm crazy.
- Yes.

892
00:46:48,386 --> 00:46:49,944
But I like crazy people.

893
00:46:50,088 --> 00:46:52,750
Yeah? So do I.

894
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:58,753
But enough about me.
What do you think about me?

895
00:46:59,564 --> 00:47:03,330
No, I'm joking.
No, I'm not. No, I was.

896
00:47:09,674 --> 00:47:12,040
Sam, can we have some
sambucca, please?

897
00:47:27,592 --> 00:47:29,150
- Don't answer.
- I really should.

898
00:47:29,294 --> 00:47:31,262
- Why?
- It might be somebody.

899
00:47:33,364 --> 00:47:37,130
Hello? Talullah! Oh sweetie.
Hold on a sec.

900
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:39,236
It's Talullah.
She's having a crisis.

901
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,837
How bloody unusual.

902
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:45,238
OK. Tell me exactly
what happened.

903
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:47,344
He's stopped calling.

904
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:49,139
- Freedom?
- Tony.

905
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,338
Who's Tony?

906
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:53,848
You know.
Tony from the phone company.

907
00:47:53,985 --> 00:47:56,453
The psycho who was
making obscene calls?

908
00:47:56,588 --> 00:48:00,046
They weren't obscene!
They were sweet.

909
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:02,455
It was the perfect relationship.

910
00:48:02,594 --> 00:48:07,122
I never felt ugly or fat.
I knew he wasn't with me for my money.

911
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:09,733
- I miss him, Jacks!
- Talullah, don't be ridiculous.

912
00:48:09,867 --> 00:48:11,528
I can't help how I feel!

913
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:13,728
Why is it as soon as
I fall in love with a man,

914
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:15,429
he abandons me?

915
00:48:15,573 --> 00:48:17,438
You don't love Tony!

916
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:20,339
Yes I do!
I do love Tony.

917
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:22,639
What did I do wrong?

918
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,840
OK. Let's indulge this
sick fantasy.

919
00:48:25,984 --> 00:48:28,953
What's the last thing
you said to Prince Charming?

920
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:31,453
'Stop pestering me
or I'll call the police! '

921
00:48:37,996 --> 00:48:39,224
Oh, this is us.

922
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:43,427
Do you want to come upstairs
for another drink?

923
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:45,729
I want to,
but I probably shouldn't.

924
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,633
I have to be at the lab at 7.

925
00:48:48,573 --> 00:48:53,135
- Oh, OK. Well...
- But I really enjoyed meeting you.

926
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,137
So did I.

927
00:48:58,383 --> 00:48:59,441
So did I.

928
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:05,146
- Are you OK here?
- Oh my God! Oh God!

929
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:06,552
- You don't! I...
- I'm so sorry!

930
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:09,251
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry. I was just...

931
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:11,555
- I'm really embarrassed.
- No, no, no, listen, Peter.

932
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:13,027
I really like you a lot, but...

933
00:49:13,164 --> 00:49:14,426
But you don't like me
in that way.

934
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:15,930
Look, I know that speech.

935
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:18,228
I use that speech because
I actually wrote that speech...

936
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:19,836
I'm not gay.

937
00:49:19,971 --> 00:49:22,439
- I didn't write that part!
- I'm straight.

938
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:25,233
Since when?

939
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:29,444
I suppose I first noticed
when I was around 8.

940
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,844
I thought it was just a phase,
you know, but eventually

941
00:49:31,983 --> 00:49:35,043
I had to accept the truth.
I like women.

942
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:39,251
Oh this is good!
This is really good.

943
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,449
You know, Jacks is useless at
fixing people up...

944
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:43,651
- Jacks thought I was gay?
- Oh she sure did.

945
00:49:43,795 --> 00:49:46,127
And I'm really going to enjoy
making her feel stupid about this one.

946
00:49:46,264 --> 00:49:48,425
No! Please don't.

947
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:51,729
I think I should tell her myself.

948
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:58,239
You and Jacks?

949
00:49:59,577 --> 00:50:01,238
You and, you and Jacks?

950
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:02,843
Oh my God!

951
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,347
Oh, look, I... I...
I won't say a word. I promise.

952
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:08,145
- Thanks.
- Cross my heart.

953
00:50:09,687 --> 00:50:12,952
- I should go.
- Yeah. Yes.

954
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:15,059
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

955
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,433
So what did you say to Jacks
when you got back?

956
00:50:27,572 --> 00:50:29,733
- Nothing, she wasn't there.
- But you're going to tell her.

957
00:50:29,874 --> 00:50:30,636
Sorry, I'm late!

958
00:50:30,775 --> 00:50:33,539
I was in the middle of
an absolutely gripping book.

959
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:34,440
I couldn't put it down.

960
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:35,637
Oh, what book's that?

961
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,544
My memoirs, darling.
I've decided to publish.

962
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:41,249
Bloody Mary please.
Light on the bloody.

963
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:43,149
- Where's Jacks?
- Spending the weekend with James.

964
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:45,653
- Oh God, how disgusting!
- Be nice.

965
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:49,248
I'm sorry, but James Wildstone stands
for absolutely everything I despise.

966
00:50:49,394 --> 00:50:50,861
I thought he was
a good friend of your family?

967
00:50:50,995 --> 00:50:51,757
Exactly my point.

968
00:50:51,896 --> 00:50:53,523
Well, we shouldn'tjudge.
Maybe he's good sex.

969
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:56,132
Oh, don't be absurd.
He's public school.

970
00:50:56,267 --> 00:50:57,928
So he probably likes
being spanked.

971
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:59,627
Or buggered. Or both.

972
00:50:59,771 --> 00:51:02,535
- Sounds like good sex to me.
- And me!

973
00:51:02,673 --> 00:51:04,038
And me actually.

974
00:51:05,877 --> 00:51:09,335
I can't believe he's so late!
Pandora, try Sasha's mobile.

975
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,947
- I tried it 5 minutes ago.
- Try again.

976
00:51:11,082 --> 00:51:12,640
And leave another message.

977
00:51:12,784 --> 00:51:14,342
Do you have his boyfriend's
number in Paris?

978
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:16,146
He got back from Paris
last night.

979
00:51:16,287 --> 00:51:17,845
He broke up with his boyfriend
this weekend.

980
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:19,854
- He did? Is he OK?
- Not really.

981
00:51:19,991 --> 00:51:22,755
But Jacks, look, it'll be fine.
Sasha always turns up.

982
00:51:22,894 --> 00:51:25,454
- I left another message.
- Thanks, Pandora.

983
00:51:26,864 --> 00:51:29,731
So I had a nice evening
with Peter the other night.

984
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:32,131
Oh my God! Really?
Isn't he great?

985
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,636
Smart, funny and cute.

986
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:37,240
Yes, he's absolutely lovely.

987
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:38,239
Where's Daphne?

988
00:51:38,376 --> 00:51:40,640
She had to go to court today.
She left me in charge.

989
00:51:40,778 --> 00:51:42,439
Who put up those lights?

990
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,241
I did, I thought you
might want them in the shot.

991
00:51:44,382 --> 00:51:47,749
You're not here to think!
You're here to do what I think! OK?

992
00:51:47,885 --> 00:51:50,547
So now you take all this down
and you bring me a ring light.

993
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,053
Pandora?
Where is Pandora? Where is it?

994
00:51:56,194 --> 00:51:57,252
Here.

995
00:51:57,595 --> 00:51:58,562
What's yourjob?

996
00:51:59,564 --> 00:52:01,031
I'm a wardrobe assistant.

997
00:52:01,165 --> 00:52:04,134
A wardrobe assistant?
No, you're a piece of shit!

998
00:52:04,268 --> 00:52:06,236
How dare you call my mobile
every 10 minutes

999
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,132
and leave me endless messages.

1000
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:09,535
I told her to call, Sasha!
We were worried.

1001
00:52:09,674 --> 00:52:11,539
- You were late.
- I know I was late!

1002
00:52:11,676 --> 00:52:13,644
I just don't need
a nobody leaving me

1003
00:52:13,778 --> 00:52:15,143
endless messages about it!

1004
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:17,543
- I understand you had a rough weekend...
- No, you don't understand!

1005
00:52:17,682 --> 00:52:19,047
You understand nothing!

1006
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:21,242
And I suggest you stop
meddling with things

1007
00:52:21,385 --> 00:52:22,943
you don't understand,
and just do yourjob!

1008
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:24,054
Whatever the hell that is.

1009
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:25,450
I don't know,
go steam something!

1010
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:26,557
Sasha!

1011
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:27,658
Jacks, he doesn't mean that...

1012
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:30,659
- Don't you tell her what I mean!
- Don't speak to her like that.

1013
00:52:34,065 --> 00:52:36,329
Get out! You're fired!
You heard me? You're fired!

1014
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:37,627
Go back to Argentina!

1015
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:40,134
You and your little
pathetic snapshots!

1016
00:52:40,271 --> 00:52:41,329
Bye bye!

1017
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:45,133
Anyone else have
something to say?

1018
00:52:45,776 --> 00:52:47,243
I have something to say.

1019
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,948
- Apologize!
- I'm sorry?

1020
00:52:51,082 --> 00:52:53,346
I said apologize!

1021
00:52:54,085 --> 00:52:55,950
- Are you insane?
- Obviously!

1022
00:52:56,087 --> 00:52:58,453
I work at Vogue!
But don't change the subject!

1023
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:00,454
- Apologize.
- Or else?

1024
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:03,151
Or else, I'm walking out
with all those dresses.

1025
00:53:04,295 --> 00:53:07,230
Oh! I have a better idea.
I will do the walking out thing.

1026
00:53:07,365 --> 00:53:09,731
And let's see what Daphne
has to say about that!

1027
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:20,935
Paolo, can I ask a favour?

1028
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:24,844
Ah, the classic movie moment
when the underdog gets to prove

1029
00:53:24,982 --> 00:53:27,542
his real worth and win
the heart of his true love!

1030
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:28,652
Don't give away the ending!

1031
00:53:28,786 --> 00:53:31,152
It's a romantic comedy!
How do you think it ends?

1032
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,153
Hi, sunshine, how are you?

1033
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:36,556
I just had the most surreal day.

1034
00:53:36,694 --> 00:53:37,854
I had a huge fight with Sasha.

1035
00:53:37,995 --> 00:53:40,429
Paolo took over the shoot,
and he was absolutely brilliant.

1036
00:53:40,565 --> 00:53:42,032
I'm probably going to
get fired tomorrow,

1037
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:44,031
but it was so worth itjust
to see Paolo in action.

1038
00:53:44,168 --> 00:53:46,432
Oh my God! This is so scary!

1039
00:53:46,571 --> 00:53:47,936
What's she watching?

1040
00:53:48,072 --> 00:53:49,232
Notting Hill.

1041
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:51,735
So what did you think
about Paolo?

1042
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:53,138
Was I right or was I right?

1043
00:53:53,277 --> 00:53:54,835
Are those my only options?

1044
00:53:54,979 --> 00:53:56,537
Oh no, don't tell me
you didn't like him.

1045
00:53:56,681 --> 00:53:58,842
I liked him a lot!
I'm just not sure I'm his type.

1046
00:53:58,983 --> 00:53:59,950
Of course, you're his type!

1047
00:54:00,084 --> 00:54:02,143
He told me himself
he thought you were 'lovely.'

1048
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:03,753
Well, I didn't see that coming!

1049
00:54:03,888 --> 00:54:04,752
What?

1050
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:08,052
Julia Roberts ending up
with Hugh Grant!

1051
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:17,029
You know, Jacks. When I told you
to take care of the shoot,

1052
00:54:17,168 --> 00:54:19,728
I was thinking more along
the lines of ordering the sushi,

1053
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,838
not enraging
our top photographer.

1054
00:54:21,973 --> 00:54:24,237
I can't help it if Sasha's
an overpampered monster.

1055
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:27,742
We work in fashion.
Everyone's an overpampered monster.

1056
00:54:27,878 --> 00:54:30,540
Yes, but that isn't an excuse
to be so vile to people.

1057
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:34,139
Besides, his pictures don't
have an ounce of truth to them.

1058
00:54:34,285 --> 00:54:37,743
But since when does truth have
anything to do with fashion?

1059
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:40,652
Well, it doesn't.

1060
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:42,156
But maybe it should.

1061
00:54:44,795 --> 00:54:47,320
- So you were Sasha's assistant?
- Yes.

1062
00:54:47,465 --> 00:54:49,023
How very 'All About Eve.'

1063
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:50,929
'All About Eve? '

1064
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:52,228
It's a movie, darling.

1065
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,429
It's about an assistant
who seems all sweet and innocent

1066
00:54:54,572 --> 00:54:57,234
but is really quite
ambitious and ruthless.

1067
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:58,433
You should rent it sometime.

1068
00:54:58,576 --> 00:54:59,941
Daphne, he was doing me
a favour.

1069
00:55:00,077 --> 00:55:01,738
- I've seen it.
- You have?

1070
00:55:01,879 --> 00:55:03,141
And what did you think?

1071
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,441
I found it rather silly actually.

1072
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:08,950
The idea that Bette Davis could be
the victim of anyone is absurd.

1073
00:55:20,765 --> 00:55:22,232
Pick 4 and run it.

1074
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:33,940
Oh my God, Paolo!
You were amazing!

1075
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:35,238
Thanks. So were you!

1076
00:55:35,379 --> 00:55:36,437
The way you handled Daphne!

1077
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,140
I mean I knew you were talented,
but I had no idea that under

1078
00:55:39,283 --> 00:55:43,447
that shy, sweet exterior was
such steely confidence!

1079
00:55:43,587 --> 00:55:46,055
What other secrets are
you keeping from me?

1080
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:49,851
Actually, Jacks,
I did want to talk to you about...

1081
00:55:49,994 --> 00:55:52,724
- Ah, Jacks! There you are!
- James?

1082
00:55:52,863 --> 00:55:54,125
Hello, Darling!

1083
00:55:54,265 --> 00:55:55,630
Hello?

1084
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:57,427
James, you remember Paolo?

1085
00:55:57,568 --> 00:55:58,933
Yes. Hello, Paolo?

1086
00:55:59,070 --> 00:55:59,934
James?

1087
00:56:00,071 --> 00:56:01,231
What are you doing here?

1088
00:56:01,372 --> 00:56:03,135
Well, actually, I was just
having lunch across the street

1089
00:56:03,274 --> 00:56:05,139
and I came to tell you
the good news in person.

1090
00:56:05,276 --> 00:56:06,038
What good news?

1091
00:56:06,177 --> 00:56:09,146
Peter is finally going to meet
the love of his life!

1092
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,248
- What?
- David Williams is in town.

1093
00:56:11,382 --> 00:56:12,940
He's leading a special auction
at Sotheby's.

1094
00:56:13,084 --> 00:56:14,051
And he and I were just
having lunch together,

1095
00:56:14,185 --> 00:56:15,345
and I just happened to mention
Peter's name.

1096
00:56:15,486 --> 00:56:18,455
And he suggested that we bring
Peter to the auction tonight!

1097
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:20,056
- He did?
- Well, actually, I suggested it.

1098
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:22,056
But he thinks it's a great idea!

1099
00:56:22,193 --> 00:56:24,753
So did I do good
or did I do good?

1100
00:56:24,895 --> 00:56:26,328
You did great.

1101
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:30,930
I should probably go.

1102
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:34,826
Paolo, congratulations on today.

1103
00:56:36,874 --> 00:56:39,240
Tell Peter I wish him
good luck with David.

1104
00:56:43,981 --> 00:56:45,141
Jacks?

1105
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,243
What are you thinking?

1106
00:56:48,085 --> 00:56:51,054
I'm thinking about
Peter and David living

1107
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:52,849
happily ever after.

1108
00:56:58,395 --> 00:57:00,522
What if I've written
the worst script ever?

1109
00:57:00,664 --> 00:57:02,325
What if everyone hates it?

1110
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:05,435
Look, most great artists have to
deal with rejection in their lifetime.

1111
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:07,036
Yes, I'm not a great artist!

1112
00:57:07,171 --> 00:57:09,731
Look, I know I'm not
some genius like Van Gogh.

1113
00:57:09,874 --> 00:57:11,933
Thank God.
I like my men with 2 ears.

1114
00:57:12,076 --> 00:57:13,737
I'm, I'm being serious.

1115
00:57:13,878 --> 00:57:16,745
What if I'm not any good?
What if I have no talent?

1116
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:19,145
Are you asking
if I'll still love you?

1117
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:21,649
- Snap out of it will you?
- What?

1118
00:57:22,186 --> 00:57:23,244
We're here.

1119
00:57:28,492 --> 00:57:30,050
There you are!
You guys are late.

1120
00:57:30,194 --> 00:57:31,661
Fin, I'm not sure
this is such a good idea.

1121
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:33,024
It's an excellent idea.

1122
00:57:33,164 --> 00:57:34,529
He's perfect for you,
Paul, darling!

1123
00:57:34,665 --> 00:57:37,133
Peter! His name is Peter!

1124
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:38,929
You're about to meet the
love of your life!

1125
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:39,626
To the left!

1126
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,237
There is no need to be
so nasty to me

1127
00:57:41,372 --> 00:57:42,236
just because I don't remember
people's names.

1128
00:57:42,373 --> 00:57:44,238
550 with you madam,
thank you very much.

1129
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:46,935
- That's him!
- 580. Anything further on 580?

1130
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:48,442
- I can't see him.
- There!

1131
00:57:48,579 --> 00:57:50,638
I have 600,000.

1132
00:57:50,781 --> 00:57:52,248
Back to the telephone bank.

1133
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,850
That's not him.
That's not him!

1134
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:55,246
- You're kidding?
- No!

1135
00:57:55,386 --> 00:57:57,149
- That's David?
- No!

1136
00:57:57,288 --> 00:57:57,947
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

1137
00:57:58,088 --> 00:57:58,747
I have no idea!

1138
00:57:58,889 --> 00:58:01,153
Of course that's David!
He's just cut his hair.

1139
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:02,054
What hair?

1140
00:58:02,193 --> 00:58:03,353
He's got a lovely smile!

1141
00:58:03,494 --> 00:58:05,826
- He's just cut his hair!
- And he's lost some weight.

1142
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:08,227
- I don't think so, Fergus...
- It's Finlay!

1143
00:58:08,365 --> 00:58:09,923
- What?
- That is not him! OK?

1144
00:58:10,067 --> 00:58:12,433
That is not the man
I bumped into at the Chancery Hotel.

1145
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,832
That is not him!

1146
00:58:13,971 --> 00:58:15,632
Well, he's good enough!

1147
00:58:15,773 --> 00:58:17,536
Oh no! No, he's not good enough!

1148
00:58:17,675 --> 00:58:21,441
Because, that man right there,
the real David Williams actually exists!

1149
00:58:21,579 --> 00:58:25,845
The real David Williams happens
to be a living, breathing,

1150
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:28,144
on-the-market gay man!

1151
00:58:45,469 --> 00:58:48,438
Morning, sunshine.
How you feeling?

1152
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:51,336
- Exhausted. You?
- Fine.

1153
00:58:51,475 --> 00:58:54,035
I'm going to brunch with Finlay
and the wrong David.

1154
00:58:54,178 --> 00:58:55,736
I'm so sorry.

1155
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,142
Sorry you outed
a total stranger

1156
00:58:57,281 --> 00:58:59,044
or sorry it's the wrong
total stranger?

1157
00:58:59,183 --> 00:59:00,150
Both.

1158
00:59:00,284 --> 00:59:01,444
I'm quite relieved, to be honest.

1159
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:02,847
At least it's over and done with.

1160
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:05,652
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

1161
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:08,952
I was just up most of
the night thinking...

1162
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:10,151
About?

1163
00:59:10,294 --> 00:59:13,821
Oh, love and other disasters.

1164
00:59:14,865 --> 00:59:16,730
- That must be Finlay.
- Send him my love.

1165
00:59:16,867 --> 00:59:19,335
- I don't have to go to this thing.
- Go!

1166
00:59:27,578 --> 00:59:28,636
I'll be right down.

1167
00:59:34,485 --> 00:59:36,851
- Morning.
- Morning.

1168
00:59:37,788 --> 00:59:40,552
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

1169
00:59:42,393 --> 00:59:44,861
That's Peter, he must have
forgotten his keys.

1170
00:59:46,163 --> 00:59:47,528
I'm going to take a bath.

1171
00:59:51,869 --> 00:59:53,234
Paolo, hi!

1172
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,235
- Hi.
- Are you OK?

1173
00:59:56,173 --> 00:59:58,539
Not really.
I haven't slept all night.

1174
00:59:58,676 --> 01:00:00,644
Come in. Come in.

1175
01:00:01,979 --> 01:00:03,037
It's just...

1176
01:00:04,181 --> 01:00:06,149
I've been wanting to talk to you
about the other night with Peter.

1177
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:10,447
But it seems every time I'm about to,
something or someone gets in the way.

1178
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:11,645
I'm sorry.

1179
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:14,553
No! It's not your fault.
It's just...

1180
01:00:16,093 --> 01:00:19,426
- He's not here, is he?
- No. No, he's out.

1181
01:00:19,563 --> 01:00:20,427
Good.

1182
01:00:20,564 --> 01:00:23,431
- I feel terrible.
Why should you feel terrible?

1183
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:25,728
I had no idea how you felt.

1184
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:28,929
What the hell is going on?

1185
01:00:29,073 --> 01:00:31,132
- I don't believe it.
- No, wait!

1186
01:00:31,275 --> 01:00:32,833
- I shouldn't have come.
- Wait!

1187
01:00:32,977 --> 01:00:34,638
- James, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with me!

1188
01:00:34,778 --> 01:00:36,040
He needs to talk!
What's your problem?

1189
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,044
He's my problem!

1190
01:00:37,181 --> 01:00:39,342
Excuse me? Paolo!

1191
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:44,045
I may not speak Spanish,
but I'm not an idiot.

1192
01:00:44,188 --> 01:00:45,052
What are you talking about?

1193
01:00:45,189 --> 01:00:46,656
I'm talking about you
and that bloody Paolo.

1194
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,655
He was upset about Peter.
He wanted to talk.

1195
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:49,850
Bullshit!

1196
01:00:49,994 --> 01:00:51,461
- What?
- I want him out of your life!

1197
01:00:51,595 --> 01:00:53,722
- Or else?
- Or else we're through!

1198
01:00:53,864 --> 01:00:57,129
See. This is exactly why I don't
want to be in a relationship with you!

1199
01:00:57,868 --> 01:00:59,335
Oh really?

1200
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:01,233
Then what the hell is this?
What the hell are we in?

1201
01:01:01,972 --> 01:01:03,030
I don't know.

1202
01:01:04,475 --> 01:01:06,340
This is just some sort of
fucking game to you, isn't it?

1203
01:01:06,477 --> 01:01:07,034
What's a game?

1204
01:01:07,177 --> 01:01:09,645
This. We fuck and then you say
you don't want a relationship.

1205
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,839
- It's not a game.
- Oh no? Then what is it?

1206
01:01:12,683 --> 01:01:13,741
It's...

1207
01:01:14,785 --> 01:01:15,547
It's the truth.

1208
01:01:15,686 --> 01:01:17,847
Bullshit!
I don't believe it is the truth!

1209
01:01:17,988 --> 01:01:19,455
For the last six months
you've been saying one thing

1210
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,251
and then doing another.
You've been playing me!

1211
01:01:21,392 --> 01:01:22,450
No!

1212
01:01:23,494 --> 01:01:24,859
But I am sorry.

1213
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:26,223
What are you sorry about?

1214
01:01:27,064 --> 01:01:28,531
I didn't mean to hurt you!

1215
01:01:30,267 --> 01:01:32,030
Fucking condescending!

1216
01:01:32,169 --> 01:01:33,932
I didn't mean it like that.

1217
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:36,631
I just... I want...

1218
01:01:36,774 --> 01:01:37,832
What do you want?

1219
01:01:39,877 --> 01:01:41,640
I want this to end.

1220
01:01:57,094 --> 01:01:59,528
So after all that,
I'm not the one?

1221
01:01:59,663 --> 01:02:01,130
Bit of a relief, huh?

1222
01:02:01,265 --> 01:02:02,323
I suppose so.

1223
01:02:02,466 --> 01:02:03,831
You must have thought
I was a stalker freak.

1224
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:05,229
Thanks to my discreet friends.

1225
01:02:05,369 --> 01:02:06,233
We were just trying to help.

1226
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:08,031
Yes, by making me out to be
a desperate fantasist?

1227
01:02:08,172 --> 01:02:09,833
You are a desperate fantasist.

1228
01:02:09,973 --> 01:02:11,338
- No, I'm not actually.
- He is.

1229
01:02:11,475 --> 01:02:13,943
I'm a fantasist,
I'm not desperate.

1230
01:02:14,078 --> 01:02:16,046
Well, I suppose I'd never have
lived up to your fantasy anyway.

1231
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,341
Trust me, David.
Nobody could.

1232
01:02:18,482 --> 01:02:20,541
- Tom!
- Sorry, I'm late!

1233
01:02:22,286 --> 01:02:24,754
- Tom, this is Peter and Finlay.
- Hey, Tom. I think we've met.

1234
01:02:24,888 --> 01:02:28,346
- Finlay! How have you been?
- Great! And you?

1235
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:30,460
Can't complain.
Can't complain.

1236
01:02:30,594 --> 01:02:32,061
Finally out of the art world!

1237
01:02:32,196 --> 01:02:33,220
Tom's acting now.

1238
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:34,625
- Acting?
- Yeah, that's why I'm late.

1239
01:02:34,765 --> 01:02:36,426
Had an audition for
a new drama at the BBC.

1240
01:02:36,567 --> 01:02:38,626
- How'd it go?
- Good! Well, great actually.

1241
01:02:38,769 --> 01:02:41,738
I was so inside
the character. You know?

1242
01:02:41,872 --> 01:02:42,930
And then they asked for a monologue

1243
01:02:43,073 --> 01:02:45,337
so I did that one from
Streetcar which everyone loves.

1244
01:02:45,476 --> 01:02:48,445
The actress I was doing it with,
she was hopeless.

1245
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:49,546
I was doing my best...

1246
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,738
Are you OK?

1247
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:53,747
- That's him.
- Who?

1248
01:02:53,884 --> 01:02:55,749
That's the guy I bumped into
at the Hotel!

1249
01:02:55,886 --> 01:02:56,944
What?

1250
01:02:58,088 --> 01:02:58,747
Sorry.

1251
01:02:58,889 --> 01:03:02,655
Excuse me, I just need to use
the loo, actually.

1252
01:03:02,793 --> 01:03:04,852
- Finlay?
- Right! I'll just...

1253
01:03:05,596 --> 01:03:06,620
Give you a hand!

1254
01:03:09,867 --> 01:03:11,528
I can't believe you said
'I'll give you a hand! '

1255
01:03:11,668 --> 01:03:12,930
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1256
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:15,231
But listen, I think
I know what happened!

1257
01:03:15,372 --> 01:03:17,431
Tom used to be
David's assistant.

1258
01:03:17,574 --> 01:03:18,836
They both must have gone
to the hotel,

1259
01:03:18,976 --> 01:03:20,739
but Tom arrived with
the paintings on his own.

1260
01:03:20,878 --> 01:03:22,038
Which is when you bumped
into him!

1261
01:03:22,179 --> 01:03:23,942
Great! So, now what do I do?

1262
01:03:24,581 --> 01:03:26,446
Well, I'd probably zip up.

1263
01:03:27,284 --> 01:03:28,751
Mustn't seem over-eager.

1264
01:03:29,987 --> 01:03:32,751
I can't believe you're cooking dinner
for some guy you just met yesterday!

1265
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,653
His name is Tom.
You know what they say.

1266
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,452
'The way to a man's heart is
through his stomach.'

1267
01:03:36,593 --> 01:03:37,958
Don't you think that's aiming
a bit high?

1268
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:39,824
Don't you think you should
applaud my courage?

1269
01:03:39,963 --> 01:03:41,726
I would but my hands are full.

1270
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:43,225
Anyway, I'm off.

1271
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:44,629
Don't you at least
want to meet Tom?

1272
01:03:44,768 --> 01:03:46,736
Why? I prefer Paolo.

1273
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,031
Maybe that's something
worth considering.

1274
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:50,333
Little late for that.

1275
01:03:58,982 --> 01:04:00,745
I've been trying to call you
since yesterday

1276
01:04:00,884 --> 01:04:02,249
but your mobile isn't working.

1277
01:04:02,386 --> 01:04:04,149
I, I ran out of credit.

1278
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,352
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

1279
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:09,259
What are you doing?

1280
01:04:09,393 --> 01:04:11,861
I have to fly back to
Argentina tomorrow.

1281
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:14,327
- What? Why?
- I don't belong here.

1282
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:15,624
What are you talking about?

1283
01:04:15,766 --> 01:04:17,427
Your career's about to
take off in London.

1284
01:04:17,568 --> 01:04:19,627
You have 4 pages in the new Vogue!

1285
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,237
OK, I know how you feel
about fashion.

1286
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:22,030
And I agree with you!

1287
01:04:22,172 --> 01:04:23,935
But at least it'll pay the rent.
While you do your own work.

1288
01:04:24,074 --> 01:04:27,840
And I've spoken to Finlay.
And he wants to meet you.

1289
01:04:27,978 --> 01:04:30,242
Maybe put a show on at
his gallery for you.

1290
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,644
- You can'tjust go home now!
- I'm being deported.

1291
01:04:33,884 --> 01:04:35,852
Immigration got a tip
I was working here illegally.

1292
01:04:35,986 --> 01:04:38,955
- A tip? From who?
- Does it matter?

1293
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:41,448
James.

1294
01:04:42,192 --> 01:04:43,352
It was James.

1295
01:04:43,493 --> 01:04:44,755
We don't know that.

1296
01:04:47,064 --> 01:04:49,726
- You're not going.
- Jacks, I don't have a choice.

1297
01:04:50,767 --> 01:04:52,234
Yes, you do.

1298
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:53,529
You can marry me!

1299
01:04:56,873 --> 01:05:00,036
Jacks. I can't ask you
to do that.

1300
01:05:00,177 --> 01:05:01,439
Then it's a good thing I'm asking!

1301
01:05:01,578 --> 01:05:04,547
Yes. And it's very kind of you.
But...

1302
01:05:04,982 --> 01:05:06,643
It's not fair to you.

1303
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:10,252
Look. I know you think I'm
doing this out of guilt or pity.

1304
01:05:10,387 --> 01:05:11,445
But that's just not true.

1305
01:05:11,588 --> 01:05:14,148
I'm doing this
because I want to.

1306
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:16,851
Because I know that you're on the
verge of fulfilling your dreams!

1307
01:05:16,994 --> 01:05:19,724
And if I could be a part of that,
that would make me happy.

1308
01:05:19,863 --> 01:05:23,526
And I don't want you to go.
So please. Marry me!

1309
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,538
I don't know what to say.

1310
01:05:28,672 --> 01:05:32,631
Well, unless you want me to feel
totally humiliated say yes.

1311
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,943
I'm like, fuck that.
I know I'm talented.

1312
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,142
I don't need some RADA degree
to tell me.

1313
01:05:42,286 --> 01:05:43,150
You know what I mean?

1314
01:05:43,787 --> 01:05:45,049
And besides,
I'm not interested in

1315
01:05:45,188 --> 01:05:47,053
being some luvvie
character actor.

1316
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,658
I am a leading man,
for fuck's sake.

1317
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:52,159
So why waste my time studying
during my peak years.

1318
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:53,126
You know what I mean?

1319
01:05:54,364 --> 01:05:57,527
Yes, yes.
Well, I, I think I do.

1320
01:05:57,668 --> 01:06:00,136
I mean sometimes studying can
become a way of avoiding doing...

1321
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,431
I'm just not sure whether
I should cut my hair.

1322
01:06:03,273 --> 01:06:05,639
I mean, my agent thinks I should,
but I think it's what makes me

1323
01:06:05,776 --> 01:06:07,437
distinctive.
You know what I mean?

1324
01:06:08,178 --> 01:06:09,543
Yeah. I think I do.

1325
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,148
So... you wanna go to bed?

1326
01:06:13,183 --> 01:06:13,740
What?

1327
01:06:13,884 --> 01:06:16,546
Do you want to go to bed?
You know, have sex?

1328
01:06:16,687 --> 01:06:17,745
I...

1329
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:20,556
I don't like wasting time
when I know what I want.

1330
01:06:26,663 --> 01:06:28,221
Is everything OK?

1331
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:31,425
Yes, I was just trying Peter,
but he didn't answer.

1332
01:06:31,568 --> 01:06:34,230
Oh, you ordered me another drink.
Thanks, Babies!

1333
01:06:34,371 --> 01:06:35,838
You're so thoughtful!

1334
01:06:38,175 --> 01:06:39,836
So what happened
with you and James?

1335
01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:42,342
The same thing that happens
with all straight men.

1336
01:06:42,479 --> 01:06:45,141
They pretend that they're fine
with you having a career

1337
01:06:45,282 --> 01:06:46,146
and being independent.

1338
01:06:46,283 --> 01:06:49,741
But deep down, they resent it.
Or they want to change it.

1339
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:51,854
Well, not all straight men.

1340
01:06:51,988 --> 01:06:54,456
Trust me! All of them!

1341
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:57,651
At the end of the day, all
straight men just want one thing.

1342
01:06:57,794 --> 01:06:58,852
You know what that is?

1343
01:06:59,563 --> 01:07:00,825
Sex?

1344
01:07:00,964 --> 01:07:02,022
Control!

1345
01:07:02,165 --> 01:07:04,030
The problem with straight men
is that no matter how hard

1346
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:06,533
they try, they still
need to control, to dominate.

1347
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:08,137
Thank God you're gay!

1348
01:07:09,072 --> 01:07:10,630
- Jacks.
- I mean think about it!

1349
01:07:10,774 --> 01:07:12,435
Why do you think we feel
so comfortable together?

1350
01:07:12,576 --> 01:07:14,737
Because I know you're not
trying to score.

1351
01:07:14,878 --> 01:07:18,041
Anyway. I'm through
with straight men!

1352
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:19,648
A toast!

1353
01:07:19,783 --> 01:07:22,251
No more straight men!

1354
01:07:22,386 --> 01:07:24,251
Good riddance I say!

1355
01:07:25,088 --> 01:07:27,955
And now, we have a very special
dedication for Paolo.

1356
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:30,753
Paolo, this one's from
your future wife!

1357
01:07:38,068 --> 01:07:40,332
Happy Wedding, Babies!

1358
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:28,749
I just remembered that Peter
might have a boy at the house.

1359
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:32,252
Can I stay at yours?
Sunderland Terrace!

1360
01:08:36,493 --> 01:08:37,551
Thanks.

1361
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:45,931
Oh my god, I just used
your toothbrush.

1362
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:47,331
No problem.

1363
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:48,836
I think I'm drunk.

1364
01:08:50,674 --> 01:08:52,938
The room's sloshing.

1365
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:56,446
You going to stand up all night?

1366
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,748
- No.
- Good. Come.

1367
01:09:02,285 --> 01:09:05,345
I think my parents would
have really liked you.

1368
01:09:05,489 --> 01:09:12,827
You're so smart and kind
and you're so really talented.

1369
01:09:13,763 --> 01:09:15,230
- Jacks!
- I think you're exactly

1370
01:09:15,365 --> 01:09:17,629
the kind of person they would
have wanted me to marry.

1371
01:09:17,767 --> 01:09:20,235
Well, not exactly.

1372
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:23,032
But not in terms of what counts.

1373
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:29,038
I know that I don't know
you very well,

1374
01:09:29,179 --> 01:09:31,443
but I feel safe with you.

1375
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:33,549
Is that crazy?

1376
01:09:33,683 --> 01:09:35,651
No. It's not crazy.

1377
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:37,748
I trust you.

1378
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:41,350
Jacks, I need to tell
you something.

1379
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:43,857
- Get into bed and tell me.
- I can't.

1380
01:09:43,994 --> 01:09:46,827
I promise I won't make a pass.

1381
01:09:46,963 --> 01:09:49,932
- It's not you I'm worried about.
- What, Paolo?

1382
01:10:04,281 --> 01:10:06,044
You're so drunk!

1383
01:10:30,974 --> 01:10:32,032
Tom.

1384
01:10:34,678 --> 01:10:37,442
Tom! It's time to get up.

1385
01:10:38,582 --> 01:10:41,244
- What time is it?
- Almost 9.

1386
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:44,548
You gotta go.

1387
01:10:45,689 --> 01:10:47,657
- Excuse me?
- You gotta go.

1388
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:50,760
I've got some friends
coming over for brunch.

1389
01:10:52,295 --> 01:10:53,819
Tom, you're in my apartment.

1390
01:11:21,191 --> 01:11:22,852
Talullah, I can't get
into it now.

1391
01:11:22,993 --> 01:11:24,654
Just meet me at the Registry.

1392
01:11:24,794 --> 01:11:27,126
I'm not getting married
without a maid of honour.

1393
01:11:27,263 --> 01:11:30,630
No! Sweetie, you don't need
to write a poem.

1394
01:11:31,668 --> 01:11:34,034
Look, I have to try Peter again.

1395
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:36,035
He hasn't been answering
the phone all night.

1396
01:11:36,673 --> 01:11:38,334
OK, bye.

1397
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,943
- Hello?
- Peter! Finally!

1398
01:11:46,082 --> 01:11:48,448
- Hi, Jacks.
- I've been calling you all night!

1399
01:11:48,585 --> 01:11:50,553
I know, I'm sorry.
I turned my phone off.

1400
01:11:50,687 --> 01:11:52,450
- Tim spend the night?
- Tom!

1401
01:11:52,589 --> 01:11:55,558
- Whatever.
- I agree. Reality crashes in.

1402
01:11:55,692 --> 01:11:58,058
I'm sorry, Babies.
Now listen.

1403
01:11:58,194 --> 01:12:01,129
I need you to come down to
the Islington Registry right away.

1404
01:12:01,264 --> 01:12:03,528
- I'm getting married.
- What? Jacks!

1405
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,225
I'll tell you everything
when you get there.

1406
01:12:05,368 --> 01:12:07,836
I just managed to get
a cancellation at 11 sharp.

1407
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:08,835
That's in 20 minutes!

1408
01:12:08,972 --> 01:12:10,530
And I still need to
buy a wedding outfit!

1409
01:12:10,674 --> 01:12:12,335
- Gotta run. Bye!
- Oh, wait!

1410
01:12:13,576 --> 01:12:15,134
Oh, pull over right there!

1411
01:12:17,981 --> 01:12:19,039
I'll be right back!

1412
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:39,835
Paolo! Thank God you're here!

1413
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:41,129
- Have they called our names yet?
- No.

1414
01:12:41,271 --> 01:12:45,230
Emily Jackson
and Paolo Sar-mentio?

1415
01:12:55,085 --> 01:12:57,246
Are you all here for
the Jackson wedding party?

1416
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:15,931
If anyone knows why these
two individuals before me

1417
01:13:16,072 --> 01:13:17,733
should not be married,
let them speak now

1418
01:13:17,874 --> 01:13:18,841
or forever hold their peace.

1419
01:13:18,975 --> 01:13:21,341
- I'm not gay.
- Excuse me?

1420
01:13:21,478 --> 01:13:22,536
I'm not gay!

1421
01:13:26,082 --> 01:13:28,141
Of course you're not gay!

1422
01:13:28,284 --> 01:13:31,048
He's not! Gay. I mean.

1423
01:13:32,388 --> 01:13:33,650
How nice for both of you.

1424
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:36,153
Now, if there's any other
reason why...

1425
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:38,055
And I think I'm
in love with you.

1426
01:13:38,194 --> 01:13:40,128
- What?
- I mean, I'm in love with her.

1427
01:13:40,263 --> 01:13:41,924
- Paolo, what are you doing?
- Telling the truth.

1428
01:13:42,065 --> 01:13:44,932
I'm not gay and I think
I'm in love with you.

1429
01:13:45,068 --> 01:13:46,626
I know I should have said
something before.

1430
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,931
But every time when I started,
it seemed like the wrong time.

1431
01:13:49,072 --> 01:13:52,633
Or maybe I didn't
have the courage.

1432
01:13:52,776 --> 01:13:54,437
But then when you suggested
getting married.

1433
01:13:54,577 --> 01:13:57,341
I just got swept up with the idea
because I wanted more than

1434
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,847
anything to stay.
I wanted to stay with you.

1435
01:14:00,984 --> 01:14:03,145
I know I should have said
something but...

1436
01:14:03,286 --> 01:14:06,653
But, What? You wanted to make a fool?
Out of me first?

1437
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:08,451
Jacks. You know that's not true.

1438
01:14:08,591 --> 01:14:10,559
I have no idea what's true!

1439
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:13,423
- Oh, Jacks.
- I trusted you!

1440
01:14:13,563 --> 01:14:16,532
I told you things.
I was naked in your bed!

1441
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:18,224
Did you know about this?

1442
01:14:19,068 --> 01:14:20,035
- Yes.
- You?

1443
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,137
- No!
- I told you!

1444
01:14:21,271 --> 01:14:23,239
Yes! And now I've lied.

1445
01:14:24,274 --> 01:14:26,333
I can't believe
I trusted any of you!

1446
01:14:27,877 --> 01:14:29,936
Jacks! Please...

1447
01:14:34,184 --> 01:14:35,242
Next.

1448
01:14:41,691 --> 01:14:43,955
- Go away!
- I'm coming in.

1449
01:14:45,762 --> 01:14:48,026
I should be very mad at you.

1450
01:14:48,164 --> 01:14:49,131
I'm sorry.

1451
01:14:50,967 --> 01:14:53,527
I'm just so stupid!
How could I be so stupid?

1452
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:56,138
You're not stupid, you just saw
what you wanted to see.

1453
01:14:56,272 --> 01:14:57,830
I can't believe I trusted him!

1454
01:14:57,974 --> 01:14:59,942
I can. He's a great guy.
He deserves your trust.

1455
01:15:00,076 --> 01:15:01,236
Don't you dare defend him!

1456
01:15:01,377 --> 01:15:03,937
Look, all I'm saying is what's
really changed about Paolo

1457
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,342
since he told you he was straight?

1458
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:07,346
- Everything!
- Yes, everything you're used to.

1459
01:15:07,483 --> 01:15:08,745
Everything you're
comfortable with.

1460
01:15:08,885 --> 01:15:09,647
What's that supposed to mean?

1461
01:15:09,786 --> 01:15:11,754
Have you ever considered you
didn't want to see

1462
01:15:11,888 --> 01:15:13,446
how Paolo really felt about you?

1463
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:14,955
Because that would have
meant breaking your rule.

1464
01:15:15,091 --> 01:15:16,649
- What rule?
- To only have sex with people

1465
01:15:16,793 --> 01:15:20,126
you don't love and to only really
love people you don't have sex with.

1466
01:15:21,064 --> 01:15:22,429
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

1467
01:15:22,565 --> 01:15:25,432
Because that way you know
you can't really get hurt.

1468
01:15:26,569 --> 01:15:29,834
Look, Paolo hasn't changed.
He's still the same person.

1469
01:15:29,973 --> 01:15:32,533
He's still the same person
you know and believe in.

1470
01:15:32,675 --> 01:15:36,338
And think is kind and smart
and sweet and bloody sexy.

1471
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,740
The only thing that's changed is
what might happen between you.

1472
01:15:45,288 --> 01:15:46,755
And he can tango!

1473
01:15:57,467 --> 01:15:59,025
God, babies. You were so right!

1474
01:15:59,168 --> 01:16:01,830
I mean when I think about it now,
he tried to tell me so many times.

1475
01:16:01,971 --> 01:16:04,132
And I just wouldn't let him.
I didn't want to hear it.

1476
01:16:04,274 --> 01:16:05,935
I didn't want to see it!
I was so blind!

1477
01:16:06,075 --> 01:16:07,133
Watch out!

1478
01:16:12,181 --> 01:16:14,741
- What time is it?
- 5:30. What time's his flight?

1479
01:16:14,884 --> 01:16:16,647
6! Hold on, babies.

1480
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:43,040
- Ticket?
- Oh, I'm not flying.

1481
01:16:43,179 --> 01:16:44,737
Only ticketed passengers
past this point.

1482
01:16:44,881 --> 01:16:46,542
Yes, but I need to speak to
someone on the BA flight

1483
01:16:46,683 --> 01:16:48,344
to Buenos Aires.
It's an emergency!

1484
01:16:48,484 --> 01:16:50,145
Try the BA's customer
service counter.

1485
01:16:50,286 --> 01:16:52,550
- They can call the gate.
- You're a genius!

1486
01:16:54,891 --> 01:16:57,359
I have an emergency message for someone
on your flight to Buenos Aires.

1487
01:16:57,493 --> 01:16:59,427
Flight to Buenos Aires?

1488
01:17:02,565 --> 01:17:05,728
I'm sorry but that flight's
already pulled out of the gate.

1489
01:17:05,868 --> 01:17:07,529
It had an early departure.

1490
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:09,331
An early departure?

1491
01:17:13,876 --> 01:17:16,640
An early departure?
What are the chances of that?

1492
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:19,748
If this was a movie, there
wouldn't be an early departure.

1493
01:17:20,883 --> 01:17:23,443
If this was a movie,
you'd be blonde!

1494
01:17:23,586 --> 01:17:25,747
If this was a movie,
you'd be famous!

1495
01:17:26,589 --> 01:17:29,057
That's the problem with life,
it's nothing like the movies.

1496
01:17:33,863 --> 01:17:35,626
I can't believe
you're really going.

1497
01:17:35,765 --> 01:17:37,733
I'm following your advice.
I'm breaking my rules.

1498
01:17:37,867 --> 01:17:38,925
Good for you!

1499
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:40,330
Are you sure you're
going to be OK?

1500
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:42,836
Jacks! I'm not a child,
I'll be fine.

1501
01:17:42,972 --> 01:17:45,031
- I worry about you, Babies.
- You worry about everyone.

1502
01:17:45,174 --> 01:17:47,039
No, I worry about you more.

1503
01:17:47,176 --> 01:17:48,734
I just don't want you
to end up alone.

1504
01:17:48,878 --> 01:17:51,938
Well, neither do I.
And stop being so dramatic!

1505
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:54,549
So stop living your life
like you're in some kind of movie.

1506
01:17:54,684 --> 01:17:55,651
Excuse me?

1507
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:58,447
Stop trying to cast your true
love instead ofjust meeting him.

1508
01:17:58,588 --> 01:18:00,954
- When I meet him, I'll know.
- I'm not so sure.

1509
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:02,853
Love isn't always
a lightning bolt, you know?

1510
01:18:02,992 --> 01:18:05,051
Maybe sometimes
it's just a choice.

1511
01:18:05,194 --> 01:18:06,218
Well, that's easy for you to say!

1512
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:08,523
You're flying to Argentina
to meet the love of your life!

1513
01:18:08,664 --> 01:18:11,224
That's just it. I don't know
that Paolo's the love of my life'

1514
01:18:11,367 --> 01:18:13,631
but I've decided to give him
the chance to be.

1515
01:18:15,271 --> 01:18:16,829
Maybe true love is a decision.

1516
01:18:16,973 --> 01:18:19,134
You know, a decision to take
a chance with somebody.

1517
01:18:19,275 --> 01:18:20,640
To give to somebody.
Without worrying whether

1518
01:18:20,777 --> 01:18:22,335
they'll give anything back.
Or if they're gonna hurt you,

1519
01:18:22,478 --> 01:18:24,241
or if they really are the one.

1520
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:27,349
Maybe love isn't something
that happens to you.

1521
01:18:27,483 --> 01:18:29,849
Maybe it's something
you have to choose.

1522
01:18:29,986 --> 01:18:31,146
So what do I do?

1523
01:18:31,287 --> 01:18:33,448
Well, you could start by
putting all of those fantasies of

1524
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:37,150
true love where they belong
into your work of fiction.

1525
01:19:01,184 --> 01:19:02,549
'Love and Other Disasters.'

1526
01:19:02,685 --> 01:19:04,152
Nice title. Catchy.

1527
01:19:04,287 --> 01:19:08,155
But it'll never fit on the marquee.
How aboutjust 'Love Disasters? '

1528
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:09,451
What?

1529
01:19:09,592 --> 01:19:10,957
I love that Jacks.

1530
01:19:11,094 --> 01:19:13,722
She's got that British
quirkiness audiences love.

1531
01:19:13,863 --> 01:19:15,023
'Hello, Babies! '

1532
01:19:15,164 --> 01:19:17,530
Yes, but technically she speaks
with an American accent

1533
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:18,725
because she's grown up
in America so...

1534
01:19:18,868 --> 01:19:21,132
Nah, it's too complicated.
Let's make her English.

1535
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:23,534
- Perfect part for Gwyneth!
- Gwyneth Paltrow?

1536
01:19:23,673 --> 01:19:26,039
Finest English actress of
her generation!

1537
01:19:27,577 --> 01:19:30,137
Brainstorm!
Orlando Bloom as the Mexican.

1538
01:19:30,279 --> 01:19:31,337
Paolo's Argentinean!

1539
01:19:31,481 --> 01:19:34,848
And we'll cover the American
angle with Drew and Cameron.

1540
01:19:34,984 --> 01:19:37,544
Drew Barrymore and
Cameron Diaz? As who?

1541
01:19:37,687 --> 01:19:38,949
Playing David and Tom.

1542
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:41,657
I'm sorry, you want me to
get rid of the gay story line?

1543
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:42,655
I don't want you to
get rid of anything!

1544
01:19:42,792 --> 01:19:44,953
I'm just saying instead of
David and Tom,

1545
01:19:45,094 --> 01:19:46,618
we have Daisy and Tina.

1546
01:19:47,263 --> 01:19:48,730
- I...
- Also, you gotta fiddle with that ending.

1547
01:19:48,865 --> 01:19:52,733
We need a bigger movie moment
when Jacks finally connects

1548
01:19:52,869 --> 01:19:54,530
- with Paolo.
- Yes, but...

1549
01:19:55,171 --> 01:19:57,639
Sorry, the whole point is
there is no big movie moment

1550
01:19:57,773 --> 01:19:59,832
because they both discover
that true love is a process

1551
01:19:59,976 --> 01:20:01,238
not an event.

1552
01:20:02,778 --> 01:20:04,643
You know, Peter. I get it.

1553
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:07,647
This script is like
your baby, isn't it?

1554
01:20:09,385 --> 01:20:11,250
Well, yes, I suppose it is...

1555
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:14,847
I understand that.
Believe me, I understand that.

1556
01:20:15,591 --> 01:20:16,649
Come here.

1557
01:20:17,393 --> 01:20:19,327
I want to give you some advice!

1558
01:20:20,663 --> 01:20:24,429
You gotta kill your baby!
You gotta fuckin' kill your baby!

1559
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:29,629
Right. Thank you. Thank you.

1560
01:20:38,781 --> 01:20:39,748
Sorry.

1561
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:41,543
- Peter!
- David! Hi!

1562
01:20:41,684 --> 01:20:44,847
- How are you?
- Good, good. You?

1563
01:20:44,987 --> 01:20:47,046
Great, I've managed to convince
Sotheby's to transfer me

1564
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:49,658
back to London.
How's the writing going?

1565
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:52,420
Good, thanks, I've finally
finished a screenplay.

1566
01:20:52,562 --> 01:20:54,120
Great! What's it about?

1567
01:20:54,263 --> 01:20:56,731
Oh, it's just about some guy
who realizes he's been

1568
01:20:56,866 --> 01:20:58,731
looking for love in
all the wrong places.

1569
01:20:58,868 --> 01:21:01,632
- Like in hotel lobbies?
- Yes, or in his head.

1570
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:04,532
- Well, congratulations!
- Thank you, thank you.

1571
01:21:04,674 --> 01:21:06,232
You may want to wait
until you've seen the film.

1572
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:10,038
I don't need to. I'm congratulating you
for having the courage to write it.

1573
01:21:10,179 --> 01:21:14,138
How it turns out or even if
it turns out that's out of your hands.

1574
01:21:15,084 --> 01:21:18,952
- Anyway, take care.
- Yes. You, too.

1575
01:21:33,169 --> 01:21:35,137
It's on the left when we get out.

1576
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:05,625
David!

1577
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:08,928
Peter?

1578
01:22:09,672 --> 01:22:10,639
Are you OK?

1579
01:22:10,773 --> 01:22:12,934
No. Actually, I'm very out of
shape and that nearly killed me.

1580
01:22:13,075 --> 01:22:15,737
But I needed to tell you two things.

1581
01:22:16,379 --> 01:22:19,940
First, I'm really sorry
I was so self-absorbed

1582
01:22:20,082 --> 01:22:21,640
when I first met you at brunch.

1583
01:22:21,784 --> 01:22:23,149
You don't have to
apologize to me.

1584
01:22:23,286 --> 01:22:26,050
Oh, no, I'm not apologizing to you.
I'm sorry for my own sake.

1585
01:22:26,188 --> 01:22:28,952
You see, I was so caught up
in my own head.

1586
01:22:29,091 --> 01:22:31,355
I missed out on getting
to know you.

1587
01:22:31,494 --> 01:22:35,624
And I would like to
get to know you.

1588
01:22:35,765 --> 01:22:38,427
I mean if you'd be willing
to give me another chance?

1589
01:22:38,567 --> 01:22:43,129
Maybe let me take you
out for dinner?

1590
01:22:45,675 --> 01:22:46,733
Oh, I don't know.

1591
01:22:47,576 --> 01:22:51,034
See, I've had this fantasy in my
head about having dinner with you.

1592
01:22:51,881 --> 01:22:53,246
What if you don't live up to it?

1593
01:22:58,487 --> 01:23:02,150
Oh well, then I'd just have
to keep taking you out

1594
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:03,849
until I get it right.

1595
01:23:07,263 --> 01:23:08,628
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1596
01:23:08,764 --> 01:23:10,629
- French or Italian?
- I think Italian.

1597
01:23:10,766 --> 01:23:11,824
Good.

1598
01:23:32,788 --> 01:23:33,846
Paolo!

1599
01:23:35,191 --> 01:23:36,249
Jacks!

1600
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:58,745
Paolo, I've been such
a bloody fool!

1601
01:23:58,881 --> 01:24:00,246
Can you ever forgive me?

1602
01:24:00,783 --> 01:24:04,742
Love means always forgiving.

1603
01:24:05,588 --> 01:24:08,648
And I do love you, Paolo!
I do!

1604
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:21,029
They made me write that ending.

1605
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:23,434
Apparently, audiences demanded
that Jacks and Paolo have

1606
01:24:23,572 --> 01:24:25,540
this big Hollywood moment.

1607
01:24:25,674 --> 01:24:27,437
I loved that ending.

1608
01:24:28,878 --> 01:24:31,244
How can you love that ending?
It's so artificial!

1609
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:33,143
It's a lot better than
what really happened!

1610
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:35,341
I agree, I don't think having
Jacks arrive in Argentina

1611
01:24:35,484 --> 01:24:38,146
with a bad case of diarrhoea
would have had the same impact.

1612
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:39,652
I loved how I came across.

1613
01:24:39,789 --> 01:24:41,654
You were played
by Drew Barrymore!

1614
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:44,055
Who totally captured my essence.

1615
01:24:44,193 --> 01:24:46,627
Name was absolutely
brilliant in that.

1616
01:24:48,164 --> 01:24:50,928
Well, I don't like to brag but
I really think I stole the movie!

1617
01:24:51,066 --> 01:24:54,433
I mean, I was funny.
Touching. Eccentric. Real.

1618
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:56,731
If a little old for the part.

1619
01:24:56,872 --> 01:24:59,033
And I have to applaud your decision
not to show me ending up with James.

1620
01:24:59,175 --> 01:25:00,642
Why? Are you ashamed of
our relationship?

1621
01:25:00,776 --> 01:25:01,538
No, of course not, darling.

1622
01:25:01,677 --> 01:25:02,735
It's just that you were
the villain

1623
01:25:02,878 --> 01:25:05,039
and itjust wouldn't have
felt very believable.

1624
01:25:05,181 --> 01:25:07,649
- What a clever boy you are!
- Thank you.

1625
01:25:07,783 --> 01:25:10,343
Making Talullah and her mother
look the same age!

1626
01:25:10,486 --> 01:25:12,545
That's very modern, Paul!

1627
01:25:12,688 --> 01:25:14,747
I'm so sorry!
My shoot went over!

1628
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:16,357
You just missed
the story of our lives.

1629
01:25:16,492 --> 01:25:17,550
But with better lighting!

1630
01:25:17,693 --> 01:25:20,321
Everyone knows I wasn't the one
who reported Paolo to immigration, right?

1631
01:25:20,463 --> 01:25:21,122
Yes, darling, we know.

1632
01:25:21,263 --> 01:25:22,321
Well, I think this calls for champagne!

1633
01:25:22,465 --> 01:25:25,025
Oh, right! Claridge's, turn left!

1634
01:25:34,677 --> 01:25:36,542
- Babies, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

1635
01:25:36,679 --> 01:25:39,443
You wrote a screenplay.
And they made a movie out of it!

1636
01:25:39,582 --> 01:25:41,846
I know and I should be grateful.
Look, I'm very lucky.

1637
01:25:41,984 --> 01:25:44,043
It's just...
I don't know.

1638
01:25:44,186 --> 01:25:46,347
I just wanted to tell the truth
and somewhere along the line

1639
01:25:46,489 --> 01:25:47,649
it got mixed up with
a bunch of lies.

1640
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:51,749
Nobody goes to the movies for
truth except possibly the French!

1641
01:25:51,894 --> 01:25:54,829
The truth is way too complicated.
And unsatisfying.

1642
01:25:54,964 --> 01:25:56,431
And hard to believe.

1643
01:25:57,366 --> 01:25:58,731
- Oh, my God!
- What?

1644
01:25:58,868 --> 01:26:00,631
- I think my waterjust broke.
- What?

1645
01:26:00,769 --> 01:26:04,432
I know, it's impossible, right?
I'm not due for another 3 weeks!

1646
01:26:05,574 --> 01:26:07,633
Paolo! Paolo!
She's having the baby now!

1647
01:26:07,776 --> 01:26:10,244
Call an ambulance!
Call a taxi!
