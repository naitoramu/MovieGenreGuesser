1
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,547
Oh, hey, you guys?

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,507
I couldn't get a reservation
for the night of my birthday...

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,843
...so we'll have to do dinner
Thursday night.

4
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:14,974
- Thursday? But that's Halloween.
- So?

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,476
It's just spooky, that's all.

6
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,229
So is Mike coming to dinner?

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:24,191
No. It's my first birthday
with a boyfriend, and he has to work.

8
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:28,404
I'd get mad at him, but I think
it's too soon to show my true colors.

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,659
I would make the reservation for five.
One of us has to stay with Emma.

10
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,910
- Which one of us should go to dinner?
- Rachel!

11
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,334
Actually, I was thinking
maybe both of us could go.

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,173
Thanks. I'll put a lot of extra thought
into your gift.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,761
All right, so great, we can all go now.

14
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,388
That is fun! Hey! You know what?

15
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,267
We all haven't been together,
the six of us, in such a long time.

16
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,686
What are you talking about?
We're together now.

17
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,438
Mon? Chandler's not here.

18
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,610
Oh, dear God.

19
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,197

22
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:51,278
Hello. It's nice to see
our team together for the first time.

23
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,865
Now, before we get started,
are there any questions?

24
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,783
- Yes. Ken, is it?
- That's right.

25
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,162
Is it true the reason you're in Tulsa is,
you fell asleep in a meeting...

26
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,332
...and took the job without realizing
what you were saying yes to?

27
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,587
Well, don't believe
everything you hear, Ken.

28
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,297
But yeah, that's true.

29
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:17,012
All right, let's get started by taking
a look at last quarter's figures.

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,518
Claudia, aren't you supposed
to blow smoke up the boss's ass?

31
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:29,066
- I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
- No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.

32
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,652
Right now, I can't remember why.

33
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,655
You're not allowed to smoke
in this office, right?

34
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,450
Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke
in offices with 15 people or less.

35
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:42,287
- Would you like one?
- All right, look. I don't smoke anymore.

36
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,749
But if the rest of you want to light up,
go ahead, it's fine.

37
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,547
So you all smoke, then?

38
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,799
You know, it's almost rude
that I'm not smoking.

39
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,385
- That's not true. If you don't want...
- Ken, please!

40
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,767
No, I can't. I can't smoke.
If I smoke, my wife would kill me.

41
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,228
I'm sorry, but isn't your wife
back in New York?

42
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,233
I've always liked you, Ken.

43
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,366
Trick or treat.

44
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,786
- Hey.
- And "treat" it is.

45
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,791
Wow. So glad I changed.

46
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,170
I almost wore my threadbare robe
that can't contain my breasts.

47
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,508
This is not what I'm wearing.
I'm ovulating...

48
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,095
...and Chandler's gonna be home.
So I thought we would try before dinner.

49
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:44,016
Wait, does that...? You guys won't
be late for my dinner, will you?

50
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,143
We haven't seen each other
in over a week.

51
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,145
We'll probably be the first ones there.

52
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,106
Okay. See you there. Happy humping.

53
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,985
Hey. Well, hey!

54
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,530
Wow, somebody smoked out here?

55
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,203
My God, don't people know you're
not allowed to smoke in public spaces?

56
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:10,542
Actually, in Oklahoma smoking's legal
in offices with fewer than 15 people.

57
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,544
Oh, you smoked.

58
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:17,508
No. I just happen to know a lot of trivia
about smoking in different states.

59
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:22,262
For example, in Hawaii,
cigarettes are called "lei-lana-lukus."

60
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,185
- Oh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes!
- Do you think Monica will smell it?

61
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,897
Are you kidding? That woman
has the nose of a bloodhound.

62
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,484
And the breasts of a Greek goddess.

63
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,031
Pheebs?

64
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,825
I'm gonna go.

65
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay. Something to cover the smell.

66
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,547
Oven cleaner.

67
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,595
Unscented.

68
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,766
Welcome home.

69
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,770
I've missed you.

70
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:15,482
- You want to join me in the bedroom?
- No, thanks, I'm good.

71
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:20,362
Okay. So you want to play it
that way, do you?

72
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,282
Well, you know what, actually,
I just got off a plane...

73
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,784
...so I'm feeling gross.
I should take a shower.

74
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,747
- Come here, you don't need a shower.
- All right, the truth is...

75
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,791
...I soiled myself
during some turbulence.

76
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,840
What do I smell? I smell smoke.

77
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,176
Did you smoke?

78
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,220
Yes. But I just had one.

79
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,847
Two.

80
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,767
Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five.

81
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,355
A pack. Two pack... A carton.

82
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,025
Three big fat cartons in two days!

83
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,821
But it's over. I've made a decision,
I'm not gonna smoke anymore.

84
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,619
Well, those are for you.

85
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,374
All right. Well, we'll just see you
when you get here. Bye.

86
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,170
Oh, that was my mom.
She's stuck in terrible traffic.

87
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,131
That is now the third sign
that I should not leave Emma.

88
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,343
- What are the other two?
- Well, the first one is, I don't want to.

89
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,014
And second one, I'm not going.

90
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,766
I know this is the first time
we're leaving the baby.

91
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,977
I know how hard it is for you. But...

92
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,271
But everything's gonna be fine.
I mean, my mom is gonna be with her.

93
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,607
- She's great with kids.
- She is?

94
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,901
Yeah.

95
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,653
What about Monica?

96
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,948
You only hear Monica's side of that.
Okay, that little fatso was a terror!

97
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:54,331
- I just don't think I can do it.
- Know what? You can and you should.

98
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,500
Really, it will be good for you.

99
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,127
In fact, you know what?

100
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,962
Go ahead to the restaurant,
and I will wait for my mom...

101
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,841
...and then I'll meet you there.
No, no, really, you should go. Go out.

102
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:11,556
Really, the world is your oyster.
Kick up your heels. Paint the town red!

103
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,770
- You need to learn some new slang.
- I'm serious. Come on, you should go.

104
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,815
Here. No, just go.

105
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,942
- Well...
- No, no! You know what?

106
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:26,113
You're not getting back in there!
The baby's fine. Now, scram!

107
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,158
Yeah, tell your story walking!

108
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,371
I was just going to say
that I left my keys.

109
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,169
Holy moley, are we in a pickle now!

110
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:48,052
Where is everyone?
They're 40 minutes late.

111
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,220
- I know.
- I'm starving.

112
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,098
I knew we were coming here tonight.
I ate nothing all day.

113
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,434
What about me?
I only had one lunch today.

114
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,105
So are we expecting
the rest of our party shortly?

115
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,650
Yes, they are expected presently.
Yeah.

116
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,445
Their arrival is in the offing.

117
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,906
Right. We have a table for two available.

118
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,740
- Perhaps you'd...
- No, they're coming.

119
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,410
We're waiting right here.

120
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,329
Joseph!

121
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:20,042
One needn't worry.
They shan't be long.

122
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,795
It's just that we do have
some large parties waiting.

123
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,924
Oh, one really does have a stick
up one's ass, doesn't one?

124
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,971
How can you smoke in this day and age?
Have you not seen that ad?

125
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,975
Where the little kid walks
through Grandpa? It's chilling!

126
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,020
I messed up. It was a meeting.
Everybody was smoking.

127
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,356
So what? Don't you have any willpower?

128
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,484
Willpower? I've watched home movies
of you eating Ding Dongs...

129
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,486
...without taking the tinfoil off!

130
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,157
You said that was sexy!

131
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,579
Okay, look, can we just drop this?
I'm not gonna smoke again.

132
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,290
That's right, because I forbid you
to smoke again.

133
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,501
You forbid me?

134
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,961
I've flown a long way
to see my loving wife.

135
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,047
Is she here, by the way?

136
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:13,220
Chandler, don't joke with me. Okay?
I'm very, very upset right now.

137
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,431
- Is this the most upset you could be?
- I think so.

138
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,725
Well, then I might as well...

139
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,019
...do this.

140
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,824
Not really sure what to do now.

141
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,620
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

142
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,372
We're already late
for Phoebe's birthday dinner.

143
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,458
So you're going to put out
that cigarette...

144
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,460
...we're gonna put this fight on hold,
and go have sex.

145
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,714
Fine. What?

146
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,758
Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating.
If we don't do it...

147
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,094
...we're gonna have to wait
until next month!

148
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,263
You're serious?

149
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,934
- Oh, yeah!
- All right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking!

150
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,104
- And no cuddling.
- And no kissing your neck.

151
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,774
Oh, good! I hate it when you do that!

152
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,737
And lots of kissing your neck!

153
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,364
Okay, well, the super's not home.

154
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,075
But my mother's gonna be here,
and she has the key.

155
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:20,538
I can't wait that long. You have to do
something. Knock that door down!

156
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,915
I would, but I bruise like a peach.

157
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:29,255
Besides, you know, everything's
gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.

158
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,676
- What if she jumps out of the bassinet?
- Can't hold her head up, but jumped.

159
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,679
Oh, my God!
I left the water running!

160
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,724
You did not leave the water running.
Please, pull yourself together, okay?

161
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:45,229
- Well, did I leave the stove on?
- You haven't cooked since 1996.

162
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,191
Is the window open? If the window's
open a bird could fly in and...

163
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,276
My God, you know what?
I think you're right.

164
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,861
- Listen.
- What? What?

165
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:57,449
A pigeon. No. No, wait, no.
An eagle flew in!

166
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,537
Landed on the stove and caught fire!

167
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:09,795
The baby, seeing this, jumps across
the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.

168
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,798
The eagle, however, misconstrues this
as an act of aggression...

169
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,675
...and grabs the baby in its talon.

170
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:18,095
Meanwhile, the faucet
fills the apartment with water.

171
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:21,766
Baby and bird, still ablaze,
are locked in a death grip...

172
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:26,770
...swirling around the whirlpool
that fills the apartment!

173
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,649
Boy, are you gonna be sorry
if that's true.

174
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,989
- Hello.
- Hi.

175
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,116
It's been an hour.

176
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:43,287
The maitre d' asked if you'd reconsider
switching to a smaller table.

177
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,081
Maybe we should just eat now.

178
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,876
You can't order until the entire
party's arrived. Restaurant policy.

179
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,004
Well, how about this?
Another table leaves, right...

180
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:55,216
...but there's still some food left
on their plates.

181
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,844
Okay, what's the restaurant's policy
about people eating that?

182
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,972
- It's frowned upon.
- But it happens.

183
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,978
- All right, I got to go to the bathroom.
- You can't go.

184
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,398
No, no, no.
I can't hold this table on my own.

185
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,608
If they ask me to move, I'll cave.

186
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,776
Well, if you ask me to stay, I'll pee.

187
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,411
Good evening, miss.

188
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,330
Miss?

189
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,709
Miss? Miss?

190
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:35,464
Okay, fine, I'll move. All right.
You don't have to manhandle me.

191
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,969
Where? Okay.

192
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:44,598
Thank you. Wow.

193
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,356
Finally. You guys made it.

194
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,698
Pheebs, who the hell...?

195
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,083
Spend more time with the tie!
That will make a baby.

196
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:16,213
Look, I can't do this. I can't make love
to you while we're fighting this way.

197
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,715
Oh, sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.

198
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,551
But when you wanted to have sex
after my uncle's funeral...

199
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,845
That was a celebration of life!

200
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,140
All right, I'm not gonna do this.

201
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,852
Is this the way you want our baby
to be conceived?

202
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,773
No, you're right.

203
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,192
No, we shouldn't do it like this.

204
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,072
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

205
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:45,534
I shouldn't have come down on you
so hard about the smoking.

206
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:49,705
So you had a few cigarettes.
It's not the end of the world.

207
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,499
- Really?
- Yeah.

208
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,001
You are incredible.

209
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,713
And listen,
I'm not gonna smoke again.

210
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,966
And if I do, I promise
I will hide it so much better from you.

211
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,059
- Want to?
- Let's celebrate life!

212
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,352
Okay!

213
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,315
Oh, God.

214
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,358
Oh, thank God you're okay.

215
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,028
I'm sorry we left.
Mommy will never leave you again.

216
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:24,240
Never, ever, ever again.

217
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,283
Great. So let's get going.

218
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,121
I mean it. After what just happened,
I'm never leaving her again.

219
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,083
I understand. Separation is hard.

220
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,253
One time I was about to leave Ross
to go to the beauty parlor.

221
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,173
And he got so upset
he took off all his clothes...

222
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,593
...tucked his willy between his legs...

223
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,598
...and cried out, "Mommy, I'm a girl.
Take me with you."

224
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:01,527
Somehow, over time,
it got easier to be apart from you.

225
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,618
You are welcome.

226
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:14,039
- You know what? Let's not talk.
- What?

227
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,710
- I am still so mad at you for smoking!
- But you said you forgave me.

228
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,837
It was just a couple of cigarettes,
no big deal.

229
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:27,344
I was ovulating and you said you
wouldn't have sex if we were fighting.

230
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,934
- You tricked me to get me into bed?
- That's right. I got mine.

231
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,272
I feel so used.

232
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,027
Well, I guess they're not coming.
You want to just order?

233
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,738
Thank you.

234
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,495
Waiter? All right, this is gonna
go fast, so try to keep up.

235
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,789
Risotto with shaved truffles
and the rib steak...

236
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,500
...with the golden chanterelles
and the Bordelaise sauce...

237
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:02,171
...unless any of that stuff I just said
means "snails."

238
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,841
- It does not.
- Tomato tart...

239
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,009
...and which of the pastas
would you recommend?

240
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,012
- Oh, well they're both exquisite...
- Both it is. Thank you.

241
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,390
Oh, can I make a special request?

242
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,434
Can you bring everything
as it's ready?

243
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,645
- Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.
- Hey!

244
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,942
- I'll wait to put your order in.
- You guys are over an hour late.

245
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,278
- What happened to you two?
- So sorry.

246
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,823
- We got locked out of the apartment.
- That's a great story. Can I eat it?

247
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,786
And then Rachel wasn't sure
she could leave the baby.

248
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:37,414
It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday
and I did what I had to do.

249
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,083
And that's Judy over there at the bar
with Emma?

250
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,966
This is for the best. I'm not distracted,
worrying about Emma...

251
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,761
...how she's doing at home, and I'm
gonna be completely here with you.

252
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,762
- Oh, she spit up. She spit up.
- What?

253
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,641
Judy? She spit...
Judy, look alive, Judy!

254
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,480
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

255
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,318
Oh, everything looks delicious.

256
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:10,280
What should I have?
What should I have?

257
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:14,326
Never hit a woman.
Never hit a woman.

258
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,246
I know what you mean,
this menu's incredible.

259
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,332
Ross bruises like a peach.
He bruises like a peach.

260
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,752
Okay, I'll have the fig salad
and the duck.

261
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,754
I'll have the soup and the salmon.

262
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,923
Remember, whatever comes up first,
okay?

263
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,466
- Hurry...
- Happy birthday!

264
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:30,801
Son of a bitch!

265
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:35,055
- Where have you been?
- Well, we had a little fight.

266
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,224
I would never lie
to get someone into bed.

267
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:41,020
You used to tell girls
you were a Kennedy.

268
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,024
Thanks.

269
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:49,278
Thanks. Wow.

270
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,322
A little tight, isn't it?
Why didn't you get a bigger table?

271
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,827
You had a big table
but they made you move.

272
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,455
Shut up, Monica.

273
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,627
Oh, well, I suppose that Chandler
will have the smoked duck.

274
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:12,134
And I suppose that Monica
will have the manipulative shrew.

275
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,845
- I'll give you another minute.
- What, where you going?

276
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,681
He said she wanted the shrew!

277
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,642
Rach, come on, Emma's fine.

278
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:25,022
You're turning into an obsessive
mother, okay? You need to stop.

279
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:30,402
You ever hear the story about when
Ross' mom went to the beauty salon?

280
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:36,617
- You mean the willy story?
- They already know it.

281
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,497
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

282
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,166
- You should order.
- That's okay.

283
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,211
- I told the waiter what they want.
- Why would you do that?

284
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,755
Chandler, control your woman.

285
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,133
Okay, well...
Everybody has ordered.

286
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:59,973
I would like to start the celebration
and make a toast to Phoebe.

287
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,518
- She dropped her sock.
- What?

288
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:07,230
- No. No, Emma dropped her sock.
- Mom's here?

289
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:11,443
I wanted to have lunch with her today.
She told me she was out of town.

290
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,697
She still has not noticed
that the baby's sock is on the ground.

291
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,199
It's a good toast.

292
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,035
Look, will you please get her attention?

293
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,163
Mommy?

294
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,299
Oh, for God's sake, Judy,
pick up the sock!

295
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:37,552
Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!

296
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,809
I'm sorry, was that rude?

297
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,896
Did my little outburst...

298
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:52,276
...blunt the hideousness
that is this evening?

299
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,361
Look, I know you have a lot going on...

300
00:19:54,528 --> 00:20:00,451
...but all I wanted to do was have
dinner with my friends on my birthday.

301
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:06,164
And you are all so late, and you
didn't even have the courtesy to call.

302
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,502
Well, it's too late now.

303
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,421
Pheebs, I don't think that's us.

304
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:18,093
Oh, well, this is... This is not over!
Hello?

305
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,974
- What is going on with you two?
- Well, you see, I'm ovulating.

306
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,769
Oh, yeah, that's what she says.

307
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:32,566
Maybe you're not ovulating. Maybe
it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.

308
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:37,404
Yeah, Smokey, that's what it was.
I just can't get enough.

309
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,781
You're not gonna believe this.

310
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,284
She tricked me
into having sex with her.

311
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,996
So? You got to have sex, right?

312
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:50,000
What's the matter with me?
Why am I such a girl?

313
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,588
- Okay. That was Mike.
- Oh, Phoebe, honey, we are so sorry.

314
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,967
You are totally right.
We are here 100 percent...

315
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:01,511
...and we love you, and we are ready
to start your birthday celebration.

316
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,890
You guys, that means the world to me.

317
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,478
Okay, I'm gonna take off.

318
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,731
What?

319
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,317
I love you guys too, but
Mike got off work early.

320
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,319
Wait.

321
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:22,032
I'm not the... I'm not the kind of girl
that just ditches her friends...

322
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,451
...to be with her boyfriend.

323
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,911
You know what? I am.

324
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,373
Bye, guys. Judy! Bye.

325
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,543
If Phoebe's gone,
can we take Emma home?

326
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,797
That's a good idea. Our babysitter
just pounded another chardonnay.

327
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,216
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

328
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:43,637
See you. Well, I guess it's just us.

329
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:51,228
So I'm probably still ovulating.
Do you want to give it another try?

330
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,690
So you've never had sex
with a Kennedy, have you?

331
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,110
- You're gonna go do it?
- We don't have much time.

332
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,446
Once the egg descends into the
fallopian tube...

333
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,489
Oh, wait, oh, get out of here!

334
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:10,205
I sincerely hope the rest of your party
is returning.

335
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:12,750
No, just me. All alone.

336
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,215
Dinner for six for one.

337
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:24,219
Well, you boys are about
to see something really special.

338
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,692
- How was everything?
- Excellent.

339
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,321
The shrew, in particular, was exquisite.

340
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,074
I hope you've got some room left.

341
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,875
Joey. Joey.

342
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,006
This is the best birthday ever!

343
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:05,844
