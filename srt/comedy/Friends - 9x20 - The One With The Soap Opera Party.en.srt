1
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,131
Hey, you guys? What are
you doing tomorrow night?

2
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,551
Oh, well, let me see.
I believe I'm...

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,887
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:16,266
Well, my agent hooked me up
with six tickets to a great play.

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,060
I could fall asleep at a play.

6
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,272
- What is it?
- It's a one-woman play called:

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:25,651
<i>Why Don 't You Like Me?</i>
<i>A Bitter Woman 's Journey Through Life.</i>

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,820
- That sounds interesting.
- That does sound interesting.

9
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:33,533
To listen to a woman complain for
two hours. I don't think it gets bet...

10
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,455
I know! I know. We can drive.
We can vote. We can work.

11
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,125
What more do these broads want?

12
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,462
Well, you guys will have a great time.
I promise.

13
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,380
What? How come you don't have to go?

14
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,132
I wish I could, but I found out...

15
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,802
...that I have to be at work really
early the next day, so I can't go.

16
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,597
But take the extra ticket
and invite whoever you want.

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,682
Let's see. Who do I hate?

18
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,311
Oh, sorry.

19
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,105
- Oops, sorry.
- Okay.

20
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,857
- Okay.
- Okay. Up we go.

21
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,234
- Oh, gosh, okay!
- All right.

22
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,163
Can I ask you a question?

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,417
Do you think it's possible
for two friends to fool around...

24
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,796
...and not have it be a big deal?

25
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,716
No, I don't think that ever works.
Why?

26
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,219
- No reason.
- No, no. Rachel?

27
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,181
- Who do you want to fool around with?
- Nobody! Forget it.

28
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,475
Joey?

29
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,019
Maybe.

30
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,689
- You can't.
- Why?

31
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,065
Because!

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,030
Okay, seriously, did not understand
a word you just said.

33
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,324
- In the hall.
- Okay.

34
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,871
- You wanna fool around with Joey?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,583
Ever since I had that dream about him,
I can't get it out of my head.

36
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,378
I mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.

37
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,213
Who do you know that are friends
that just fool around?

38
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,634
Okay. Off the top of my head...
Don and Janet.

39
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,470
- Who are they?
- I know them from work.

40
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,432
- Both of them?
- No, just one of them.

41
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,392
Which one?

42
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,478
I don't know.
What were the names I just said?

43
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,440
No, Rachel, things could get
incredibly complicated.

44
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:32,069
You're right. I won't do anything
with Joey. I just thought it...

45
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:37,074
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,
a pound of baking soda and a red onion?

46
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,243
What the hell are you cooking?

47
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,039

50
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,092
You guys won't believe
what I have to do for work today.

51
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,805
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career
of talking about dinosaurs.

52
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,394
There are these two professors
who are joining my department...

53
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,606
...and I have to meet them here
and show them around campus.

54
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,898
What's bad about that?

55
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,776
I just know they'll be
a couple of old windbags...

56
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,488
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede elbow patches.

57
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,573
Ross?

58
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,410
What? These aren't suede.

59
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,084
Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.

60
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,295
You don't, by any chance,
know a Ross Geller?

61
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,505
No.

62
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,345
Hi. Hi, I'm Ross Geller.

63
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,265
Oh, hi. I'm Professor Wheeler.

64
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,727
Oh, that's... That's...
That's nice.

65
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,729
It's good to meet you.

66
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,774
Thank you so much for taking the time
to show me around.

67
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,776
No, it's no big deal.

68
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:40,281
If I weren't doing this, I'd just,
you know, be at the gym working out.

69
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,616
Is he gonna introduce us?

70
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:46,120
I think we're just blurry shapes
to him now.

71
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,289
By the way,
I really enjoyed your paper...

72
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,919
...on the connection between geographic
isolation and rapid mutagenesis.

73
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,047
I wrote that in one night.

74
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,301
Twenty bucks says they're married
within the month.

75
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,596
Well, we should probably get going.

76
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,558
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

77
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,435
Isn't another professor
supposed to come with us?

78
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,313
I don't think so.

79
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,317
I'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?

80
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,569
Well, he's obviously late,
and the rule in my class is:

81
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,698
If you can't come on time,
then don't come at all.

82
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,036
An option that many of my students use.

83
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,996
- Shall we?
- We shouldn't wait for him?

84
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,416
You know what, he's a big boy.
I'm sure he'll find us, okay?

85
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,961
- Professor Geller?
- Oh, damn it!

86
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,349
"Hi", "it's Jan Rogers."
<i>Can 't wait for your party tonight.</i>

87
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:54,146
"Listen", "I forgot your address."
<i>Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.</i>

88
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:58,776
What's happening?

89
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,238
It's a real shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.

90
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,450
I'd love to, but I gotta get up
so early the next day.

91
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:10,329
- You know me, work comes first.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

92
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,376
"Hi", "it's Jan Rogers."
<i>Can 't wait for your party tonight.</i>

93
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,463
Stupid Jan Rogers!

94
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,466
You are having a party tonight?

95
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,178
I'm kind of having a thing
for the "Days of Our Lives" people.

96
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,721
You weren't gonna tell us?

97
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,307
How did you think
you'd get away with that?

98
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,309
I do it every year.

99
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,980
You do that every year?!

100
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,315
I didn't have to tell you that!

101
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,360
God, I'm stupider than Jan Rogers!

102
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,573
That's why you got us tickets
to that play, to get rid of us!

103
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,823
Yeah.

104
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,452
Last year is that why you sent us
to that Medieval Times restaurant?

105
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,829
Yeah.

106
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:57,334
The year before that, you set up that
nighttime tour of that button factory?

107
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,587
I can't believe you guys went
for that one.

108
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,048
Why wouldn't you invite us
to your parties?

109
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:07,552
You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts
like an idiot around famous people.

110
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,597
Well, then, so just invite me.

111
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,434
Please, I was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.

112
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,605
Joey, come on! Please, please?
Let me come. I will behave. I promise.

113
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,276
- I will behave. Please, please, please.
- Okay, fine. You can come.

114
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,071
But don't tell anybody else.
It's up on the roof at 8.

115
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,823
A soap-opera roof party?!

116
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,660
I'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

117
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,414
And it's out of my system.

118
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:47,634
And then my wife and I went
on a cruise to the Galapagos.

119
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:52,014
There was a seafood buffet
you wouldn't believe.

120
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:57,311
There were clams and mussels
and oysters...

121
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,771
...and cracked crab...

122
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,107
...and snow crab...

123
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,777
...and king crab.

124
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,071
It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.

125
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,576
So where did you get
your undergraduate degree?

126
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:16,497
- And that's not all I'm allergic to.
- Oh, it's not over.

127
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,792
I'm also allergic to peanuts
and cashews...

128
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,128
...and almonds and filberts...

129
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,963
So basically all nuts!

130
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,382
Interestingly, no.

131
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:32,054
You're kind of playing it fast and loose
with the word "interesting."

132
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,434
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to use the restroom.

133
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,271
Oh, my God!

134
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,606
I've lost the will to live.

135
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,818
- Let's ditch him.
- What?

136
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,695
While he's still in the bathroom.
I am begging you.

137
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,657
Okay. Okay, fine,
but I just have one question for you.

138
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,910
When we exit, should we walk or run...

139
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,455
...or prance or stroll...?

140
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:03,460
Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,
but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!

141
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,430
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.

142
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,517
Charlie, this is Phoebe
and my sister, Monica.

143
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:21,854
- Hi.
- Charlie will be joining my department.

144
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,189
- You're a paleontologist too?
- Yeah.

145
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,567
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...

146
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:31,071
...of Renyard's new theory of species
variegation in segmented arthropods?

147
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:37,703
Well, I think he's a little out there,
but he does have some interesting ideas.

148
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,290
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take this.
Excuse me.

149
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,168
Renyard's theory of species variegation?

150
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:49,506
I saw the article on your coffee table.
I memorized the title to freak you out.

151
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,343
So did you two have fun?

152
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,971
Oh, my God. She's great.

153
00:09:56,138 --> 00:10:00,434
We have so much in common, and she's
just cool, you know? And funny.

154
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,313
And I don't know if you've noticed,
but she's a hottie!

155
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,689
Hi!

156
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,615
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
I'm not feeling really well...

157
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,202
...and I don't think I'm gonna get
to go to the play.

158
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,704
Really? What's wrong?

159
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,082
I don't know.
I think it's kind of serious.

160
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,710
You know, I was watching this thing
on TV this morning...

161
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:31,131
...about Newcastle disease,
and I think I might have it.

162
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,010
Newcastle disease is
a secretion-borne virus...

163
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,929
...that only affects chickens
and other poultry.

164
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,849
Okay, who's this?

165
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,728
I'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.
She's a colleague.

166
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,814
Hi. Well, I would shake your hand...

167
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,275
...but I'm sure you don't want
to get my chicken disease.

168
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,029
- Rachel, can I see you for a second?
- Sure.

169
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,494
You're not sick.

170
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,620
What? Yes, I am!

171
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,249
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?

172
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:11,297
When you're sick, you do whatever
you can to make yourself feel better.

173
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,176
You just want to stay home
so you can make a move on Joey.

174
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,137
No, I heard you before.
That is so not what this is.

175
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,556
Okay, then what is this?

176
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,267
Okay.

177
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,521
Joey is having a secret
"Days of Our Lives" party up on the roof.

178
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,232
And he sent you guys to the play
to get rid of you.

179
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,401
What?!

180
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,486
What? What's going on?

181
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:38,282
Joey is having a secret
"Days of Our Lives" party up on the roof!

182
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,869
He didn't want you to know about it,
but I came over here to tell you.

183
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,998
- You came to say you were sick.
- All right, professor or detective?

184
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,712
Wait, Joey's having a party,
and he wasn't gonna invite us?

185
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,466
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.

186
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,845
That's why he sent us to that medieval
restaurant and to that button factory.

187
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,264
And that horrible museum tour?

188
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,391
No, I arranged that.

189
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,190
Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.
Have fun.

190
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,320
We know about your party, Joey.

191
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,990
- What party?
- The game's over. Take off your robe.

192
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,951
Okay, I mean...

193
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,873
Close it up! Close it up!

194
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,211
Nice to meet you.

195
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,681
Hey, you made it! All right!

196
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,058
Glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.

197
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,394
- Oh, my God. Kyle Lowder!
- Hi.

198
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,814
I love you!

199
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,650
That's why I didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?

200
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,819
Just get yourself a drink
or something.

201
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,864
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.

202
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,702
Oh, my God, can you believe
we're surrounded by all this?

203
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,411
I can barely control myself.

204
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,206
You might want to remember
that you're married.

205
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,625
Where is Chandler anyway?

206
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,377
Oh, my God! Chandler!

207
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,720
Where the hell is everybody?

208
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,557
<i>Why Don 't You Like Me?</i>

209
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,773
Chapter 1: My First Period.

210
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,446
Hey, Joey said no autographs.

211
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,740
But if she's getting one,
I want one too!

212
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:48,036
"To Monica." And none of this
"best wishes" crap. I want "love."

213
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:53,250
Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was
giving me his phone number.

214
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,211
Oh, man! If I had known
I was coming to this party...

215
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,255
...I never would've gotten married!

216
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,508
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

217
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,760
- Call me.
- We will!

218
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:10,100
Look at you with all the guys!
I guess you've forgotten all about Joey.

219
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,061
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten
about Joey.

220
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,605
And clearly, you've forgotten
about Chandler.

221
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,734
Please. Chandler's
the love of my life.

222
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,986
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!

223
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:27,951
So it's probably gonna be hard
for you to leave Boston, huh?

224
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,997
Actually, I'm kind of happy to be leaving.
I just broke up with someone.

225
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,416
Oh, so sad.

226
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,669
Still, it can't be easy
for you to leave Harvard.

227
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,923
Especially after working with a Nobel
Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.

228
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,135
Actually, Albie is the guy
I broke up with.

229
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,430
- You dated Albert Wintermeyer?
- Yeah.

230
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,517
And you called him "Albie"?

231
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:56,564
I mean, that's like calling
Albert Einstein...

232
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,399
Albie.

233
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,445
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.

234
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,780
You think?
I mean, you dated the guy...

235
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:08,409
...who improved the accuracy
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!

236
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,913
Yes, and while that is everything
one looks for in a boyfriend...

237
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,748
...he had a lot of issues.

238
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,792
Oh, like what?

239
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,337
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.
It's just that this must be...

240
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:24,675
...what regular people experience
when they watch "Access Hollywood."

241
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,885
Okay, you want the dirt?

242
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,179
Albie was seriously insecure.

243
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,558
He was really intimidated by the guy
I dated before him.

244
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:36,144
Who's intimidating to a guy
who won the Nobel Prize?

245
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,313
A guy who won two.

246
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,149
Two? What...?

247
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,276
Don't tell me you dated
Benjamin Hobart?

248
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,320
Yeah, for three years.

249
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,863
Oh, my God.

250
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:52,035
Have you ever dated someone
who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?

251
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,164
No.

252
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,083
But there was
my first boyfriend, Billy.

253
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,586
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?

254
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:04,047
No, but he did just win
a MacArthur "genius grant."

255
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,051
What a loser.

256
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,512
Some more wine?

257
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,102
Hey, Ross. How's it going
with Charlie?

258
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,146
Oh, great. After I finish my wine...

259
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:23,234
...I'm gonna blow
my average-sized brains out.

260
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:24,985
What's the matter?

261
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:29,782
She only dates geniuses
and Nobel Prize winners.

262
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,742
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant
earlier today...

263
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,248
...I put chopsticks in my mouth
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.

264
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,667
I always loved that.

265
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,337
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!

266
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,507
I can't compete with the guys
she goes out with.

267
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,218
They're so out of my league.

268
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,845
Oh, my God!

269
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,972
- Worse?
- Oh, much, much worse.

270
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:58,310
I did my impression of Joan Rivers
as one of the earliest amphibians.

271
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,603
"Can we walk?"

272
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,107
- Oh, you like that?
- No.

273
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,525
What?

274
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,029
Come on! I think that's funny!

275
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,323
Woolly mammoth.

276
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,200
It's good!

277
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:19,498
I bet you're thinking that now would be
a great time for an intermission, huh?

278
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:22,293
Oh, yes. God, yes.

279
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,795
Well, you're not gonna get one!

280
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:28,382
Because in life, there are
no intermissions, people!

281
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:33,428
Now, Chapter 7:
Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!

282
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,725
How could he leave me?!

283
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,145
I don't know. You seem lovely.

284
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:53,365
Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.

285
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,951
- Nice to meet you.
- So, what show are you on?

286
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,496
I'm not an actor.
I'm a professor of paleontology.

287
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,082
That's science.

288
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,377
Hey, well, listen,
I play a scientist on "Days."

289
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,422
Yeah, my character just won
a Nobel Prize.

290
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,262
Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you two are together?

291
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,681
Well, no, but...

292
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:21,769
I mean, she only goes out
with really, really smart guys.

293
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,063
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.

294
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,358
I'd lead with that.

295
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,446
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.

296
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,366
Monica!

297
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:39,078
Don't worry, Joe.
I won't come next year!

298
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,374
What the...?

299
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,834
What do you got there?

300
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,504
Just some boys gave me
their phone numbers.

301
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,922
Oh, really? Let me see.

302
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,134
Damn, that's a lot of guys.

303
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,595
Are you a little slutty?

304
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,558
I think I am.

305
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,768
Let me see if I approve
of any of these clowns.

306
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,188
- This guy wears a rug.
- Well...

307
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,774
This guy's Canadian.

308
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,860
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?

309
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:16,782
Lt'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,
and I don't feel any different.

310
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,452
Pass. Pa... Oh, pass. Pass.

311
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,831
- Why? What's wrong with these guys?
- Well, nothing major.

312
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,417
It's just that, you know,
they're not really good enough for you...

313
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,795
...and you deserve the best.

314
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,214
Joey, you're so sweet.

315
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:36,760
It's true, but it doesn't matter. I already
know who you're going home with.

316
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,637
Who?

317
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,517
Me.

318
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,310
What?

319
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,646
Really?

320
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,150
Yeah, because we live together.
It's a joke! It's a joke.

321
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,610
Right! That's funny! I get it!

322
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,697
- Got you!
- You're funny, Joey.

323
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,949
Oh, my God.

324
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,750
So how did you enjoy the play?

325
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,130
Oh, my God.
Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.

326
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,340
You should be.

327
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:18,719
You missed the most powerful
three hours in the history of the theater.

328
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:22,056
- You really liked it?
- Oh, yeah. I mean, at first I hated it.

329
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:26,435
But why wouldn't I? Because as a man,
I've been trained not to listen!

330
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:34,568
But after Chapter 16:
Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...

331
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,571
...I was uplifted.

332
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,739
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah.

333
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:43,160
I had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.

334
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:47,289
Tell me...
Tell me about your first period.

335
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,292
No!

336
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,671
Did somebody sign your bra?

337
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:57,841
So I got it when I was 13.
Very difficult.

338
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:03,722
Hey, Ross? So listen,
about you and the dinosaur girl?

339
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:07,559
Are you really just gonna let
a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?

340
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,062
What is that?
Come on, a piece of paper?

341
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:12,314
It's actually a million-dollar prize.

342
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,649
Go, Charlie!

343
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,569
But my point is...

344
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:21,657
...okay, so she dated them,
but she also broke up with them.

345
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:27,412
Maybe she's looking to, you know,
slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.

346
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:33,377
Yeah, maybe, and I do have
my whole career in front of me.

347
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,004
I mean...

348
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,090
I could still win a Nobel Prize.

349
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:44,096
Although the last two papers
I've written were widely discredited.

350
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:50,978
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.

351
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,646
And sexy.

352
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,941
Okay, well, give her a chance
to see all that.

353
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,277
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

354
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,987
- Thanks. I'm gonna go find her.
- Good for you.

355
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:06,076
Your paper on punctuated equilibrium
in the Devonian Era was topnotch.

356
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,245
Stop going through my stuff!

357
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,585
I just wanted to let you know
I've changed my mind.

358
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,796
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna kiss Joey.

359
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:21,425
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

360
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,636
Please! What about you and Chandler?

361
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,763
That's different.
I was drunk and stupid.

362
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,266
Well, hello?

363
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:33,646
What about all the guys that you got
the phone numbers from?

364
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:36,398
- Why don't you just kiss one of them.
- I could...

365
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:40,110
...but I don't want to.
I want to kiss Joey.

366
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:44,781
All right. I think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.

367
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,079
I'm gonna do it.

368
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,749
- And I can't stop you?
- No.

369
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:10,098
Hey, Rach, have you seen
Charlie anywhere?

370
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,231
I'm smarter than him!

371
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:27,241
Hey, thank you so much
for these tickets, Chandler.

372
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:31,786
This was a really important experience
for me. I wanted to share it with you.

373
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:33,747
You're so wonderful.

374
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,167
<i>Why Don 't You Like Me?</i>

375
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:42,047
Chapter 1: My First Period.

376
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:47,553
I can't believe you guys bought that.
Enjoy your slow death.
