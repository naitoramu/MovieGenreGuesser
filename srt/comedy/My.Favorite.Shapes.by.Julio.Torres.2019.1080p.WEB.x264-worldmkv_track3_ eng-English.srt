1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,750
Dear God,
today is going to be big.

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,540
The Gemstones are
an absolute disgrace

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,580
to all ministries.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,120
You just threw Jesus
across the room.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,290
It was a karate person.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,460
That was Jesus.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,830
(phone chimes)

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,500
(Julio Torres speaking Spanish)

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,170
(ethereal music playing)

10
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,290
Uh-huh.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,210
(speaks Spanish)

13
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,920
(architecture whirring)

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,420
(audience cheering, applauding)

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,620
Hi. Hi. Hello.

16
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,750
Hello.

17
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,370
(cheers and applause continuing)

18
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,710
Hi. Hi.

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,750
Hey. Hello.

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,670
Uh, my name is Julio.

21
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,290
I am from El Salvador.

22
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,210
I am an Aquarius,

23
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,250
and I am here to show you
my favorite shapes.

24
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,460
I have a lot of shapes
but not a lot of time.

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,420
So, we have to start
immediately.

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,920
(laughter)

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,370
-Um...
-(conveyor belt whirring)

28
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,540
The first shape
that I want to show you...

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,210
um...

30
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,460
(laughter)

31
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,790
This shape-- I'm very excited
that this shape is here.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,290
But when I originally asked
this shape

33
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,830
if he wanted to do
the show,

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,620
he was like a little
hesitant about it,

35
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,790
a little worried that
we were gonna find him

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,710
to be mainstream, I guess?

37
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,370
But I'm like,
what are you talking about?

38
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,000
Everyone... loves a square.

39
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,420
(laughter)

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,000
Some of you may be
seeing a square

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,460
for the very, very
first time right now.

42
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,830
-(laughter)
-Some of you have seen
a square before.

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,500
For those of you who don't know,

44
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,120
a square is roughly
the shape of a door...

45
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,210
(laughter)

46
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,750
...but not quite.

47
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,960
(laughter)

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,500
It's a little bit more
complicated than that.

49
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,540
(laughter)

50
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,830
In order for this show
to happen,

51
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,710
a lawyer had to look
at all of my shapes

52
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,880
and decide whether or not
they were clearable for air.

53
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,580
(laughter)

54
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,170
She looked at every
single one of them,

55
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,670
and after that process
concluded,

56
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,370
completely unprompted
and out of nowhere,

57
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,170
she goes, "And my favorite
shape was the square."

58
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,420
(laughter)

59
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,670
Oh.

60
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,920
Beautiful little lawyer.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,170
You think we have you
all figured out, don't you?

62
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,370
(laughter)

63
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,790
The next shape that
I need to show you...

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,080
is a rectangle having
a really bad day.

65
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,170
(laughter)

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,290
This is an oval...

67
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,830
looking at his reflection
at a pond...

68
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,670
-(laughter)
-...wishing, oh just wishing,
he were a circle.

69
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,330
(laughter)

70
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,370
The next shape is a sphere

71
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,370
who you may recognize
for her current role

72
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,080
as a Ferrero Rocher chocolate.

73
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,500
(laughter)

74
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,790
Originally, we had booked
a different Ferrero Rocher
chocolate

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,790
to play this part,
but then I was backstage

76
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,750
and I was like, "Places,
places!" And like...

77
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,920
I'm sorry, but where's
your little skirt?

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,880
(laughter)

79
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
And she was like,
"No, I can do it."

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,250
(laughter)

81
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,000
No, honey,
I know you can do it,

82
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,790
but if you're not in costume,
I don't know what to tell you.

83
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,420
-(laughter)
-And then this one was like,

84
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,960
-"I can do it."
-(laughter)

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,790
It's a cruel, cruel business.

86
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,710
(laughter)

87
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,750
The next shape...

88
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,210
is a pyramid second.

89
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,460
But first, it is one of my
favorite kinds of shapes,

90
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,210
which is, uh, clear

91
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,920
with a little animal
trapped inside of it.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,210
(laughter)

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,580
As I was preparing this show,

94
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,790
and I was deciding which shapes
were gonna go in which order

95
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,210
and I was weighing out the pros
and cons of all of them,

96
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,960
thinking which one
of them were stars,

97
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,500
which ones were
more supporting.

98
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,210
-(laughter)
-And as I was just
deciding all of that,

99
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,290
I thought, oh, I'm sorry.
Is this one of the many
good jobs

100
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,790
that I'm stealing from
hardworking Americans?

101
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,250
-(laughter)
-Because...

102
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,080
Look, I'm just doing it
'cause no one else was doing it

103
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,500
and it needed to be done.

104
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,330
(laughter)

105
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,540
But notice what happens
to this shape

106
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,080
once you begin to expand on
the same basic principle of it.

107
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,080
All of a sudden...

108
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,500
it turns into
Tilda Swinton's apartment.

109
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,290
(laughter)

110
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,620
This is where the guests sleep.

111
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,460
(laughter)

112
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,710
And this tells them
when it's time to go home.

113
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,620
(laughter)

114
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,250
The next shape that
I want to show you...

115
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,370
is a very basic geometric shape.

116
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,830
It is the harp of time.

117
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,080
Be careful with
the harp of time.

118
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,420
Don't play it too quickly,

119
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,040
or you might end up yesterday.

120
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,210
(laughter)

121
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,620
The next shape that
I need to show you, um...

122
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,170
Oh, this is actually--
this is actually pretty simple.

123
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,710
This is me coming in late
for a meeting

124
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,370
and immediately chiming in.

125
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,880
(laughter)

126
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,620
There's something about this
shape that I should confess,

127
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,790
something that I have
to come clean about.

128
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,460
And that is that this cactus

129
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,580
is not the first occupant
of this vessel.

130
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,120
(laughter)

131
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,210
This vessel used to hold
another cactus,

132
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,580
-but I killed it.
-(laughter)

133
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,790
Turns out a cactus needs
very little water,

134
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,620
sunlight,

135
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,460
and not a lot of shaking
around the apartment.

136
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,620
(laughter)

137
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,620
And now, I have begun to fear

138
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,920
that this new cactus knows

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,040
that seconds before it arrived
into my apartment,

140
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,880
I, with my bare hands,

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,670
excavated the corpse
of his predecessor,

142
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,040
threw it out,
wiped the vessel clean,

143
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,080
and said, "Oh, look,
a new home for you."

144
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,040
(laughter)

145
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,040
And by the way, I can speak
freely in front of this cactus

146
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,170
because he doesn't speak
any English.

147
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,500
(laughter)

148
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,830
But I went through his diary...

149
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,750
(laughter)

150
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,330
...and I found this.
(clears throat)

151
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,500
(ethereal music playing)

152
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,290
"I feel like I have been
here before..."

153
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,580
(male voice speaking Spanish)

154
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,040
Julio:
"Silly Cactus,
we have a show to do."

155
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,880
(laughter)

156
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,790
(cheers and applause)

157
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,330
A fact about me...

158
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,580
is that I--

159
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,540
I wholeheartedly believe...

160
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,420
in reincarnation.

161
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Because I know-- I just know
in my heart that I was

162
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,330
the Trojan guard who
saw the Trojan horse
approach the gates...

163
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,580
(laughter)

164
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,670
...and was like, "Let it in."

165
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,750
(laughter)

166
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,790
"Oh my God, it's a big
fucking beautiful horse!

167
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,420
"Open the gates and let it in.

168
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,420
No questions asked.
I don't care."

169
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,920
(laughter)

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,290
Like any of you would see
a big fucking beautiful horse

171
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,250
come to your apartment
and you wouldn't let it in.

172
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,170
-No questions asked.
-(laughter)

173
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,250
One of my very favorite
TV shows growing up

174
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,000
was The Flintstones.

175
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,460
But there was always
something that I found

176
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,000
a little puzzling
about The Flintstones.

177
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,330
And that is that I would see
so many scenes

178
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,790
with Fred and Barney
hanging out.

179
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,170
And some scenes with
Wilma and Betty hanging out.

180
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,080
And enough scenes
with the couples

181
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,580
just doing their own thing.

182
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,920
But never once in the history
of The Flintstones

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,710
was there a scene
where Fred Flintstone

184
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,080
and his friend's wife
Betty Rubble

185
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,170
had to be alone
in the same room together.

186
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,080
(laughter)

187
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,790
This next scene explores
what it would be like...

188
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,040
(laughter)

189
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,420
if Fred Flintstone
and Betty Rubble

190
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,290
had to be alone
in the same room together

191
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,250
for the first time
in their lives.

192
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,460
(cartoonish music playing)

193
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,540
"Betty Rubble answered the door.

194
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,080
"It was none other
than Fred Flintstone.

195
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,500
"'Oh, hi Fred. Are you
looking for Barney?'"

196
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,420
'"Yeah. Is he around?'"

197
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,880
"'He just stepped out,
but did you wanna--

198
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,790
"'I'm sorry, did you want
to wait inside?'"

199
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,000
"'Oh, so he's not
here right now?'"

200
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,120
"'No, but did you wanna...?'"

201
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,830
"'Right. Um, yeah, sure.'"

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
"Both parties began
to dread the small talk."

203
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,830
"'Oh, I'm sorry, Fred.
No shoes in the house.'"

204
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
(laughter)

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,620
"'Excuse me?'"

206
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,330
"'No shoes in the house.'"

207
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,620
(scoffs)
"'No, I... I heard you,

208
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,920
but literally no one
wears shoes.'"

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,620
(laughter)

210
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,500
"'Seems kind of silly
for that to be a rule.'"

211
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,370
"'Huh, well, I'm sorry
you find me silly, Fred.'"

212
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,920
(laughter)

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,790
"'No, I don't think
you're silly. I think
the rule is silly,

214
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,040
"'because it's not
a problem that you have.

215
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,330
Like, why would you
even say that?'"

216
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,370
"'Okay, Fred. Next time
I wanna say something,

217
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,210
I'll just ask you whether or not
I can say it in my house.'"

218
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,290
(laughter)

219
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,540
(stammering):
"'That is not what I'm saying.'"

220
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,790
"'And now you're raising
your voice.'"

221
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,420
"'I don't think I'm raising
my voice.'"

222
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,080
"'No, you are. You're screaming
at me in my own house, Fred.'"

223
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,420
"'I am not.'"
"'Fred. Fred. Fred...

224
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,540
Why don't we just
change the subject?'"

225
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,790
"The silence was potent.

226
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,290
You could hear
a pterodactyl flying
from miles and miles away."

227
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,370
(laughter)

228
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,790
(sighs)

229
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,830
"Yabba-dabba-doo."

230
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,120
(laughter and applause)

231
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,290
(cartoonish music plays)

232
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,670
So, um...

233
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,500
That little story wasn't so much
about the shapes themselves

234
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,420
as it was about
the negative space...

235
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
(laughter)

236
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,580
...surrounding the shapes.

237
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,420
Um... have you ever seen

238
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,830
the television show
House Hunters  ?

239
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,830
If you haven't seen
House Hunters,

240
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,210
just allow yourself to have
the most passive experience

241
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,540
a human being
could possibly have.

242
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,920
Allow yourself
to just be like...

243
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,250
(laughter)

244
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,960
"Oh, no garage.
He's not gonna like that."

245
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,120
(laughter)

246
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,670
I had a dream
about the television show
House Hunters,

247
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,960
and in this dream
I was a real estate agent

248
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,370
who had to show a client
three different properties.

249
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,250
Except this client was
a little hermit crab,

250
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,710
so I had to show him
three different shells.

251
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,580
The first shell I showed him

252
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,710
was a really good shell,
really good location
right by the shore.

253
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,250
Move-in ready, but definitely
a little over his budget.

254
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,210
The second shell I showed him,
comfortably within his budget,

255
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,830
a bit of a fixer-upper,

256
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,120
a little farther away
from the shore,

257
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,540
but definitely within reason.

258
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,750
And then the third shell
I showed him...

259
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,420
was a ranch-style shell.

260
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,460
(laughter)

261
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,880
Do you remember...

262
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,580
the Disney animated film

263
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,880
The Hunchback of Notre Dame  ?

264
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,750
It wasn't a hit,
but it was there.

265
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,420
It's just sort of what
we got that year.

266
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,420
(laughter)

267
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,120
Sometimes we get lions,
sometimes we get genies,

268
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,830
sometimes we get a tender
Parisian drama for the children.

269
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,040
(laughter)

270
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,500
But a part about that movie
that really, really stayed
with me

271
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,210
was its villain.

272
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,710
This withering,
possibly-closeted,

273
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,960
deeply-troubled little man

274
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,250
named Monsignor Claude Frollo.

275
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,040
And during the peak
of his narrative arc,

276
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,540
Monsignor Claude Frollo sings
into the roaring flames
of the fire

277
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,000
about his lust for
the gypsy girl Esmeralda.

278
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,960
And in that moment,
we see him turn lust

279
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,370
into misogyny,
into essentially genocide.

280
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,330
Anyway, that was
a Happy Meal toy.

281
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,370
(laughter)

282
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,920
(applause)

283
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,370
(laughter)

284
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,000
So, while some children
were playing

285
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,710
with like a Ninja turtle
or a Transformer,

286
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,830
others were like, "Oh, yeah,
mine is this sort of

287
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,120
"like, medieval court justice.

288
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,460
"Uh, he's morally bankrupt.

289
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,790
"Uh, there's a lot
of self-hate in him.

290
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,460
"And that combined with power
just makes him lash out

291
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,830
"in really toxic and scary ways.

292
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,500
And sometimes, I don't know,
I put him in a little car."

293
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,920
(laughter)

294
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,500
Um, my favorite color is clear.

295
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,330
(laughter)

296
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,000
I love the color clear.

297
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,210
And I distinctly
remember the moment

298
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,540
where I was confronted for
my love with the color clear.

299
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,170
That was when I saw for
the very first time in my life

300
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,920
Cinderella's pretty little feet

301
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,620
go into that glass slipper.

302
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,540
When I saw that,
I was like,

303
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,000
"What is that?"

304
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,420
(laughter)

305
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,540
"Mother, let's rewind."

306
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,920
(laughter)

307
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,420
And she'd be like,
"Rewind to what?"

308
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,330
I'm like, "You know to what."

309
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,670
(laughter)

310
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,370
"Show me the shoe."

311
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,880
(laughter)

312
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,170
But something that I've been
thinking a lot about recently,

313
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,080
and it didn't hit me
until a few days ago--

314
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,500
Okay, remember that scene
in Cinderella

315
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,420
where she has to rush out of
the ball because it's midnight,

316
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,080
and she leaves behind
the glass slipper.

317
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,750
Then the prince finds the shoe,

318
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,960
and this is all
he has left of her.

319
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,120
But presumably there's a scene
where the prince takes the shoe,

320
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,500
and he goes to his subjects
and he goes,

321
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,540
"Have every maiden
in the kingdom try this on

322
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,460
until you find the girl
I met at the ball."

323
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,920
But I bet they were like...

324
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,170
-"Or..."
-(laughter)

325
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,710
"You could just come with us
and look at their faces."

326
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,880
(laughter)

327
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,080
And the prince was
probably like,

328
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,790
(scoffs)

329
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,370
"Okay, but how would
we use the shoe?

330
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,210
(laughter)

331
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,920
Just because you have a tool
doesn't mean you have to use it.

332
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,460
(laughter and applause)

333
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,330
I don't know if you can tell,

334
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,670
but as a child I really loved
playing with toys.

335
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,670
This might have been
something that maybe
would've hit you tomorrow,

336
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,670
-but I'm telling you now.
-(laughter)

337
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,330
My happiest moments
were really just

338
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,920
me by myself in my room playing.

339
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,830
And something that would
happen sometimes is that

340
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,210
we had this dog
who... I was so-so on.

341
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,830
-And it was mutual.
-(laughter)

342
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,330
And this dog-- this puppy
at this time--

343
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,170
would chew on some of my toys.

344
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,880
And I would come back
and find them disfigured.

345
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,710
Whenever that happened,

346
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,960
my mother would
rush to the store

347
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,420
and find the exact same one.

348
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,080
And then I would
perform a little ritual...

349
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,210
that I, in my head,
called the "transference."

350
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,580
(laughter)

351
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:50,210
Where I would take the soul
of my old friend...

352
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,500
(laughter)

353
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,960
...and whoosh it away
from its body

354
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,420
and deposit it
onto its new vessel.

355
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,000
And then I'd be like,
"Great! I can play again."

356
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,120
(laughter)

357
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,580
(applause)

358
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,620
My parents really did
encourage me...

359
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,580
to just truly believe that like
anything was possible,

360
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,670
which I think that
that was connected

361
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,830
to just, like, me being
in my little room, like,

362
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,670
pretending to be
different things.

363
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,290
But that encouragement really,
really, really backfired

364
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,790
when I told them that I wanted
to move to the United States

365
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,580
to pursue... uh, this.

366
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,670
(laughter)

367
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,830
And now we go
on a little journey.

368
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,460
-(visor chimes)
-(laughter)

369
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,040
(laughter)

370
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,830
Follow me.

371
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,040
(cheering and applause)

372
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,040
Something fun about these

373
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,920
is that these aren't
so much video glasses

374
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,790
because they have
a slight delay.

375
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,830
So, they're not
so much video glasses

376
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,170
as they are a window...

377
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,330
-into the past.
-(laughter)

378
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,290
And why does
he wear them you ask.

379
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,290
Well, because
if I didn't wear them,

380
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,290
how would you know what
happened from there to here?

381
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,920
(laughter)

382
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,250
-How am I ever gonna know?
-(laughter)

383
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,330
But now I'm here.

384
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,000
I have traveled. Hello.

385
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,540
(applause)

386
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:46,000
I will now very abruptly
do some impressions at you.

387
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,710
(laughter)

388
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,830
Okay.

389
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,750
Here's the first one.
(clears throat)

390
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,170
"Do not rush me!

391
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,120
The water will be ready
when it's ready!"

392
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,080
-(laughter)
-That is...

393
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,580
-a Brita filter.
-(laughter)

394
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,540
You know, Brita filters,
they're not...

395
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,830
they're not seamstresses,
they're designers.

396
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,040
You need to give them time
to do what they do.

397
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,620
And often you'll come back and
be like, "Well, is it ready?"

398
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,170
And it's like, "No,
you gotta let an artist
do what an artist does."

399
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,290
(laughter)

400
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,920
Okay, here's another one.
(clears throat)

401
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,790
(scoffs)
"Okay, well, I'm sorry
if you don't like what I do,

402
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,620
"and I'm sorry if you don't
like what I stand for.

403
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,790
"But I actually
keep the economy going,
and my job is pretty important.

404
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,420
"I'm sorry if you
can't handle that,
but we live in

405
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,710
a nation of laws,
and rules are rules.

406
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,880
I'm sorry if you
can't handle that."

407
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,670
-That is...
-(laughter)

408
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,170
That nasty little curtain that
divides first class from coach.

409
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,000
(laughter)

410
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,170
And look, I understand
that it's a job

411
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,370
and that some curtain
has to do it.

412
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,250
But to be a curtain and pick
that as your curtain job,

413
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,250
it's like, "Who are you? Why?"

414
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,830
(laughter)

415
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,080
And I bet that if you were
to talk to this curtain,

416
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,880
the curtain would be like,
"Well, you know, I wanted
to be in theater,

417
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,330
but things don't
always work out."

418
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,170
(laughter)

419
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:33,210
But at least that curtain is
sort of serving a purpose

420
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,000
that I don't fully agree with,
but it is doing something.

421
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,750
To me, though,
the most utterly psychotic

422
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,420
of all the curtains
in the world...

423
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,750
are the curtains that are hung
in a basement...

424
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,620
as to give the illusion
of a window.

425
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,330
(laughter)

426
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,620
Curtains that tell you,

427
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,370
"Well, we don't know.
There might be a window."

428
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,290
But it's like, "No, we know."

429
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,580
(laughter)

430
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,210
"What are you doing?"

431
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
That is religion right there.

432
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,040
(laughter and applause)

433
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,500
It's just this
whole thing of like,

434
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,500
"Well, you know, actually
there might be something."

435
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,000
It's like, "There isn't."

436
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,290
(laughter)

437
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,170
And as soon as
we acknowledge that,

438
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,120
we can live a happy life
and move on.

439
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,120
(cheering and applause)

440
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,920
But going back to the curtain
that divides first class
from coach,

441
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,460
I was on this flight,
not long ago,

442
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,880
and it was
a very small airplane.

443
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
You could tell that
it had been remodeled

444
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,670
so as to accommodate
first class,

445
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,370
that the original design
of the airplane

446
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,920
had only coach seats.

447
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,330
But when they built
in the first class,

448
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,420
they left one flaw,

449
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,540
which is that the first
row of coach seats,

450
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,080
the second seat
on that first row

451
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:05,880
didn't have a first-class seat
directly in front of it.

452
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,370
But it actually had the hallway.

453
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,750
I was sitting on that seat.

454
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,210
And when the flight
attendant came over

455
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,580
and she drew the curtain
dividing the people,

456
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,540
the curtain fell right
in front of my face,

457
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,880
like I was this little secret
for first class.

458
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,170
And when it crossed my legs,
my knee gently caressed
the curtain,

459
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,040
causing it to fall.

460
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,540
(laughter)

461
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,460
So, then the flight
attendant came over

462
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,250
and reattached
the curtain very quickly.

463
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,210
And then I said, "The curtain's
just gonna fall all over again

464
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,750
"the second I make
the slightest movement.

465
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,250
Can you please not put it up?"

466
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,960
And then she goes...

467
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,580
-"No, we-- we have to."
-(laughter)

468
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,920
And I'm like, "Well, okay,
but I'm just gonna make
the slightest movement again,

469
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,710
"and the curtain's just gonna
fall all over again.

470
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,750
Can we please not put it up?"

471
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,000
And she goes,
"No, we have to."

472
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,880
(laughter)

473
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,000
And then I asked...

474
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,880
-"Why?"
-(laughter)

475
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,540
And in her eye...

476
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,420
I saw flowers blooming,
meteors falling,

477
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,120
and animals decomposing.

478
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,750
(laughter)

479
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,750
And suddenly, she was free.

480
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,580
(laughter)

481
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,710
-She had been released.
-(cheering and applause)

482
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,670
These next shapes
I'm so excited to show you.

483
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,080
(laughter)

484
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,460
So, I went to the zoo recently,

485
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,330
and I was very underwhelmed
by the silhouettes

486
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,370
-that I saw at the zoo.
-(laughter)

487
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,960
It just felt like
more of the same,

488
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,960
like all these animals
I've seen before.

489
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,460
So, I am going
to present this zoo

490
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,790
with ideas for new animals
for them to make.

491
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,620
(laughter)

492
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,580
The first idea is how about...

493
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,370
a swan with a neck so, so long

494
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,420
that he must drag
his head behind him.

495
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,170
(laughter)

496
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,120
Beauty is a curse.

497
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,500
(laughter)

498
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,920
And this swan knows that
very, very well.

499
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,330
Or how about a flamingo
that's like,

500
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,080
"You know what?
I'm just gonna use both legs."

501
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,040
(laughter)

502
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,830
Or a platypus that's like,

503
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,670
"Bisexuality is real,
and so am I."

504
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,540
(laughter)

505
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,210
Or how about a little porcupine
who removed all of his quills

506
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,120
so as not to hurt
his non-porcupine lover?

507
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,040
And now he looks
at his reflection

508
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,460
and can no longer
recognize himself.

509
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,710
(laughter)

510
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,370
These are all Happy Meal toys,
too, by the way.

511
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,500
(laughter)

512
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,040
So, some kids
are gonna be like,

513
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,370
"Oh, yeah, I got
the porcupine that compromised

514
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
to the extent where now he can't
even recognize himself."

515
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,710
And another kid's
gonna be like,

516
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,290
"Oh, I got the snake who's like

517
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,960
addicted to buying shoes online,
even though she can't wear them,

518
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,210
and at first it's kind of funny,
but then it gets really sad.

519
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,460
(laughter)

520
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,420
And lastly, how about a clam

521
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,790
who is way in over his head

522
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,420
because he misrepresented
himself at a job interview

523
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,250
-as an oyster.
-(laughter)

524
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,920
So, now the clam is at work,
and the boss is like,

525
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,370
"Great! We'll just need a pearl
by the end of the day."

526
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,540
(laughter)

527
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,580
And the clam is like, "I...

528
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,540
-Yeah, okay."
-(laughter)

529
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,580
"Mm-hmm."
"One? One round?"

530
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,250
"Yeah, just go back
to your computer

531
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,330
and, uh, make the pearl."

532
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,830
"And how do you-- oh, no,
I know how to do it.

533
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,210
Got it."
"Okay, great."

534
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,790
(laughter)

535
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,460
And for this presentation
for the zoo, by the way,

536
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,460
I am very well-prepared

537
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,000
because I have also made...

538
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,420
their shadows and their souls.

539
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,540
(laughter)

540
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,540
-Because I don't want
the zoo to say...
-(applause)

541
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,750
"Oh, these are great,
but I have no idea

542
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,790
what their shadows
or their souls would be like."

543
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,290
And I was like,
"Well, I'm not crazy.

544
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,540
-I make them."
-(laughter)

545
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,000
I really feel
a connection to that clam,

546
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,460
because I've tried to take
so many jobs here in America

547
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:48,210
just wildly misrepresenting
what I could or could not do.

548
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,920
Because I was
just so desperate

549
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,960
to stay here
and get a work visa.

550
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,370
And there was this one
job interview that I went to,

551
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,920
but then the job interview
was going bad

552
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,170
because the interview
is for sales.

553
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,420
And I'm saying things like,

554
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,040
"Well, you know,
I've bought things before,

555
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,540
"so doing the opposite
would be fun...

556
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,880
-(laughter)
-...for me."

557
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,330
And then there's this long, long
silence at the job interview.

558
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,830
And I'm panicking
and I'm thinking,

559
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,330
I-- I need to get some job.

560
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,170
I need to get something.

561
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,920
'Cause if I don't,
it's just gonna cause

562
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,790
this domino effect that
I can't think about.

563
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
I have to get
this woman to like me.

564
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,420
I have to get her to like me.

565
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,830
I have to say something
that will turn it around.

566
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,670
And then, I look at her,
straight in the eye,

567
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,620
and out of nowhere I say...

568
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,540
"I love corporations."

569
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,080
(laughter)

570
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,040
That is by far the darkest thing
I have ever said in my life.

571
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,830
(laughter)

572
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,210
And it haunts me.

573
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,710
It haunts me to this very day.

574
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,290
(laughter)

575
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,540
But, you know,
it all worked out at the end,

576
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:10,290
because I didn't get
any of those jobs.

577
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,920
But I ended up getting a visa

578
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,880
that claims I'm an alien
of extraordinary ability.

579
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,370
-(cheers and applause)
-The ability includes this.

580
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,710
-(ethereal music playing)
-(laughter)

581
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,330
(Julio chuckles)

582
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,250
That's for me.

583
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,500
(laughter and applause)

584
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,750
A problem that I often face
is that I'll sit down

585
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,960
and try to write and try
to come up with things to say

586
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,420
and try to come up
with material.

587
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,290
But something that has been
happening to me a lot

588
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,960
is that I'll sit down,
wanting to write

589
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,750
and then I'll end up
accidentally just
fully-sketching

590
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,750
another gorgeous
bridal collection.

591
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,830
(laughter)

592
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,080
Because I have never
in my life seen

593
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,330
a wedding dress
that I actually liked.

594
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,880
So I sit down and I'm like,
"Well, maybe it's a pant."

595
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,920
And then I have to be like,
"No, Julio, this is not
your problem."

596
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,250
(laughter)

597
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,880
This is somebody else's
cross to bear.

598
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,790
However, though,
there is a garment

599
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,040
that I've been
meaning to design.

600
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,830
It's not a wedding dress,
but how about...

601
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:27,460
a cape for a queen
that is so, so long

602
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,620
that she doesn't know there's
another queen at the end of it.

603
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,830
(laughter)

604
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,790
But the cape has
to be so, so long

605
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,120
that they have no idea.

606
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,210
Except every now and then,
they feel a little tug,

607
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,670
and they might wonder what it is
or they might ignore it,

608
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:53,880
but then the curious queen will
be the one who turns around,

609
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,250
follows the cape,
and changes her life forever.

610
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,000
There are two kinds
of queens in this world:

611
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,540
the queen that follows the cape
and the queen that does not.

612
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,670
I made that up right now.
(poofs) I have returned.

613
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,120
(laughter and applause)

614
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,420
I have often been called
"too niche."

615
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,000
-(laughter)
-To which I'll say,

616
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:33,000
I have no idea what you could
possibly be talking about.

617
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,420
(laughter)

618
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,880
I have purchased chairs
for all of my crystals.

619
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,880
(laughter)

620
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,040
Because I don't know
if crystals actually work,

621
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,920
but, just in case,

622
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,960
I got them all chairs
and little desks.

623
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,620
(laughter)

624
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,670
So, they don't have an excuse.

625
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,710
(laughter)

626
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:01,170
(chuckles)
I'm just a little alien

627
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,880
playing with my toys,

628
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,540
but this time
to a captive audience.

629
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,000
(laughter)

630
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,790
Um, as a child,
I distinctly remember

631
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,080
learning how to write.

632
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:18,920
And I distinctly remember
learning how to write
the letter E,

633
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,080
because me and the Es

634
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:27,170
became this ongoing
parent-teacher conference saga.

635
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,750
Where-- okay, you know
what an E is, right?

636
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,250
You've seen an E before?

637
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,620
But when I would watch
the teacher write the letter E,

638
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,290
I'd be like, okay,
I see what she did.

639
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,460
She created the frame,

640
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,620
which are sort of the rules
that we must respect

641
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,540
in order to live in a society.

642
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,750
But within those boundaries,
she drew in a little stick.

643
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,960
And I was like, okay,

644
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,580
but what if I--

645
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,460
I mean, could I just maybe...?

646
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,710
(laughter)

647
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,540
So, I would treat Es
on a case-by-case basis.

648
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,790
(laughter)

649
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,290
I'd be writing and I'd be like,

650
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,540
oh, this one wants two,
this one wants five.

651
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:21,080
Oh, this one's 18,
this one feels like it wants 18.

652
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,040
And my teacher was like,

653
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,170
"Okay, Julio,
that's really interesting,

654
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,420
but you gotta write an E
and move on."

655
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,540
Or, you know, "You can't have
a sentence like,

656
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,290
(speaking Spanish)

657
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,330
It'd be ten days
of labor for you."

658
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,620
(laughter)

659
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,040
And you know what?
I get it, I...

660
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,370
I understand how you live
in the real world,

661
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,000
and I understand that sometimes
a thing is just a thing

662
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,330
and you have to move on,

663
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,750
and you just gotta
see it for what it is.

664
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,210
But frankly-- I'm sorry--
but that is the kind of thinking

665
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,120
that got that man elected.

666
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,080
(laughter)

667
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,000
(applause)

668
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:07,670
My least, least favorite shape

669
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,710
is someone telling me,
"It is what it is."

670
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,210
(laughter)

671
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,170
This is Helena Bonham Carter.

672
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,790
(laughter)

673
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,830
Shakira.

674
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,000
(laughter)

675
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,920
And this...

676
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,620
Oh, where are you going?

677
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,120
No! No, no, no, no, no.

678
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,620
Come here.
(sighs) So delicate.

679
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,880
You know, it's because
he is so beautiful

680
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,620
that he can get away
with being so shy.

681
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,540
Because he knows
that no matter what,
the camera will love him.

682
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,330
It's like, shh, shh!
So shy!

683
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,420
Anyway, this is
Timothée Chalamet.

684
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,000
(laughter)

685
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,790
Timothée doesn't want to be
in the show right now. Okay.

686
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:06,170
Have you ever met someone
who is so young

687
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,750
and so attractive
and so confident

688
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,120
but so utterly clueless about
the way the world works?

689
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,210
But because they're so young,
so confident, and so attractive,

690
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,500
you just know that the world
will just be handed to them?

691
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,580
(sighs)
This is Josh.

692
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,500
(laughter)

693
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,540
The confidence at his age
is like... how?

694
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,040
(laughter)

695
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,620
Josh came up to me after a show,
and he was like, "Hey,

696
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,330
"you know, just so you know,
I really like what you're doing

697
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,290
and I'd love to get involved
in any way that I can."

698
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,960
And I'm thinking,
I have nothing to offer you.

699
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,960
(laughter)

700
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,420
But anyway,
he's my social media intern now.

701
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,830
(laughter)

702
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,460
It's like, okay,
I don't know why,

703
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,290
but I feel compelled
to give you things.

704
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,790
(laughter)

705
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,040
Um...

706
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,370
This is Rob.

707
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,370
Rob is my immigration attorney.

708
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,540
(laughter)

709
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:19,000
And this right here,
this is Dylan Cabrera.

710
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,620
Uh, Dylan works in--

711
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,170
I always forget.
Merchandising, I think,

712
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,670
the last time we spoke.

713
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,670
And Dylan and Rob,
they're a couple.

714
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,750
Uh, they live...

715
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,580
in this gorgeous, gigantic loft

716
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,670
-in Tribeca.
-(laughter)

717
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:41,120
Uh, because I think
Dylan comes from money.

718
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,250
Uh, it's just one
of those things

719
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,500
where you walk into the loft
and you're like,

720
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,080
okay, so you're
an immigration attorney

721
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,880
and you do
merchandising sometimes.

722
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,920
-And the loft happens how?
-(laughter)

723
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,500
Um...

724
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,920
But we don't ask
questions, but, uh...

725
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,040
I don't know if you can see,
but Dylan here,

726
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,830
he doesn't have much of a beak.

727
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,750
And that's because he had a very
large, very prominent beak,

728
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,040
that he was a little
self-conscious about,

729
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,120
so he got it removed.

730
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,790
When he came back to the loft
that night after the surgery,

731
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,420
Rob was there,
and Dylan was like,

732
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,790
"Well? What do you think?"

733
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,500
(laughter)

734
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,330
And Rob was like...

735
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,620
"No, I like it..."

736
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,960
(laughter)

737
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,500
And Dylan was like,
"No, you like it?"

738
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,670
And Rob was like, "Well...

739
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,370
I mean, I don't know. Your--

740
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,620
Your beak was big,

741
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,000
but your beak was...
it was you.

742
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,250
And Dylan is like,
"Exactly! My beak was me,

743
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,080
"my beak was a part of my body,
so I don't feel like you can

744
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,080
just walk into a room and police
what I do with my body.

745
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,080
-And Rob is like, "Sweetie..."
-(laughter)

746
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,210
"Sweetie, I love you
the old way,

747
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,880
"I love you the new way.

748
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,420
Let's just go to bed."

749
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,000
(laughter)

750
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,420
Anyway, they're engaged.

751
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,710
(laughter)

752
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,830
So, um, good luck
with all of that.

753
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,000
This is...

754
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,420
Jessica.

755
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,370
(laughter)

756
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,420
Jessica is from L.A.

757
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,790
(laughter)

758
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,620
-Jessica works in P.R.
-(laughter)

759
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:37,290
Jessica begins and ends
every single e-mail with ASAP.

760
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,960
(laughter)

761
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,170
-Everything is ASAP.
-(laughter)

762
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,210
Um...

763
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,920
And, wait, hold on.
I'm sorry.

764
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,120
If I can just go
back to the whole...

765
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,920
Dylan and Rob mess for a second.

766
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,880
(laughter)

767
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,000
And that is, that with all
the conflicts that they have

768
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,120
and all the baggage
that you can feel

769
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,830
and the toxicity that's
between them as a couple,

770
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,830
they met this young,
beautiful thing right here.

771
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,580
-(laughter)
-His name is Tristan,
of course.

772
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,750
And now they brought him
into their relationship,

773
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,330
so there's this
"polyamorii" triad thing.

774
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,080
And it's like, great,
you know what?

775
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,710
2019, you do you.

776
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,000
But also, he's 22.

777
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,920
(laughter)

778
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,830
You know what? Whatever.
We're all gonna be there
at the wedding,

779
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,920
and none of us are gonna say
a damn thing about anything.

780
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,540
(laughter)

781
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,670
I should preface this
by saying...

782
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,370
that I have nothing but love
for all of my shapes.

783
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,580
I-- and I mean it.

784
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:59,210
(sighs)
But there is just something
about this shape...

785
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:04,080
and I can't quite put
my finger on it.

786
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,880
But every time I see it...

787
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,620
(laughter)

788
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,880
I'm just like, no.

789
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,370
(laughter)

790
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,620
No.

791
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,960
Just like, absolutely not.

792
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,080
(laughter)

793
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,170
His name is Eric.

794
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,420
He's very sweet
and he means well,

795
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,120
but I don't--
like, some--

796
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,000
like, every group has
the one, I guess.

797
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,620
And like, sometimes
my shapes and I after a show,

798
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,370
we like grab a drink
and we're having fun.

799
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,250
And then I'm like having
a glass of wine,

800
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,620
and then I turn around
and it's like...

801
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,830
"Hey."

802
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,880
(laughter)

803
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,620
And I'm like, "Hey, Eric.

804
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,210
How's your night going?"

805
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,250
He's like, "I'm sorry, what?"

806
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,170
It's like, "How's your--
don't make me--

807
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,830
like, I don't know!"

808
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,080
(laughter)

809
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,750
But you know, Eric,

810
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,670
even though all of it, I...

811
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,040
I do have a lot of love for him,

812
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:10,250
because it is thanks to Eric
that I have met a true star.

813
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,210
(laughter)

814
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:16,420
The second I saw her,
I thought...

815
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,290
Game over.

816
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,710
(laughter)

817
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:26,080
The star power is palpable
and it fills up the room.

818
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:32,710
-(drumroll)
-Please allow me
to introduce...

819
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,210
Krisha.

820
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,370
(laughter)

821
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:46,710
(applause and cheering)

822
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,620
Now, let's introduce her again,
but in the very same way

823
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,670
that Kate Winslet was
introduced in Titanic  .

824
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:00,620
-(flute music playing)
-When Kate laid eyes on the boat
for the very first time.

825
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,880
(laughter and applause)

826
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,500
-Krisha.
-(laughter)

827
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,960
I obviously adore Krisha.

828
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,830
And I like her so much that I am
helping her with a TV show.

829
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,120
(laughter)

830
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,710
And this TV show would be
semi-autobiographical,

831
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,170
and it would follow
Krisha's journey,

832
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,920
beginning with getting
cheated on in the D.R.

833
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,920
Deciding that she's
had it with that man,

834
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,370
she packs her bags
and she moves to Miami

835
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,500
to pursue her passion
of fashion.

836
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,330
-(laughter)
-But is the Miami market
ready for little dresses

837
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,540
that are actually
to Krisha's size?

838
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,710
(laughter)

839
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,710
We'll find out in the show
as Krisha juggles love,

840
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:02,290
relationships, fashion,
and her faith.

841
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,290
(laughter)

842
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:08,500
Krisha's faith was not
originally a part
of the concept,

843
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,120
and, frankly, some of the rants
get a little dicey.

844
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,080
Some of the rants, I'm like,
okay, but you know that...

845
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,370
You know that I am, right?

846
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,580
And you also know that the guy
who did your makeup is--

847
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,330
okay, well, I love you anyway.

848
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,290
The title of the show you ask.

849
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,920
Mundo de Krisha.

850
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,670
(laughter)

851
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,670
Oh my God.

852
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,500
This next shape...

853
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,040
might be my favorite part
of this entire show.

854
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,710
Might be the reason why this
show even exists to begin with.

855
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,290
I shudder to think
what would happen

856
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:57,420
if this shape were to fall
in the wrong hands.

857
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,370
(laughter)

858
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,000
If you have never seen one
of these in action before...

859
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,710
-get ready.
-(laughter)

860
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,710
One, two...

861
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,210
(toy squeaking)

862
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,710
(laughter)

863
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,830
(laughter)

864
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,880
We rehearsed this.

865
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,080
(laughter)

866
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,500
And then I get here
and I'm like, "Do you guys
wanna run it?"

867
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,080
They're like, "No, we got it.
Uh-uh, uh-uh..."

868
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,580
Regardless...

869
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,880
I've got nothing--
nothing but love

870
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,290
for the penguins
and their world.

871
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,210
But especially
this one right here.

872
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,120
That blue one in the middle.

873
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,460
I love him so much
that he's inspired

874
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,830
a little something
I'm about to read to you.

875
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,670
(laughter)

876
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,210
(clears throat)

877
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,580
-(piano music playing)
-"The blue penguin loved being

878
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,370
"a part of the playful
penguin race

879
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,880
more than anything else
in the world."

880
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,620
Male voice:
The excitement of going
up the stairs,

881
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,290
down the loops,

882
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,420
and maybe, just maybe

883
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,250
winning one day
was all I had.

884
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,960
But everything changed
the day I realized

885
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,080
I was racing on a preset track.

886
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,670
The black penguin ahead of me,

887
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:40,290
the red one behind me,

888
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,620
and nothing
I could do about it.

889
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:48,880
The game was designed so I'd
come in second place forever.

890
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,540
The black penguin
celebrated his victories

891
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,750
as though they were his own.

892
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,540
The red thought he just
wasn't trying hard enough.

893
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,670
And so I was
suddenly all alone

894
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,370
in this deeply
solitary awakening.

895
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,370
That was the day that
the playful penguin race...

896
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,080
-(lightning crashes)
- ...became hell.

897
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,960
(laughter)

898
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,210
So, really the toy is
more of an allegory

899
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,710
for the middle class, I guess.

900
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,000
(laughter)

901
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:25,960
This next shape...

902
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,500
(laughter)

903
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,620
He's making fun of me.

904
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:47,580
(laughter and applause)

905
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,000
He's making fun of me.

906
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,960
That's a big swing
for someone you barely know.

907
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,210
(laughter)

908
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,670
Ha-ha, I guess.

909
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,620
My very, very favorite

910
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:12,120
cartoon character, though,
growing up, my hero

911
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,080
was Daisy Duck.

912
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,750
(laughter)

913
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,790
Daisy Duck, of course,

914
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,620
being the supporting actress
of the Mickey gang.

915
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:22,790
Right? She didn't get
a lot of screen time,

916
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,580
but when she did,
she earned it.

917
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,080
(laughter)

918
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,250
My parents took me
to Disney World one time.

919
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,500
And to me, it was
just a pilgrimage

920
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,370
to finally meet Daisy.

921
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,040
And we go into the park,
and we see Mickey's house.

922
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,790
And we go inside of it
and I greet Mickey,

923
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,210
and I'm like,
"Okay, we'll wrap it up

924
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,580
-'cause we're going
to Daisy's."
-(laughter)

925
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,500
And then we go into Donald's,
and Donald is there.

926
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,000
And he greets me,
he greets my family.

927
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,580
It's like, "This is very nice.
Thank you for having us,

928
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:52,120
but we're running late.
I'm going to Daisy's."

929
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:58,080
And then I see Daisy's door.

930
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,420
And I am so, so excited
that it's finally gonna happen.

931
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,170
And I walk over to the door,

932
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,250
and I see the big,
beautiful, bulbous doorknob.

933
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,250
And I reach towards it,

934
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,120
and I twist,

935
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,080
and then I pull.

936
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,580
But the door won't open.

937
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:24,370
I pull and I pull and I pull,
but the door just won't open.

938
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,540
So, then I look at my mother,
just panicking

939
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,370
because the door
is not opening.

940
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,210
And then she explains to me

941
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,170
that it was all just a facade.

942
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,370
In that moment,
I became an atheist.

943
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,540
(laughter)

944
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,670
She released me.

945
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:45,040
(laughter)

946
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,250
-(applause)
-And I-- I understand.

947
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,920
Look, I'm not crazy.

948
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,460
-(laughter)
-I understand that the park
has to end at some point.

949
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,210
I understand that
it can't be infinite,

950
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,580
and I understand that maybe
there wasn't enough budget

951
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,790
to build the home
for a pretty minor--

952
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,540
-even though iconic--
character.
-(laughter)

953
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,540
I get all of that.

954
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:09,580
But I feel like they were
operating under the notion

955
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,750
that the world is
actually pretty simple,

956
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,420
so we might as well
just lie to a kid

957
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,710
with a door
that goes nowhere.

958
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:15,920
(laughter)

959
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,830
If I had designed the park,

960
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:24,880
I would've created a miniature
interior of Daisy's house

961
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,790
and put it behind
the little keyhole.

962
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,620
So that when the bizarre little
child comes up to the door...

963
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,040
(laughter)

964
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,080
...and looks
through the keyhole,

965
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,460
they'll feel that even though

966
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,420
they don't have complete
access to everything yet,

967
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:47,460
and even though you can't
see everything all at once,

968
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:53,210
there is something so beautiful
just out of reach.

969
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:59,080
-This is all in an e-mail
I've sent to them several times.
-(laughter)

970
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:02,000
-But I keep waiting...
-(applause)

971
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,120
...for them to reply
one of these days.

972
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:06,710
'Cause I'm like, "Hey, just
checking in on Daisy's door."

973
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,290
(laughter)

974
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,120
Of course, what was
frustrating about Daisy's door

975
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:17,710
is because something
was presented as just that
and nothing more.

976
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:22,080
The world was explained to me
by oversimplifying it.

977
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,420
But I don't like simple.

978
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,750
(laughter)

979
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,040
I'm sorry, what is that,
you're wondering.

980
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,960
This is
a stiletto-shaped display

981
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,420
for a miniature
stiletto collection.

982
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,170
(laughter)

983
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,880
-I feel seen by this object.
-(laughter)

984
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,500
Note that none of the shoes
involved are to scale.

985
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,830
(laughter)

986
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,790
This is what I feel like
when somebody casually asks,

987
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,120
"So, what do you do?"
And I'm like, "Oh, well,

988
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,540
"it's actually pretty simple.

989
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:08,420
"I'm just like a big shoe
that is for little shoes.

990
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,670
"And I do have a purpose

991
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,420
"if you have a miniature
shoe collection

992
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,790
"that you want displayed
in a bigger shoe.

993
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,370
"So, yeah, a visa for that.

994
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,500
"That's, uh, sort of what
I bring to the table.

995
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,210
Yeah, pretty-pretty-pretty
straightforward actually.

996
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,120
(laughter)

997
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,790
Now I'll read to you a little
monologue by the shoe.

998
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,920
(laughter)

999
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,500
"Who am I even for?"

1000
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,330
(saxophone playing
melancholy melody)

1001
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,370
Female voice:
Am I for the little shoes?

1002
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,500
Or are the little shoes for me?

1003
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,500
I am an idea on top of an idea.

1004
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:50,670
Look at the little shoes
marching down to my toe.

1005
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:55,040
If I'm alive, are they?

1006
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,330
I am what happens
when no one says no.

1007
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:04,040
I sit by the window
and watch other shoes go by,

1008
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:09,040
real shoes, with real lives,
with real purpose.

1009
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,500
Have you seen that show

1010
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,620
The Assassination
of Gianni Versace,

1011
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,960
where Penelope Cruz, a Spanish
actress with a Spanish accent,

1012
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,620
played an Italian
but does it all in English?

1013
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,540
I am that.

1014
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,710
I'm complicated.

1015
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:30,710
I'm difficult to explain
and impossible to draw.

1016
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,710
"I am alive."

1017
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:38,540
(applause)

1018
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:45,710
And now, our next shape...

1019
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,620
What? What do you want?

1020
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,170
I already dealt with you.

1021
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,750
I guess that's it.

1022
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,920
I have no control over
how many shapes are back there.

1023
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,880
(laughter)

1024
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:05,460
But what do you...?
Ah, yes, yes, I see.

1025
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,750
-(laughter)
-Look what you've been
hiding all along.

1026
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,880
-(pastoral music playing)
-(birds twittering)

1027
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:17,080
(high-heels clicking)

1028
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,170
Julio:
Unless there are
any questions...

1029
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,880
(laughter)

1030
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,170
I think we're done here.

1031
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,250
Thank you so much for coming.

1032
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:27,000
Good night. Bye.

1033
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,250
(cheering and applause)

1034
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,080
(ethereal music playing)

1035
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,250
(cheers and applause continuing)
