1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,923
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,095
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,263
Fifteen?

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,975
Your personal best!

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,729
Where were you?

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,813
On a date.

7
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,733
I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,986
- Which museum?
- How'd you meet her?

9
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,781
No. Answer his.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,200
We were at the back of the train.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,787
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me...

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,999
...if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,670
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,256
I'm late because
she lives in Poughkeepsie.

15
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,884
She seems great,
but she's two and a half hours away.

16
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:55,472
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie?

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,850
That joke would have killed
in Albany.

18
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,562
Done! I did it.

19
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,232
Who's stupid now?

20
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,320
The One with the
Girl From Poughkeepsie

21
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,743
Look! They're lighting
the big Christmas tree tonight.

22
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,455
That paper is two weeks old.

23
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,126
Who keeps leaving old newspapers
in the trash?

24
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,839
I really wanted
to take Kathy to this.

25
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,592
At least you have somebody
to miss stuff with.

26
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,844
I hate being alone
this time of year.

27
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,013
Next it's Valentine's Day...

28
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,182
...then my birthday, then bang!

29
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,186
Then they're lighting
that damn tree again.

30
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,440
I want somebody!

31
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,154
You know, I want a man!

32
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:41,745
It doesn't even have to be
a big relationship. Just a fling!

33
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,081
I didn't think girls ever
just wanted a fling.

34
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:50,462
Let me tell you, it's been
a long time since I've been flung.

35
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,507
I know what I'm giving you
for Christmas.

36
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,722
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?

37
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:05,102
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?

38
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,230
I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,403
I no longer go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.

40
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:16,947
No accountants.

41
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,492
And no one from "legal".
I don't like boring jobs.

42
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:25,830
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?

43
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,835
What's wrong, Mon?

44
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,379
Everybody at work still hates me.

45
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,797
I was making headway.

46
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,175
Everyone was smiling at me,
and then I get off work...

47
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:42,181
...and find out they wrote this
on my chef's hat.

48
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,980
Maybe they meant to write
"Quiet, Bitch."

49
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,485
What's the matter?

50
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,198
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

51
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,035
I haven't been picked on this much
since kindergarten.

52
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:09,583
And they brought in someone from
junior high to do the see-saw with me.

53
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:17,007
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.

54
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,551
But I've waited for this
my whole life.

55
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,680
Wait, you're the boss.
Yell at them. Or fire them!

56
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:28,269
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.

57
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,770
You know what you can do?

58
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,273
I read about this director,
Orson Welles...

59
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:37,486
...who, at the beginning, would
hire somebody just to fire them.

60
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,949
Then they would all know who was boss.

61
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:46,328
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?

62
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,415
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?

63
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,209
Good enough to get fired.

64
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,754
All right. You're hired!

65
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:03,261
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?

66
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,405
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?

67
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,908
I'm not asking for me.

68
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,244
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.

69
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,413
I'm not gay.

70
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,623
I didn't think you were gay.

71
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,877
I do now.

72
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,839
My friend, Rachel,
wants to be set up.

73
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,508
I just got out of
a big relationship.

74
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,677
I'm not looking to get serious.

75
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,222
That's okay. A fling
might be all right with her.

76
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:52,018
Is this "Hot Rachel" that
you took to the Christmas Party?

77
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,022
By the way, that is her full name.

78
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,899
Wow! I'm free for her.

79
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,361
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.

80
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,988
Let's talk it over
at the Ranger game.

81
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,032
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.

82
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,453
I'll bring them
by your office at five.

83
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,832
That's a little later
than I usually stay, but sure.

84
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:18,420
Before the game, we could enjoy
some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.

85
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,632
I don't know what that is,
but let's!

86
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:32,559
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?

87
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:41,109
<i>Happy Hanukkah, Monica</i>

88
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,114
<i>May your Christmas be snowy, Joey</i>

89
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,825
<i>Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross</i>

90
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:52,871
<i>Spin the dreidel, Rachel</i>

91
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,584
Pheebs, that's great!

92
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:01,088
But you know,
Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.

93
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:06,134
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

94
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:09,305
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:

95
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,809
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.

96
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,603
Maypole.

97
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,191
All good. Thanks.

98
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:24,069
Do you, maybe, have a nickname
that's easier to rhyme?

99
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,656
Didn't your dad used to call you
"Pumpkin"?

100
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,910
But did he ever call you
"Budolph"?

101
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,082
Hello, children.

102
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,794
Have I got the 50 guys for you!

103
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,005
I showed them your picture.

104
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,216
Guys are throwing themselves at me
and giving me stuff.

105
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,259
- Knicks tonight?
- Where are the seats?

106
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,930
Wherever! I've got 20.

107
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,474
Will I like any of these guys?

108
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,602
You know, I'm going to...

109
00:07:56,852 --> 00:08:00,147
...play the field a little bit more.

110
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:04,443
Guys are signing over
their 401 Ks to me.

111
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,572
You work with robots?

112
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:18,332
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.

113
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,250
I like swimmers' bodies.

114
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,838
His dad made the magnetic strip
on credit cards.

115
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,673
I like credit cards!

116
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,342
I'm not bad at this!

117
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,178
- What does he do?
- He works in fine foods.

118
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,766
- You have a fine foods division?
- It's a big company...

119
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,646
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?

120
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:45,025
No, the robots just work for them.

121
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,652
All right, I'm going to work.

122
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,822
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

123
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,157
Yeah, lady. I do!

124
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,450
I got a problem!

125
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,077
I'll give you a problem!

126
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,038
What will you do?
Fire me?

127
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,749
You bet your ass I'll fire you!

128
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,252
See you later.

129
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,676
I should go.
I've got a date.

130
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,094
With who?

131
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,347
You know the girl
who lives in Poughkeepsie?

132
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,349
Not her.

133
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,434
This is someone else.

134
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,229
I can't decide between the two.

135
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,817
The one from Poughkeepsie, though
two hours away, is pretty...

136
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,444
...really smart and a lot of fun.

137
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:35,242
But this other girl,
she lives right uptown.

138
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,204
She's just as pretty.

139
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,830
I guess she's smart.

140
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,209
She's not fun.

141
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,379
If she's no fun,
why date her at all?

142
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,758
I want to give her a chance.
She lives so close.

143
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:56,430
And, at the end of the date,
she said something that...

144
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,683
...if she was kidding,
was very funny.

145
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:06,314
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.

146
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,946
How was your first day
at the restaurant?

147
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:15,574
Damn!

148
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,625
What happened to your fancy jacket?

149
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,710
They baked it.

150
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,044
I can't take this anymore.

151
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,924
- I'm going to fire you tonight.
- You got it.

152
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,550
What are you doing?

153
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,470
You're still on fire there.

154
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:41,016
I think you got it!

155
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:48,357
Chandler, you have
the best taste in men.

156
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,527
Like father, like son.

157
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,655
Patrick and I had such
a great time last night!

158
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,408
This could, maybe, get serious.

159
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:01,412
I thought you weren't looking
for serious. Just a fling?

160
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:05,833
Well, you know, possibly.

161
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:11,589
You didn't tell him that,
though, right?

162
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,845
You told this guy that
I was looking for a fling?

163
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,389
- You don't tell him that!
- Why not?

164
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,850
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl...

165
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,644
I see.

166
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,106
You telling him I want a fling
and me putting out...

167
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:33,777
...he's so going to get
the wrong idea!

168
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:40,242
Joey, could you pass the cheese?

169
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,578
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.

170
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,165
I thought it might be fun
to try out a cool nickname.

171
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,834
Hey, Dragon!

172
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,547
Here's your tips
from Monday and Tuesday.

173
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,590
There's $300 in this one.

174
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,260
People get generous
around the holidays.

175
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,432
And it never hurts
to wear tight trousers.

176
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,269
Could the waiters listen
to the specials?

177
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,898
There's Chilean sea bass
with a mango relish...

178
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,651
Why is nobody writing these?

179
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,236
We can remember them.

180
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,531
Because you'll make up fake specials
and make me cook them?

181
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:23,660
Sure, that too.

182
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:29,542
Forget the specials for a minute.
Here's the thing...

183
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,669
For the last two weeks I have...

184
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,674
...tried hard to create
a positive atmosphere.

185
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,885
Can't hear you!

186
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,137
Positive atmosphere.

187
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:46,558
But I've had it up to here.

188
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:52,273
From now on,
it is going to be my way...

189
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:56,318
...or the highway. All right?

190
00:12:56,568 --> 00:13:00,947
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

191
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,040
Hey, new guy.

192
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,295
I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?

193
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:18,758
No, ma'am.

194
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,011
He has a name. It's Dragon.

195
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,264
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.

196
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:30,352
We did the hat, right?

197
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,150
- What the hell just happened?
- I am so sorry.

198
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,693
I was going to do it.

199
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:41,572
But I was standing there
with $327 in one hand...

200
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:45,117
...and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking...

201
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,954
...it's been a long time since I had...

202
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:53,041
...$327 plus $238!

203
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,962
We had a deal! It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!

204
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:01,216
And I got to pay rent!

205
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,802
How about you don't fire me.

206
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,680
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.

207
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,393
They'll listen to the nice things
I say about you.

208
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,853
What nice things?

209
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:17,190
Nothing yet. They hate you,
and I want to fit in.

210
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,861
<i>Happy Hannukah, Chandler and Monica</i>
<i>Merry, merry...</i>

211
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,989
You know what, Pheebs?

212
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,408
I'm not Jewish so...

213
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,744
Ross doesn't decorate his tree
with floss...

214
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:33,582
...but he's not complaining.

215
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,087
Bad dream?

216
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,006
I wasn't sleeping.

217
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,342
What was Phoebe's song about?

218
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:48,847
It's the one with the cat.

219
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,226
I got to go.
I've got another date.

220
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,936
Did you pick one yet?

221
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:58,399
It turns out the one
from uptown was making a joke.

222
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:03,237
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.

223
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:04,947
So I'm still torn.

224
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,157
You don't like the one from uptown.

225
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,201
And you're exhausted
from dating Poughkeepsie.

226
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,287
Just end them both!

227
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,166
Go to Poughkeepsie
and break up with her.

228
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,208
Then break up with uptown.

229
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,213
By the time you get home,
you're done!

230
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:24,132
You're right. Thank you.

231
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:28,470
I had a similar problem
when I lived in Prague.

232
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,308
- Prague?
- So much you don't know.

233
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,740
Patrick just ended things with me.

234
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:54,288
Did you or didn't you tell him
I wanted a serious relationship?

235
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,498
I did! I absolutely did!

236
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,375
You idiot!

237
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,419
I'm sure you're right.
But why?

238
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,091
You don't tell a guy that
you want a serious relationship.

239
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,176
Now you scared him away!

240
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,347
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

241
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:15,226
You should never be allowed
to talk to people!

242
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,185
I know, I know!

243
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:20,397
Now I'm right back where I started.

244
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,107
This sucks!

245
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,860
Being alone sucks!

246
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,029
You'll meet somebody.

247
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,156
You're a great catch!

248
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:35,329
When I told those guys about you,
I didn't have to lie once.

249
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,956
Really?

250
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:42,211
You graduated magna cum laude, right?

251
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,381
It doesn't matter.

252
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:52,179
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?

253
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,556
Cute guys in little shorts?

254
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,183
Sure.

255
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:02,189
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.

256
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:06,401
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.

257
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:13,909
Have you ever been with a woman?

258
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,496
What is the matter with you?

259
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:22,876
There is no good time
to ask that question.

260
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:30,134
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!

261
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,721
Ross?

262
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,682
Wake up!

263
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,776
I need more swordfish.

264
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:52,572
- Can you get me more swordfish?
- I don't speak English.

265
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:53,866
You just did.

266
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:57,328
I don't know what to tell you.

267
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,623
Fine.

268
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,717
Very funny.

269
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,469
Let me out, please.

270
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,348
Come on, I'm cold!

271
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,101
And covered in marinara sauce!

272
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,145
Let me out!

273
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:30,652
You found that handle, did you?

274
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:35,574
- It's not funny.
- Well, that's not true.

275
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,495
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.

276
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:43,832
And I don't deserve to have
marinara sauce all over me!

277
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,669
If you want me
to quit this bad then...

278
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,505
Chef Geller?

279
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,882
You know that speech you made?

280
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,677
I got a problem with it!

281
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,681
- You do?
- You bet I do!

282
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:05,187
I just wasn't listening then,
that's all.

283
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:09,942
If you want a problem,
I'll give you a problem!

284
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,361
What are you going to do?
Fire me?

285
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:16,490
You bet I'll fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!

286
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,077
Get out!

287
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,788
All right.

288
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,832
Anybody else got a problem?

289
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,377
How about you, chuckles?

290
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:32,381
You think this is funny now?

291
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:37,761
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?

292
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,805
No, it's really good.

293
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:43,809
Take those salads to table four.

294
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,769
And you, get the swordfish!

295
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,479
And you!

296
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,941
Get a haircut!

297
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:58,657
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!

298
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,036
What?

299
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:09,251
I bet myself
that you had beautiful eyes.

300
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:13,463
Now that I see them, I win!

301
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:22,139
We're at my stop.
Would you like to have coffee?

302
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,727
Are we really in Montreal?

303
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,562
Yes, we are.

304
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,440
So coffee?

305
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:35,152
Coffee sounds great.

306
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,529
Wait.

307
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,698
So you live in Montreal?

308
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:45,162
No, but it's only a two-hour
ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

309
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,708
I should have thought
about my wife and kids...

310
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,795
...before I talked back
to Chef Geller.

311
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,677
It will be a lean Christmas
at the Dragon house this year.

312
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,807
Enough!

313
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:09,144
Lean, lean, lean!

314
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,899
<i>Went to the store</i>
<i>Sat on Santa's lap</i>

315
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:18,487
<i>Asked him to bring my friends</i>
<i>All kinds of crap</i>

316
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:22,324
<i>Said all you need is</i>
<i>To write them a song</i>

317
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:27,037
<i>Now you haven't heard it yet</i>
<i>So don't try to sing along</i>

318
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,123
<i>No, don't sing along</i>

319
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,210
<i>Monica, Monica</i>

320
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,756
<i>Have a happy Hannukah</i>

321
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,467
<i>Saw Santa Claus</i>

322
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:45,096
<i>He said hello to Ross</i>

323
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,267
<i>And please tell Joey</i>

324
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:53,272
<i>Christmas will be snowy</i>

325
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:57,777
<i>And Rachel and Chandler</i>

326
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,242
Happy holidays, everybody!
