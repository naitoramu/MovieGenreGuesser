1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,965
Oh, that feels so good.

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:11,011
Oh, lucky me.
Coffee and a live sex show.

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,888
- I'm sorry, what?
- I'm sorry.

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,642
- Nothing. I was just reading to Emma.
- From "Cosmo"?

5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,188
Yeah. Yeah, it's:

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,358
"Climax Your Way to Better Skin."

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,654
So I have to go shopping today,
which is my least favorite thing.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,989
I'm so bad at picking out clothes.

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:35,327
So you need someone who knows
fashion to tell you what looks good.

10
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,538
Not me. Not me. Not me.

11
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,457
- Oh, hey, Rach?
- Yeah?

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,336
- Maybe you could take Charlie shopping?
- Oh, well...

13
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,922
- I'm sure you have better things to do.
- You kidding?

14
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,800
Rachel loves to shop,
and she has great taste.

15
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,220
She's the one that taught me not
to wear white after Labor Day...

16
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,892
...and to always, always, always put
on underwear when trying on clothes.

17
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,396
If you have the time,
I'd really appreciate the help.

18
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,815
Okay. Yeah, let's shop.

19
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:09,570
Okay, you are gonna come back
with some very classy clothes.

20
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,988
And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,743
Okay, great. All right, bye.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,995
Pain in the ass!

23
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,916
- That's off, right?
- What's the matter, Pheebs?

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,212
Mike's sister just invited me to
a party tonight and he's gonna be there.

25
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,925
She was like, "Don't worry. I asked him
and he's totally okay with seeing you."

26
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,929
So now I have to go so he'll think
that I'm totally okay with seeing him.

27
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,932
- Which you're not. You're hung up on him.
- Exactly.

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,519
You want him to eat his heart out,
so you have to look fabulous.

29
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,147
I didn't even think about that.

30
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,858
Sexual politics!

31
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,111
Pheebs, I'm taking Charlie shopping.

32
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,490
- Come and I'll help you find something.
- That'd be great.

33
00:01:54,656 --> 00:02:00,203
Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,
trying on slutty lingerie together.

34
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:05,584
- That's not what we're gonna do.
- Why'd you ruin it? Who was I hurting?

35
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,796
The One With The Donor

38
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,588
Fortunately, she has
a very pretty face.

39
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:01,348
I still can't believe this. My uterus is
an inhospitable environment?

40
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,560
I've always tried so hard
to be a good hostess.

41
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,563
I can't believe my sperm
have low motility.

42
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:12,400
While I was growing up, they sure
seemed to be in a hurry to get places.

43
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,277
- Hi there.
- Hi.

44
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,530
I'm sorry there wasn't better news
from your tests last week...

45
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,451
...but I wanted to talk to you
about your options.

46
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,660
Okay.

47
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,914
Even though your chances of conceiving
through natural means aren't great...

48
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,792
...you never know,
so keep having sex on a regular basis.

49
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,003
Oh, damn it!

50
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:36,299
Don't worry.
After a while, you'll tune it out.

51
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,804
Given your situation, the options
with the greatest chances for success...

52
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:45,058
...would be surrogacy
or insemination using a sperm donor.

53
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:52,441
If you feel that neither of those is
right for you, you could always adopt.

54
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,276
Is that a hint?

55
00:03:54,443 --> 00:04:00,115
Because we love you, Dr. Connelly,
but we don't want you to be our child.

56
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,414
Wow! Talk about
an inhospitable environment.

57
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,504
Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick up
Phoebe and go shopping?

58
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,298
- Let's do it.
- All right, have a good time.

59
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,050
Not gonna find any clothes in there.

60
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,595
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi.

61
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:26,684
Guess who's up for keynote speaker
at the National Paleontology Conference?

62
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,602
- Chris Bailey?
- Yeah, right.

63
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:33,357
When was the last time he made
a submission deadline for an abstract?

64
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,612
Why are you laughing?

65
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,408
Just seeing what it'd be like
to be a paleontologist.

66
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,201
It's fun. Yeah.

67
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,037
So you're up for keynote speaker?

68
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,997
- Who's deciding?
- Professor Sherman.

69
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,668
- I'm meeting with him today.
- He's a pretty tough guy to impress.

70
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,962
I think I know how to dazzle him.

71
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,090
You're not gonna to do
a magic trick, are you?

72
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,801
No.

73
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,354
- Hey, guys.
- I want to ask you something.

74
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,733
I may get to speak
at this paleontology convention.

75
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,361
If I do, I'd love for you guys
to come and hear me.

76
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:24,616
I think I can safely say that we all have
family issues, work and/or are sick.

77
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,161
- It's in Barbados.
- But you come first.

78
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,830
I'm there.

79
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,082
- We'll see you guys.
- Bye.

80
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,292
See you.

81
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,631
- So how did it go at the fertility clinic?
- Not as much fun as last time.

82
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,260
Apparently, you only get porn
if you're giving a sperm sample.

83
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,971
So, what did the doctor say?

84
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,850
There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt
her whole life of carrying a child...

85
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,938
...and she just felt that watching
a surrogate would be too hard for her.

86
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,315
- So you're ruling out surrogacy?
- Yeah.

87
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,483
So I don't have to learn
what that means?

88
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,737
Aside from adoption, the only
other choice is insemination...

89
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,949
...so we're talking about sperm donors.

90
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,827
Enough said. I'm there for you, man.
Where is she, upstairs?

91
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,873
How do you feel about all this?

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,045
I wish there was an easier way for us
to have a child, but there isn't one.

93
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,007
Come on, Ross, be a good guy.
Step up and do it.

94
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,176
What?

95
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,682
What?! No!
I'm not gonna give them Ben!

96
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,940
The data we're receiving
from MRI scans and DNA testing...

97
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,151
...of these fossils are staggering.

98
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,740
I mean, we've been accepting
Leakey's dates as a given.

99
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,992
But if they're off
by even a 100,000 years or so...

100
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,996
...then you can just throw
most of our assumptions...

101
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,457
...you know, right in the trash.

102
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:59,711
So, what I'm saying is...

103
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,714
Is that...

104
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:06,718
Is that repercussions could be huge.

105
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,639
I mean, not just in paleontology,
but if you think about it...

106
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:15,019
...in evolutionary biology,
genetics, geology.

107
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,813
I mean, truly, the mind boggles.

108
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,320
Well, that's not what you want.

109
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,869
- Incentive for Men?
- I'll take some of that.

110
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,703
- Pheebs, that's for men.
- I know.

111
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,498
When I go to the party later...

112
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,668
...Mike will know I'm over him
because I'll smell like another guy.

113
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,005
Okay.

114
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,675
Oh, good, I'm dating
a Russian cabdriver.

115
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,096
Seriously, does anyone buy this?
I smell like beets.

116
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:57,686
I really like those jackets with the
shoulder pads in them. Where are those?

117
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,065
On Melanie Griffith in "Working Girl".

118
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,943
I think what you want is over here.

119
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,946
See, I told you I needed someone.

120
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,491
By the way, as a thank you,
I would really love to take you out.

121
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,911
- Really?
- Joey and I are going to a movie tonight.

122
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,330
- You want to come?
- Oh, I can't.

123
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,500
Because I've seen them.

124
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,214
You've seen all the movies?

125
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,675
Yeah. I'm a big fan.

126
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,302
Of the movies.

127
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,596
You know, motion pictures.

128
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,139
The talkies.

129
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,560
Rach, will you come with me
to a dressing room?

130
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,770
- Sure.
- Okay.

131
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,856
Maybe we could do something else.

132
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:46,485
You know, that depends on what it is.
I've done a lot of stuff.

133
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,622
So, what were you doing out there?
Do you not like Charlie?

134
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,751
She's okay. I don't know, I just don't
get a really good vibe from her.

135
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,254
- Why?
- I don't know.

136
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,550
You know, just the way
she waltzed in here all smart...

137
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,386
...and tall, you know...

138
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:16,057
...and just swept Joey off his feet.
Nobody else has a chance.

139
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,600
Who else?

140
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,476
Anybody.

141
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,604
You.

142
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,439
Me.

143
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,941
You know, Monica's mom.

144
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,653
You like Joey?!

145
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,904
Phoebe!

146
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:35,534
All right, look, I do.
I have a little thing for him. Just...

147
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,328
- Oh, my God.
- It's just physical.

148
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:42,958
I have it totally under control, okay?
It's just when I see them together...

149
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,295
...sometimes, I just get a little jealous.

150
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,131
Wow. Isn't that ironic
that he liked you, and now you like...?

151
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,801
I get it!

152
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,220
All right, as long
as it's under control.

153
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,432
You can't do anything about it.
He's already dating her.

154
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,060
She is a nice person.
That wouldn't be right.

155
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,770
I know, I know.
So it's just not a big deal.

156
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,189
- So can we keep this between us?
- Sure.

157
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,485
Great, because I gotta get out of here.
The smell of beets is killing me.

158
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,578
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?

159
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,084
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

160
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,337
I brought a friend home for dinner.
This is Zack from work.

161
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,800
Oh, of course. It's so nice
to see you again, Zack.

162
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,635
- You too.
- You guys haven't actually met before.

163
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,679
But, boy, you're both polite.

164
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,848
Have a seat. I'll get you a beer.

165
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,308
- I got it.
- Thanks.

166
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:48,607
- So Zack's pretty nice, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

167
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:52,945
So how would you like to have a baby
that's half yours and half his?

168
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,950
Excuse me?

169
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,578
We're talking about sperm donors,
and Zack may be the guy.

170
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:06,792
Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,
he's athletic. I mean, he's sperm-tastic!

171
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,714
Chandler, this is crazy.
Well, what did you even say to him?

172
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,176
"Come up. Meet my wife.
Give us your sperm."

173
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:20,055
I invited him to dinner so you'd get
a chance to get to know him.

174
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,475
With a sperm bank, you never
meet the guy, get to check him out.

175
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,061
- Chandler!
- I'm telling you, he's great.

176
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:30,399
I mean, even if my sperm worked fine,
I think he'd be the way to go.

177
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,861
I'm not going to be a part of this.

178
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:38,365
You can't bring some random guy home
and expect him to be our sperm donor.

179
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,575
Okay.

180
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,245
- Zack?
- Thanks.

181
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,791
Do you have a coaster?
I don't want to make a ring.

182
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,126
Tell me about yourself, Zack.

183
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:57,134
Oh, God, do you think she heard?
Lt'd be so bad if she heard.

184
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:01,388
Maybe she didn't hear. I'll go into that
dressing room and talk. You stay here.

185
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,515
- See if you can hear me.
- Okay, great.

186
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,730
Oh, thank God,
I can't hear a word that you're saying.

187
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:14,527
- I didn't say anything yet.
- Well, get back in there and talk.

188
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:16,904
I'm Rachel.

189
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,865
It's so annoying when I put Emma
on the phone to talk with my friends.

190
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,326
What?

191
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,954
Well, some things are just hard
to say to your face.

192
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:31,460
Okay, well, I heard that.
Which means that she heard it too.

193
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,589
- We have a problem.
- Oh, what are we gonna do?

194
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,591
Just be honest with her.

195
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,551
Oh, my God!

196
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,054
It is annoying when parents
put babies on the phone.

197
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,223
All right, enough out of you!

198
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,775
- Hello?
- I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?

199
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,778
No, she went shopping with Rachel.
Why? What's up?

200
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,907
I'm meeting with Professor Sherman
about my being the keynote speaker.

201
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,451
- How's it going?
- It could be better.

202
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,748
He fell asleep.

203
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,917
What? But I already bought
my ticket to Bermuda!

204
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,129
- Barbados.
- Fine, I'll rent a car and drive.

205
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,425
You have to get that job.

206
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,885
What am I supposed to do?
He's out cold.

207
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,763
In fact, he was just talking
in his sleep before...

208
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,309
...and evidently he wants someone
named Fran to "spank him harder."

209
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,771
- Well, just wake him up.
- I can't.

210
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:37,651
If he realizes that I'm the one who
put him to sleep, I won't get the job.

211
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:38,986
<i>That's a tough one.</i>

212
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,072
Oh, wait a minute.
This happened to me before.

213
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:47,494
Yeah, I was auditioning for a play,
and the producer fell asleep. L...

214
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,788
No, wait a minute.

215
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,540
It was me who fell asleep.

216
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:56,587
I mean, hey, Shakespeare, how about
a chase scene once in a while?

217
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:03,260
- Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
- I'm gonna go wash up first.

218
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,470
Thanks.

219
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:12,311
What do you think? I want his genes
for my kid. Those eyes, those cheekbones.

220
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:16,065
Okay, there's enthusiastic,
and there's just plain gay.

221
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,361
- You don't like him.
- I think he's fine.

222
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,779
But we don't know
anything real about him.

223
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:27,284
- I wish we could get more information.
- All right, just follow my lead.

224
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,621
- You guys have a great place here.
- Thanks. I'm crazy about our place.

225
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,581
Hey, speaking of crazy...

226
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,713
...do you have a history
of mental illness in the family?

227
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:44,259
No. Although, I did have an uncle
who voted for Dukakis.

228
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,846
That's really not the kind of thing
we're looking for.

229
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,516
Okay.

230
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,728
So tell me, how'd you guys meet?

231
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,190
Oh, friends first, drunk in London,
you know the story.

232
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,067
I've got a better question for you:

233
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,779
Do you or any of your blood relatives
have diabetes?

234
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,241
No.

235
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:11,245
Heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?

236
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,292
You guys don't have people
for dinner a lot, huh?

237
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,836
We're just making conversation.

238
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,464
Yeah, well, okay.
I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny.

239
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,384
You know what's not funny?
Male pattern baldness.

240
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,767
You guys have shown a lot of interest
in me tonight, and I'm flattered...

241
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,227
...and quite frankly, a little frightened.

242
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,688
Can we just talk about something else?

243
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,273
- Sure.
- All right.

244
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,316
This ravioli's delicious.

245
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:45,738
I notice you're enjoying that ravioli
with a beautiful set of teeth.

246
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,781
Did you have braces as a child?

247
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,408
- No, I didn't.
- Yes!

248
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,956
We're teeth people, Zack.

249
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:04,465
Let's just do it. Let's just go
over there and see if she heard.

250
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,757
- Good plan.
- Okay.

251
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,470
- What? Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Rachel.

252
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,974
I don't have time
for your childish games, okay?

253
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,727
I still have to find something
incredible to wear...

254
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,897
...so I can beat Mike
at "Who's More Over Who"!

255
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,031
- Where have you been?
- Trying on clothes.

256
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:34,036
Oh, really? In the dressing room?
Well, that's so weird.

257
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:39,458
Phoebe and I were in the dressing room.
Gosh, it's just such a small world.

258
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,169
Rachel, I heard you
two guys whispering.

259
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:45,464
Oh, God, you did, you heard.
Okay, look, let me explain.

260
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,633
There's nothing to explain.
I heard you.

261
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,134
Phoebe likes Joey.

262
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,140
Yeah.

263
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:00,020
I don't understand it.
I mean, Phoebe likes Joey...

264
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,148
...and then she's here to buy a dress
to impress another guy?

265
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:08,111
Yeah, that's Phoebe. That's Phoebe.
You know, she just wants them all.

266
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,156
It's, like, she's nympho.

267
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,992
- Wow!
- Yeah.

268
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,996
You know, by the way, I heard you
tell her not to do anything.

269
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:22,501
Thanks for sticking up for me.
God, you are such a nice person.

270
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:24,879
I try.

271
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:07,963
Oh, my God, you really want me
to be the keynote speaker?

272
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,590
Thank you!

273
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,553
You're welcome.

274
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,234
Wow! You look...

275
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,404
...stop-eating hot!

276
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,700
Which is like the highest level
of hotness.

277
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:41,205
Okay, are you sure? Because I am
really dreading going to this party.

278
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,414
Then don't go.

279
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:46,335
Mike knows I'm coming. If I don't
show up, he'll think it's because of him...

280
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:51,298
...and then I'm gonna lose face.
That's a very serious thing in my culture.

281
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:56,929
All right, then you go to that party,
and you pretend to be over Mike.

282
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,640
Afterward, you come to my place
and I'll get you good and drunk.

283
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,559
You got it. Okay.

284
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,270
But not on the wine
that you made, okay?

285
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:09,358
Because I just don't want to go back
to the emergency room.

286
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,411
David?

287
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,162
Phoebe! Hi.

288
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,748
- Oh, my God!
- Hi.

289
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,751
Wow! You look unbelievable.

290
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,670
Oh, yeah, well...

291
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,298
What are you doing here?

292
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,426
Well, I'm back from Minsk.
Permanently.

293
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,803
Well, what happened?

294
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,805
Remember how I was trying
to achieve...

295
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,850
...the positronic distillation
of subatomic particles?

296
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,476
Yeah.

297
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:48,188
Well, after eight years of research,
I discovered...

298
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,858
...that it can't be done.

299
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,735
Well...

300
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,238
...great that you're back. How are you?

301
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,282
- Good. Good. Life is good.
- Good.

302
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,825
Well, I'm seeing someone.

303
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,038
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

304
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:08,583
She's also a scientist,
so she's very smart and pretty and...

305
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,211
It's actually because of you
that we're together.

306
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,256
I mean, I saw what you had
with that Mike guy...

307
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,508
...and I just said, "Boy, I want that."

308
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:20,012
- Mike and I broke up.
- You're kidding me.

309
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:24,308
Because I'm not seeing anybody.
I just totally made that up.

310
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,518
- Really?
- I don't know why, I'm sorry.

311
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:29,313
I guess I just didn't want
to lose face.

312
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,732
I understand.

313
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,319
Yeah. Okay. So then, okay...

314
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:39,406
So we're both living in New York,
not seeing anyone.

315
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,825
- That's so not like us.
- Yeah, I know.

316
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:46,538
Well, this is probably a stupid question,
seeing that you look like that...

317
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,583
...but do you have someplace
that you need to be right now?

318
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,793
Well...

319
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,128
No.

320
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,050
- Well, do you want to get a drink?
- I'd love to.

321
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,177
- Great.
- Okay.

322
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,182
Do you smell beets?

323
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:08,102
All right, stay upwind of me.

324
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:14,066
Hey, there's Phoebe.
Is that Mike she's with?

325
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,777
No, that's David.

326
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,697
There's a third guy?

327
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,367
Tip of the iceberg.

328
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,663
I'm gonna take off now.

329
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,373
You're gonna let me go home,
aren't you?

330
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,917
Sure you don't want to stay
a little longer?

331
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,212
No, I should get home.
I'm kind of tired.

332
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,089
Are you always tired?

333
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:40,134
Because that could be
a sign of clinical depression.

334
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,596
No, it's tiring to figure out the age
at which all my grandparents died.

335
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,559
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

336
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:49,768
Bye.

337
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,397
I think we found our sperm.

338
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,941
He does seem pretty perfect.

339
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,485
Yeah? You think so?
Should I ask him?

340
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,197
No.

341
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,992
Why not? Just because his
great-grandmother was obese?

342
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,827
Our kid's gonna get that
from you anyway.

343
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:12,166
No, that's not it.

344
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:16,795
It's just that when we were asking him
all those questions before...

345
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:21,884
...I just realized I don't care if he
is the most perfect guy in the world.

346
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,720
- He's not you.
- Yeah, he's better!

347
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,558
No, he's not.

348
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:34,063
If I can't get pregnant with you, then
I don't want to get pregnant by him...

349
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,814
...or anyone else.

350
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,695
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

351
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,280
Thank God, because I
don't wanna do this either.

352
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:46,659
I was just doing it because I thought
that was what you wanted.

353
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,412
I'm the husband.
I'm supposed to bring the sperm.

354
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,165
That is so sweet.

355
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,417
I love you.

356
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,173
So you know this leaves us with...

357
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:02,967
Adoption.

358
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,678
How do you feel about that?

359
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,765
I think I feel okay about it.

360
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,602
Actually, I think I feel
really good about it.

361
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:15,771
Me too.

362
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:20,693
I wanna find a baby that needs a home,
and I wanna raise it with you.

363
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:24,571
And I wanna mess it up
in our own specific way.

364
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,618
So this is it?
We're really gonna adopt?

365
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,453
Yeah.

366
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:36,458
- Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!
- We are gonna be great parents.

367
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,876
And it could be soon.

368
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:41,213
I mean, think about it.
Right now, somewhere out there...

369
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,049
...our baby could be being conceived.

370
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:48,762
Wait. If we're lucky,
and we're really, really, really quiet...

371
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:52,599
...we may be able to hear
the sound of a condom breaking.

372
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,397
Hey, Zack.

373
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,734
Hey, Chandler.

374
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,735
I wanted to apologize for last night.

375
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,279
I got the feeling
we made you uncomfortable.

376
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,614
- No, you didn't.
- Really?

377
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,491
No, you did.

378
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:12,327
My wife and I have
some boundary issues.

379
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,621
Sometimes we ask
inappropriate questions.

380
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,373
We're working on it.

381
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,877
- Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.
- Thank you.

382
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:25,841
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning
on keeping her baby, would you?

383
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,183
