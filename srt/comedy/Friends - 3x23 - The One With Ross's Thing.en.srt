1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,470
Wouldn't it be cool if our duck
and our chick had a baby?

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,740
We could call it Chuck.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,750
Or Dick.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,740
Listen, I need a favor.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,140
I was in the shower,
and as I was. . .

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,860
. . .cleansing myself, I felt something.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,950
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,180
No. I mean, like,
a thing on my body.

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,980
Well, what was it?

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,660
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of in a place that's not. . . .

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,790
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys. . .

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,180
. . .could help me out.

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,940
Come on, you guys!
It's no big deal!

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,750
Well, what is it?
ls it a mole?

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,950
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

16
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,940
Is it--?
What, a pimple?

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,340
No, it's. . .

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,790
. . .fancier than a pimple.

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,220
-Ross, just go see a doc--
-Guys, what's--?

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,380
Well, it's definite.
Two more weeks of winter.

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,380
Yeah, right.

22
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,540
The One With Ross' Thing

23
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,860
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

24
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,180
And this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.

25
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,380
-Good deal.
-These are my friends.

26
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,620
People? This is vince.
vince, the people.

27
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,030
vince is a fireman.

28
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,460
Have you ever rescued anyone
from a burning building?

29
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,980
Ninety-eight hot saves.
Highest on the force.

30
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,020
If Joey and I play with matches,
we could get you up to an even 1 00.

31
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,180
Fire safety is not a joke, son.

32
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,140
You're right. I know.

33
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,340
Look, I gotta go.
I'm on call tonight.

34
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,580
See you Saturday.

35
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,060
He's cute, Pheebs.

36
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,300
But you just started dating
that teacher.

37
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,380
Oh, Jason?

38
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,380
We're seeing each other tonight.

39
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,270
Well, Pheebs?

40
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,110
Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.

41
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,380
I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field.

42
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,340
I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats.

43
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,750
You know, this kind of, like,
oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

44
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,790
So do they know about each other?

45
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,580
Does a dog's lips move
when he reads?

46
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,740
Okay, no, they don't know.

47
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,940
Hey, guys.

48
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,940
-Well?
-How'd it go at the doctor's?

49
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,900
He said there's definitely
nothing to worry about. It's benign.

50
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,180
-What is it?
-He couldn't even tell me.

51
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,340
He said it was just
some sort of "skin abnormality. "

52
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,350
The worse thing is, he said,
being unable to identify it. . .

53
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,390
. . .he was reluctant to remove it.

54
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,980
You should go to my guy.

55
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,540
Because when I went in there
with my third nipple. . .

56
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,740
. . .he just lopped it right off.

57
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,740
So I guess I'm lucky.

58
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,950
I mean, not as lucky as people
who are born with two nipples.

59
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,340
At least they knew what yours was.
You know? Yours had a name.

60
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,540
Maybe they'll name yours after you.

61
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,340
You know?
They'd call it "The Ross. "

62
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,540
And then people would be, like,
"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

63
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,750
Yeah, that'd be cool.

64
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,350
Pete's breaking up with me.

65
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,380
What?

66
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,750
I just checked my messages.

67
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,110
He said that when he gets back,
"We need to talk. "

68
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,980
-And?
-Well, that's it.

69
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,420
People never say, "We need to talk,"
unless it's something bad.

70
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,350
That doesn't necessarily mean
he's breaking up with you.

71
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,780
Really?

72
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,020
Maybe he just cheated on you.

73
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,380
I won't get rich doing it,
but I gotta say, it's cool. . .

74
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,380
. . .knowing you're making
a difference in a kid's life.

75
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,540
That is so great.

76
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,140
Oh, my God!

77
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,860
Oh, my God!

78
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,860
We'd better call
the fire department.

79
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,980
Well, we don't need a fireman.

80
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,950
We need, like, a good mechanic.

81
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,870
Here they come!
We gotta get out of here!

82
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,900
Wait. Why?

83
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,620
If I wanted to see a fireman,
I'd date one.

84
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,180
That's all it is.
A third nipple.

85
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,820
You know? Just your
run-of-the-mill third nipple.

86
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,380
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off.

87
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,590
Take your shirt off.
Let's see what we're dealing with.

88
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,740
What are you doing?

89
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,950
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,
slice-it-right-off third nipple.

90
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,580
Well, that's not a third nipple.

91
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,140
First of all, it's on your ass.

92
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,460
Well, then what is it?

93
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,750
Wait a minute. Hold it.

94
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,220
-Jansen, come in here.
-I'm with Hamilton!

95
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,140
He's good with weird things.
Bring him in too.

96
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,740
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

97
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,940
You know what? lf he's gonna break up
with me, maybe I won't water them.

98
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,780
If he's gonna break up with you,
maybe Joey and I should do it. . .

99
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,540
. . .if you know what I mean.

100
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,940
Or. . .

101
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,460
. . .we could go and pee on them.

102
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,190
I can't take it, you know.

103
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,180
I'm afraid one of them
will catch me with the other.

104
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,740
It's making me crazy!

105
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,940
Why don't you break up
with one of them?

106
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,470
What happened to playing the field?

107
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,820
It doesn't feel like playing anymore.

108
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,940
It's feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.

109
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,380
So pick one of them.

110
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,700
Which one do you like more?

111
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,140
vince is great, you know?
Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

112
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,060
He's just so burly,
so very burly.

113
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,660
Okay, good. So there you go.
Go with vince.

114
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,420
But Jason's really sensitive.

115
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,460
Sensitive is important.
Pick him.

116
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,340
Oh, sure.
Go with the sissy.

117
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,940
Jason is not a sissy.

118
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,940
I meant Chandler.

119
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,190
You know, I have dinner plans.

120
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,780
Thank you so much for coming
on such a short notice.

121
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,780
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been
practicing medicine for 23 years. . .

122
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,350
. . .and I'm stumped.

123
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,460
Okay, this is the den.

124
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,940
All right, check this out.
Lights!

125
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,550
All right, less lights!
Bad lights!

126
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,820
Lights, go away!

127
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,420
See? You just need the right command.

128
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,140
And the dimmer switch.

129
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,500
For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.

130
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,190
That's the video phone.

131
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,180
But you shouldn't be here.
So don't touch anything.

132
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,350
IKEA, this is comfortable!

133
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,340
This place is amazing!

134
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,220
-Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen.
-I know.

135
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,620
It's the nicest kitchen.

136
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,140
The refrigerator
told me to have a great day.

137
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,660
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.

138
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,190
Joey, put that down.

139
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,740
Oh, my God, that's Pete.
Get out!

140
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,340
How the hell do you answer
a video phone?

141
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,030
I guess that's how.

142
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,150
Monica, how's it going?

143
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,540
Oh, it's good. It's good.

144
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,430
Just here, watering the plants.

145
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,660
Don't forget that ficus
there by Rachel.

146
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,590
Chandler's on the couch!

147
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,100
I see him. You guys
are the worst hiders, ever.

148
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,980
-Hi.
-How you doing?

149
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,750
The other day when you said
you needed to talk. . .

150
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,540
. . .just so I know,
is it good news or bad news?

151
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,060
It's good news.
It's definitely good news.

152
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,860
Hold on a second,
I have another call.

153
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,220
How's it going?

154
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,060
It's still me.

155
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,140
I've got picture-in-picture here.

156
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,340
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

157
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,550
Monica? You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

158
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,620
So I'll see you soon.

159
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,750
-Okay. I love you.
-I love you.

160
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,140
We love you too!

161
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,780
Well, it's good news.
It's good news.

162
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,030
-What do you think the good news is?
-Look at this!

163
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,350
He wrote a check for $50,000
to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design. "

164
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,150
Sorry. What do you think
the good news is?

165
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,100
Oh, my!

166
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,110
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!

167
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,860
You gotta get Mom on the phone!
Call Mom! Call Mom!

168
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,190
And that's Pete's mom.

169
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,780
You have to make it a theme wedding.
And the theme could be:

170
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,980
"Look How Much Money We've Got! "

171
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,390
I mean, you could put money
in the invitations.

172
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,190
You could have, like,
little-money place settings.

173
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,860
And you could start
with a money salad.

174
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,940
I mean, it'll be dry,
but people will like it.

175
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,340
Would you stop?

176
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,140
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.

177
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,750
We don't know if he'll propose.

178
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,180
But this is Pete.
He's not like other people.

179
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,180
On your first date, you went to Rome.

180
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,140
For most guys, that's like
a third or fourth date kind of thing.

181
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,990
Well, if that's what it is,
then it's crazy.

182
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,140
Monica's right.
We're talking about marriage here.

183
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,660
She can't just rush into this.

184
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,550
What do you know?
You married a lesbian!

185
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,660
I gotta go.
I have to break up with vince.

186
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,900
So you're going with the teacher?

187
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,740
I like vince a lot, you know?
But Jason is so sensitive.

188
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,220
In the long run, I think
sensitive is better than having. . .

189
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,940
. . .a really, really, really nice body.

190
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,540
Jason. Definitely Jason.

191
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,740
-Wish me luck!
-Good luck!

192
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,380
Oh, my God!

193
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,940
Sorry.

194
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,390
I was imagining what it'd be like
to catch the money bouquet.

195
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,260
Excuse me. Is vince here?

196
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,540
Oh, sure.

197
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,580
I didn't know you guys
actually used those.

198
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,750
So what's up?

199
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,500
This isn't gonna be easy.

200
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,550
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

201
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,580
Good deal.

202
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,780
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,900
No, it's okay.

204
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,790
It's just that I thought
we had something pretty special here.

205
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,940
I felt like you were someone
I could finally open up to.

206
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,350
There's so much in me
I haven't shared with you yet.

207
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,350
My God!
I didn't know you were so--

208
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,350
I'm sorry. I can't talk.

209
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,380
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

210
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,020
Wait! Wait! Wait!

211
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,140
If you wanna take care of that thing,
go see my herbal guy.

212
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,750
Thanks. But I wanna remove it,
not make it savory.

213
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,460
When girls sleep with guys
with weird things on their body. . .

214
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,740
. . .they tell their friends about it.

215
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,740
Give me that.

216
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,420
Okay, don't be mad at me,
but I couldn't resist.

217
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,780
Bride's Magazines?

218
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,540
I know you said you'd say no
if he asked you. . .

219
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,740
. . .but how great would you look
walking down the aisle. . .

220
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,900
. . .in this Donna Karan?

221
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,540
You so would!

222
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,590
You should get that anyway.

223
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,190
Well, for clubbing.

224
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,540
It is so weird.

225
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,580
I know what I said.
But this morning. . .

226
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,140
. . .I was lying in bed, imagining
what it'd be like to say yes.

227
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,940
I know it's a little sudden,
and it's rushed. . .

228
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,700
. . .and it's not like me to do
something like this.

229
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,740
But it doesn't mean I can't.
Right?

230
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,590
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

231
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,550
And I know that
we want the same things.

232
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,940
And when I thought
about saying yes. . .

233
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,860
. . .it made me really happy.

234
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,340
Oh, my God!

235
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,180
I know.

236
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,940
I need more pie.

237
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,540
Mon, if you do get married,
can I bring two guests?

238
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,460
You didn't break up with that fireman?

239
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,270
That was my way of telling you.

240
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,660
Well, it turns out
he's incredibly sensitive.

241
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,980
He keeps a journal and he paints.

242
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,990
He even showed me charcoal drawings
that he drew of me.

243
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,430
He'd prefer watercolors, but he has
easy access to a lot of charcoal.

244
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,740
So will you dump Jason?

245
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,150
Yeah, because I have to break up
with someone.

246
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,180
So Jason is sensitive.
But now, so is vince.

247
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,460
Plus, vince has the body.
You know?

248
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,700
So. . . .

249
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,350
It's really just about the math.

250
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,150
Come on in.

251
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,140
You sounded serious on the phone.

252
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,140
Is anything wrong?

253
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,940
You must be Ross.

254
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,340
I am Guru Saj.

255
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,660
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never
been to a guru before, so. . . .

256
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,780
Well, relax.

257
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,460
If it makes you feel any better,
I've attended. . .

258
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,940
. . .fine medical schools
in Central America.

259
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,860
Well, let's take a look
at this skin abnormality of yours.

260
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,750
Come on, have a seat.

261
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,430
As I suspected, it's a kundus.

262
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,900
What's a "kundus"?

263
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,340
I don't know.
What's a kundus with you?

264
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,740
Please lie down.

265
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,740
I've got a salve that
ought to shrink that right up.

266
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,750
I guess it's worth a try.

267
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,590
Sure. We should see results--

268
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,340
Clearly not the way to go!

269
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,150
What? What?

270
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,460
We appear to have angered it.

271
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,780
We? We angered it?

272
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,940
I think I see the problem.

273
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,820
And I'm afraid we're gonna
have to use a much stronger tool.

274
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,620
Love.

275
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,060
Oh, God!

276
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,460
There is absolutely no way
this is gonna come off. . .

277
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,140
. . .unless you start to. . . .

278
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,540
What was that?

279
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,540
Well, it's gone.

280
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,100
How's that?

281
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,220
Got caught in my watch.

282
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,540
Lights.

283
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,540
Romantic lights.

284
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,980
Nice.

285
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,180
So there was this thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

286
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,140
Oh, right. I'd completely
forgot about that.

287
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,020
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

288
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,100
And I look at my life. . .

289
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,910
. . .and I feel like I've conquered
the business world.

290
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,630
And I feel like I've conquered
the intellectual world.

291
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,950
And now I have the most
beautiful woman in the world.

292
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,740
But there's one thing missing.

293
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,220
What's that?

294
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,620
It's time for me to conquer
the physical world.

295
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,950
I wanna become. . .

296
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,940
. . .the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

297
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,430
You wanna what?

298
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,580
I wanna be
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

299
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,550
It's the most intense
physical competition in the world.

300
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,100
It's banned in 49 states.

301
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,430
What are you talking about?

302
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,550
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me. . .

303
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,900
. . .Jeet Kune Do
and Brazilian streetfighting.

304
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,180
I even had my own
octagon training ring designed.

305
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,310
And I suppose you used
a ring designer for that.

306
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,150
I want you there,
in the front row, when I win.

307
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,740
I want you close enough
to smell the blood.

308
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,940
What do you think?

309
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,540
My parents will be so happy.

310
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,460
Crazy underwear
Creeping up my butt

311
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,790
Crazy underwear
Always in a rut

312
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,220
Crazy underwear

313
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,070
What is he doing here?

314
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,220
All right, just keep playing.

315
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,940
You'll get through this.
You'll be fine.

316
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,950
Okay, thank you.

317
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,420
And as always, no one talk to me
after the show.

318
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,380
I was passing by
and saw you were playing.

319
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,820
This is cool, seeing you up there.

320
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,980
What's going on here?
Who's this guy?

321
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,340
I don't know! He just started
kissing me. Get him, vince!

322
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,500
What?

323
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,860
I've been dating both of you.

324
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,150
And it's been really horrible,
because it's been. . .

325
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,190
. . .a lot of fun for me.

326
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,030
But I like you both. . .

327
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,380
. . .and I didn't know how to choose.

328
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,300
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.
I'm a terrible person.

329
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,780
Relax. It's okay.
I mean. . . .

330
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,260
We never said this was exclusive.

331
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,070
Neither did we.
So give yourself a break.

332
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,140
Really?

333
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,380
We haven't been going out that long.

334
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,190
Come on, we haven't even
slept together yet.

335
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,350
You haven't?

336
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,780
You have?

337
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,140
Well, this is none of my business.

338
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,830
I can't believe this!
You slept with him?

339
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,750
Well, I made you
a candlelight dinner in the park.

340
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,750
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

341
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,540
That could've been really awkward.

342
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,540
You made him a candlelight dinner
in the park?

343
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,100
Yeah, but I can do that for you.
I'm gonna do that for you.

344
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,740
I can't believe
I went out with somebody. . .

345
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,340
. . .who'd have an open flame
in the middle of a wooded area!

346
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,540
Everything's gonna be all right.

347
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,140
Okay, Dick?

348
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,860
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

349
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,540
He's a duck, right?
Because otherwise. . .

350
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,740
. . .this is way out of my league.

351
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,460
He's got a really bad cough,
and our vet can't stop it.

352
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,340
Is there something you can do?

353
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,190
Let me see.

354
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,580
Let me see.

355
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,140
Do you think you could get him
to eat a bat?
