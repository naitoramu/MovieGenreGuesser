00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,965
<i>He sprang to his sleigh</i>
<i>To his team gave a whistle</i>

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,135
<i>And away they all flew</i>
<i>Like the down of a thistle</i>

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,430
<i>But I heard him exclaim</i>
<i>Ere he drove out of sight</i>

4
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:19,061
<i>"Merry Christmas to all</i>
<i>And to all a good night. "</i>

5
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:26,235
Wow! That was great!
You really wrote that?

6
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,157
Say goodbye, elves.
I'm off to Tulsa.

7
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,660
I can't believe you won't be here
for Christmas.

8
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,661
You're really not coming back?

9
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,998
We have this paperwork that needs
to be filed by the end of the year.

10
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,876
- Lf I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
- It's so unfair.

11
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,088
- You don't even like your job.
- So. Who does?

12
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,756
- I like my job.
- I love my job.

13
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:51,009
- I can't wait to go back to work.
- I can't get enough dinosaurs.

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,515
I'm sorry I won't be here.

15
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,477
It's hard enough not seeing you
during the week...

16
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,604
...but for Christmas...

17
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,940
If this is what you have to do,
I understand.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,484
Thanks.

19
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,902
I'll see you New Year's Day.

20
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,238
You're not gonna be here
New Year's Eve?

21
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,492
- Did I not mention that?
- No.

22
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,869
And to all a good night!

23
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,166

26
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,302
All right, everybody.
I know it is Christmas Eve...

27
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,847
...and you'd rather be with family,
but there is no call for writing...

28
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:23,644
..."Screw you, Mr. Bing"
on the back of my chair.

29
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,188
By the way,
you can all call me Chandler.

30
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,650
- Hey.
- Hey. Where you been?

31
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,153
I was checking out that insurance
company's Christmas party on three.

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,573
It was really beautiful. They have
decorations and this huge tree.

33
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,743
And I just thought,
to hell with them, we have to work.

34
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,496
So I stole their ham.

35
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,957
Hear that?
You may not be with your families...

36
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,752
...but at least it's gonna smell like ham
in here.

37
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,089
My kid's in a play right now.

38
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,300
You know what?
I know what will cheer you up.

39
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:59,304
I had a talk with the boys in New York.
I told them about all your hard work...

40
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,933
...and that a little Christmas bonus
may be in order.

41
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:08,563
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."

42
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,027
Well, that's like money in your pocket.

43
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,530
All right, you want me to say it?
This sucks.

44
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,115
Being here sucks. This work sucks!

45
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,618
Now it feels like Christmas.

46
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,954
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,082
At least you get to go home
and be with your families tonight.

48
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,793
I have to go to an empty hotel room
and lay down...

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,422
...on a very questionable bedspread.

50
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,842
Then tomorrow, you get to have
Christmas in your own houses.

51
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,470
Which, by the way,
none of you have invited me to.

52
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:43,932
- You can come to my house.
- No, thanks.

53
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,519
- It was a nice pep talk.
- Thanks.

54
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,482
I'm actually thinking about becoming
a motivational speaker.

55
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,986
So if you were home right now,
what would you be doing?

56
00:03:56,195 --> 00:04:00,491
Typical Christmassy stuff, you know.
Our holidays are pretty traditional.

57
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,577
So here's a very special
holiday song...

58
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,373
...that I wrote for some
very important people to me.

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,471
Happy holidays, everybody.

60
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,599
Pheebs, look in the kitchen.
I'll look in the back closet.

61
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,228
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

62
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,939
Yeah. Chandler,
why don't you take a walk.

63
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,066
This doesn't concern you.

64
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,486
We are looking for
our Christmas presents from Monica.

65
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,031
- What? That's terrible.
- No, no. We do it every year.

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,701
Well, that makes it not terrible.

67
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,331
No. Yeah, we never find them.
She's always bested us, that wily...

68
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,833
...minx.

69
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,544
We're gonna search here
for an hour...

70
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,005
...and then we'll go to Joey's
and search. Okay?

71
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,966
No, not okay.
You can't look for Monica's presents.

72
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,010
- No, we have to.
- No, you don't have to.

73
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:47,139
And you can't,
because I live here too.

74
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,810
- Well, then you should look with us.
- Why?

75
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,980
Aren't you worried about what
to get Monica for Christmas?

76
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,400
No, I have a great idea
for a present for her.

77
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,652
That's it? "A great idea"?

78
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,280
That's not enough.
What if she gets you a great present...

79
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,575
...two medium presents
and lots of little presents...

80
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,995
...and you got her one great present?
That's gonna make her feel bad.

81
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,956
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

82
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,085
- Lf I helped, we could find them faster!
- Right.

83
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,966
- We have a live one!
- It's a Macy's bag!

84
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,763
Who's it for?

85
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:33,101
"Dear Losers: Do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

86
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:38,607
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."

87
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,277
Rach, these are for you.

88
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:47,199
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.

89
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,536
No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do.

90
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,334
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

91
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,297
Toilet seat covers!

92
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,053
Is that what you were doing
while I was getting gas?

93
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,723
You guys.

94
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,268
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet Tooth.

95
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:22,985
- You got me a cola drink?
- And... a lemon-lime!

96
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,863
Well, this... This is too much.

97
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,908
I feel like I should get you
another sweater.

98
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,871
And last but not least...

99
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:40,085
They're ribbed, for your pleasure.

100
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,712
Well, hey, Ben?

101
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,095
What if the Holiday Armadillo
told you all about the Festival of Lights?

102
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,805
Cool!

103
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,723
Come on, Ben.

104
00:07:55,392 --> 00:08:01,940
Years and years ago, there were
these people called the Maccabees!

105
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,945
Merry Christmas!

106
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,072
Santa!

107
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,869
What are you doing here, Santa?

108
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,624
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.

109
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,043
What are you doing here...

110
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,005
...weird turtle-man?

111
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:33,305
I'm the Holiday Armadillo,
your part-Jewish friend.

112
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,394
You sent me here to give Ben
some presents.

113
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,854
Remember?

114
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,190
What?

115
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,568
Ben, why don't you open
some more presents.

116
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,488
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

117
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:53,492
There's a sentence I never thought
I'd say.

118
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,994
What are you doing?

119
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,331
You called and said you had trouble
finding a Santa costume...

120
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,126
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

121
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,837
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

122
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,505
- Why?
- Because...

123
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,424
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah.

124
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,093
And you're wrecking it.

125
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,347
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowl full of jelly.

126
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,312
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

127
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,691
Okay, fine. I'll give the suit back.

128
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:31,197
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

129
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,992
Santa? Really?

130
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:40,831
- Yeah, is that okay?
- Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

131
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:45,961
- No.
- Then it's okay!

132
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,341
You know what, everybody?

133
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,718
Go home.
You should be with your families.

134
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,137
It's bad enough we're working
New Year's Eve.

135
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,017
Did I not tell anyone
about New Year's Eve?

136
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:04,522
All right, look, go. Go home, okay?
Merry Christmas.

137
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,817
- Merry Christmas.
- Peace on earth.

138
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:12,696
- Bye.
- Good. Godspeed, good people.

139
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:17,576
- You're not gonna go?
- No. I couldn't leave you alone.

140
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,037
Thanks.

141
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:24,249
Besides, I can't leave until that
Christmas party downstairs clears out.

142
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,711
There are some pissed-off
insurance people looking for that ham.

143
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,926
- Chandler Bing.
- Hi, honey. We're all here.

144
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,885
We want to wish you
a merry Christmas.

145
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,263
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

146
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,101
Merry Christmas. I miss you guys.

147
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,896
So is it horrible?
Is everybody working really hard?

148
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,940
Well, no, it's just me and Wendy.

149
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,860
Wendy? That sounds like a girl's name.

150
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,239
It is. Did I not tell you about her?

151
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,200
About the time you told me
about New Year's Eve.

152
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,495
- Where's everybody else?
- "I sent them home."

153
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:06,458
You are such a good boss.
Is she pretty?

154
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,380
Answer faster. Answer faster.

155
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,424
- I don't know.
- Answer better. Answer better.

156
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,554
I don't think of her that way.
I mean, she's a colleague.

157
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,807
- What does she do there?
- She's regional vice president.

158
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:24,477
- She's just below me.
- She did what?

159
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,900
Below me.

160
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,654
Wait, is Wendy the runner-up
Miss Oklahoma?

161
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,489
What?!

162
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,993
Well, she didn't win.

163
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,162
All right, maybe I should let you...

164
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,332
...and the second prettiest girl
in Oklahoma get back to work.

165
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,545
Second prettiest that year. Of all
the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...

166
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,213
Chandler, stop talking.

167
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,927
Honey, there's really
nothing to worry about.

168
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,387
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

169
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:01,847
Okay.

170
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,850
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

171
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,938
- Merry Christmas, you guys.
- Merry Christmas.

172
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,905
- The wife says hi.
- Fun conversation?

173
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:21,158
Well, she's just got
this weird idea that...

174
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,620
...because you and I are alone
something's gonna happen.

175
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,830
Really?

176
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,375
Would that be so terrible?

177
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:35,422
This is probably the wrong thing
to be worrying about...

178
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,426
...but you're getting ham
on my only tie.

179
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,186
- Back off, missy!
- Missy?

180
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,022
I don't know. I'm not used to girls
making passes at me.

181
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:56,235
Wait a minute.
Am I sexy in Oklahoma?

182
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:01,782
- You are to me.
- No. No. No!

183
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,370
- Look, I'm married.
- So? I'm married.

184
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,455
I'm happily married.

185
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,250
What's that like?

186
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:16,589
- Right. So I'm sorry, but...
- Seriously? Happily married?

187
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,883
So that phone call before,
that was happy?

188
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,304
Well, look, it's not easy
to spend this much time apart.

189
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,723
She's entitled to be
a little paranoid.

190
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,558
Or, in this case, right on the money.

191
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:34,148
You know, she's amazing
and beautiful and smart.

192
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,943
And if she were here right now,
she'd kick your ass.

193
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,951
Look, you're a really nice person,
ham-stealing and adultery aside.

194
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,622
But what I have with my wife
is pretty great.

195
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,834
So nothing's ever gonna happen
between us.

196
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,628
Okay, let me ask you something.

197
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:00,382
If what you and your wife have
is so great...

198
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,802
...then why are you spending
Christmas with me?

199
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,806
You were the most beautiful woman
in the room tonight.

200
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,392
- Really?
- Are you kidding?

201
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,562
You're the most beautiful woman
in most rooms.

202
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,989
What's going on?
You and I just made out.

203
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,617
- You and I are making out?
- Well, not anymore.

204
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:31,204
- But we don't do that.
- I know. I just thought it would be fun.

205
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,376
- How drunk are you?
- Drunk enough that I wanna do this.

206
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,795
Not so drunk that you should
feel guilty about taking advantage.

207
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,591
That's a perfect amount.

208
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,724
- You know what's weird?
- What?

209
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,310
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

210
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:58,691
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

211
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:03,737
You wanna get under the covers?
Okay.

212
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,039
Wow, you are really fast.

213
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,418
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

214
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,880
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

215
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,716
- You want to do it at the same time?
- Count of three?

216
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,385
- One.
- Two.

217
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,637
Three.

218
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:36,562
Well, I think it's safe to say
that our friendship is effectively ruined.

219
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,398
We weren't that close anyway.

220
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,777
Are you really gonna go out
with that nurse-man?

221
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,197
Well, you and I
are just goofing around.

222
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,993
I thought, why not
just goof around with him?

223
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:57,332
I don't know if you've ever looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

224
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,793
Well, I have.

225
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:04,965
And the technical definition
is two friends...

226
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:11,430
...who care a lot about each other
and have amazing sex...

227
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:18,187
...and just want to spend
more time together.

228
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,523
If you have this newfangled dictionary
that gets you mad at me...

229
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,402
...then we have to, you know,
get you my original dictionary.

230
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,949
I am so bad at this.

231
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,160
I think you're better
than you think you are.

232
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:37,163
- Really? Okay. So if...?
- Know when to stop.

233
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,416
I sensed that I should stop.

234
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,670
- So we're okay?
- Yeah.

235
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,842
- Don't do the dance.
- Right.

236
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,013
I can't get married without
something old, something new...

237
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,766
...something borrowed, something blue.
- Okay, okay.

238
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,268
Here's something blue and new.

239
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,980
You are so efficient. I love you.

240
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,523
- Let's go.
- No, no, wait!

241
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,399
We need something old.

242
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:08,821
Okay. I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was 12.

243
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,865
That'll work!

244
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,867
I don't think so.

245
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,537
Okay. Now we just need
something borrowed.

246
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:22,000
- Here, just take this.
- That's stealing.

247
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,753
We'll bring it back.
Just put it under your dress.

248
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,392
Okay, one thing at a time.

249
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,521
Listen...

250
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,274
...I've been thinking.

251
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,528
It's not fair for me to ask you to spend
all of your money on our wedding.

252
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,782
I mean, you work...
You work really hard for that.

253
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,202
- Well...
- Well, you work for that.

254
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,831
Look, I've thought about it too.
And...

255
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:05,628
...I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

256
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:10,549
- You do?
- Yeah. I'm putting my foot down.

257
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,386
Yeah, look, when I proposed...

258
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:18,682
...I told you that I would do anything
to make you happy.

259
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,519
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy, then...

260
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,646
Then that's what we're gonna do.

261
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,191
You are so sweet.

262
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,489
But wait. What about our...?
What about the future and stuff?

263
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:38,452
Forget about the future and stuff.
So we only have two kids.

264
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:42,790
You know, we'll pick our favorite,
and that one will get to go to college.

265
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,251
- You've thought about that?
- Yeah.

266
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:50,464
- How many kids were we gonna have?
- Four. A boy, twin girls...

267
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,092
...and another boy.

268
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,886
- What else did you think about?
- Well...

269
00:18:56,595 --> 00:19:00,474
...stuff like where we'd live, you know.

270
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:05,145
Like a small place outside the city
where our kids could ride bikes and stuff.

271
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:08,982
And we could have a cat
that had a bell on its collar...

272
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:13,028
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

273
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:17,491
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.

274
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,957
You know what?

275
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,085
I don't...
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

276
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,754
- Sure you do.
- No.

277
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,758
I want everything
that you've just said.

278
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:37,386
I want a marriage.

279
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,138
You sure?

280
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:46,103
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

281
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:04,496
- I love it!
- Really? You're not gonna return it?

282
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,165
Well, not this second.

283
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,420
Hey, look, you guys. It's snowing!

284
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:20,096
- Wow, it's so beautiful.
- Wow, it really is.

285
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:25,475
Wendy's a fat-girl name.

286
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,145
Aren't we done with that?

287
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:32,399
Okay, fine. Fine.
Let's talk about snow.

288
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:38,196
Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa where
my husband's having sex on a copier?

289
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,201
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

290
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,749
Look at that.
That's a Christmas miracle!

291
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:54,838
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to be with you.

292
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,757
I missed you so much.

293
00:20:56,924 --> 00:21:00,219
- Hey, hey. Who'd you miss the most?
- Monica.

294
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,305
Gotcha.

295
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:10,312
- I never want to leave you again.
- I thought if you left, you'd get fired.

296
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:13,983
Turns out they can't fire me.
Because I quit.

297
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,903
- What?
- What? You...? You really quit your job?

298
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,573
Yeah. It was a stupid job,
and I could not stand leaving you.

299
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:25,577
Why should I be the only one who
doesn't do what he really wants to do?

300
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:30,708
- Well, what do you really wanna do?
- I have not thought this through.

301
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,879
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I should've talked to you first.

302
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:38,257
No, I think that this is what
you wanna do. I think it's great!

303
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,051
Thanks.

304
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,348
Chandler, your being here is the best
Christmas present I could ever imagine.

305
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,394
- Now give me my real gift.
- Yeah.

306
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,605
- Thank you.
- Here, pass those around.

307
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:05,284
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."

308
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,371
How did you know?

309
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,542
What? Are you kidding?
I can't return this.

310
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,921
It's time we started thinking about
other people.

311
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,715
And besides, this gift still says,
"I love you guys."

312
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:23,718
- Mine says, "To Lillian Myers."
- I don't have a job.

313
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,518
Actuary? No.

314
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:35,022
Bookkeeper? No.

315
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,775
Topless dancer?

316
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:46,742
Hey, you know what I just realized?
You are the sole wage earner.

317
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:52,415
You are the head of the household.
I don't do anything. I'm a kept man!

318
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:54,125
You are.

319
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,709
Honey, here's 20 bucks.

320
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,629
Go buy yourself something pretty
while I'm at work tomorrow.

321
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,306
