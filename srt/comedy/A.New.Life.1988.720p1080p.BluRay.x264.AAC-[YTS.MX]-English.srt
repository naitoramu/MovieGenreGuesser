3
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:34,335
What the hell
are you doing here?

4
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:35,883
Give me those shoes. Hey, hey!

5
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:37,164
You didn't have to
come in today.

6
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:38,557
I got 'til 11 o'clock.
Give me my shoes.

7
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:40,931
Get yourself a cup of coffee,
collect your thoughts.

8
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:42,344
No need to collect
my goddamn thoughts.

9
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:44,215
This is not necessary, Steve.
I can handle it myself.

10
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,347
Would you get back to the floor?

11
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:46,241
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

12
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:47,285
Screw you. Screw you.

13
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,418
Up your ass. Up your ass.

14
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:32,813
Audrey, call Rasha.

15
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:35,033
Tell him we'll try to
buy in 50,000 within range.

16
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:36,861
And I don't know
if I can buy it all today.

17
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:38,471
Okay. He's not patient,

18
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:39,579
I can't get him his prices,
you know?

19
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:40,691
Right, right.

20
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,128
Why don't you go home?

21
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:44,323
I don't need a psychotherapist.

22
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:46,175
Just be a clerk, okay?

23
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:47,350
Steve? Yeah?

24
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,134
I heard. I'm sorry.

25
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:49,701
Thanks.

26
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:03,542
Graykirk's still ahead 3/4.

27
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,807
Sorry you have to go
through this deal.

28
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,001
I'm in a daze, I'm telling you.

29
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,897
It's the worst. I know.

30
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,030
Stevie!

31
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,730
Hey!

32
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,650
Fifteen top.

33
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:27,742
Sell 5,000 right ahead.

34
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:29,004
10,000.

35
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:30,048
An 1/8 for 10,000.

36
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,094
1/8 and a quarter, 10,000.

37
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:50,505
Right, Steve,
just sign right here.

38
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:52,942
Why are you doing this?

39
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm cruel to you, right?

40
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:55,641
I'm mean to you.
I make your life miserable.

41
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:57,513
Is that right?

42
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:59,471
I don't want to
go through this again.

43
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:00,753
It doesn't make any sense to me.

44
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:02,232
What am I, a bad person? Come on, Steve.

45
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:04,345
No, I love this woman.
She's throwing me out.

46
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,609
Does that make sense to you?

47
00:05:06,652 --> 00:05:08,655
I'm asking you,
does that make sense?

48
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,831
Come on.

49
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,137
Give me the pen.

50
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:16,576
I also don't understand

51
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,186
why she gets
half my Knicks tickets.

52
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,058
I'm a little thick,
I just don't get that.

53
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:22,235
One week you have them,
the next week she has them.

54
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:24,367
She doesn't like basketball.

55
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,631
Who's Larry Bird,
who's Magic Johnson?

56
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:28,458
If you want the tickets,
you can have them.

57
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,852
I don't want the damn tickets.

58
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,506
This isn't about money.

59
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,727
What do you want from me?
Just tell me what you want.

60
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,599
I come home late.
What is that, a crime?

61
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:41,255
I don't answer questions
while I'm reading the paper.

62
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,735
Well, I'm sorry,

63
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:44,060
I can't talk and read
at the same time.

64
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:45,433
I'm not a ventriloquist.

65
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,655
Just sign it, please.

66
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:51,396
This marriage
has really been over

67
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,660
since Judy went away to college.

68
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:07,544
Thank you.

69
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:09,851
Bye, Steve.

70
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:11,243
I'll walk you outside.

71
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,680
I'll talk to you tonight.

72
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:15,770
Thank you.

73
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:17,686
I'll call you later.
I love your work.

74
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:22,604
Are you going back to school?

75
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:24,083
I'm starting classes
on Wednesday.

76
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:25,694
Good. I hope you enjoy it.

77
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:27,696
What are you studying?

78
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:29,916
I'm getting a degree
in special education.

79
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,875
I'm going to teach
deaf children.

80
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,790
You know, you're very smart.

81
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,854
If you want to help
deaf children,

82
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:36,967
you could be a doctor.

83
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,230
I don't want to be a doctor.
I want to teach.

84
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,729
You couldn't do that
and stay with me?

85
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:43,147
You have to break up
a marriage for this?

86
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,411
What marriage?

87
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,152
You left the house
at 7 in the morning,

88
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:48,651
you didn't come home
'til the 11 o'clock news

89
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,504
which you watched.

90
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:53,680
You played tennis on Saturday,
golf on Sunday.

91
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,508
What marriage
are we talking about?

92
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:58,468
That was business.
You know that.

93
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:00,209
The golf was with clients.

94
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,472
Oh, my mistake.

95
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:05,301
Look, I...

96
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:07,739
I'm gonna say goodbye here,
all right?

97
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:09,958
Do you want to
shake hands or what?

98
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:11,700
Yeah, sure.

99
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:13,267
Nice knowing you.

100
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,641
How was it?

101
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:40,296
Oh, could have been worse.

102
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,601
He could have bitten somebody.

103
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:43,429
Well, look,
we're gonna celebrate.

104
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:44,735
Here.

105
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:49,174
Here's to your new life.

106
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:51,916
What?

107
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,400
What if I'm making
this incredible mistake?

108
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,272
What if I'm ruining my life
and my daughter's?

109
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:01,579
She's grown up.

110
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,581
And so are you.

111
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:06,149
I've never lived alone before.

112
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:07,804
Ever.

113
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:12,199
I went right from college
to marriage.

114
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,071
It's not so bad.

115
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:16,247
It can be fun.

116
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,075
And I think
it would be good for you.

117
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:21,122
I mean, it's important
to know how to be alone.

118
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,429
Oh, come on,
give yourself a little time,

119
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:25,344
you're gonna meet somebody.

120
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:26,606
You'll fall in love.

121
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,086
Oh, yeah?

122
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,566
You've been divorced
for two years.

123
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,917
All I keep hearing from you
are these horror stories.

124
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,571
Don't be negative.

125
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,966
Now, come on, we've got
to be scientific here.

126
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,404
I have this chart in my lab,
and every time I do a sampling

127
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:45,234
of the male population, I plot
him on "X" and "Y" axes.

128
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,149
I thought you did
charts on mice.

129
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,586
I'm systematic,

130
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,067
mice on one side,
men on the other.

131
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:53,200
Now, come on.

132
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:55,855
Here's to your new life.

133
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:57,117
Come on.

134
00:09:01,643 --> 00:09:03,143
What the hell am I? Some piece
of garbage you throw away

135
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,082
when you're finished with it?

136
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,320
What the hell are you
beating up on yourself for?

137
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:07,650
I'm not beating up on myself.

138
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,193
Maurice, where are
those little pizza things?

139
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:10,542
On the way,
Mr. Giardino. I'm starving here.

140
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,891
You see anybody
coming with pizzas?

141
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:12,979
They're coming, 12 seconds.

142
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:15,310
They'll be here in... here, $20,

143
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:17,332
Twelve seconds,
starting now. I'm not hearing 12 minutes.

144
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,228
These guys are full of shit.

145
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:24,886
What's the rush?
Relax, you'll live longer.

146
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:27,366
I'm beating up on myself
'cause I'm pissed.

147
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,020
Hey, hey, don't put
that crap all over.

148
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:30,607
I'm not gonna eat that. This is yours,
over here.

149
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:32,111
I get one piece?

150
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,373
Geez, you're a real pig.

151
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:34,611
No wonder she threw you
out of the house.

152
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:36,202
Let me tell you something.

153
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:37,658
I've been a good husband.
I don't deserve this.

154
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:39,205
You know how lucky you were?

155
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:40,400
Don't you remember
what I went through

156
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:42,948
before Elvira let me go?

157
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:44,690
Stevie, it's all
out there for you.

158
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:47,171
Blondes, brunettes,

159
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:48,670
but you can't walk around
looking like that.

160
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:50,043
Like what?

161
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:51,697
You know who likes
white facial hair?

162
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,656
Women who are sexually
attracted to Santa Claus.

163
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,528
Touch it up a little, something.

164
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:58,836
Get some new clothes, get hip.

165
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,577
Hip? You said hip in 1942.

166
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:03,188
Yeah, well,
they're saying it again,

167
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:04,754
but they ain't gonna
say it about you

168
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:07,496
if you look like Father
Christmas's older brother.

169
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,300
Maurice, bring me some more
of these pizza things

170
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:11,124
only put it over here
where he can't get at it

171
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,895
with his goddamn roach powder.

172
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:47,496
Oh, 'scuse me, are you here

173
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:49,759
for Introduction
to American Sign Language?

174
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:51,543
Yeah, could you help me?

175
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:54,156
I have an Education course
scheduled at this hour.

176
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:55,785
Do you teach this class
at any other time today?

177
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:57,550
No, no, no, I'm a student.

Hi, how you doing?

192
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:55,045
My name is Steve. How about you?

193
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:56,525
Sybil.

194
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:58,004
Sybil?

195
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:00,224
Classical name.
I love the classics.

196
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:01,791
Can I buy you a drink?

197
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:08,799
It's gonna be a great evening.

198
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,469
So you follow basketball much?

199
00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:26,948
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, relax,

200
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,274
you're not a sports fan,
that's all right.

201
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:30,256
It's okay.

202
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,432
You have a favorite author?

203
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:33,738
Huh?

204
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:39,353
You know it's possible
I misread the signals.

205
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:42,878
I'm sorry. I'm not
used to this, all right?

206
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:44,856
Tell you what, I think
we're both a little nervous.

207
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,100
Hey!

208
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:49,123
Can I ask you something,
why do you keep hitting me?

209
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:51,061
Why? You want to know why?

210
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:52,715
Why?

211
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,152
This is why.

212
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:57,329
This is why.

213
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:58,634
Stop the cab!

214
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:00,158
Pull over by the water.

215
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,681
You're getting out.

216
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:03,423
Why didn't you tell me
you were male?

217
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:05,618
What did you expect me to do,
blurt it out all at once?

218
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:07,185
No, I don't think
you should blurt it out.

219
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,409
I think you should hang a
fuckin' sign around your neck.

220
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:13,998
What the hell is this?

221
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,237
Hey, what are you doing?
Get back in the car.

222
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:16,654
Get out of here.

223
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:17,481
Get in the phone booth.

224
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,048
Aw, shit!

225
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:21,050
Oh, God. Take off your clothes

226
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:22,051
and leave the money
in the pockets.

227
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:23,661
Okay, just relax. Take it easy.

228
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,576
Take it easy, all right.

229
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,380
Just leave me a quarter to
make a phone call, all right?

230
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:28,100
Move! All right, okay.

231
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,537
Today!

232
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,453
All right, don't shoot,
don't shoot.

233
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:32,865
All right. I never had
my clothes stolen before

234
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,195
and I'm very nervous.

235
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:36,414
Hey, to hell with you
and your problems.

236
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,460
Look what I've got to go
through to earn a living.

237
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:40,070
I'm allergic to make-up,

238
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,377
my toes are getting deformed
from wearing these shoes

239
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,423
and I got assholes like you
trying to feel me up.

240
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,425
Believe me, that was a mistake.

241
00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:47,774
Save it. Here.

242
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:49,138
I'll buy your shoes
for a quarter.

243
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,692
And the watch.

244
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:57,393
See, now, these,
I didn't steal, heh?

245
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:58,762
I'm not as bad as
you thought I was, heh?

246
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,310
No, you're a very decent guy,
Sybil.

247
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:02,007
Don't call me Sybil.

248
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,419
What do you want from me?
You got my clothes, all right?

249
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:05,184
Get out of here. Go!

250
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:09,754
Goddamn son of a bitch.

251
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,544
Come on, be home, be home.

252
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,029
Yeah? Mel, wake up!

253
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:24,552
I'm awake, I'm awake. What?

254
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:26,227
I got robbed. I'm underneath
the Manhattan Bridge.

255
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,687
He took everything.

256
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,298
He got my clothes,
he got my shoes, my watch.

257
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:32,213
Oh, my God, where?

258
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,868
Pike Slip.

259
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,999
Go get my clothes.

260
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:38,001
Okay, okay, yeah, okay.

261
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:41,310
Um, wait here.

262
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:55,891
I can't believe your timing.

263
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:58,023
I was in bed with a loan
officer from Chemical Bank.

264
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,461
Give me those.

265
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:02,114
And what is it
with these clothes?

266
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:03,507
Looks like
the cast of Miami Vice

267
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:05,117
crawled into your closet
and died.

268
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:06,205
He took my new shoes.

269
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:07,382
All right, all right.

270
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:08,576
Here. The bottoms were still shiny.

271
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,514
Fine, fine. Come on. And my watch.

272
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:11,342
Don't talk. Dress!

273
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:12,822
She was a blonde
with a downy lip.

274
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,694
Do you have any idea
how incredibly aroused I get

275
00:17:15,738 --> 00:17:17,435
by a woman with a downy lip?

276
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,393
You should have been here
earlier.

277
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:20,570
Mine needed a shave.

278
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:22,833
I can't believe it.
He took everything,

279
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,574
he took my cigarette lighter.

280
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:26,793
Pike Slip?
Who goes to Pike Slip?

281
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,771
I didn't go to Pike Slip,
he took me to Pike Slip.

282
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:30,231
I thought I was getting laid.

283
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:34,366
Down, up, down, up and up.

284
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:36,021
I can't go on a blind date.

285
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:37,979
Come on, it's been
a couple of months.

286
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,130
You've got to take the plunge.

287
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:41,113
Anyway, it's just dinner.

288
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,160
I'm getting hot
just thinking about it.

289
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:49,209
You sound like
you love what you do.

290
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:50,776
I love it.

291
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,040
I have always been
interested in soft drinks.

292
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,826
They're neat, they are clean,
you don't need a showroom,

293
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,567
they repeat.

294
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,571
They are an ideal product.

295
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,488
Was your family
in that business?

296
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:07,794
My father never did anything.

297
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,970
I hated him.

298
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:12,189
My mother was no bargain either.

299
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:15,105
I don't have a single relative
that I like.

300
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:17,282
They're users.

301
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:23,332
What I like about you
is I feel like I trust you.

302
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:26,509
You're not gonna
betray me, are you?

303
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:28,772
You must have had
a really rough childhood.

304
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,296
I don't let it get to me.

305
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,037
I don't let anything get to me.

306
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:36,172
If I'm not happy,
it's my own fault.

307
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,392
Look, as long as we've gotten
personal like this,

308
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:39,630
I have a list of all the people

309
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:40,674
that I've been intimate with

310
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:42,787
over the past eight years.

311
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,140
Can I ask to see yours
the next time we meet?

312
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,466
Dad? Is that you?

313
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,425
I almost didn't recognize you.

314
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:11,689
I can't believe you.

315
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:14,126
You look really weird.

316
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:16,911
I love those shoulders.

317
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:17,975
What have you got in there?

318
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:19,392
A box of Kleenex? Ha, ha.

319
00:19:19,436 --> 00:19:20,630
How you doing? What's in the bowl?

320
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:22,134
Rice and goulash.

321
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:23,788
We pictured you sitting at home

322
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,636
eating pizza and peanuts and
we don't want you to starve.

323
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,096
That's great. Thank you.

324
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,247
Listen,
if you're on your way out,

325
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:29,142
we can leave it
with the doorman.

326
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:30,448
Yeah, Mel's coming to get me.

327
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:32,145
We've got a, you know,
a business dinner.

328
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:33,755
Oh, well, we just
came by to say hello

329
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,584
and thought I'd just bring you
up to date.

330
00:19:36,628 --> 00:19:37,716
We'll call you tomorrow.

331
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,458
What? Up to date on what?

332
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:40,676
I'll call you tomorrow.

333
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,418
What? What is it? Aw, come on, tell him.

334
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:44,898
We're having a baby.

335
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:47,857
Ahhhh! Ha-ha-haahhhh!

336
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,904
Isn't that something? Whoa.

337
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:54,711
I knew we shouldn't
tell him in the street.

338
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,215
When? When? About the middle of June.

339
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:57,781
Ahhh, that's great.

340
00:19:57,825 --> 00:19:59,174
Yo, Stevie, let's go.

341
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,263
Mel, Judy's having a baby.

342
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:03,439
Little Judy!

343
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:05,876
I don't believe it, little Judy.

344
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,096
Ha-ha-hah.

345
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,402
Billy, wonderful, wonderful.

346
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:10,858
Listen, we've got
a couple of clients waiting.

347
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:12,057
Oh, yeah, okay.

348
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:13,537
We'll have dinner
this week, huh?

349
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,036
We'll celebrate. I'll
leave this with the...

350
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,298
Yeah, okay,
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

351
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:18,107
All right, bye. That's great, great.

352
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,022
Friends of his is having a baby.

353
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:21,633
Tina, Sherry, this is Steve.

354
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:24,070
Hi.Hi.

355
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:25,463
Come with me. MEL: What?

356
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:27,117
Where do you think...
Where you going?

357
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,466
What are you doing? Excuse us.

358
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,120
Come here.

359
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:31,338
What are you doing?

360
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:33,210
I don't think
I should go tonight.

361
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:35,779
What are you talking
about? It feels indecent.

362
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:36,930
You've been trying
to do something indecent

363
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:38,216
for six months now.

364
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:39,541
These girls are only
a couple of years older

365
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:40,827
than my daughter.

366
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,065
I'm sorry,
it's the best I can do.

367
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:43,414
Everyone at
the Beth Isreal Old Age Home

368
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:44,614
was busy tonight.

369
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:46,354
Get in the car. Some other time.

370
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:47,418
What's the rush?
What's the rush?

371
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:48,508
Listen, listen to me,
listen to me.

372
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:50,577
You've been divorced, rejected,

373
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:51,859
you're entitled to have
a little fun.

374
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,014
What are you waiting for?

375
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:53,841
An official telegram
from the Pope?

376
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,713
Get in the car.

377
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:12,818
- Hey, food's here.
- Dig in, dig in.

378
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:16,083
So what part of the music
business are you girls in?

379
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:18,172
Booking.

380
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:19,541
Yeah, I wanted to sing
when I started out,

381
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:22,785
but you're always on the road.

382
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:25,353
You get these skuzzy guys
hitting on you all the time.

383
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:26,789
I got to go to the john.

384
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,182
Me too.

385
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:31,839
See, what'd I tell you?
They're nice girls.

386
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:33,101
You don't think it's funny

387
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:35,451
they have to keep going
to the bathroom?

388
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,236
What? You got to have a girl
with a perfect bladder?

389
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,674
This one had white powder
on her upper lip.

390
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,042
I don't think
they're serving sugar donuts

391
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:44,417
in the ladies' room.

392
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:46,202
Don't ruin this.

393
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:48,900
These girls are open-minded
and convivial.

394
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:50,859
Modern progressive women.

395
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:52,643
Sluts.

396
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:53,949
Don't get ethical;

397
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:57,300
It inhibits
their sexual creativity.

398
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:05,788
♪ Whatcha gonna do
With my lovin'? ♪

399
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:10,270
♪ Please don't make me
Fantasize ♪

400
00:22:23,502 --> 00:22:25,897
Wait here, I'm just
walking her to the door.

401
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:37,778
Want to come up
for a cup of tea?

402
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:40,434
Cup of tea?

403
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:41,759
Yeah, sure.
That'd be great, sure.

404
00:22:41,783 --> 00:22:43,263
Okay.

405
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:54,754
It's a lot of stairs,
but I don't mind.

406
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:55,929
It keeps me in shape.

407
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:57,495
Yeah, it's great, great.

408
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,280
Oh, this is Shirley,
my roommate.

409
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:00,194
Hello. How do you do?

410
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,674
Have a seat.

411
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:04,981
Okay.

412
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:09,726
I've got fennel tea, linden tea,

413
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,773
hibiscus flowers
and rosehip tea.

414
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:14,209
What's the matter?

415
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:17,386
Uh, I get a spasm sometimes.

416
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,127
It's all right, it's okay.

417
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:23,262
Take off your jacket. No, I'm fine.

418
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:24,786
It's all right, it's all right.

419
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:26,328
No, take off your jacket. No,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

420
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:27,852
I shouldn't move,
no, I shouldn't move.

421
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:29,201
I know what I'm doing. No. I know,
but it's the...

422
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:31,444
Lay down. Oh, God. Ohh.

423
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:33,055
Aghhh!

424
00:23:36,712 --> 00:23:38,061
What are you doing?

425
00:23:38,104 --> 00:23:39,516
You know, I think
it's your sacroiliac.

426
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,648
I know what it is
and it shouldn't be moved.

427
00:23:40,672 --> 00:23:41,325
I know what to do. Listen, I...

428
00:23:41,368 --> 00:23:42,543
This goes here.

429
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,719
Oh, don't.This goes here.

430
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:46,983
Aagghhh!

431
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:47,810
Does it feel better now?

432
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:49,856
Oh, God, no.

433
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,336
Hmm.

434
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:53,947
You know what?

435
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:55,122
What?

436
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,428
I think you're too tense.

437
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:57,864
Well, I'm a little tense.

438
00:23:57,908 --> 00:24:00,345
You need to relax a little bit.

439
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:01,738
You know?

440
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,328
Maybe we should wait a minute.

441
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:26,765
Huh?

442
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:28,636
I think we should wait a minute.

443
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,859
Here.

444
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:35,035
You're gonna have to
put this on, honey.

445
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,705
Uh, listen, my back
feels a lot better.

446
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:55,186
I think I'd better get home.

447
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,971
You're going? Yeah, I think so.

448
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,714
I had a great time.

449
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:03,413
Thanks. See you shortly.

450
00:25:03,456 --> 00:25:07,156
Tina, it was great meeting you.

451
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:09,119
That's it, come on, come on,
hit it up, will you?

452
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:10,550
Come on.

453
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:11,857
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

454
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,685
Hey! Why didn't you duck?

455
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,208
Lightning reflexes.

456
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:16,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,995
You're great, you're wonderful.

458
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:20,910
What's the matter?
You're so morose.

459
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:24,391
Do you ever miss being married?

460
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:26,699
Why would I miss it?

461
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:28,266
You don't miss
being loved by somebody,

462
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:29,634
somebody who will make you
French toast

463
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:31,312
on a Sunday morning?

464
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:34,446
Somebody you can talk to
at night when you can't sleep?

465
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:36,491
I've always had someone
to talk to at night.

466
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,060
That's why my wife wouldn't
make me French toast.

467
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,760
You're a very shallow person,
you know that?

468
00:25:43,804 --> 00:25:46,328
What, having some woman make
fried bread for you is deep?

469
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:48,461
Ah, damn it, I'm not happy.

470
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:50,158
I want to get happy.

471
00:25:50,202 --> 00:25:52,858
What are you making such a big
deal about happiness for?

472
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,772
Look at me.

473
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:55,948
I trade all day against guys

474
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:58,472
who would cut my heart out
for an 1/8.

475
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,343
I drink too much,
I eat rich food,

476
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:01,667
I make love to women
half my age.

477
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,303
You think I'm happy?

478
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,830
That's the advantage
of being shallow.

479
00:26:16,752 --> 00:26:18,493
Sorry I'm late.
I got all jammed up.

480
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,452
Sure.

481
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,541
What would you like?
I already ordered.

482
00:26:22,585 --> 00:26:24,239
I don't know, anything,
it doesn't matter.

483
00:26:26,415 --> 00:26:28,721
Your hair looks nice.

484
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:30,071
It's just a rinse.

485
00:26:30,114 --> 00:26:32,290
I don't know
if I'm gonna keep it.

486
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:33,944
I don't know,

487
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:36,600
let me have a cutty sark
and a steak or something.

488
00:26:36,643 --> 00:26:37,707
So what are we... Our special today

489
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:39,168
is a lovely trout almondine.

490
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:41,474
Meat. Very well done.

491
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,128
A piece of burnt meat, okay?

492
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:44,651
Burnt meat? Fine. Okay.

493
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:45,914
Fine.

494
00:26:45,957 --> 00:26:47,698
So what are we
talking over here?

495
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:56,490
Has it been a problem for you,
meeting new people?

496
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:59,276
Problem?

497
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:02,845
I thought maybe we could
help each other out.

498
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:07,241
Like what, go on
double dates together?

499
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:11,332
No. It's worse than that.

500
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:14,988
Donna knows some women
who want to meet men

501
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:18,601
and they don't want to go
to bars or dating services.

502
00:27:18,645 --> 00:27:20,647
So, what do they do?

503
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,605
Oh, you're gonna hate this.

504
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,834
Okay, they have a party where
each woman invites a man,

505
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:35,706
a friend or somebody
they used to be married to,

506
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,753
and she introduces him
to everybody else.

507
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:42,148
Like a swap meet?

508
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:44,499
You know, you might find
somebody very interesting.

509
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:45,935
People do this?

510
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:47,502
I knew you'd hate this.

511
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:48,783
No, all right, fine.
You want to try it,

512
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,592
what the hell.
I'll try it. Fine.

513
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,376
Okay.

514
00:27:53,682 --> 00:27:55,162
Here's the address.

515
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:58,905
It's an artist loft
in Tribeca, Friday at 8.

516
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:00,144
Did you ever think
as long as we lived,

517
00:28:00,168 --> 00:28:02,257
we'd have a conversation
like this?

518
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,172
Not in a million years.

519
00:28:45,912 --> 00:28:47,653
Who did you bring?

520
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:49,742
I brought that guy
right over there, tall, dark.

521
00:28:49,785 --> 00:28:51,309
See the one? MAN: Yeah, I see, I see.

522
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:52,527
Yeah, I brought him

523
00:28:52,571 --> 00:28:54,012
and I brought
my other boyfriend too.

524
00:28:54,052 --> 00:28:56,010
Two? Which one's the other one?

525
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:57,751
He's a little chubbier.

526
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:04,018
Now, see, this one over here...

527
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,159
Hi, I'm Jackie Giardino.

528
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:15,813
Hi, I'm Dr. Dave Salisman.

529
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:18,860
Hello, Dr. Dave.

530
00:29:18,903 --> 00:29:21,211
Steve, I want you
to meet Eleanor Pederman.

531
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:22,604
Hello. Nice to meet you.

532
00:29:22,647 --> 00:29:24,103
Maybe you know her law firm,
Bender & Sachs?

533
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:25,389
Steve's on Wall Street.

534
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:26,564
Oh, who are you with?

535
00:29:26,608 --> 00:29:29,306
I have a seat on
the American Exchange.

536
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,655
Ahh.

537
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:33,528
What?

538
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,183
Well, you're not obsessed,
are you?

539
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:36,706
Obsessed?
What do you mean obsessed?

540
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:38,925
I've met a couple of traders.

541
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:40,555
Well, they were like
compulsive gamblers.

542
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,320
Oh, ho. I see.

543
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,602
Well, and I hear
they're all like that.

544
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,976
$50 says you're wrong.

545
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:47,630
Was that a joke?

546
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:52,418
Well, what do you do?

547
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:55,117
God, this is nice.

548
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,162
Paul Bunyan's hat rack.

549
00:29:57,206 --> 00:29:58,729
I like them.

550
00:29:58,772 --> 00:30:00,446
They have all these different
shapes and angles.

551
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,645
It all seems to balance.

552
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:03,126
So does a scale.

553
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,171
They're fun, strong-looking.

554
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:07,260
Please, the Polish army
is strong-looking.

555
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:10,045
I wouldn't want it standing
around in my living room.

556
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:14,049
I don't know, I just love
the human form.

557
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:15,747
Maybe it's because I'm a doctor.

558
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,576
Hi, Dr. Dave Salisman.

559
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,186
Hi, Doc.

560
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,057
Don't you love the human form?

561
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:22,624
Mostly on humans.

562
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:24,468
Oh, don't tell me,
your friend's the sculptor.

563
00:30:24,496 --> 00:30:28,587
No. I'm the sculptor.

564
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,025
Hah.

565
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:32,896
Actually I see someone over
here who is alone

566
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,854
and I think
she needs some company.

567
00:30:33,897 --> 00:30:35,508
Pardon me.

568
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:37,379
Sorry.

569
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:38,859
Hope you didn't bring him.

570
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:41,992
No, I actually brought him,
that's my ex-husband.

571
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:43,448
- Parasite.
- Where do you get your money?

572
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:45,823
You get your money
from people's misery.

573
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:48,870
Divorces, you get it
from when people die.

574
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,828
I help people invest

575
00:30:50,872 --> 00:30:52,110
and the reason
they want to invest,

576
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:53,534
they want to be part
of the economy.

577
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,920
And we got a liquid economy
because of what I do

578
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:57,445
down on Wall Street.

579
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,448
This is the longest
bull market in history.

580
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,947
I understand that... It doesn't matter

581
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:03,601
whether the market goes up
or whether it goes down,

582
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,385
people... look, I don't even
want to talk about it.

583
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:06,604
You don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

584
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:08,238
No, you don't listen.

585
00:31:08,282 --> 00:31:09,500
It was nice meeting you.

586
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:10,632
You're not leaving?

587
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:12,069
Oh, yes, I really
have got to go.

588
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:13,462
Listen, you're here

589
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:14,743
'cause you finished
with this guy, right?

590
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:15,594
So let him make
an ass of himself.

591
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:17,683
What do you care?

592
00:31:17,727 --> 00:31:19,337
I know I'm being foolish

593
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:24,342
and I'm getting
these awful gigantic hives.

594
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:26,563
Look, I'm sorry. No, listen, here.

595
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:29,392
I'm having an opening next
week and this is my new show.

596
00:31:29,435 --> 00:31:31,568
This is official. Will you come?

597
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:35,224
Jim Page? Yeah, well, that's my name,

598
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:38,531
but my family and people
who love me call me Doc.

599
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:40,031
Thanks, Jim. Let me tell you something.

600
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:41,361
Your alimony...

601
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:43,189
Your job is done already
by a computer.

602
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,886
Will you listen to me?

603
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,299
Pay attention to what
I'm talking about, will you?

604
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:47,280
You don't listen.

605
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:48,760
You don't listen.

606
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:51,284
I'm sorry, I really have to go.

607
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:55,202
You know,
I really do love your work.

608
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,509
I really do.
I want you to know that.

609
00:31:57,552 --> 00:31:58,660
I'll see you next week, right?

610
00:31:58,684 --> 00:31:59,946
Yes. Bye.

611
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:01,271
Bye. STEVE: But you don't listen.

612
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:02,818
In my job...

613
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:04,448
You got everything
written down in the computer

614
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:06,649
and you charge
the same amount of money.

615
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:08,042
Goodbye. Nice talking to you.

616
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:09,522
Goodbye.

617
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:10,760
Can't you deal with a woman?
This is...

618
00:32:10,784 --> 00:32:12,104
Goodnight.
I had a hell of a time.

619
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,375
I love these people
who have no idea

620
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,618
what happens on the Street

621
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:20,577
and then they have
all these theories.

622
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:25,147
Where are you going?

623
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,758
Oh, I embarrassed you, right?
You're ashamed of me, huh?

624
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:29,107
We made a mistake coming here.

625
00:32:29,151 --> 00:32:30,370
Let's just forget about it.

626
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:32,110
Let me tell you something.
I'm who I am.

627
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:34,156
If your friends don't like it,
the hell with them.

628
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,202
Oh, I love the spirit
of accommodation you have.

629
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,030
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I love it.

630
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:39,573
Accommodation.
Let me tell you something.

631
00:32:39,597 --> 00:32:41,686
I accommodated you for
26 years, don't forget that.

632
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,166
Uh, excuse me? We're divorced.

633
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:46,125
I don't have to have
this fight anymore.

634
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:47,997
I turned myself
inside out for you.

635
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,304
I jumped through hoops for you.

636
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:50,740
What hoops?

637
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:54,047
In the car, in the kitchen,
in the bedroom.

638
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:55,832
What do you mean,
in the bedroom?

639
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,275
You sure you're ready
for the truth?

640
00:32:57,312 --> 00:32:58,835
What hoops?

641
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:01,664
When we did it. How we did it.

642
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:03,754
If we did it.

643
00:33:03,797 --> 00:33:05,949
You think back through all the
time we've been married.

644
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:07,366
Think about it.

645
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,499
You never ever wanted me
when I wanted you,

646
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:10,761
that whole time.

647
00:33:10,804 --> 00:33:12,371
Think about it.

648
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:14,199
Because most of the time
you didn't want me.

649
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,287
You wanted sex.

650
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:18,247
You were who I wanted it with.

651
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:19,945
You never just wanted
to have sex, right,

652
00:33:19,988 --> 00:33:21,662
you always make love
to my whole person, right?

653
00:33:21,686 --> 00:33:22,991
Bullshit!

654
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:25,167
When you wanted to screw,
we screwed.

655
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,256
See if this can sink in, okay?

656
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,910
Making love does not start

657
00:33:28,954 --> 00:33:30,260
when you take your clothes off.

658
00:33:30,304 --> 00:33:32,611
It starts when
you talk to me at dinner

659
00:33:32,654 --> 00:33:35,483
or on the terrace fertilizing
my nasturtiums with me.

660
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:37,703
That's how you get me going.

661
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:39,661
Not by putting down
the Wall Street Journal,

662
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:42,447
grabbing my tits and sticking
your tongue in my mouth.

663
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,059
You never just sat and talked.

664
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,409
You never ever wanted
to just cuddle.

665
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:50,064
I hate that word. I hate it.

666
00:33:50,107 --> 00:33:52,066
Children cuddle.
Teddy bears cuddle.

667
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:53,676
I'm a grown man.

668
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,548
I see a desirable woman,
I get an erection.

669
00:33:55,591 --> 00:33:56,871
You see a couple of cantaloupes,

670
00:33:56,897 --> 00:33:57,855
you get an erection.

671
00:33:57,899 --> 00:33:59,291
Yes, yes.

672
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:01,337
But to please you, I cuddled.

673
00:34:01,381 --> 00:34:03,295
Oh, for 15 seconds.

674
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,385
From them on, you were
climbing all over me.

675
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:08,475
What did you want,
a husband or a penpal?

676
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:11,129
I'm not gonna let you
put down our sex life.

677
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,568
If there was something wrong
with the way we made love,

678
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:16,875
then I sure misinterpreted
a lot of moans and groans.

679
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:18,660
Let me tell you something,

680
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:20,357
what is this,
Entertainment Tonight?

681
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:21,967
Go buy a TV set.

682
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:23,534
Go upstairs, get out of here.

683
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:25,581
Let me tell you something.

684
00:34:25,624 --> 00:34:27,234
I desired you
more than you desired me,

685
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:30,499
that's what it was.

686
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:34,459
I ached for you,
but you were never there.

687
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:35,610
I tell you one thing, though,

688
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:37,549
I'm real happy
we had this little talk

689
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:40,423
'cause I'm beginning
to miss you a lot less.

690
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:46,080
To hell with her.
To hell with all of them.

691
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:47,188
From now on, I'm devoting myself

692
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:48,909
to food, alcohol and tennis.

693
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,737
Devote yourself
to watching the ball.

694
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:53,132
He's got a very tricky serve.
Pay attention.

695
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,134
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

696
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,621
Are you all right? I'm fine, I'm fine.

697
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:04,273
Come on, let's play another set.

698
00:35:04,317 --> 00:35:06,101
No, no.

699
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,732
Come on. I got a lot of carnal
energy to displace here.

700
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:10,280
Come on. Mel, hit with me,
come on, Barry, let's play.

701
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:11,475
I'm sorry.
I got surgery this morning.

702
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:12,674
One more.

703
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:14,241
We played. That's enough.

704
00:35:14,284 --> 00:35:16,156
Steve, three sets is enough,
all right.

705
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,549
- Mel, hit with me.
- Let's play.

706
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:20,683
All right. Come on.

707
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:21,684
But we'll take it easy.

708
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,207
Lightly.

709
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:24,687
Little warm down.

710
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,126
Look.

711
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,911
As long as I can hit
a nice backhand,

712
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:33,740
make a good trade,
what do I need with women?

713
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:34,959
Huh?

714
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:37,832
Hey! Easy. I said easy.

715
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:42,576
To hell with 'em.
I don't need 'em.

716
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:44,316
I'll live on the edge.

717
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,710
I'll live on adrenalin
and Chateau Lafite.

718
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:49,148
Steve.

719
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:51,628
Steve!

720
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,415
Steve, what is it?
What happened?

721
00:35:55,459 --> 00:35:56,678
God, it's his heart.

722
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:57,742
No, I'm all right,
I'm all right.

723
00:35:57,766 --> 00:35:58,810
It's okay. He looks pale.

724
00:35:58,854 --> 00:36:00,005
Do you have a pain
in your chest?

725
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:01,770
No, no, it's not a pain.

726
00:36:01,813 --> 00:36:03,139
It's like there's a little
Volkswagon sitting on it.

727
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:04,295
Myocardial infarction.

728
00:36:04,338 --> 00:36:05,078
How do you know what he's got?

729
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,253
He's the doctor.

730
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,559
I know, I know. Don't move.

731
00:36:07,603 --> 00:36:08,971
The slightest movement
could kill you.

732
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:10,736
I'm all right. It's nothing.
It's anguish.

733
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,043
Don't move, don't move.
Here, give him some air.

734
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:14,523
Take his pulse.

735
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:15,630
Why do you think
I'm holding his wrist?

736
00:36:15,654 --> 00:36:18,136
Look, it could just be anxiety.

737
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:19,877
Anxiety?
A man does not fall down

738
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,792
and turn white
because of anxiety.

739
00:36:21,835 --> 00:36:23,465
Take him to a hospital.
Give him an angiogram.

740
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:24,446
What are you? Crazy?

741
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,926
That's an operation.

742
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,556
Ah, simple procedure,
little tube in your groin,

743
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,714
up the vein, in your heart,
you're home the same day.

744
00:36:29,757 --> 00:36:31,063
Will you get out of here?

745
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,586
I'll call you
if I want a butcher.

746
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,892
Slowly, slowly.

747
00:36:33,935 --> 00:36:35,894
I'm gonna take you
to the hospital.

748
00:36:35,937 --> 00:36:37,852
See you get an EKG
to work off the energy.

749
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,332
How about a stress test?

750
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:40,788
I had a stress test
at that party last night.

751
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:42,311
Don't listen to him.
The man is delirious.

752
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:43,729
Phil, get your car,

753
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:44,923
we'll take him
right to the hospital.

754
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:45,774
I'm not going to the hospital.

755
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:46,949
I'm taking a shower.

756
00:36:46,993 --> 00:36:48,318
What are you talking about?
A shower?

757
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:49,711
At a time like this,
you take a shower?

758
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:50,755
If the man
wants to take a shower,

759
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:51,693
at least let him do it calmly.

760
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:52,844
He could be in cardiac arrest,

761
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:55,001
you're prescribing
soap and water?

762
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,923
Dr. Peterson says
your patient 405

763
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:04,098
has a very low white count.

764
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:05,597
Wants you to see him
as soon as you can.

765
00:37:05,621 --> 00:37:06,772
Oh, I'm gonna
have to get somebody else

766
00:37:06,796 --> 00:37:07,817
to work you up, Steve. Fine, fine.

767
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,079
Make sure
they do everything now.

768
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:11,541
Take some blood, sed rate... Over here.

769
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:12,498
Will you go down
to the Exchange?

770
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:13,891
Trading opens in 20 minutes.

771
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:15,335
I'll be there,
don't worry about it.

772
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:16,720
Alice, could you see

773
00:37:16,764 --> 00:37:17,828
if Dr. Hutton can examine
Mr. Giardino?

774
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:19,680
Who's Dr. Hutton? A fine doctor.

775
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:21,551
What are you waiting for? Fine.

776
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:22,552
You be examined,
I'll go to the Exchange.

777
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:23,814
Will you... Go in there

778
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:25,121
and take off your clothes.

779
00:37:25,164 --> 00:37:27,036
Do what the doctor says
and relax.

780
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:27,950
Whatever you do, relax.

781
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:29,429
Both of you relax, tachycardia

782
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:31,518
can be terrible for angina. Oh, really?

783
00:37:31,562 --> 00:37:32,694
I'd never heard of that.

784
00:37:35,697 --> 00:37:38,569
Mr. Giardino?
Hi, I'm Dr. Hutton.

785
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:39,963
Hello.

786
00:37:40,006 --> 00:37:40,746
Are you having
any chest pains now?

787
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,009
No, no.

788
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:45,359
Well, I'm just going to
listen to your heart.

789
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:47,100
Then I'll take
your blood pressure

790
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:48,164
and then we'll do
an electrocardiogram.

791
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:49,668
Okay.

792
00:37:49,712 --> 00:37:51,322
Just breathe normally.

793
00:38:05,946 --> 00:38:07,296
Have you ever been diagnosed

794
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,820
as having an irregular
heartbeat?

795
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:10,604
No, not that I can remember.

796
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:11,712
Any history of heart disease
in your family?

797
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:13,215
No, no.

798
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:14,390
How's your diet?

799
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:16,218
Chicken and fish.

800
00:38:16,262 --> 00:38:18,003
You exercise regularly?

801
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:21,224
I play tennis
three times a week.

802
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:22,225
Well, you don't look like you're

803
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:23,389
in all that bad shape to me.

804
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,291
Dr. Hutton!

805
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:44,248
This guy's gonna code
any second.

806
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,815
Can you help us?

807
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:46,859
I'll be right back.

808
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:49,559
Is there a BP?

809
00:38:49,602 --> 00:38:50,734
80/40.

810
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:52,214
Hook up the monitor.

811
00:38:54,346 --> 00:38:55,696
I've got the testings.

812
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,654
Let's get somebody in here
to ventilate.

813
00:38:57,698 --> 00:38:59,482
He's got no oral airway.

814
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:00,265
Was he brought in by ambulance?

815
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:01,614
Yes.

816
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:02,659
I'm not getting a BP.

817
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,184
VTAC. Start a line.

818
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:07,186
Give him 100 milligrams
of Lidocaine.

819
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,797
Charge the paddles.

820
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:11,364
Line's in.

821
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,020
Hands off. Now!

822
00:39:19,852 --> 00:39:20,940
Sinus rhythm.

823
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,420
All right! Way to go.

824
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:24,727
Start a Lidocaine drip,
4 milligrams per minute

825
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,424
and do a 12VDKG.

826
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:27,686
What's his name?

827
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,643
Ed Hogan.

828
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:31,038
Eddie?

829
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:33,432
Eddie, can you hear me?

830
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:35,521
Ed?

831
00:39:35,564 --> 00:39:37,610
You had a problem
with your heartbeat.

832
00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:39,786
You're going to be okay now.

833
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,831
You're in the hospital.

834
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:42,833
I'm Dr. Hutton.

835
00:39:42,876 --> 00:39:44,357
You're gonna be fine.

836
00:39:45,706 --> 00:39:47,490
They said it was urgent.

837
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:50,885
It is urgent. Doc called twice.

838
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:52,428
He wants to make sure
you go to his opening tonight

839
00:39:52,452 --> 00:39:53,496
at the gallery.

840
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,107
Look, what's the point?

841
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,065
Do you realize
how much younger he is?

842
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:58,676
What do you care?

843
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,505
An attractive, adorable man
wants to see you again.

844
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:03,551
What did you go
to the party for?

845
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:09,383
Oh, nice.
What happened to foreplay?

846
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:12,169
Look, I'm nearly a grandmother.

847
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:13,823
This makes me
very uncomfortable.

848
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:15,433
Look, just go for a few minutes.

849
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:16,889
I mean, I don't know
if you got a look

850
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:18,872
at that cute little
behind of his or not, but...

851
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:21,048
His behind?

852
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:22,242
You know,
you spend your whole day

853
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:24,312
arranging dates
for horny rodents

854
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,619
and it's really
changing your values.

855
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:28,317
Go for 10 minutes.

856
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,709
I got to hang up now,

857
00:40:29,753 --> 00:40:30,904
but give your mice
a cold shower.

858
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,147
Bye.

859
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:41,829
How's it going?
Feeling any better?

860
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,681
It's nothing.
Nerves, aggravation.

861
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:45,552
Stevie!

862
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:52,429
Uh, you want me to do it?

863
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:54,301
Why would I want you to do it?

864
00:40:54,345 --> 00:40:55,563
Audrey!

865
00:41:28,598 --> 00:41:30,862
You could have paid
3/8 for that 25,000.

866
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,037
Stock trading all around you

867
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,144
and you're just standing there.

868
00:41:33,168 --> 00:41:34,625
I wasn't standing.
I was thinking, all right.

869
00:41:34,649 --> 00:41:35,519
Why didn't you let me
execute the order?

870
00:41:35,563 --> 00:41:36,825
Relax, will you?

871
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,782
Now the market closed
and we blew it.

872
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:39,262
Leo, you got to help me out.

873
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:41,612
I owe a customer a report
on 25,000 Homotronics,

874
00:41:41,656 --> 00:41:42,787
what do you say, huh?

875
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,050
Nah, can't help you.

876
00:41:44,093 --> 00:41:45,051
Nah, come on,
the bell just rang,

877
00:41:45,094 --> 00:41:46,226
you can still hear it.

878
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,098
Come on.

879
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:51,536
I was examined by Dr. Hutton
and I have to talk to her.

880
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,364
It's an emergency. Is she there?

881
00:41:59,762 --> 00:42:02,287
Hello? It's Steve Giardino.

882
00:42:02,331 --> 00:42:03,898
There's something wrong.

883
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:07,249
My heart races
and it skips beats

884
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:10,295
and I get distracted.

885
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:13,385
Mr. Giardino,
I couldn't find anything.

886
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:15,605
Maybe you've suffered
some kind of anxiety attack.

887
00:42:15,648 --> 00:42:16,912
Sometimes when you're...

888
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:18,106
Well, yeah, yeah,
but it still bothers me.

889
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,872
Can I see you?

890
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:23,048
Can you come over
this afternoon?

891
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:25,442
Why don't we meet for
a drink and then, you know,

892
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:27,270
I'll go over
my whole history with you.

893
00:42:27,313 --> 00:42:30,796
I don't usually make
saloon calls.

894
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,756
Look, I've had
a very traumatic change

895
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,021
in my life lately and...

896
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:40,458
Hmm, Barry told me
you were divorced a while ago.

897
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:41,546
Is that what you mean?

898
00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:43,375
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

899
00:42:43,418 --> 00:42:45,072
About six months ago, yeah, so.

900
00:42:45,116 --> 00:42:48,075
Well, that might be
contributing to this.

901
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,165
Look, I really don't think
I can help you.

902
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:52,906
I just want to talk.

903
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:56,431
It would mean
a great deal to me.

904
00:42:56,475 --> 00:43:00,349
It would save my life,
that's what it would do.

905
00:43:02,003 --> 00:43:03,265
Hello?

906
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,616
Where would you want to meet?

907
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,357
How about the Oak Room?

908
00:43:08,401 --> 00:43:09,968
Six o'clock.

909
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:14,147
Sure you're all right?

910
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,583
You don't look too good.

911
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,266
It's all right,
I'm seeing a doctor later.

912
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:33,471
You're not saying much.

913
00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:37,998
Well, I'm going through

914
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:41,480
this very vulnerable time
right now

915
00:43:41,524 --> 00:43:46,181
and when this beautiful,
intelligent woman

916
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:48,748
put her hand on my shoulder,
my heart turned over.

917
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:49,967
It was kind of funny

918
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:51,795
hearing it flopping around
like that.

919
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,145
Yeah, yeah, so, see,

920
00:43:53,189 --> 00:43:56,192
I thought that if you were free,

921
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:57,932
I mean, if you weren't
married or anything

922
00:43:57,976 --> 00:43:59,673
and Barry told me
that you weren't...

923
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:08,118
I thought that we could
go out on sort of a date.

924
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:10,163
Are you always this roundabout?

925
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:11,904
No, no, no.

926
00:44:11,947 --> 00:44:15,038
I'm usually more direct.

927
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:18,302
According to my former wife,

928
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:21,393
something in the order
of a trainwreck.

929
00:44:21,436 --> 00:44:23,308
I'm trying to do this right.

930
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,355
What did you have in mind?

931
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:31,533
I have tickets
to the Knicks tonight.

932
00:44:31,577 --> 00:44:32,491
Do you want to go?

933
00:44:32,534 --> 00:44:34,711
Sure. Hahh!

934
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:21,631
Hello. WOMAN: Hi.

935
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:23,459
I had a good time tonight.

936
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:25,417
I don't usually
scream like that.

937
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:27,463
Screaming is good.
It helps your appetite.

938
00:45:27,506 --> 00:45:28,986
I used to scream a lot.

939
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:30,530
I was a real basketball freak
in high school.

940
00:45:30,554 --> 00:45:33,383
Yeah?

941
00:45:33,426 --> 00:45:35,226
Would you like to come up
for a cup of coffee?

942
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:39,954
Coffee.

943
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:41,715
Well, you're probably tired
and I have to get up early.

944
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,785
No, no. No, no, no, no,
coffee is good.

945
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:44,917
Let's have coffee. Good.

946
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,571
Listen, coffee's good.

947
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:09,551
This is my floor.

948
00:46:12,381 --> 00:46:14,427
Here's the thing.

949
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,621
I don't know
how this works anymore

950
00:46:15,645 --> 00:46:17,691
and it makes me nervous.

951
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,147
I'm gonna have to
do this step by step.

952
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:21,042
Okay.

953
00:46:21,085 --> 00:46:23,610
I definitely want
to have coffee with you.

954
00:46:23,653 --> 00:46:29,573
I really, really would like
to have coffee with you,

955
00:46:29,617 --> 00:46:31,271
but how would you feel
about dinner first?

956
00:46:31,314 --> 00:46:32,533
You don't mean tonight, right?

957
00:46:32,576 --> 00:46:35,231
It's 11 o'clock. No, no, tomorrow night.

958
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:37,799
I'll be at the hospital 'til 10.

959
00:46:37,842 --> 00:46:39,193
And then on Saturday,

960
00:46:39,236 --> 00:46:40,387
my best friend has a beach house

961
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:42,065
and I promised I'd visit.

962
00:46:42,108 --> 00:46:44,023
Well... Why don't you come along?

963
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,175
No, I don't want
to get in the way.

964
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:48,071
No, it'd be fun.

965
00:46:48,114 --> 00:46:50,116
Why don't you give me
a call tomorrow?

966
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,466
We'll work it out.

967
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,556
Okay. All right.

968
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,213
Uh, by the way, it was
just going to be coffee.

969
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,307
Perfect day. Fabulous.

970
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,526
I can't believe it.

971
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,527
What do you have in there?

972
00:47:07,571 --> 00:47:09,094
Coffee? Coffee and cognac.

973
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:10,791
Why do you think
you can't sleep at night?

974
00:47:10,835 --> 00:47:12,532
Ah, here we go.

975
00:47:12,576 --> 00:47:13,596
What do you tell your patient?

976
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,926
Yeah, what do I tell my patient?

977
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,362
Did she examine you? Yeah.

978
00:47:16,406 --> 00:47:18,973
Did she tell you not coffee? Yeah.

979
00:47:19,017 --> 00:47:21,194
You are really a pisser.

980
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,718
If you're not in too deep,
I'd get out now.

981
00:47:23,762 --> 00:47:25,807
Yeah, well, don't make me
out to be the crazy one.

982
00:47:25,851 --> 00:47:27,002
I don't have
this neurotic compulsion

983
00:47:27,026 --> 00:47:29,158
to swim in ice water.

984
00:47:29,202 --> 00:47:31,987
First day of spring, he swims.

985
00:47:32,031 --> 00:47:34,121
One year he went in
during a snow storm.

986
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:35,964
I'm gonna go down and see
if it's cold enough.

987
00:47:37,603 --> 00:47:38,995
What is he, an old boyfriend?

988
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:41,084
No, he's my best friend.

989
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:42,497
How does he know
you don't sleep at night?

990
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:44,218
I told him.

991
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:49,006
What else do you tell him?

992
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:52,009
Everything. He's my best friend.

993
00:47:52,053 --> 00:47:54,403
I think we're having
a generation problem here.

994
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:56,753
I thought you had to be
a generation apart for that.

995
00:47:56,797 --> 00:47:58,277
Ya-ha-hoo!

996
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,061
It's perfect.

997
00:48:00,104 --> 00:48:01,715
My fingers are paralyzed.

998
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:03,892
Ah, that's wonderful.

999
00:48:03,935 --> 00:48:05,459
Great.

1000
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:09,027
Yaaaaa-haa-hooo.

1001
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:12,988
Go for it, go, go!

1002
00:48:14,903 --> 00:48:18,908
Aghh! It's cold!

1003
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:24,435
Go, go, go. Ha, ha.

1004
00:48:24,479 --> 00:48:26,263
That's great.

1005
00:48:27,873 --> 00:48:29,092
What are you doing?

1006
00:48:29,135 --> 00:48:30,529
Gonna take a little dip.

1007
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:31,487
Are you serious?

1008
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:32,792
Yeah, why not?

1009
00:48:32,836 --> 00:48:33,900
You're really gonna go
in the water?

1010
00:48:33,924 --> 00:48:35,447
Yeah, yeah, why not?

1011
00:48:35,491 --> 00:48:37,841
Hey, Eric, look at this.

1012
00:48:37,884 --> 00:48:40,060
All right!

1013
00:48:40,104 --> 00:48:41,932
Come on!

1014
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:47,286
Ha, ha, ha.

1015
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,983
Go, Steve!

1016
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:51,464
Ha, ha, all right!

1017
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:59,343
Oh, God! I'm not gonna die.

1018
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:00,996
I'm not gonna die.

1019
00:49:07,568 --> 00:49:08,589
I shouldn't still be shivering.

1020
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,223
I should be warm by now.

1021
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:12,313
You are warm. You have a fever.

1022
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:16,424
I tried to go
to the bathroom before.

1023
00:49:16,448 --> 00:49:18,319
I fell down in the closet.

1024
00:49:18,363 --> 00:49:20,582
You'll be okay.

1025
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:22,367
I think you've got
a little pneumonia.

1026
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,561
Don't go away.
Come back. Come here.

1027
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:24,804
I'm here.

1028
00:49:24,848 --> 00:49:26,459
You started to get small.

1029
00:49:26,502 --> 00:49:28,112
I'm right here.
Take these pills.

1030
00:49:28,156 --> 00:49:31,725
You know, I think
about your chin all the time.

1031
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,553
I love your chin.

1032
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,250
What do you think
to getting married?

1033
00:49:35,293 --> 00:49:37,948
I think it's a little
too soon to talk about that.

1034
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:41,866
I'm much better.

1035
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,346
Yes. More in control.

1036
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,956
You are.

1037
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:50,179
I'll be all right.

1038
00:50:29,439 --> 00:50:31,745
That was quick.

1039
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:33,965
Are you going home to read
War and Peace before dinner?

1040
00:50:34,008 --> 00:50:35,924
I felt a small hive
starting here.

1041
00:50:35,968 --> 00:50:37,752
Again? Yes.

1042
00:50:37,796 --> 00:50:39,426
Come on in. I've got
something to show you.

1043
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,670
Come in.

1044
00:50:42,714 --> 00:50:45,151
You're the only woman I know
with pet hives.

1045
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:48,000
Now, do you remember
at the party

1046
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:49,088
when you said that you felt

1047
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:51,071
my work had a sense of balance?

1048
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:52,768
Yes. Do you?

1049
00:50:52,812 --> 00:50:54,006
Right, because I've been
thinking about that.

1050
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,684
Now, come on.

1051
00:50:55,728 --> 00:50:57,860
I want you to stand right there.

1052
00:50:57,904 --> 00:51:00,080
Now, I made this for you.

1053
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,087
It balances.

1054
00:51:08,611 --> 00:51:10,787
You thought about me
when you made this?

1055
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,922
I thought about you
when I wasn't making it too.

1056
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:19,928
What do you have in mind here?

1057
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:24,193
Well, I don't know.

1058
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:25,673
Exploring.

1059
00:51:28,066 --> 00:51:30,548
Oh, there's a really big one
starting up my arm.

1060
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:34,030
Why, is there a problem?

1061
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:36,380
You're somewhat younger
than I am,

1062
00:51:36,423 --> 00:51:37,729
have you noticed?

1063
00:51:37,773 --> 00:51:38,773
So?

1064
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:41,733
You need to work on something.

1065
00:51:41,777 --> 00:51:44,911
You're too worried about
what other people think.

1066
00:51:44,955 --> 00:51:47,435
I'm gonna take you
to lunch tomorrow.

1067
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,915
Are you free?

1068
00:51:48,959 --> 00:51:50,656
I can't.

1069
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,353
No, no. I want you
to meet somebody.

1070
00:51:52,397 --> 00:51:53,790
Who?

1071
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:54,854
Oh, there's a waiter there.

1072
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:57,490
I think you ought to meet him.

1073
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,623
I don't think we ought to
take this any further.

1074
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,625
No, no, no. You listen to me.

1075
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:03,278
Nothing I've ever done
in my life

1076
00:52:03,322 --> 00:52:06,673
has ever meant anything
unless it started in here.

1077
00:52:06,717 --> 00:52:08,588
I don't know how,
but somehow you got in here.

1078
00:52:08,632 --> 00:52:10,329
That's all I care about.

1079
00:52:12,158 --> 00:52:14,813
I mean, I don't care
what anyone thinks.

1080
00:52:14,856 --> 00:52:17,511
You come with me tomorrow,
I'll prove that.

1081
00:52:17,555 --> 00:52:19,208
Say you will.

1082
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:20,819
Say you'll come.

1083
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,562
Okay.

1084
00:52:26,565 --> 00:52:28,349
Do you know this place?

1085
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:29,393
No.

1086
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:31,657
No? Right.

1087
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,528
You sit right there.

1088
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,097
I'll be right back.

1089
00:53:03,168 --> 00:53:04,343
You're a waiter?

1090
00:53:04,387 --> 00:53:07,870
No, I'm a sculptor.

1091
00:53:07,913 --> 00:53:10,263
See, what's important
is how I look at it.

1092
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:15,660
The way I look at it,

1093
00:53:15,704 --> 00:53:17,662
you're a beautiful,
intelligent woman,

1094
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:20,318
who likes good art.

1095
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:21,512
Maybe you're
a little too young for me,

1096
00:53:21,536 --> 00:53:24,104
but I don't mind.

1097
00:53:28,979 --> 00:53:30,633
You see anything you want?

1098
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,595
Well, I'm thinking about that.

1099
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:40,165
Did you see my face today?

1100
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:42,428
I'm happy. I'm like a kid.

1101
00:53:42,471 --> 00:53:43,995
You're like someone
with brain damage.

1102
00:53:44,038 --> 00:53:45,823
Twice you tried to trade
at the wrong post.

1103
00:53:45,866 --> 00:53:47,520
This woman is incredible.

1104
00:53:47,563 --> 00:53:51,481
He's crazy. And he's fun.

1105
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:53,919
And he brings me things.

1106
00:53:53,962 --> 00:53:56,661
Muffins, pastries,
always some kind of food.

1107
00:53:56,704 --> 00:53:58,358
Ha, ha, ha.

1108
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,578
And he's sweet.

1109
00:54:01,622 --> 00:54:03,712
Is your father a doctor too?

1110
00:54:03,756 --> 00:54:07,368
No, he worked in a steel mill.

1111
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,065
Big day for him
when I got into Columbia.

1112
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:11,502
Right. Big day for all of us.

1113
00:54:13,591 --> 00:54:15,725
Were both your parents Italian?

1114
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:19,076
No, my mother's Irish.

1115
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:22,950
I'm Italian on my father's side.

1116
00:54:25,692 --> 00:54:27,563
My mother's family was German

1117
00:54:29,304 --> 00:54:34,092
and a little French
somewhere back there.

1118
00:55:11,176 --> 00:55:12,351
It opens from the front.

1119
00:55:12,394 --> 00:55:13,787
Oh.

1120
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:34,940
I leave you for two seconds
and you're asleep?

1121
00:55:34,983 --> 00:55:37,812
Come here.
I got some nice stuff for us.

1122
00:55:37,856 --> 00:55:40,250
Cold pizza, ice cream and beer.

1123
00:55:40,294 --> 00:55:44,385
It's 5 in the morning.
No wonder I'm zoning out.

1124
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:46,058
You weren't asleep while
we were making love, were you?

1125
00:55:46,082 --> 00:55:48,868
Just during the slow parts.

1126
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:50,217
What are you doing?

1127
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,958
Do you ever have this
on ice cream?

1128
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:53,874
What? Red pepper.
It's really good.

1129
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:54,788
On ice cream? Oh, it's great.

1130
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:56,485
Come here. Take some.

1131
00:55:56,528 --> 00:55:58,269
I don't think I'm hungry.

1132
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:01,577
Mm, it's good. Mm.

1133
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,883
Hey, hey, come on.

1134
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,058
I don't mind you falling

1135
00:56:04,101 --> 00:56:04,885
asleep while I make love to you,

1136
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,236
but not while I eat.

1137
00:56:07,279 --> 00:56:08,604
Come on, there's something
perverted about that.

1138
00:56:08,628 --> 00:56:10,979
And don't let me oversleep.

1139
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:14,915
I'll drop you off at work
on my way downtown.

1140
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:16,308
Then I'll pick you up again
right after work, okay?

1141
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:17,986
Mm.

1142
00:56:18,029 --> 00:56:19,137
Then I'll drop you off
again the next morning

1143
00:56:19,161 --> 00:56:20,772
and pick you up at night.

1144
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:34,110
No, what were you like
when you were a kid?

1145
00:56:34,134 --> 00:56:35,222
Did you have heroes?

1146
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,137
Yeah.

1147
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:39,792
Yeah, in high school,
Mr. Callifarno.

1148
00:56:39,836 --> 00:56:41,228
He led the marching band

1149
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:46,799
and he had this sexy deep
voice and soft eyes.

1150
00:56:46,843 --> 00:56:48,802
I learned to play the tuba

1151
00:56:48,846 --> 00:56:51,631
and came away
with a great pucker.

1152
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:52,782
No, wait, wait,
was that the year

1153
00:56:52,806 --> 00:56:54,721
that you had scarlet fever?

1154
00:56:54,764 --> 00:56:56,766
How do you remember
all this stuff?

1155
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,030
Well, I'm interested.

1156
00:56:59,073 --> 00:57:03,035
You know, I don't know
if this is calculated or what,

1157
00:57:03,078 --> 00:57:05,211
but you are definitely
getting to me.

1158
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:11,347
You know what you can do
right now?

1159
00:57:11,391 --> 00:57:12,914
What?

1160
00:57:14,785 --> 00:57:17,920
Get you home so you can study.

1161
00:57:17,964 --> 00:57:20,096
You've got a big exam tomorrow.

1162
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,404
Okay.

1163
00:57:28,191 --> 00:57:29,778
I've just never gone through
anything like this before,

1164
00:57:29,802 --> 00:57:31,500
you know?

1165
00:57:31,543 --> 00:57:33,589
He thinks that
every single thing that I do

1166
00:57:33,632 --> 00:57:34,982
is fascinating.

1167
00:57:35,025 --> 00:57:39,725
Ooh, that is a nice change.

1168
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:41,858
Yeah, I used to beg Steve
to come up here with me

1169
00:57:41,902 --> 00:57:43,009
and he wouldn't even sit there

1170
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:44,731
and read the paper while I dug.

1171
00:57:44,775 --> 00:57:45,689
And Doc comes up?

1172
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:48,126
Oh, yeah.

1173
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:51,129
He made me a salad
out of nasturtiums.

1174
00:57:51,173 --> 00:57:54,045
He couldn't just read the paper?

1175
00:57:54,089 --> 00:57:57,180
Oh, God, he's totally
unlike Steve.

1176
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,922
He doesn't ignore me,
he doesn't...

1177
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:02,402
He doesn't interrupt me,
he doesn't...

1178
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:03,534
What?

1179
00:58:03,577 --> 00:58:05,362
Oh, you know.

1180
00:58:05,405 --> 00:58:06,885
What?

1181
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:08,756
The way... do you know the way

1182
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,951
Steve always used to grab at me

1183
00:58:09,975 --> 00:58:11,630
all the time?
He doesn't do that.

1184
00:58:11,673 --> 00:58:14,676
Hasn't there been anything?

1185
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,418
There's been
a little kissing, a little...

1186
00:58:18,985 --> 00:58:20,334
Well, basically, that's it.

1187
00:58:20,378 --> 00:58:23,816
A little kissing and it's warm
and it's friendly

1188
00:58:23,859 --> 00:58:28,648
and it's filled with respect
and it's making me sick.

1189
00:58:28,691 --> 00:58:30,519
He definitely needs a signal.

1190
00:58:30,563 --> 00:58:33,609
Oh, I looked in his eyes.

1191
00:58:33,653 --> 00:58:37,178
I have let my hand sort of

1192
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,007
linger on his thigh.

1193
00:58:39,051 --> 00:58:40,550
I mean, what do I need to do?
Get in the 6 o'clock news?

1194
00:58:40,574 --> 00:58:42,880
Yes.

1195
00:58:54,023 --> 00:58:55,982
Excuse me.

1196
00:58:56,025 --> 00:58:57,026
Hello.

1197
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,549
Hello.

1198
00:58:58,593 --> 00:59:01,988
Do you have a table
for one, please?

1199
00:59:02,031 --> 00:59:04,425
Oh, sure, how's that?

1200
00:59:04,468 --> 00:59:06,297
That looks nice.

1201
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:22,053
What do you have that's good?

1202
00:59:22,097 --> 00:59:24,273
Well, everything's good.
What would you like?

1203
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:32,759
I was thinking of something
hot, spicy.

1204
00:59:35,459 --> 00:59:38,418
Something stir-fried?

1205
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:47,950
I don't know.
Something slow-cooked.

1206
00:59:47,994 --> 00:59:51,650
You know, something
that'll take all afternoon.

1207
00:59:54,348 --> 00:59:56,089
Do you have anything like that?

1208
00:59:58,613 --> 00:59:59,832
Hm?

1209
01:00:24,293 --> 01:00:29,560
Oh, I've got to
get home and change.

1210
01:00:29,604 --> 01:00:33,260
Oh, I can't go to class

1211
01:00:33,303 --> 01:00:35,827
in the same outfit
I wore yesterday.

1212
01:00:37,481 --> 01:00:39,048
I'll loan you a sweater.

1213
01:00:42,312 --> 01:00:43,271
You'll look different.

1214
01:00:43,314 --> 01:00:45,142
Yeah, maybe.

1215
01:00:45,186 --> 01:00:49,059
Maybe if I wear a sweater,
nobody'll notice.

1216
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:55,979
Or maybe I'll just skip class.

1217
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:09,124
Have you seen
these freckles on your back?

1218
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:11,692
These colors are incredible.
I'm gonna get a mirror.

1219
01:01:11,736 --> 01:01:12,737
You've got to see this.

1220
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,957
I think I have to sleep now.

1221
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,964
I love the way your hand
comes out of your wrist.

1222
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:47,861
This is organically grown
and water decaffeinated.

1223
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,429
Oh, I got to go home,

1224
01:01:50,472 --> 01:01:53,128
I haven't changed clothes
for three days.

1225
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:56,175
You haven't worn them
for three days.

1226
01:01:56,218 --> 01:01:57,480
That's true. The hell with it.

1227
01:02:06,273 --> 01:02:08,013
I got it. Steady.

1228
01:02:09,885 --> 01:02:11,408
I'm gonna put this one
in the bedroom.

1229
01:02:11,452 --> 01:02:12,690
Let's just live with it
for a while.

1230
01:02:12,714 --> 01:02:14,324
What do you think?

1231
01:02:14,368 --> 01:02:16,370
I don't believe how big it is.

1232
01:02:16,413 --> 01:02:19,590
It is so huge.

1233
01:02:19,634 --> 01:02:20,960
Wow, listen, it looks
pretty good right here.

1234
01:02:20,984 --> 01:02:24,030
Let's just leave it out here.

1235
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,423
Sure, why not?

1236
01:02:40,222 --> 01:02:41,658
Hello.

1237
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:42,963
Billy?

1238
01:02:43,007 --> 01:02:44,008
Is everything all right?

1239
01:02:45,357 --> 01:02:47,577
When?

1240
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,753
Is she okay?

1241
01:02:49,928 --> 01:02:51,059
I'll be right over.

1242
01:02:51,103 --> 01:02:52,365
Bye.

1243
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:53,453
Judy just had a baby boy.

1244
01:02:53,497 --> 01:02:54,541
Whooo!

1245
01:02:54,585 --> 01:02:57,283
Ho-ah-ha-hah!

1246
01:03:03,508 --> 01:03:04,857
Steve!

1247
01:03:07,076 --> 01:03:08,513
I don't know if you remember
or not,

1248
01:03:08,556 --> 01:03:10,012
but Judy was born
at 4 in the morning too.

1249
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:10,950
No, no, I didn't.

1250
01:03:10,993 --> 01:03:12,212
4:07. Yeah?

1251
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:13,909
Yeah. Oh, this is Steve.

1252
01:03:13,953 --> 01:03:15,171
Steve, hi, I'm Doc.

1253
01:03:15,215 --> 01:03:16,130
How are you? Congratulations.

1254
01:03:16,173 --> 01:03:17,610
Thank you. This is Kay.

1255
01:03:17,653 --> 01:03:18,524
Kay, how are you?

1256
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:19,699
Jackie. Hi.

1257
01:03:19,742 --> 01:03:20,656
Hello, congratulations.

1258
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,310
Thank you.

1259
01:03:22,354 --> 01:03:23,940
See, this is really weird,
but I had this feeling

1260
01:03:23,964 --> 01:03:25,400
the minute that the phone rang,

1261
01:03:25,444 --> 01:03:27,054
I said, Jackie, pick it up,

1262
01:03:27,097 --> 01:03:27,837
you've got a grandchild.

1263
01:03:27,881 --> 01:03:29,666
Oh, yeah?

1264
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,775
This is a family visit, I'll
wait for you in the lobby.

1265
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:33,148
Yeah, I'll wait down here too.

1266
01:03:33,191 --> 01:03:34,821
All right, now you give her
a kiss for me.

1267
01:03:34,845 --> 01:03:36,258
Tell her I did the tarot cards
on this, all right?

1268
01:03:36,282 --> 01:03:37,805
Okay.

1269
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:38,936
You know what I got?

1270
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,417
The sun, the world,
the nine of cups.

1271
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:43,246
Kid's got it made.

1272
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:48,643
I hear from Judy he's a waiter.

1273
01:03:48,686 --> 01:03:50,862
During the day.

1274
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:51,863
And his name is Doc?

1275
01:03:51,907 --> 01:03:53,300
Hm-mm.

1276
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,914
You're laughing at his name?

1277
01:03:57,957 --> 01:03:59,307
Neil Simon is Doc.

1278
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:01,091
Albert Schweitzer is Doc.

1279
01:04:01,134 --> 01:04:03,136
A psychic waiter is not Doc.

1280
01:04:05,356 --> 01:04:06,879
I don't think
it's any of your business

1281
01:04:06,923 --> 01:04:10,143
if I live with a guy
named Dopey or Sneezy.

1282
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:12,669
You're living with him?

1283
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:14,560
I notice you didn't come here
unaccompanied yourself

1284
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,716
at 5 o'clock in the morning.

1285
01:04:20,633 --> 01:04:22,418
Just... Yeah, all right, all right.

1286
01:04:25,813 --> 01:04:27,380
Hi.

1287
01:04:27,424 --> 01:04:29,469
You both came.

1288
01:04:29,513 --> 01:04:30,775
Did you see him?

1289
01:04:30,818 --> 01:04:34,387
He's got these tiny little
fingernails.

1290
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:36,258
He is so beautiful.

1291
01:04:36,302 --> 01:04:37,129
He looks so good.
You won't believe it.

1292
01:04:37,172 --> 01:04:38,478
Thanks for coming.

1293
01:04:38,523 --> 01:04:40,089
Oh, you've got to go down
and see him.

1294
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:41,047
She looks beautiful.

1295
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,527
Doesn't she?

1296
01:05:13,603 --> 01:05:16,345
Mmm, aaahhh.

1297
01:05:16,389 --> 01:05:18,086
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

1298
01:05:18,129 --> 01:05:20,959
Don't do that. No, no.

1299
01:05:21,003 --> 01:05:25,007
Oh, don't do that.

1300
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:28,184
Oh, oh, that's good. It's good.

1301
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:36,411
Ah, leave it this way.

1302
01:05:36,454 --> 01:05:37,673
I like it. No.

1303
01:05:37,716 --> 01:05:39,128
I want to see you
the way you really are.

1304
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:40,260
Oh, good,
I'll go to the dentist,

1305
01:05:40,284 --> 01:05:41,304
have him take the caps
off my teeth.

1306
01:05:41,328 --> 01:05:43,113
Leave it. I like it.

1307
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:44,419
All right, what the hell.

1308
01:05:44,462 --> 01:05:46,159
Yeah, probably be seeing
a lot of it.

1309
01:05:46,203 --> 01:05:47,727
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

1310
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:49,163
I thought
we ought to get married.

1311
01:05:49,207 --> 01:05:50,426
Oh, good.

1312
01:05:52,776 --> 01:05:55,648
Ahhhh! Ha-ha-haahhhh!

1313
01:05:57,258 --> 01:05:58,825
Judy, he's wonderful.

1314
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,047
Sweetie! Ah, isn't he pretty.

1315
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:04,179
I think he needs to be changed.

1316
01:06:04,223 --> 01:06:06,268
Can I do it? Oh, sure.

1317
01:06:06,312 --> 01:06:10,098
Oh, yes, Steve, come on.

1318
01:06:10,142 --> 01:06:11,578
What?

1319
01:06:11,622 --> 01:06:12,753
We're gonna change the baby.

1320
01:06:12,797 --> 01:06:15,277
I saw the baby
being changed before.

1321
01:06:15,321 --> 01:06:17,672
We're not going to see it.
We're going to do it.

1322
01:06:17,716 --> 01:06:21,589
Aren't we, we're gonna
take good care of my guy.

1323
01:06:21,633 --> 01:06:23,286
My baby guy.

1324
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:25,332
Come on.

1325
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:27,334
There, sweetheart.

1326
01:06:27,377 --> 01:06:30,164
Aw, he's so cute.

1327
01:06:30,207 --> 01:06:31,861
Hand me the diaper.

1328
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,689
Hello, sweetheart.

1329
01:06:33,733 --> 01:06:37,388
Oh, gosh,
what a good guy you are.

1330
01:06:37,432 --> 01:06:38,912
Of course I want one.

1331
01:06:38,955 --> 01:06:40,653
Well, I can't, I can't.

1332
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:41,654
I'm too old to go
through that again.

1333
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:42,872
Too old.

1334
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,440
I am. I'm too old.

1335
01:06:44,484 --> 01:06:45,635
You play tennis
three times a week.

1336
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:47,008
You're too feeble
to lift a baby?

1337
01:06:47,051 --> 01:06:49,489
Kay, come on.

1338
01:06:49,532 --> 01:06:52,100
Before a kid of ours
even got out of high school,

1339
01:06:52,143 --> 01:06:54,494
I'd be 70 years old.

1340
01:06:54,537 --> 01:06:56,515
I mean, how long do you think
I'm gonna be around for?

1341
01:06:56,539 --> 01:06:57,410
Don't you think
I've thought of that?

1342
01:06:57,454 --> 01:06:58,934
I'm a doctor.

1343
01:06:58,977 --> 01:07:00,892
I know what I can
probably expect with you.

1344
01:07:00,936 --> 01:07:02,459
You drink, you smoke,
you eat junk.

1345
01:07:02,503 --> 01:07:03,504
Yeah, so?

1346
01:07:03,547 --> 01:07:04,896
So when you go,

1347
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:06,637
you may not just pass away
in your sleep.

1348
01:07:06,681 --> 01:07:08,789
You may have a stroke first
and I'll have to nurse you

1349
01:07:08,813 --> 01:07:11,600
for two or three years
while you fade away.

1350
01:07:11,643 --> 01:07:13,043
But I love you
and the way I see it,

1351
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:15,778
love is responsibility.

1352
01:07:15,821 --> 01:07:18,084
You don't know what it's like.

1353
01:07:18,128 --> 01:07:20,870
It takes over
your whole life, you know.

1354
01:07:20,913 --> 01:07:23,176
Fatigue, night nursing,
the constant worry

1355
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:26,354
about diaper rash and roseola.

1356
01:07:26,398 --> 01:07:29,227
The next time we have sex
will be in the year 2004.

1357
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:31,359
If you get lucky.

1358
01:07:45,592 --> 01:07:47,159
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1359
01:07:47,202 --> 01:07:48,745
Why is everybody
trying to pressure this man

1360
01:07:48,769 --> 01:07:50,292
into having a baby?

1361
01:07:50,336 --> 01:07:51,356
He doesn't want one,
he doesn't want one.

1362
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:52,992
End of discussion.

1363
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:54,709
All Steve has to do is
contribute a few spermatozoa.

1364
01:07:54,733 --> 01:07:55,821
He already gave.

1365
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,518
The man has a grown daughter.

1366
01:07:57,562 --> 01:07:58,974
Everybody has an opinion
about my spermatozoa.

1367
01:07:58,998 --> 01:08:00,434
Yeah. This is important stuff.

1368
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,262
This is the issue of his loins.

1369
01:08:02,305 --> 01:08:04,545
What makes you people think
this is any of your business?

1370
01:08:07,007 --> 01:08:08,071
Discussing
the issue of my loins.

1371
01:08:08,095 --> 01:08:09,115
What is this? Hey, I'm on your side.

1372
01:08:09,139 --> 01:08:10,837
It's not up for discussion.

1373
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,815
There are only two opinions
that count on this subject.

1374
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,450
Not two. One. Hers.

1375
01:08:15,493 --> 01:08:16,906
You know, she's got
a biological clock

1376
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,279
ticking inside of her.

1377
01:08:18,322 --> 01:08:19,778
Oh, please,
I got a biological clock too.

1378
01:08:19,802 --> 01:08:20,978
It's called decrepitude.

1379
01:08:21,022 --> 01:08:21,849
He's right. Look at this.

1380
01:08:21,892 --> 01:08:23,154
This is an old man.

1381
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,114
What are you talking, old man...?

1382
01:08:26,157 --> 01:08:27,898
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1383
01:08:27,942 --> 01:08:32,599
I want to hear from Kay.
What do you want?

1384
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:34,471
I guess I want
more meaning in my life.

1385
01:08:34,514 --> 01:08:36,342
I love my work

1386
01:08:36,386 --> 01:08:37,842
and I wouldn't give it up
for anything,

1387
01:08:37,866 --> 01:08:40,433
but I don't want to give up
having a baby either.

1388
01:08:44,046 --> 01:08:45,700
Listen to me.

1389
01:08:45,743 --> 01:08:48,573
I never had any kids
and I don't miss it.

1390
01:08:48,617 --> 01:08:50,575
Kids tie you down.

1391
01:08:50,619 --> 01:08:52,272
You can't just take off
when you got kids.

1392
01:08:52,316 --> 01:08:53,186
Kids are a pain in the ass.

1393
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:55,014
Oh!

1394
01:08:55,058 --> 01:08:56,513
You know, maybe women look
at this differently, Mel.

1395
01:08:56,537 --> 01:08:58,235
Women and other humans.

1396
01:08:58,278 --> 01:08:59,715
Somebody read a book.

1397
01:08:59,758 --> 01:09:02,849
Oh, excuse me
for having a brain.

1398
01:09:02,893 --> 01:09:04,348
Listen to me,
all the books in the world...

1399
01:09:04,372 --> 01:09:05,373
You can't know what...

1400
01:09:16,951 --> 01:09:18,320
If this isn't
going to lead to a baby,

1401
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:20,389
then I have to know now.

1402
01:09:20,433 --> 01:09:23,218
I don't have a couple of years
I can play with.

1403
01:09:23,262 --> 01:09:24,829
How can you just
walk away from me?

1404
01:09:24,872 --> 01:09:27,353
How can you tell me
I have to give this up?

1405
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:28,635
It may not mean anything
to your friend, Mel,

1406
01:09:28,659 --> 01:09:30,705
but it means a lot to me.

1407
01:09:33,273 --> 01:09:34,883
All right, let's do it.

1408
01:09:34,927 --> 01:09:37,669
Let's do it.

1409
01:09:37,712 --> 01:09:39,690
If we have a family, it can't
be like your last one.

1410
01:09:39,714 --> 01:09:41,150
You have to be there with me.

1411
01:09:41,194 --> 01:09:42,737
Of course I will. Every step of the way.

1412
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,285
Will you listen to me?

1413
01:09:44,328 --> 01:09:46,156
I want to be with you
every minute of the day.

1414
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,985
I'm jealous of your patients.

1415
01:09:49,029 --> 01:09:52,119
Look, the answer is yes.

1416
01:09:52,162 --> 01:09:55,122
I want you and I want
everything you want.

1417
01:09:55,165 --> 01:09:56,776
Everything.

1418
01:10:13,664 --> 01:10:15,144
Let's neck.

1419
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:27,766
So in joining
you good people together,

1420
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:31,596
we're enjoying
an exercise in hope.

1421
01:10:31,639 --> 01:10:33,119
You two are igniting
in all of us

1422
01:10:33,163 --> 01:10:36,340
the hope that life together
is possible,

1423
01:10:36,383 --> 01:10:40,301
and caring for someone else
is possible.

1424
01:10:40,345 --> 01:10:44,653
Kay, do you take Steve
to be your husband?

1425
01:10:44,697 --> 01:10:49,310
To love him and cherish him
in sickness and in health?

1426
01:10:49,354 --> 01:10:51,530
In good times and bad?

1427
01:10:51,573 --> 01:10:54,186
For as long as you both
shall live?

1428
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:55,840
I do.

1429
01:10:55,883 --> 01:11:00,583
Steve, do you take Kay
to be your wife?

1430
01:11:00,627 --> 01:11:04,196
To love her and cherish her
in sickness and in health?

1431
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,939
In good times and bad?

1432
01:11:06,982 --> 01:11:07,940
So long as you both shall live?

1433
01:11:07,983 --> 01:11:10,203
I do.

1434
01:11:10,246 --> 01:11:12,118
Well, then, in the eyes
of everyone here,

1435
01:11:12,161 --> 01:11:17,036
and the State of New York,
you're husband and wife.

1436
01:11:23,347 --> 01:11:24,131
Okay, enough, enough!

1437
01:11:24,174 --> 01:11:26,133
Next, next.

1438
01:11:30,137 --> 01:11:31,767
Listen, I hope he didn't
make too much noise.

1439
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:32,879
He made it wonderful.

1440
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:33,837
Oh, thank you. Congratulations.

1441
01:11:33,881 --> 01:11:36,579
Thank you. Kay.

1442
01:11:36,622 --> 01:11:38,886
Hey, am I happy for you guys.

1443
01:11:38,929 --> 01:11:40,975
Ah, thank you, Mel.

1444
01:11:41,018 --> 01:11:43,978
You look lovely,
absolutely radiant.

1445
01:11:44,021 --> 01:11:46,154
She hates me.
Woman cannot stand me.

1446
01:11:46,197 --> 01:11:47,915
She's just a little
pissed at you, that's all.

1447
01:11:47,939 --> 01:11:49,539
She'll get over it.
Don't worry about it.

1448
01:11:53,249 --> 01:11:54,424
Is this a tough day for you?

1449
01:11:54,467 --> 01:11:58,384
Oh, no, I love Kay.
She's terrific.

1450
01:11:58,428 --> 01:12:02,041
Did she tell you, you know,
what our plans are?

1451
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:04,304
She's pregnant, I know.
She told me.

1452
01:12:04,348 --> 01:12:05,784
So how do you feel about that?

1453
01:12:05,828 --> 01:12:07,220
I think it's great.

1454
01:12:07,264 --> 01:12:08,458
I mean, I'm gonna have
a kid and everything,

1455
01:12:08,482 --> 01:12:09,677
but do you feel all right,
really?

1456
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:10,354
Listen, can I ask you a favor?

1457
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:11,746
Yeah, what?

1458
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:13,190
Spend some time
with this one, okay?

1459
01:12:24,848 --> 01:12:26,501
Come on, let's eat. Come on.

1460
01:12:45,392 --> 01:12:46,586
I just want to
look at your face.

1461
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:48,177
Does this bother you?

1462
01:12:48,221 --> 01:12:50,092
It's just a little hard

1463
01:12:50,136 --> 01:12:51,093
reading up in the air like this.

1464
01:12:51,137 --> 01:12:52,486
Oh, here, just...

1465
01:12:53,879 --> 01:12:55,576
Are you all right there?

1466
01:12:55,619 --> 01:12:57,535
That's great.

1467
01:12:57,579 --> 01:12:58,948
When you take a break,
can we work on the terrace?

1468
01:12:58,972 --> 01:13:00,451
Uh-ha.

1469
01:13:00,495 --> 01:13:02,627
I love to watch you dig.

1470
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:03,715
What's the matter?

1471
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:04,978
Can I get you something?

1472
01:13:05,021 --> 01:13:06,501
No, it's okay.
You just keep talking.

1473
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:10,524
Forget that it's your first day.

1474
01:13:10,548 --> 01:13:12,682
Up here, you're in charge, okay?

1475
01:13:12,725 --> 01:13:14,355
Now you don't think of
yourself as a teacher's aide,

1476
01:13:14,379 --> 01:13:16,816
you act like you've been
doing this for years.

1477
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,470
All right? Don't make me nervous, okay?

1478
01:13:18,514 --> 01:13:19,708
All right, here we go.
Little kiss for good luck.

1479
01:13:19,732 --> 01:13:20,951
All right, go get 'em.

1480
01:13:20,995 --> 01:13:22,605
This is it. Go get 'em, kiddo.

1481
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,085
This is your day.

1482
01:13:24,128 --> 01:13:26,479
This is yours.

1483
01:13:26,523 --> 01:13:28,177
You're gonna be great.

1484
01:13:32,094 --> 01:13:34,139
Good luck.

1485
01:13:34,183 --> 01:13:35,097
I'll be waiting here
when you get out.

1486
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:36,925
I want a full report.

1487
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,843
Now, try to get a seat
near an exit.

1488
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,062
I want you back safe.

1489
01:13:43,106 --> 01:13:44,150
You're making me nervous.

1490
01:13:44,194 --> 01:13:46,152
I packed you a little
picnic lunch.

1491
01:13:46,196 --> 01:13:48,938
I stuck it right here
at the top of your bag.

1492
01:13:48,981 --> 01:13:50,330
Don't come in.

1493
01:13:50,374 --> 01:13:52,594
Will you call me every day?

1494
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:54,379
I'll try.

1495
01:13:54,422 --> 01:13:56,052
I mean, if they're gonna have
me talking sign language

1496
01:13:56,076 --> 01:13:57,643
morning 'til night.

1497
01:13:57,686 --> 01:13:59,142
You know, there's no place
here that you can do it?

1498
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:00,124
You have to go to D.C.? No, there isn't.

1499
01:14:00,167 --> 01:14:01,429
Yes, yes, yes.

1500
01:14:01,473 --> 01:14:02,754
The best in the field's there.
Now go.

1501
01:14:02,778 --> 01:14:04,258
All right, bye.

1502
01:14:04,302 --> 01:14:05,738
I love you. Love you too.

1503
01:14:27,153 --> 01:14:29,851
Oh, excuse me,
can I squeeze in there please?

1504
01:14:29,894 --> 01:14:32,810
Sure, no problem.

1505
01:14:32,854 --> 01:14:34,248
You're going to Washington?

1506
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:35,529
Oh, it's a great city.
It's very historic.

1507
01:14:35,553 --> 01:14:37,729
Lots of monuments, yeah.

1508
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:39,253
Is this your first time there?

1509
01:14:43,474 --> 01:14:44,954
Boy, did I get you.

1510
01:14:44,998 --> 01:14:48,306
Did you suspect anything?

1511
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,134
I had a week coming to me
so I took it now.

1512
01:14:50,178 --> 01:14:51,701
But listen,
I won't be in the way.

1513
01:14:51,744 --> 01:14:52,852
I'll be at the motel
during the day.

1514
01:14:52,876 --> 01:14:54,225
Whenever you're through
at night,

1515
01:14:54,269 --> 01:14:56,358
8, 9 o'clock at night,
I'll be waiting for you.

1516
01:14:58,621 --> 01:15:01,232
Is this great?

1517
01:15:01,276 --> 01:15:02,277
I can hardly believe it.

1518
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:15,379
- Hey, look at this, huh?
- What do you think?

1519
01:15:15,422 --> 01:15:17,685
Ah-ha-hahh.

1520
01:15:17,729 --> 01:15:18,773
I can't believe it.

1521
01:15:18,817 --> 01:15:19,924
Where did you get a gondola?

1522
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:21,689
Well, I said it was
an Italian lunch.

1523
01:15:21,733 --> 01:15:23,561
I even got some of this
dried yak dung

1524
01:15:23,604 --> 01:15:26,781
for Steve to sprinkle
all over a ziti. Come on.

1525
01:15:26,825 --> 01:15:29,481
We'll have a little lunch,
ride around the lake.

1526
01:15:29,524 --> 01:15:31,831
The idea is to get acquainted.
We're family now.

1527
01:15:31,874 --> 01:15:33,765
You're married to this guy,
you're married to me.

1528
01:15:33,789 --> 01:15:34,984
Mary, you want to sit here?
Is that all right?

1529
01:15:35,008 --> 01:15:36,227
It's Mary, right?

1530
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,576
It's Mara, Mara, help your wife.

1531
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:39,206
She falls in that water,
she'll decompose.

1532
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,100
What happened?
She's all right now.

1533
01:15:40,144 --> 01:15:41,101
Here we go.

1534
01:15:41,145 --> 01:15:42,189
What happened?

1535
01:15:42,233 --> 01:15:43,931
Once around the lake.

1536
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:46,194
He used to run around the car
and help me out.

1537
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:48,153
Now when he drops me off
at the hospital,

1538
01:15:48,196 --> 01:15:51,199
he slows down and sort of
ejects me out of my seat.

1539
01:15:51,243 --> 01:15:54,246
Come on, when have I ever
done anything like that?

1540
01:15:54,289 --> 01:15:58,338
In 46 days
we've been married, 11 times.

1541
01:15:58,381 --> 01:16:01,384
She counts everything.
Don't marry a doctor.

1542
01:16:01,428 --> 01:16:03,082
You could starve to death

1543
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,867
while she measures out 2 cc's
of oil, 1 cc of vinegar

1544
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:09,436
and 1.2 grams of garlic
for your salad.

1545
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:11,502
How come I never noticed that
before we got married?

1546
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:14,616
Before we got married,
you made the salad.

1547
01:16:14,659 --> 01:16:15,854
Never give men what they want,

1548
01:16:15,878 --> 01:16:17,836
it ruins their appetite.

1549
01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:23,233
Have a frittata, sweetheart.

1550
01:16:36,029 --> 01:16:38,598
Let me tell you a few things
about this guy you married.

1551
01:16:38,642 --> 01:16:40,557
Steve's been my partner
for 18 years

1552
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,187
and I can say this
from the bottom of my heart,

1553
01:16:42,211 --> 01:16:44,387
the man is a selfish pig.

1554
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:45,953
But he's got the heart
of a stallion.

1555
01:16:45,997 --> 01:16:47,738
He'll work till he drops.

1556
01:16:47,781 --> 01:16:50,741
Sun goes down in L.A.,
he's trading in Tokyo.

1557
01:16:50,784 --> 01:16:54,006
Sun comes up in England,
he's on the London Exchange.

1558
01:16:54,049 --> 01:16:55,399
The man never stops.

1559
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:57,444
I'm bombing here, I'm dying.

1560
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:59,272
He's a great family man.

1561
01:16:59,316 --> 01:17:02,232
He cries at baby pictures.

1562
01:17:02,275 --> 01:17:04,495
We have an agreement.

1563
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:08,195
When the sun sets in Chicago,
he doesn't follow it to Tokyo.

1564
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:11,416
Somebody else can stay up
all night with the Japanese.

1565
01:17:11,459 --> 01:17:13,896
He comes home.

1566
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,811
Right?

1567
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:38,662
I can do this without you.

1568
01:17:38,706 --> 01:17:39,900
I just thought it would be
better for both of us

1569
01:17:39,924 --> 01:17:41,032
if we went through it together.

1570
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:42,381
Yeah, sure,
I missed this kind of thing

1571
01:17:42,405 --> 01:17:43,798
with my first kid.

1572
01:17:43,841 --> 01:17:45,210
And this guy's into
this sort of thing

1573
01:17:45,234 --> 01:17:46,342
and he thought
you should come too.

1574
01:17:46,366 --> 01:17:47,803
Yeah, good, fine.

1575
01:17:47,846 --> 01:17:49,041
Look, don't worry
about how long it takes.

1576
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:50,477
I got a paper.
I'll be fine out here.

1577
01:17:50,501 --> 01:17:52,068
Just take your time.

1578
01:17:52,111 --> 01:17:55,506
Steve, I want you
to come in with me.

1579
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:56,657
What do you mean?
Until the doctor comes?

1580
01:17:56,681 --> 01:17:58,683
I mean, until it's over.

1581
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:08,061
Oh, this is a very,
very good image, here.

1582
01:18:08,085 --> 01:18:09,454
Look, oh, look,
you can see the hand.

1583
01:18:09,478 --> 01:18:10,566
Can you see that?

1584
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:12,176
There it is. There it is.

1585
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,134
Oh, you can see
the fingers wiggling.

1586
01:18:14,178 --> 01:18:15,417
Look, it's very good.
This is very clear.

1587
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,356
Oh, you can see the face.

1588
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,011
See the orbits
for the eyes, the mouth.

1589
01:18:20,054 --> 01:18:21,578
Oh, and look,
you can see the heart.

1590
01:18:21,621 --> 01:18:24,624
Can you see that? The heart?

1591
01:18:24,668 --> 01:18:26,713
Can you see the heart beating?

1592
01:18:26,757 --> 01:18:27,888
Yeah, yeah.

1593
01:18:27,932 --> 01:18:29,500
Stop it there.

1594
01:18:32,329 --> 01:18:35,288
What you're gonna feel...

1595
01:18:35,332 --> 01:18:39,510
is just a little pressure,
a little punch, okay?

1596
01:18:39,553 --> 01:18:41,096
What I want you to do
is take a deep breath for me

1597
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,120
and hold it.

1598
01:18:46,126 --> 01:18:50,043
That's right.
Just hold, hold, hold.

1599
01:18:50,086 --> 01:18:51,086
You can let it out now.

1600
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:54,395
There. Do you feel anything?

1601
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:55,744
It's all right.

1602
01:18:55,788 --> 01:18:57,530
Make sure
you're not near the fetus.

1603
01:18:57,573 --> 01:18:59,445
No, no, I'm watching it
on the screen.

1604
01:18:59,488 --> 01:19:00,184
Can you tell what sex it is?

1605
01:19:00,228 --> 01:19:01,534
No.

1606
01:19:01,577 --> 01:19:02,622
Do you want to know? No.

1607
01:19:02,665 --> 01:19:05,277
Is that... is this
pretty much over?

1608
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,974
Just a few more seconds.

1609
01:19:07,017 --> 01:19:08,845
Nice, nice, nice.

1610
01:19:10,892 --> 01:19:12,415
There. All done.

1611
01:19:12,459 --> 01:19:15,200
Ahh, thank you.

1612
01:19:15,244 --> 01:19:16,613
Don't worry, babe,
you're gonna be fine.

1613
01:19:16,637 --> 01:19:18,900
He did great. That looks great.

1614
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,040
Try not to walk me
into a truck, okay?

1615
01:19:28,084 --> 01:19:29,955
Okay. Just relax.

1616
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:31,498
You'll only be out of control
for a couple more seconds.

1617
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:33,045
Now there's gonna be a step.

1618
01:19:33,089 --> 01:19:35,961
Right. Turn around.

1619
01:19:36,005 --> 01:19:37,093
Look.

1620
01:19:40,184 --> 01:19:41,272
What's that?

1621
01:19:41,316 --> 01:19:43,535
I bought myself a present.

1622
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:44,275
Well, you're not
gonna ride on that?

1623
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:45,798
Yeah.

1624
01:19:45,842 --> 01:19:47,017
In traffic?

1625
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,671
Yeah, this saves me
an hour a day.

1626
01:19:48,714 --> 01:19:50,542
You wanted to see me more.
Now you will.

1627
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:52,589
Here, just put this on
and get on.

1628
01:19:52,632 --> 01:19:55,679
I'm gonna give you a ride.

1629
01:19:55,722 --> 01:19:59,291
Now, don't lean or anything
and just don't try to help,

1630
01:19:59,335 --> 01:20:01,206
just sit back and relax

1631
01:20:01,249 --> 01:20:03,991
and try and keep your feet
on these platforms here.

1632
01:20:04,035 --> 01:20:05,210
Just sit there, all right?

1633
01:20:05,253 --> 01:20:06,694
All right.
But this is not a bicycle.

1634
01:20:06,734 --> 01:20:07,929
I mean, you steer
with your whole body,

1635
01:20:07,953 --> 01:20:09,104
not just your hands, right? Yes, I know.

1636
01:20:09,128 --> 01:20:10,521
And easy on the brakes.

1637
01:20:10,564 --> 01:20:12,364
I don't want to go flying
over the handlebars.

1638
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:17,310
Look, I know you're trying
to be helpful, okay?

1639
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:20,053
Believe me, I know that
and I love you for it,

1640
01:20:20,096 --> 01:20:22,055
but I had one of these
when I was a teenager.

1641
01:20:22,098 --> 01:20:24,927
I'm fine. Yeah. You sit, I drive, okay?

1642
01:20:24,971 --> 01:20:25,971
Drive. Okay, sweetheart.

1643
01:20:31,847 --> 01:20:34,198
Waah!

1644
01:20:34,242 --> 01:20:36,113
Easy on the gas!
Stay in control.

1645
01:20:36,157 --> 01:20:37,593
I know what I'm doing.

1646
01:20:45,645 --> 01:20:46,907
Don't lean on...

1647
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:50,302
Oh, my God, we're
on the sidewalk now.

1648
01:20:59,964 --> 01:21:01,402
It's okay, I'm all right.

1649
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:03,534
No worry. Not hurt.

1650
01:21:03,578 --> 01:21:06,058
You okay? You all right?

1651
01:21:06,102 --> 01:21:08,626
Why did you stick your feet out?

1652
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:11,499
Because you were gonna
kill yourself, that's why.

1653
01:21:11,542 --> 01:21:14,458
Jackie, you cannot
ride around on this thing.

1654
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,940
Oh, boy, this is really
getting claustrophobic.

1655
01:21:16,983 --> 01:21:20,857
Now, listen, let's just...
Let's skip dinner, okay?

1656
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,728
Uh? Let's go to a movie?

1657
01:21:22,772 --> 01:21:25,122
Want to? And let's have popcorn.

1658
01:21:25,165 --> 01:21:27,254
I have to study tonight.

1659
01:21:27,298 --> 01:21:28,536
All right, you study. I'll cook.

1660
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,302
What about curried eggplant?

1661
01:21:30,345 --> 01:21:33,174
If I want eggplant,
I'll make it.

1662
01:21:33,218 --> 01:21:35,089
Something's bothering you,
isn't it?

1663
01:21:35,133 --> 01:21:37,440
Something's bothering me?

1664
01:21:37,483 --> 01:21:38,919
You watch every move
that I make,

1665
01:21:38,963 --> 01:21:41,835
and you haven't noticed
that I am going crazy?

1666
01:21:41,879 --> 01:21:44,012
I can't breathe!

1667
01:21:44,056 --> 01:21:46,232
You're constantly watching me

1668
01:21:46,275 --> 01:21:48,756
and questioning me
and examining me.

1669
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,845
That's what you do
when you care about someone.

1670
01:21:50,889 --> 01:21:53,674
No, that's what you do
when you take a hostage.

1671
01:21:53,718 --> 01:21:55,023
I feel like such an idiot.

1672
01:21:55,067 --> 01:21:56,547
It never occurred to me

1673
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:58,332
and it was staring me
right in the face.

1674
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:01,074
He's a control freak.
Am I bothering you?

1675
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:03,511
Go ahead, I'm working.

1676
01:22:03,555 --> 01:22:06,166
And that's why he waited
so long to make love to me.

1677
01:22:06,209 --> 01:22:07,820
He was getting me warmed up

1678
01:22:07,863 --> 01:22:10,257
like one of his eggplant
casseroles.

1679
01:22:13,043 --> 01:22:14,654
I can't go.

1680
01:22:14,697 --> 01:22:16,264
This is an ordinary
Lamaze class.

1681
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:18,005
I can't do it without you.

1682
01:22:18,048 --> 01:22:19,286
My first wife went through
this whole thing without me.

1683
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,442
That was then.

1684
01:22:20,486 --> 01:22:22,575
It was then and it was great.

1685
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:25,274
I bought the cigars
and drove her to the hospital.

1686
01:22:25,317 --> 01:22:27,406
The only thing that made me
sick was the cigar.

1687
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,384
Unlike this pregnancy,
which is like sitting through

1688
01:22:29,408 --> 01:22:31,062
Friday the 13th for nine months.

1689
01:22:34,501 --> 01:22:35,806
Look, I've got to
level with you,

1690
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:38,506
I don't know if I can be there
when you give birth.

1691
01:22:38,549 --> 01:22:39,942
I don't want to see
blood and pain

1692
01:22:39,985 --> 01:22:42,205
and little arms and legs
coming out of your body.

1693
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:43,728
It's like an exercise class.

1694
01:22:43,772 --> 01:22:45,251
What's gonna make you sick?

1695
01:22:45,295 --> 01:22:47,515
Stretching, breathing,
what's gonna make you sick?

1696
01:22:47,558 --> 01:22:50,126
Okay, dads, help mother up and
we'll talk about the things

1697
01:22:50,169 --> 01:22:52,041
we'll be doing
the next few weeks.

1698
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,177
Don't go, don't leave me.

1699
01:22:57,221 --> 01:22:58,614
What's the matter?

1700
01:22:58,657 --> 01:23:00,529
My back. I can't move.
I'm paralyzed.

1701
01:23:00,572 --> 01:23:02,095
Let me help you. No, no, no, no, no.

1702
01:23:02,139 --> 01:23:03,377
You'll hurt yourself,
you'll hurt the baby.

1703
01:23:03,401 --> 01:23:04,837
Don't... I can do it. I'm fine.

1704
01:23:04,881 --> 01:23:07,711
I'll just, I'll be all right.

1705
01:23:07,754 --> 01:23:09,210
I just got to get
in the right position.

1706
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,192
After class, I can show you
the pelvic tilt.

1707
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,585
It may help your back.

1708
01:23:12,629 --> 01:23:13,499
Good. That's very nice.

1709
01:23:13,543 --> 01:23:14,674
That'll be fine.

1710
01:23:16,284 --> 01:23:18,678
Okay.

1711
01:23:18,722 --> 01:23:20,657
Well, the more you know
regarding labor and birth,

1712
01:23:20,681 --> 01:23:22,683
the less anxious you'll be.

1713
01:23:22,727 --> 01:23:27,383
So we'll talk in detail
about anatomy and physiology,

1714
01:23:27,427 --> 01:23:32,214
how to push the baby out,
Cesarean birth, complications.

1715
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:34,348
I'll be right back.

1716
01:23:34,391 --> 01:23:37,569
I'll take you of a tour of
the labor and delivery rooms

1717
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:42,225
and we'll discuss techniques
for pain management,

1718
01:23:42,269 --> 01:23:45,533
role of the coach,
coping strategies.

1719
01:23:47,448 --> 01:23:50,408
You all right? Just wanted some stale air.

1720
01:23:50,452 --> 01:23:52,106
You look upset.

1721
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:53,063
I don't think I'm gonna be able

1722
01:23:53,107 --> 01:23:54,978
to tour the hospital with you.

1723
01:23:55,022 --> 01:23:57,328
By then, you'll be
an old hand at this.

1724
01:23:57,372 --> 01:23:58,871
You'll know what happens
when the water breaks,

1725
01:23:58,895 --> 01:24:00,220
you'll know what to do
during an emergency.

1726
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:02,421
Those are the exact two things
I don't want to know.

1727
01:24:02,465 --> 01:24:04,032
You can't do that here

1728
01:24:04,075 --> 01:24:05,836
and you promised you'd cut
down during my pregnancy.

1729
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:08,253
I didn't know your pregnancy
was gonna be so stressful.

1730
01:24:14,303 --> 01:24:17,046
Okay. I'm ready.

1731
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:23,052
Oh, are we
celebrating something?

1732
01:24:23,095 --> 01:24:25,576
Well, that depends
on how you feel.

1733
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:26,664
About what?

1734
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:29,450
About getting married.

1735
01:24:29,494 --> 01:24:31,235
I think we ought to
talk about it.

1736
01:24:33,367 --> 01:24:34,455
Are you serious?

1737
01:24:34,499 --> 01:24:36,588
I've been thinking about it.

1738
01:24:36,632 --> 01:24:38,285
I threw the yarrow sticks.

1739
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,201
Yarrow sticks?

1740
01:24:41,245 --> 01:24:42,376
Yeah, you remember,

1741
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:43,291
the I Ching,
the Book of Changes,

1742
01:24:43,335 --> 01:24:45,424
the Chinese divination, right?

1743
01:24:45,467 --> 01:24:47,992
So I throw the sticks,
I open the book,

1744
01:24:48,035 --> 01:24:50,037
and what do you think it says?

1745
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:53,258
The mountain above,
the lake below.

1746
01:24:56,522 --> 01:24:58,133
I'm very excited about this.

1747
01:25:03,051 --> 01:25:04,487
Are you okay?

1748
01:25:04,531 --> 01:25:06,968
You sounded funny on the phone.

1749
01:25:07,012 --> 01:25:08,753
He asked me to marry him.

1750
01:25:08,796 --> 01:25:10,363
Really?

1751
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:12,322
Some Chinese guy who's been
dead for 2,000 years

1752
01:25:12,366 --> 01:25:13,715
thinks it's a great idea.

1753
01:25:13,759 --> 01:25:15,935
What do you think?

1754
01:25:15,978 --> 01:25:18,328
I don't think I would live
through the honeymoon.

1755
01:25:18,372 --> 01:25:20,156
He never leaves me alone.

1756
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,028
I can't study.
I can't take a trip.

1757
01:25:22,071 --> 01:25:25,206
I got to leave a goodbye note
to go to the bathroom.

1758
01:25:25,249 --> 01:25:27,295
That would drive me crazy.

1759
01:25:29,863 --> 01:25:31,691
You know, after Steve moved out,

1760
01:25:31,734 --> 01:25:33,103
there were certain things
about living alone

1761
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:36,478
that I really started to like.

1762
01:25:36,521 --> 01:25:39,395
I mean, I know
that this sounds stupid,

1763
01:25:39,438 --> 01:25:42,050
I like to read while I eat.

1764
01:25:42,093 --> 01:25:45,227
I like going without dinner
if I'm not hungry.

1765
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:47,185
Sometimes, I like to just
sit and think.

1766
01:25:50,972 --> 01:25:53,932
I just don't think I...

1767
01:25:53,976 --> 01:25:55,562
I don't think I want to
marry anybody right now.

1768
01:25:55,586 --> 01:25:56,935
I need a rest.

1769
01:25:56,979 --> 01:25:58,981
There's just so many things
I want to do

1770
01:25:59,024 --> 01:26:04,508
and I don't have time
for all this stuff.

1771
01:26:04,551 --> 01:26:06,772
So are you gonna leave him?

1772
01:26:06,816 --> 01:26:08,687
I can't keep leaving
these people.

1773
01:26:09,993 --> 01:26:12,430
Look at these hives.

1774
01:26:12,473 --> 01:26:14,084
Oh, listen, I have tried,
I really have.

1775
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:17,478
I just... I wish I had
a little time to myself.

1776
01:26:17,522 --> 01:26:18,697
So take it.

1777
01:26:18,741 --> 01:26:20,047
I will.

1778
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:22,397
I'm gonna take
some time to myself.

1779
01:26:22,441 --> 01:26:25,966
Just got to get over
this scratching thing.

1780
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:27,074
You'll labor
in one of these rooms

1781
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:29,535
along this hallway.

1782
01:26:29,578 --> 01:26:31,145
And you'll stay here

1783
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:34,497
until you've dilated
approximately 10 centimeters

1784
01:26:34,541 --> 01:26:37,283
and push until the baby's head
is crowning.

1785
01:26:37,326 --> 01:26:39,391
At that point, we'll move you
down to the delivery room.

1786
01:26:39,415 --> 01:26:41,374
Dads will come with you
and give you support.

1787
01:26:45,813 --> 01:26:48,164
Okay, folks, follow me.

1788
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:49,687
Come on.

1789
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:51,143
I'll meet you down
in the parking lot.

1790
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:52,125
Just make it to the end
of the hall.

1791
01:26:52,168 --> 01:26:53,604
It's not that bad.

1792
01:26:53,648 --> 01:26:56,782
No, it's a little worse
than you think.

1793
01:26:56,825 --> 01:26:58,653
Why is this
such a problem for you?

1794
01:26:58,696 --> 01:27:01,526
Look, I love you, all right?
I'd give my arm for you.

1795
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:03,410
I'd give my eyes,
my entire head and shoulders,

1796
01:27:03,441 --> 01:27:05,139
but I am not walking
down this hallway.

1797
01:27:05,182 --> 01:27:06,531
That's all.

1798
01:27:06,575 --> 01:27:07,706
I'll see you in the parking.

1799
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:22,200
That's it. Keep the breathing
slow and relaxed.

1800
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,813
That's great.

1801
01:27:25,856 --> 01:27:27,423
Try to keep it even.

1802
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:31,820
You're at your 30-second peak.

1803
01:27:33,865 --> 01:27:36,128
Don't force it.
Just keep it relaxed.

1804
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:37,260
Hello?

1805
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:45,312
Okay, we're coming up
to 45 seconds.

1806
01:27:45,356 --> 01:27:47,662
That's it.
Just slow, even breaths.

1807
01:27:47,706 --> 01:27:49,273
Hello?

1808
01:27:51,275 --> 01:27:52,450
Uh-huh.

1809
01:27:54,713 --> 01:27:56,497
Can you make it
for the last hour?

1810
01:27:58,631 --> 01:28:01,460
Okay. See you at home.

1811
01:28:04,985 --> 01:28:06,378
Just do me a favor, all right?

1812
01:28:06,421 --> 01:28:07,790
Don't short a stock
while it's on the way up.

1813
01:28:07,814 --> 01:28:08,989
That's nuts.

1814
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:10,314
It went up 30 points
in four hours.

1815
01:28:10,338 --> 01:28:11,427
There's no stock in the

1816
01:28:11,471 --> 01:28:12,578
world's not gonna
fall after that.

1817
01:28:12,602 --> 01:28:15,344
Don't worry,
we'll get it back tomorrow.

1818
01:28:16,998 --> 01:28:18,521
Hey!

1819
01:28:18,565 --> 01:28:21,002
What the hell is bugging you?

1820
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:23,787
I'm making her miserable.

1821
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:26,704
This thing with the baby
is just...

1822
01:28:26,748 --> 01:28:28,576
Geez, doesn't she know
how much I love her?

1823
01:28:30,273 --> 01:28:34,582
Listen, I'm telling you
this from the heart.

1824
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:36,801
Let her know you love her.

1825
01:28:36,845 --> 01:28:39,980
Give her a few bucks.
Let her buy a nice dress.

1826
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:42,983
Oh, I'm a grandfather.

1827
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:44,854
I'm gonna have a baby.

1828
01:28:46,551 --> 01:28:47,988
Geez, I'm gonna have an infant.

1829
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:50,164
You're getting excited
about nothing.

1830
01:28:50,207 --> 01:28:53,037
How am I gonna...

1831
01:28:53,081 --> 01:28:56,040
How am I gonna do this?

1832
01:28:56,084 --> 01:28:58,651
Listen to me, women know
what to do about babies.

1833
01:28:58,695 --> 01:29:01,350
Babies are a woman's thing.
You'll do what you can.

1834
01:29:01,393 --> 01:29:03,526
She'll do the rest.

1835
01:29:03,569 --> 01:29:04,962
That's the way it used to be.

1836
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,009
Things haven't changed
that much, believe me.

1837
01:29:07,052 --> 01:29:10,795
Hey, I know a little bit
about women, right?

1838
01:29:10,838 --> 01:29:12,971
I'm going home. What?

1839
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:14,427
I'm going home, that's what,
that's what, I'm going home.

1840
01:29:14,451 --> 01:29:15,558
All right, come on,
we'll go inside,

1841
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:16,801
we'll have a drink.

1842
01:29:16,844 --> 01:29:17,541
No, no, I don't
like to drink alone.

1843
01:29:17,584 --> 01:29:19,021
Forget it.

1844
01:29:19,064 --> 01:29:19,936
What did... hey, come on,
what did I say?

1845
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:21,589
Goodnight. Have fun, have fun.

1846
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,909
I don't know, maybe I'm corny,

1847
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:39,260
but I think there's
such a thing as destiny.

1848
01:29:39,304 --> 01:29:40,740
What about you,
what do you think?

1849
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:46,572
Is there such a thing
as destiny?

1850
01:30:01,153 --> 01:30:02,503
What are you doing?

1851
01:30:02,546 --> 01:30:04,002
This place is a mess.
I put your stuff in a pile.

1852
01:30:04,026 --> 01:30:05,245
You put it where you want it.

1853
01:30:05,288 --> 01:30:06,811
I had it where I wanted it.

1854
01:30:06,855 --> 01:30:08,398
You want your shorts
on the coffee table?

1855
01:30:08,422 --> 01:30:11,947
I was using them as a coaster.

1856
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:14,602
You're pissed about
the Lamaze thing, aren't you?

1857
01:30:14,645 --> 01:30:17,867
I had a crisis,
an emergency, all right?

1858
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:19,738
I had a man with chest pains
at 6 o'clock.

1859
01:30:19,782 --> 01:30:23,307
I got him into the CCU
and I still made it to class.

1860
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:26,049
Okay, I missed one lesson
in breathing.

1861
01:30:26,093 --> 01:30:28,138
I already knew how to breathe.

1862
01:30:28,182 --> 01:30:29,421
Now I know how to breathe
lying on the floor

1863
01:30:29,445 --> 01:30:31,273
with my elbow up my ass.

1864
01:30:31,316 --> 01:30:33,164
You're not going to be there
when I have the baby, are you?

1865
01:30:33,188 --> 01:30:34,928
I told you I might not.

1866
01:30:34,972 --> 01:30:35,929
You didn't even try.

1867
01:30:35,973 --> 01:30:37,670
I didn't try?

1868
01:30:37,714 --> 01:30:39,561
I watched that doctor stick
a needle in your stomach.

1869
01:30:39,585 --> 01:30:40,717
I went to the hospital,

1870
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:41,911
listened to women
getting tortured.

1871
01:30:41,935 --> 01:30:43,088
Do you think
I found that interesting?

1872
01:30:43,112 --> 01:30:45,070
Not everything in life
is entertaining.

1873
01:30:45,114 --> 01:30:47,377
You bet I'll be screaming
and I want you with me.

1874
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:49,205
You know what the problem is?

1875
01:30:49,248 --> 01:30:51,468
You got this quirk
in your personality.

1876
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:53,774
You like blood so you think
everybody else does.

1877
01:30:53,818 --> 01:30:55,385
I like blood?

1878
01:30:55,428 --> 01:30:56,754
No, that's fine,
it makes you a good doctor,

1879
01:30:56,778 --> 01:30:58,234
but you got to realize
normal people don't like

1880
01:30:58,258 --> 01:31:00,478
to hold somebody else's heart
in their hands.

1881
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:02,393
I'm not asking you
to hold somebody's heart,

1882
01:31:02,436 --> 01:31:04,023
I'm asking you to help me
give birth to our baby

1883
01:31:04,047 --> 01:31:06,310
and it's making you sick.

1884
01:31:06,353 --> 01:31:08,244
I'm not the one with
the personality problem, pal.

1885
01:31:08,268 --> 01:31:09,487
Come on, look.

1886
01:31:18,062 --> 01:31:20,412
I said some stupid things
last night.

1887
01:31:27,246 --> 01:31:29,813
I said some stupid things
last night.

1888
01:31:29,857 --> 01:31:31,902
You're not getting
an argument from me.

1889
01:31:33,469 --> 01:31:34,992
Taxi!

1890
01:31:45,874 --> 01:31:48,442
Aw, come on. Hey! Hey!

1891
01:31:48,485 --> 01:31:49,182
Come on, hey,
I love you, come on.

1892
01:31:49,225 --> 01:31:50,357
Come back.

1893
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,204
Jackie?

1894
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:17,647
Do you have a minute?

1895
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:19,431
I've got a 9 o'clock class.

1896
01:32:19,475 --> 01:32:20,999
All right, okay,
it's not important.

1897
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:23,132
No, no, come on up. Come on.

1898
01:32:26,744 --> 01:32:31,575
Well, it's hard to say this.

1899
01:32:31,618 --> 01:32:35,232
My second marriage is starting
to have some problems.

1900
01:32:35,275 --> 01:32:38,365
I'm sorry to hear that.

1901
01:32:38,409 --> 01:32:39,560
And you're having a baby,
aren't you?

1902
01:32:39,584 --> 01:32:41,542
Yeah, yeah.

1903
01:32:41,586 --> 01:32:44,197
She thinks I ought to be more
involved, but I, you know,

1904
01:32:44,241 --> 01:32:47,244
be a part of the delivery
and that kind of thing and...

1905
01:32:49,638 --> 01:32:52,075
Look, it isn't fair for me to
drag you through all of this.

1906
01:32:52,119 --> 01:32:57,385
I just thought
maybe you could, I don't know,

1907
01:32:57,429 --> 01:32:58,623
I thought maybe you'd be able
to help me figure out

1908
01:32:58,647 --> 01:33:01,390
what I'm doing wrong.

1909
01:33:01,434 --> 01:33:02,609
To tell you the truth,

1910
01:33:02,652 --> 01:33:04,306
I don't really think
I understand

1911
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:07,614
what she wants from me.

1912
01:33:07,657 --> 01:33:09,964
Well, it's probably
not very complicated.

1913
01:33:12,749 --> 01:33:14,795
She probably wants to know
you're listening

1914
01:33:14,838 --> 01:33:19,714
and that she's
at the top of your list.

1915
01:33:19,757 --> 01:33:21,890
Guess I was never very good
at that, was I?

1916
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:28,897
Oh, I don't know.

1917
01:33:28,941 --> 01:33:31,466
I think maybe
I needed that too much.

1918
01:33:33,511 --> 01:33:35,470
Just knowing I was loved.

1919
01:33:42,085 --> 01:33:44,219
Well, I don't want to make
you late for your class.

1920
01:33:45,481 --> 01:33:46,569
Thanks.

1921
01:33:46,612 --> 01:33:49,572
Sure.

1922
01:33:49,615 --> 01:33:51,245
It's funny how our lives
have turned out, isn't it?

1923
01:33:51,269 --> 01:33:52,488
Yeah.

1924
01:33:54,751 --> 01:33:55,969
I'll see you.

1925
01:33:57,276 --> 01:33:58,321
Watch your head.

1926
01:35:24,717 --> 01:35:26,415
I'm late, I'm sorry.

1927
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:28,025
Give me a market on Bretassa.

1928
01:35:28,068 --> 01:35:29,940
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1929
01:35:29,983 --> 01:35:31,724
Okay, so you're here.
Good for you.

1930
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:33,727
What happened to your face?

1931
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:36,121
I had an accident in a taxi.

1932
01:35:36,164 --> 01:35:38,253
Stevie!

1933
01:35:38,297 --> 01:35:39,342
Hey!

1934
01:35:44,564 --> 01:35:46,392
Yeah?

1935
01:35:46,436 --> 01:35:48,395
Where?

1936
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:50,092
I'm on my way. Is it okay?

1937
01:35:50,136 --> 01:35:51,766
She's in labor. Go give her a kiss from me.

1938
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:53,139
Go, go.

1939
01:35:53,182 --> 01:35:54,246
Wait, wait, wait.
I need money for a cab.

1940
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:55,707
Here, here, here.

1941
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:56,771
You know, I envy you,
having a life together,

1942
01:35:56,795 --> 01:35:58,144
memories to share.

1943
01:35:58,187 --> 01:36:00,189
Fifty dollars says
the baby has blue eyes.

1944
01:36:00,233 --> 01:36:02,105
Give me that.

1945
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:04,269
Tell her to lie on her side,
it's better for the baby.

1946
01:36:13,508 --> 01:36:14,596
Hey, hey, out!

1947
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:15,903
Out!

1948
01:36:50,635 --> 01:36:52,028
How you doing?

1949
01:36:52,071 --> 01:36:54,334
I'm okay.

1950
01:36:54,378 --> 01:36:55,658
How close are your contractions?

1951
01:36:55,684 --> 01:36:57,295
Pretty close.

1952
01:36:57,338 --> 01:36:58,533
What, like about
10 minutes apart?

1953
01:36:58,557 --> 01:37:01,038
More like a minute.

1954
01:37:01,081 --> 01:37:02,822
Why didn't you call me?

1955
01:37:06,522 --> 01:37:07,890
All right, look,
go with the breathing, okay.

1956
01:37:07,914 --> 01:37:09,394
Just relax
and breathe in and out.

1957
01:37:09,438 --> 01:37:11,310
You'll be ready to push soon.

1958
01:37:11,353 --> 01:37:13,399
I'll check you again
in a couple of minutes.

1959
01:37:13,443 --> 01:37:14,444
Okay, thanks.

1960
01:37:14,487 --> 01:37:15,314
Just relax, baby.

1961
01:37:15,357 --> 01:37:17,447
Ohh!

1962
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:19,797
Easy, take it easy. Easy.

1963
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,668
Don't blank out, all right.

1964
01:37:21,712 --> 01:37:22,887
Breathe.

1965
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:25,194
Open your mouth, breathe.
Breathe.

1966
01:37:30,025 --> 01:37:31,897
I love you, babe.
I love you, Kay.

1967
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:33,464
Ohh, it's coming. What?

1968
01:37:33,507 --> 01:37:36,031
The baby's coming.

1969
01:37:36,075 --> 01:37:38,513
Nurse! Hello?

1970
01:37:38,557 --> 01:37:39,708
Come here, come on.
The baby's coming.

1971
01:37:39,732 --> 01:37:40,646
Check this woman.

1972
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:41,690
Okay.

1973
01:37:42,909 --> 01:37:43,823
Take it easy.

1974
01:37:43,866 --> 01:37:45,215
Okay, let's go.

1975
01:37:49,263 --> 01:37:50,675
Keep looking at me.
Look me in the eye.

1976
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:51,613
Keep breathing.

1977
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:53,137
I don't like this.

1978
01:37:53,181 --> 01:37:54,791
Just keep breathing. I love you.

1979
01:37:54,835 --> 01:37:55,618
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

1980
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:56,750
I love you.

1981
01:37:56,793 --> 01:37:57,857
I think I'm gonna throw up.

1982
01:37:57,881 --> 01:37:59,100
That's good. It's a good sign.

1983
01:37:59,143 --> 01:38:00,164
Things are going
just the way they ought to.

1984
01:38:00,188 --> 01:38:03,191
Oh, God, you're dumb.

1985
01:38:03,234 --> 01:38:05,759
Aghh, aghh.

1986
01:38:05,802 --> 01:38:07,041
Okay, I want you to take
a deep breath in,

1987
01:38:07,065 --> 01:38:08,545
hold it and push down hard.

1988
01:38:08,589 --> 01:38:10,199
Push, push, baby, push.

1989
01:38:10,242 --> 01:38:11,809
Push. Push.

1990
01:38:11,853 --> 01:38:13,028
Come on, Kay, push.

1991
01:38:13,071 --> 01:38:14,116
You're going through

1992
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:15,559
a tremendous amount
of pressure soon

1993
01:38:15,596 --> 01:38:16,921
and then I'll ask you
to stop pushing and pant.

1994
01:38:16,945 --> 01:38:18,009
Should she stop now,
stop pushing?

1995
01:38:18,033 --> 01:38:19,358
No, no, keep pushing. No.Aghh, aghh.

1996
01:38:19,382 --> 01:38:20,297
No, keep pushing, keep pushing.

1997
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:21,516
Don't be afraid, all right?

1998
01:38:21,559 --> 01:38:24,388
Don't be afraid. Oh, get it... get it out.

1999
01:38:24,431 --> 01:38:25,496
Concentrate. You can do it.

2000
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,043
Come on, stay in it, stay in it.

2001
01:38:27,086 --> 01:38:28,368
Baby's head's coming,
baby's head's coming.

2002
01:38:28,392 --> 01:38:30,220
It's out now, it's out now.

2003
01:38:30,263 --> 01:38:31,545
It's coming, it's coming,
coming, the baby's coming.

2004
01:38:31,569 --> 01:38:33,790
Pant, pant, pant.

2005
01:38:33,833 --> 01:38:35,182
The baby's head's coming.

2006
01:38:35,226 --> 01:38:37,968
It's coming.
That's it, that's it.

2007
01:38:38,011 --> 01:38:41,624
Now, just gently,
gently push for the shoulder.

2008
01:38:41,667 --> 01:38:44,627
That's good.
And you've got a baby girl.

2009
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,280
Isn't she pretty?

2010
01:38:47,281 --> 01:38:48,327
You did it, babe.

2011
01:38:50,938 --> 01:38:51,938
You did it.

2012
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:55,595
Daddy, would you like
to cut the cord?

2013
01:39:04,257 --> 01:39:07,173
Here you are.

2014
01:39:07,216 --> 01:39:10,350
And you can cut right between
those two clamps on the cord.

2015
01:39:22,755 --> 01:39:26,628
Oh, it's so great. Great.

2016
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:46,215
Take care of yourself, okay?

2017
01:39:46,258 --> 01:39:47,912
I will.

2018
01:40:55,376 --> 01:40:58,031
Yeah?

2019
01:40:58,074 --> 01:40:59,074
Right, so buy 15,000.

2020
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:02,925
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be in at 10 o'clock.

2021
01:41:02,949 --> 01:41:05,560
I've just got to wait
for the nurse.

2022
01:41:05,603 --> 01:41:08,433
She's good,
I just gave her a bottle.

2023
01:41:08,477 --> 01:41:10,305
No, not yet.

2024
01:41:10,348 --> 01:41:11,698
No, she'll burp,

2025
01:41:11,741 --> 01:41:13,261
she just hasn't burped yet,
that's all.

2026
01:41:14,178 --> 01:41:16,964
For how much?

2027
01:41:17,007 --> 01:41:19,575
$50 if she doesn't burp
in the next minute.

2028
01:41:19,619 --> 01:41:20,727
All right, wait a minute, wait,

2029
01:41:20,751 --> 01:41:22,031
I'll put the phone by her mouth.

2030
01:41:29,151 --> 01:41:30,848
You owe me $50.

2031
01:41:30,892 --> 01:41:31,893
You lost.

2032
01:41:31,936 --> 01:41:33,024
I said...
