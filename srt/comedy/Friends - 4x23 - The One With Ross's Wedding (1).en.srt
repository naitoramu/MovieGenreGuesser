1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,755
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,633
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:12,429
In London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,517
Six-hour trip to London.
That's a lot of Monica.

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:22,439
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,025
- Who are you saying "check" to?
- Myself.

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,693
For remembering to pack a thing.

8
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:31,115
You do a good thing,
you get a "check".

9
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,076
Mom does it.
I never realized it was weird.

10
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:37,454
My mom used to put her head
in the oven.

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:42,751
Actually, only the one time.
But it's pretty weird.

12
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,546
Are you ready yet?

13
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,801
- Got the tickets?
- Right here. Check!

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,262
It's all London, baby!

15
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,140
Here we go.

16
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,226
Got your passport?

17
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:04,189
Third drawer of my dresser.
You don't want to lose that!

18
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,570
There it is!

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,407
The One With Ross' Wedding

20
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,869
The vacuum's in my closet
on the left side.

21
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,371
Garbage bags are next
to the refrigerator.

22
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,291
Rachel's gonna be here.
Can't I just ask her?

23
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,294
Yeah, okay. Give that a try!

24
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,422
- Let's do it.
- Cheerio!

25
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,382
London, baby!

26
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,385
That's not gonna get annoying.

27
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,263
London, baby!

28
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,681
You know what?
I was wrong.

29
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,309
We're all here.
Let's get going!

30
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,603
I want to go over and hug you...

31
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,731
...and wish you luck,
but I can't get up.

32
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,777
- I'll come hug you.
- Great, can you bring me the paper?

33
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,530
- Have a great wedding.
- Thanks.

34
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,741
Chandler, I want to hug you too!

35
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:42,829
You might as well bring my book
from your apartment.

36
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:51,630
- So we're off.
- Have fun!

37
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,424
- I can't believe you won't be there.
- I know.

38
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,178
Come. Why don't you come?

39
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,972
To London. Please?
It would mean so much to me.

40
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,392
I gotta work. I'm sorry.

41
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,394
Why can't you take
a couple of days off?

42
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,522
Because I can't.
I told you.

43
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,941
This is my wedding.

44
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,195
Now we are late.
Let's go, let's go!

45
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:20,451
Fine, you'll watch it
on video when we get back.

46
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:25,706
Here you go, Phoebe!
Phoe-bo! Phoo-ba-la!

47
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,960
You!

48
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,545
Let's go!

49
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,756
Bye, Pheebs!

50
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,806
London, baby!

51
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,474
Oh, God!

52
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,102
Do you need a hug?

53
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,022
You don't have to bring me anything.

54
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,957
Chandler, do something!

55
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,170
- Do something!
- I am. I'm ignoring you.

56
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,130
I'll be the on-camera guy.

57
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,924
All right. First stop...

58
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,220
...Westminster Abbey.

59
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,513
What is that?

60
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,723
That's London, baby!

61
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,892
All right, the hotel's here.

62
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,226
Wait.

63
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,271
We want to go...

64
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,484
I know.

65
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm gonna have to go into the map.

66
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:46,454
If you see a little version
of me in there, kill it!

67
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,122
I got it.

68
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,250
Here we go!

69
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:58,298
We're not gonna have to walk this way
the entire time, are we?

70
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,885
Man, you made me lose it!

71
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,892
That was all before 10:00.

72
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,436
The caterer rang. It'll be Chicken
Kiev, not Tarragon.

73
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,023
Then the florist said
there are no tulips.

74
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,025
And the cellist has
carpal tunnel syndrome...

75
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,944
Emily, honey. Okay?

76
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,780
Well, up yours too!

77
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,824
- No! That's "time out".
- Sorry.

78
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:29,037
Sweetie, relax.
Everything will be great, okay?

79
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,583
Come on, come on.

80
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,795
Chicken Kiev?

81
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,256
Doesn't that sound delicious
at the last minute?

82
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,218
Salmon would be
more elegant than chicken.

83
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,889
And you wouldn't worry
about the salmonella.

84
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,934
I can't wait to see
where you're getting married.

85
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,689
It's beautiful.
Her parents got married here.

86
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,857
I can't believe
they're tearing it down.

87
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:02,821
It's really the most lovely building.
It's over...

88
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,741
Oh, my God!

89
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,204
It's nice.

90
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,339
Oh, my God!

91
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,508
What are we going to do?

92
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,843
Everything's gonna be all right.

93
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,386
How's it gonna be all right?

94
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,640
I see that.

95
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,559
I talked to a guy,
and I found out what happened.

96
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,770
They tore it down early.

97
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,025
All right!

98
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,444
Westminster Abbey.

99
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,740
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

100
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,954
What do you think of the Abbey?

101
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,499
It's great! They're thinking
of changing the name.

102
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,753
- To what?
- To "Put the Camera Away"!

103
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:04,174
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

104
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:14,017
- Don't get up. What do you need?
- Nothing.

105
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,188
Come on. I'm here
to take care of you.

106
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,899
Okay, I have a wedgie.

107
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,070
That is all you.

108
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,240
What do you want for lunch?

109
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,701
I don't know.

110
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,786
I guess we have to eat.

111
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,288
Yeah, I do.

112
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,082
What's the matter?

113
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,918
I'm bummed the way
I left things with Ross.

114
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,215
I wish I didn't lie about work.
He seemed so mad at me.

115
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,176
Don't be so hard on yourself.
If I was still in love with some...

116
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,180
Still in love with?

117
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,391
I'm not in love with Ross.

118
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,771
Good!

119
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,190
Yeah, me neither.

120
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm not at the wedding,
because he's my ex-boyfriend...

121
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,738
...and that would be uncomfortable.

122
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,076
Not because I'm in love with him.
I like Ross as much as anyone.

123
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,955
Clearly, I have feelings for him,
but they don't mean love.

124
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:22,086
I mean, do I still have
loving feelings for Ross? Yeah!

125
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,212
I have continuing feelings of love.

126
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,299
But that doesn't mean
I'm still in love with him.

127
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:33,514
I have sexual feelings for him,
but I do love him.

128
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,183
Oh, my God!

129
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,770
Why didn't you tell me?

130
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,564
- We thought you knew!
- We?

131
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,401
We all know.
We talk about it all the time.

132
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,237
You all know?
Does Ross know?

133
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,366
No! Ross doesn't know anything.

134
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,493
And you didn't tell me!

135
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,038
We thought you knew.
It's so obvious!

136
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,165
It would be like telling Monica:

137
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,544
"Hey, you like things clean. "

138
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:13,094
What are you in the market for?
Scarves, souvenir post cards...

139
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,807
Check this out!

140
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,726
That's the stuff!
What do you think?

141
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:24,273
I won't need that
"I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.

142
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,734
Well, I like it. Here you go.

143
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,654
You're not really buying that.
Haven't you embarrassed me enough?

144
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,155
Oh, I embarrass you?

145
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:36,160
How can I answer when
I'm pretending I don't know you?

146
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,288
He's just jealous.
All Londoners wear them.

147
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,625
Really? Then how come no one here
anywhere is wearing one?

148
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,796
They're all tourists.

149
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,090
If you insist on wearing that
in public...

150
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,178
...you're gonna spend the afternoon
all by yourself.

151
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,228
If you make me choose between
you and the hat, I choose the hat.

152
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,522
- Good choice.
- Thanks.

153
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:10,694
That's it! I'm out of here.
I won't be embarrassed anymore.

154
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,665
I spoke to your dad,
and you know what?

155
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,043
He thinks we can find a new hall.

156
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,754
- We don't have to.
- You found a place?

157
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,341
No, but Monica and I were talking...

158
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,677
...and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down...

159
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:40,515
...she suggested we put
the wedding off for a bit.

160
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,519
She said what?

161
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,939
If I won't be happy with somewhere
we'd find in a day...

162
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,609
...we should postpone it.

163
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,947
Postpone it.

164
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:59,368
Do you think Monica realizes
how much our parents spent on this?

165
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:03,956
Do you think my sister's teeny,
tiny, little brain comprehends...

166
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,500
...that people took time
out of their lives...

167
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,380
...to fly thousands of miles
to be here?

168
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,051
This isn't right.

169
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,721
I realize that
people are gonna be disappointed.

170
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,099
But I'm sure they'll come back.

171
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,811
I can't ask people to do that.
Would you?

172
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:29,189
Don't you point your pants at me!

173
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,858
We have no choice.

174
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:34,194
Anywhere half-decent
will have been booked.

175
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,905
Don't you understand?
This is our wedding!

176
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:41,826
Postponing it is not an option.
This is when we're getting married.

177
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,038
- You're saying it's now or never?
- I'm saying it's now.

178
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,625
- Or?
- There's no "or" in mine!

179
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,337
What is wrong with these pants?

180
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,882
It's not the pants.
It's you who's backwards.

181
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,260
If you don't understand
how important this is to me...

182
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,804
...perhaps we shouldn't marry at all!

183
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,849
Emily, no! Wait, stop!
Emily, please...

184
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,111
Did shopping help you
feel any better?

185
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,698
Manhattan doesn't have enough stores.

186
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,993
I can help you get over him.

187
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,453
You can?

188
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,122
I need you to bring me
photos of Ross...

189
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,000
...and a small piece of chocolate...

190
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,169
...and a glass of tepid water.

191
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,421
Is this where you throw stuff...

192
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:39,009
...in a bag with graveyard dirt
and hang it from a north-facing tree?

193
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:43,305
Only if you have the hiccups too.

194
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:49,436
The chocolate and water are for me.
I didn't feel like getting up.

195
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,606
I'll show you a picture of Ross.

196
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:56,610
And you remember all
the bad things about him.

197
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,029
- Focus on his flaws.
- I can do that.

198
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,699
I did that
while we were going out.

199
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,328
Before we start, I want to say,
for the record, I love Ross.

200
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,998
He's such a great guy.

201
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,213
Close your eyes.

202
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,924
Imagine that you're with Ross.

203
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,677
Imagine that you're kissing him.

204
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:25,013
You're running your hands
all over his body.

205
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,808
You run your hands
through his hair but...

206
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:33,021
Gross!
It's some kind of grease.

207
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,151
I don't know.

208
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,070
His hair never bothered me that much.

209
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,658
It was more crunchy
than it was greasy.

210
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,036
This will be harder than I thought.

211
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:52,082
Let's try some aversion therapy.

212
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,585
Look at the picture.

213
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,094
How do you feel now?

214
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,848
Well, I like you less.

215
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,618
Sorry.

216
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:32,373
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said
you were embarrassing me.

217
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:33,874
That wasn't cool.

218
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:39,254
If it makes you feel any better,
I've had a really lousy day.

219
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,173
Me too.

220
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,217
- Yeah?
- No!

221
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:47,388
I had the best day ever!

222
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,183
Dude, check this out!

223
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,772
<i>Tell my friend you like my hat.</i>

224
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,900
<i>- What's your friend's name?
- Chandler.</i>

225
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,151
<i>Hi, Chandler.</i>

226
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,111
That's...

227
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:07,241
That's Fergie, baby!

228
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:12,287
<i>Joey says you don't like his hat,
but I think it's kind of dashing.</i>

229
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,831
When did you...?
How?

230
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,041
I was trying to get
to Buckingham Palace.

231
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,836
So I'm in my map and...

232
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,925
I understand you had
a talk with Emily.

233
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,718
Yes, I did.

234
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,639
And you are welcome.

235
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,517
Am I?

236
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,896
Was it your idea
to postpone the wedding?

237
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,609
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Wait up!

238
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,823
Since you're the fix-it lady,
here's a pickle:

239
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:52,786
What do you do when the bride says
she doesn't want the wedding at all?

240
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,538
She said that?

241
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,580
Why?

242
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:59,752
I don't know. I said it was stupid
to put off the wedding...

243
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,588
...and she, like, flipped out.

244
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:07,134
Oh, my God!
You're even dumber than I am.

245
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,136
Excuse me?

246
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,347
How long have you been planning
this wedding?

247
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:13,766
I don't know. A month?

248
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:17,228
Emily's probably been planning it
since she was 5.

249
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:22,691
Ever since the first time she hung
a pillowcase from her head.

250
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,818
That's what we did.

251
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,154
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.

252
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,199
In the perfect place.

253
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,704
With the perfect
four-tiered wedding cake.

254
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,832
With the little people on top.

255
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,509
But the most important part...

256
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,179
...is that we had the perfect guy...

257
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:58,101
...who understood just how important
all that stuff was.

258
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,188
I had no idea.

259
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:07,319
That pillowcase thing, I thought
you were doing "The Flying Nun".

260
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,531
Sometimes we were.

261
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,450
Come on.

262
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,204
Help me figure out what to do.

263
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,546
Pretty intense, huh?

264
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:31,719
I hope Ross didn't think we left
because we were uncomfortable here.

265
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,601
I hope he did.

266
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,193
Pheebs, it's Joey.

267
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,528
Hey, Joey!

268
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,657
I saw someone that looks just
like you on the subway.

269
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:59,746
I was going to say hi, then I figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.

270
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,791
That just cost me 4 bucks.

271
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,503
I called to see how the chick
and the duck are doing.

272
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:11,758
They're having fun with Aunt Phoebe.
Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful.

273
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,510
So do you miss me?

274
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,554
Kind of, but I've been
having too much fun.

275
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,557
You're not homesick yet?

276
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,852
I don't think so.

277
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,939
Well, the seven of us miss you.

278
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,277
- Who's seven?
- Me, Rachel...

279
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,903
...the birds, the babies.

280
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,908
The babies miss me?

281
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,117
Pizza guy's here!

282
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,412
You ordered pizza without me?

283
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:44,166
But we were thinking about you.
We ordered the Joey Special.

284
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,628
Two pizzas?

285
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,380
<i>- Gotta go! Talk to you later.
- Wait!</i>

286
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:54,135
Where did you get it from?

287
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:08,273
<i>And they're always glad you came</i>

288
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,943
<i>You want to be where you can see</i>

289
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,445
<i>Your troubles are all the same</i>

290
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:19,451
<i>You want to be
Where everybody knows your name</i>

291
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,790
Why have you brought me here?

292
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,458
You'll see.

293
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,920
This wedding won't happen.

294
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,382
Ross.

295
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,051
But imagine a lot more lights...

296
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,929
...and fewer bricks...

297
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,640
...and flowers and candles.

298
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,559
And the musicians can go over here.

299
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,479
The chairs can face this way and...

300
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,731
You go.

301
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:53,944
But if you don't love this,
we'll do it any other place or time.

302
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,862
Really, it's fine.

303
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:59,283
Whatever you want.

304
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,201
It's perfect.

305
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,620
And, I don't know, if it rains...

306
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,957
Then we'll get wet.

307
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,756
I don't even have a date.

308
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,511
Do you remember
where the duck food is?

309
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,639
In the guys' apartment,
under the sink. Why?

310
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,767
Because I'm going to London.

311
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,894
What? What do you mean?

312
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,313
I have to tell Ross I love him.

313
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,524
Take care and don't have
the babies till I get back.

314
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,986
You can't go.
Ross loves Emily.

315
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,989
I know, but I have
to tell him how I feel.

316
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,744
He deserves all the information
to make an informed decision.

317
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,872
You're going
because you hope he'll say:

318
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:51,627
"I love you too.
Forget the British chippy. "

319
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,545
You think he will?

320
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:59,092
No, because he's in love
with the British chippy!

321
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,846
You're just gonna mess with his head
and ruin his wedding.

322
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,433
It's too late!
You missed your chance.

323
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,395
I'm sorry.
This must be hard.

324
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,982
But it's over.

325
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:19,821
No, it's not over
until someone says, "I do. "

326
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:23,284
I do! I do!

327
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:33,669
Like I can really chase you.
I'm carrying a litter!

328
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,884
The Waltham residence.

329
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,969
Is this Emily's parents' house?

330
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,888
<i>This is the housekeeper.</i>

331
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:50,727
And, by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

332
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,855
<i>First one identifies oneself...</i>

333
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:57,985
...and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

334
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,363
This is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please...

335
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,282
...if it's not
too much trouble, please.

336
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:08,120
Might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

337
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,164
Miss Waltham is
at the rehearsal dinner.

338
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:15,294
And it is not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye.

339
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:19,381
I'll be nice, I swear.
Could you just give me their number?

340
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:23,718
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

341
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:28,056
Somebody is on their way to ruin
the wedding, and I have to warn them.

342
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,268
So give me that number
or I'll come over there...

343
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:37,482
...and I'll kick your snooty ass
all the way to New Gloukenshire!

344
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:42,237
She knew I could kick her ass.

345
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,536
Hi, sweetheart.

346
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,121
Mom, Dad.

347
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,664
Sorry, we're late.

348
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:55,042
My fault.
I insisted on riding the tube.

349
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,753
Judy, the kids!

350
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:02,174
That's what they call the subway.

351
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:03,008
I thought...

352
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,927
Dad, we got it.

353
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,055
Here comes my dad and stepmom.

354
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,473
Mr. And Mrs. Geller.

355
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,558
This is Steven...

356
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,226
...and Andrea Waltham.

357
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,521
Very nice to meet you.

358
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,481
Darling, the Gellers.

359
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,358
Darling, it's the Gellers.

360
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:24,738
She's self-involved.
I should never have married her.

361
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,865
- It's the Gellers.
- Where?

362
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,577
That's one and that's another one.

363
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:31,745
Lovely to meet you.

364
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,289
Nice of you to pay
for half the wedding.

365
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,001
The hell with tradition!
We're happy to do it.

366
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:40,004
We know how expensive
weddings can be.

367
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:44,175
Besides, this may be
the only wedding we get to throw.

368
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:48,720
A joke that's funny in all countries.

369
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:57,604
- What's in it?
- Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.

370
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,818
That's not food.

371
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:09,658
Everything's different here.
I want to go home.

372
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,702
I miss my family, the coffeehouse.

373
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:15,497
I can't remember
what Phoebe looks like!

374
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,500
It's been three days.

375
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,795
You're just homesick.

376
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:24,714
Would you just try to relax
and just enjoy yourself?

377
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:28,051
You're different here too.

378
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:31,514
You're mean in England!

379
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,056
What the hell?

380
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:34,225
What's up, Dad?

381
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,143
This bill for my half.
It's insane.

382
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,980
Why is it so much?
The reception's at their house.

383
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,151
Flowers, liquor.
Re-carpet first floor?

384
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,070
New guest bath, landscaping.

385
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,532
I'm paying to remodel this house.

386
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:53,118
I'll give that son of a bitch
a piece of my mind.

387
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,244
Please.

388
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,080
I don't want anything
to upset Emily.

389
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,125
She's had a hard enough
couple of days as it is.

390
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,669
Here.
Let me go talk to him.

391
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,800
You tell him no one takes advantage
of the Gellers.

392
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:14,223
Sometimes I forget
how powerful you can be.

393
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:19,728
And I'll go get drunk.

394
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,696
Your next flight to London?

395
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:32,283
There's one leaving in 30 minutes.

396
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,202
And I do have one seat left.

397
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,662
Thank you, thank you.

398
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:41,917
The last-minute fare
on this ticket is $2700.

399
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,836
I don't have enough left
on my credit card.

400
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,506
You can split it with another card.

401
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:51,218
How about five?

402
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:52,761
Thank you.

403
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:56,973
I need to see your passport.

404
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:04,189
I don't have it, but I can tell you
where it is on my nightstand.

405
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:09,278
You know what?
I have my driver's license.

406
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:13,031
And I have a 20.

407
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,663
My father is not going to pay
for the built-in barbecue.

408
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:24,501
And believe me, you can
kiss your gazebo goodbye.

409
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,671
I might be able
to get you the new lawn.

410
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,258
Then you have to give us
the lawn ornaments.

411
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:36,346
I go back there with lawn ornaments,
he'll laugh in my face.

412
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,682
It's ridiculous, I mean we had an
agreement!

413
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:43,228
Will you say something, Steven?

414
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:47,440
Don't take that tone with me.

415
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:51,195
All right, you can.

416
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,201
Thank God!

417
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,579
You changed your mind.

418
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:03,457
You probably don't want
to talk about it.

419
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:06,710
You're doing the right thing.

420
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,253
Where are you going?

421
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:10,673
What are you doing?

422
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:15,594
Why am I always pregnant
when she does that?

423
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,097
I'd like to toast Ross and Emily.

424
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,891
My big toast is tomorrow.

425
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:26,813
This is kind of my little toast
or Melba toast, if you will.

426
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:35,155
I knew Ross when he was going out
with his first girlfriend.

427
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:40,869
I thought things would work out
until he over-inflated her.

428
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,875
Oh, dear God!

429
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,754
Hello, Waltham Interiors.

430
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:52,422
Mrs. Waltham.

431
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:56,844
I need to speak with
one of the best men or Ross' sister.

432
00:27:57,094 --> 00:28:01,181
- Who is this?
- Phoebe, one of Ross' best friends.

433
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,309
If you're Ross' friend,
why aren't you here?

434
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,315
I can't fly.
I'm having my brother's babies.

435
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:16,572
Am I on the radio?

436
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,950
Can I talk to one of them?
It's important.

437
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,704
I'm bored of you now.
I'm going to cut you off.

438
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,541
Okay I have to kick her ass too.

439
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:34,131
We're excited that Ross and Emily are
getting married at Montgomery Hall.

440
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:38,135
To think, my friend getting
married in Monty Hall.

441
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,553
Come on, Monty Hall!

442
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:43,515
Let's Make a Deal.
Come on, you people!

443
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:47,978
All right, forget it.
Congratulations.

444
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:54,610
Best man number two, Joey Tribbiani.

445
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,239
I'm not good with the jokes
like Chandler here.

446
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,370
Congratulations to the happy couple.

447
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,667
I first met Ross
in this coffeehouse back home.

448
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,507
Home.

449
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,426
New York City.

450
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,513
Where everybody knows my name.

451
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,809
Anyway...

452
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,561
... I love you guys.

453
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,023
But not as much as I love America.

454
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:37,361
Can we please go home now?

455
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,238
Are you going home?

456
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:43,200
I was hoping to get
to know you better.

457
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,204
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.

458
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,711
I was laughing.

459
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:57,006
Out loud?

460
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,384
I didn't want everyone
to think I was stupid.

461
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:01,677
How are you?

462
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:05,514
My mom's driving me crazy.
But Ross is getting married!

463
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:09,059
I'm happy.
I won't let anything spoil that.

464
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:13,438
I just want to say that
Ross is a wonderful young man.

465
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:16,442
Thanks. We like him.

466
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:22,072
My God! You must have been
a teenager when you had him.

467
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,833
There's no way in hell
I'm paying for it.

468
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,544
Look, we're down to just one point.

469
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:21,006
Could we please just settle it
after the wedding?

470
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,632
Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...

471
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:24,551
Fine, but I'm not paying
for your wine cellar...

472
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:22,549
Hello.

473
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:26,428
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.

474
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:30,765
...you thieving, would-be-speaking-
German-if-it-weren't-for-us man!

475
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,598
Oh I'm afraid that plane has already
pulled away from the gate.

476
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,891
Okay, you know what. You're
going to have to call that plane

477
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,393
and tell them to swing around
and come and pick me up.

478
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:35,354
I can't do that.

479
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:39,650
The guy was hammered. There's
no way you look like Ross' mother.

480
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:37,105
Sure, you know what? Come
on, we'll just tell them

481
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:40,359
that there was like a problem
with like the "engine".

482
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:42,152
- Then why would he say it?
- Because he's crazy!

483
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,363
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you
to step aside, Miss.

484
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:48,199
Earlier, he thanked me for my very
moving performance in "Titanic".

485
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,366
Look, If I don't get to London... he is
going to marry that other girl!

486
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:52,371
I can't imagine why.

487
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:52,788
My mother's right.
I'll never get married.

488
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:57,334
All right, you know what? I am not leaving
here, until you call that plane back!

489
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,207
You know what, that is...

490
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,459
Who wouldn't want you?

491
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:02,505
Please! I'm a single mom
with a 30-year-old son.

492
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,845
I'm getting married today!

493
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:10,305
Hi Ross.

494
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:14,810
I'm getting married today!

495
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:20,482
Do you think he knew I was here?

496
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:30,492
I've never done that with you before.

497
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,495
So how are you?

498
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:36,539
You okay?

499
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:39,668
You?

500
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,754
You?

501
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:46,133
We did you.

502
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:53,640
- I better get going.
- Absolutely.

503
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,852
Could you not look?

504
00:32:57,102 --> 00:33:00,314
I don't want to look.

505
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:21,043
Excuse me, if you plan on
doing that the entire flight...

506
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:24,463
... tell me now, so that
I can take a sedative.

507
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:28,050
Or maybe slip you one.

508
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,558
It's just that I'm kind of excited.

509
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:42,689
I'm going to London
to tell this guy that I love him.

510
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:58,664
Where the hell have you been?

511
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:03,502
I spent the night out. I met
this cute bridesmaid. She is so...

512
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,170
I don't want to hear about her!

513
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,466
Pheebs, you know you're still
my number one girl.

514
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:13,428
We have an emergency.
Rachel's coming to London.

515
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,764
Great!

516
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:19,684
No, she's coming to tell Ross
that she loves him.

517
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:20,978
But he loves Emily.

518
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,480
I know that!

519
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,858
You have to stop her.
She's going to ruin the wedding.

520
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,318
Okay.

521
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:29,862
All right, so, okay...

522
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:41,373
Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming.
Do... something.

523
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,210
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's

524
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,046
your responsibility now. The
burden is off me, right?

525
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:49,172
Right.

526
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,966
So tell me about this girl.

527
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:59,474
Have you seen Monica?

528
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:02,811
I'm not seeing Monica!

529
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:11,278
We got to find her. Rachel's coming
to tell Ross she loves him.

530
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:14,281
- Oh, my God!
- Do you know where she is?

531
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:20,579
What's with the third degree?
Why not just shine a light in my eyes?

532
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:24,667
Then I realized all this stuff
I had been doing...

533
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:28,963
...proposing to Joshua,
lying about why I couldn't come...

534
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:32,508
...was all just a way of...

535
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,468
I'm sorry. Can I interrupt?

536
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:40,891
I just want to say that you are
a horrible, horrible person.

537
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:42,601
Pardon me?

538
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:46,355
You're about to ruin
the happiest day of his life.

539
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:49,024
I have to agree
with your friend Pheebs.

540
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:52,402
This is a terrible, terrible plan.

541
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:55,990
- But he has to know how I feel.
- But why?

542
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,494
He loves this Emily.
No good can come of this.

543
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,287
I think you're wrong.

544
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:05,124
Oh, no!

545
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:11,964
By the way, it seems to be clear
you were on a break.

546
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:24,518
Oh, my God!

547
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,062
It's like a fairyland.

548
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,940
I know. It's horrible, isn't it?

549
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,527
I love it. I only hope
my wedding looks this good.

550
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:37,364
- I just...
- You can let some go by.

551
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,660
Start looking out for Rachel.

552
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,871
I'll cover the door.
You watch that big hole.

553
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:47,499
I've got Chandler covering Ross.

554
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:50,418
Why would I care where Chandler is?

555
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:53,463
You know...

556
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:57,259
...sometimes I don't even
like Chandler.

557
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,431
I do.

558
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:05,475
I do.

559
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:07,519
It's the second one.

560
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,563
Right?

561
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,026
Hello, Joey.

562
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:17,446
Hey, Felicity.

563
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:21,324
I thought about you all day.

564
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,953
Talk New York to me again.

565
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:27,039
Forget about it.

566
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,792
How you doing?

567
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:35,672
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

568
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:37,925
You have to meet me in the middle.

569
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:42,554
My foot will meet
the middle of your ass.

570
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,058
- What's going on?
- Everything's under control.

571
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:50,938
You want a piece of me?
Is that what you're saying?

572
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,022
That's it!

573
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,524
Parents! Parents!
Back away!

574
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,860
This is our wedding day!

575
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,945
From now on, everyone gets along.

576
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,448
And if I hear one more word...

577
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:02,824
...no grandchildren!

578
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,369
That's right!

579
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,247
Sorry, old boy.

580
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:13,877
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

581
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,923
What was that about?

582
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:22,511
It was this disagreement over...

583
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:26,473
My God! You look beautiful.

584
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:30,602
You can't see me before the wedding.
It's bad luck.

585
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:35,775
I think we've had all the bad luck
we're going to have.

586
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:14,397
My God, Rachel!

587
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,567
You're here.
I can't believe it.

588
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:21,987
Why are you here?

589
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:25,615
I just came to...

590
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:32,080
I just needed to tell you...

591
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:36,877
...congratulations.

592
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:09,159
Hello, Waltham Interiors.

593
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,411
<i>Mrs. Waltham? Hi it's Phoebe again.</i>

594
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,246
Why?!

595
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:16,167
Yeah. Can I please please please talk

596
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,460
to one of the best men? This is
going to be the last time.

597
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:21,796
Joey, there's a girl on the phone for you.

598
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,009
Great!

599
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,219
Hello.

600
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:28,804
<i>Joey it's Phoebe.</i>

601
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:30,264
Did you stop Rachel?

602
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:33,099
No, but it's okay. She just came in and
gave him a hug. That's it.

603
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,935
Nothing got ruined?

604
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,020
No.

605
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,689
That's so great!

606
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,191
So what's going on now?

607
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,404
I'm walking down the aisle.

608
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:48,491
Still walking.

609
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:52,244
I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked
up with last night. Hey!

610
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:56,624
I just told her "Hey!".

611
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:59,627
I'm at the front with Ross.

612
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:02,797
It's Phoebe!

613
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:08,344
He looks pretty mad.

614
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:09,595
I better go.

615
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:13,849
Wait! Hold it up so I can listen.

616
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:23,150
- What we did last night was...
- Stupid.

617
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,694
Totally crazy, stupid.

618
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,572
What were we thinking?

619
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:32,826
I'm coming over
tonight though, right?

620
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:36,038
Definitely.

621
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:02,189
Friends, family...

622
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:04,441
... we are gathered to celebrate
here today...

623
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:09,196
...the joyous union
of Ross and Emily.

624
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:10,823
<i>May the happiness of today...</i>

625
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:12,408
...be with them always.

626
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:14,660
Now, Emily, repeat after me.

627
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,371
- I, Emily...
- I, Emily...

628
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:19,790
...take thee, Ross...
... take thee, Ross...

629
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,001
...as my lawfully wedded husband
in sickness and in health...

630
00:42:23,252 --> 00:42:25,296
...till death parts us.

631
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:29,467
As my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

632
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:32,302
...until death parts us.

633
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:34,930
Now, Ross.

634
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,556
Repeat after me.

635
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:38,350
I, Ross...

636
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,726
I, Ross...

637
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:41,395
...take thee, Emily...

638
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:44,857
...take thee, Rachel...

639
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:50,445
Emily!

640
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:06,670
Shall I go on?
