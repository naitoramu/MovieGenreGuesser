1
00:00:00,925 --> 00:00:03,484
I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl,

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:06,673
so I'm wise, and I have worms.

3
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:09,773
So... oh breakfast

4
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:12,038
I got your sausage,
egg and cheese biscuit.

5
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,647
Yummy yummy ! thank you Ryan.

6
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:20,597
What was the thing you needed me
to come in early for ?

7
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:24,914
The sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.

8
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:30,012
But thank you, and why don't
you just take a couple hours,

9
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:32,616
office is yours, home alone,

10
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,610
risky business.

11
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,656
Take your pants off, run around.

12
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:39,620
Whatever you wanna do ?

13
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:43,056
I'm just gonna take a nap
in my car until work starts.

14
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:48,380
Healtheir, gotta watch those carbs.

15
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:21,222

16
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:25,561
Today I, Michael Scott, am
becoming an home-owner.

17
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,310
- Investing in real estate.
- Diversifying, smart !

18
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:30,560
Yes it is. Yes it is.

19
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:33,861
It is very important to own a property.

20
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:37,622
Back in olden days, they
would not even let you vote,

21
00:01:37,738 --> 00:01:39,960
unless you own a property and
they threw you in the stacks,

22
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,372
and then humiliate you.

23
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:42,541
- And it worked !
- Yes.

24
00:01:42,547 --> 00:01:43,622
They should bring the stocks back

25
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:45,621
people would obey the law,
there'd be less trouble makers.

26
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:46,903
Maybe !

27
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:57,803
<i>Every so often, Jim dies of boredom.</i>

28
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:01,620
I think today it was the
expense reports that did him in.

29
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,362
And our deal is, that
it's up to me to revive him.

30
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:07,721
You see Dwight's coffee mug ?

31
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:09,342
Sometimes when he's not here,

32
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:11,561
- I try to throw stuff in it.
- No way !

33
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:16,670
Let's do this !

34
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:22,571
Here, try paper-clips.

35
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:26,561
Oh wait, this message, for Dwight.

36
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:33,753
- You should go.
- Yes, yes, final walkthrough.

37
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:35,810
Sign the papers at the condo.

38
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,862
- You'll have your lawyer there ?
- I don't need one.

39
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:39,320
- Can I be your representative ?
- I don't need repr...

40
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:40,800
- I think I should be there.
- No, no.

41
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,250
- No I'm good I can make
sure things are up to code.
- No, Dwight.

42
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,442
Please, am I not always the
guy that you rely on at work ?

43
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:46,853
Well, this isn't about work.

44
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:49,710
This is closing on a condo,
it's completely personal.

45
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,952
So you're taking a personal day ?

46
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:56,771
Except that, it's about my
living arrangement, and as boss,

47
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:58,791
I need to have a living arrangement,

48
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,761
- in order to do work.
- Please, I'll make you proud.

49
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:05,640
- Ok fine, yes you can come.
- Yes, as your representative ?

50
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,233
- As my associate.
- Same thing.

51
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:08,661
No it is not !

52
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:12,043
I have been Michael's
number 2 guy for about five years,

53
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:16,083
and we make a great team. We're like
one of those classic famous teams,

54
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:18,260
he's like Mozart and I'm like,

55
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,462
Mozart's friend.

56
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:25,801
No, I'm like Butch Cassidy,
and Michael is like

57
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,253
Mozart.

58
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:29,733
You try and hurt Mozart,

59
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:33,662
you're gonna get a bullet in your head,
courtesy of Butch Cassidy.

60
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:37,772
Ah, most honorable Pamera

61
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:40,210
not offensive because that's
the way they talk in movies.

62
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:41,900
- You headed out ?
- We are,

63
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,072
Dwight and I are headed to a big thing

64
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:47,183
why don't you have everybody
work on their expense reports

65
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:48,992
and I'd like them in
by the end of the day.

66
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:49,820
- Ok.
- Very good.

67
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:50,961
- Have a great time !
- We will.

68
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:53,613
Um did you do the thing
I asked you about the magazines ?

69
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:55,131
Yeah I changed them to your new address.

70
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:58,761
- Good, the Small Businessman ?
- Yep.

71
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:03,240
- Maxim ? American Way ? Cracked ?
- Yes,

72
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:07,002
I changed your Cracked
magazine subscription.

73
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:10,560
How about Fine Arts ?

74
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,443
Aficionado  Monthly ?

75
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:19,252
No ? Ok well could you get on that ?
cause I don't just read Cracked.

76
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:21,472
Thank you.
Ok, see you soon.

77
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:24,401
What kind of shocks
you've got on this baby ?

78
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:28,533
I don't know, regular, normal ones ?
Nothing fancy.

79
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:31,032
Not my style.

80
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,170
- What are you doing ?
- I wanna put the top down.

81
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:37,182
- Dwight it's 50° outside don't, please
- But then no one could see us.

82
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:40,732
I... just... would you... put it up ?

83
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:43,281
Ok, fine. Just leave it down.

84
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,873
whiner !

85
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:49,350
Check it out. I'm terminator.

86
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:52,411
I do not understand what
you spend your money on ?

87
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,810
Hey Oscar, on these new expense reports

88
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:58,350
do we really have
to go back to last quarter ?

89
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,923
Yeah, it's a terrible system I know.

90
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:05,352
What is 2005 Season here ?

91
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:09,041
- Wait a minute what is this ?
- It's a score board.

92
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:09,691
What ?

93
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:12,522
Kevin and I play this paper
football game when Michael's out.

94
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,282
- Really ?
- Or when we are bored.

95
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:16,041
Oh my god !

96
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:18,091
Wait this goes back 2 years !

97
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:20,043
We are bored a lot.

98
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:22,483
- Ow !
- Sweet !

99
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,531
Yes, so close.

100
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:29,491
I really love the paper triangle
flicking and hitting things game.

101
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:32,272
- Yeah, we call it Hate Ball.
- Why ?

102
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:34,922
Because of how much Angela hates it.

103
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:37,482
Hey do you guys have many other games ?

104
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:41,293
Sometimes we play "Who can put
the most M&M's in their mouth ?"

105
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:42,521
You play that.

106
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:46,142
You should ask Toby
to teach you Dunder Ball.

107
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,732
Home Sweet Home.

108
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:53,353
- Which one's yours ?
- Right there.

109
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:57,093
My sanctuary. My party pad.

110
00:05:57,446 --> 00:06:02,981
Someday  I can just see my grandkids
learning how to walk out here.

111
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:08,232
Hang on and swing from
this tree, pushing back...

112
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:13,042
Wait, no it's this one, right here.

113
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,593
Home Sweet Home.

114
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:21,733
So that's what this sound is all day !

115
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,802
Michael this is Bill he's the
head of the condo association.

116
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,931
Hey how are you ? Nice to meet you Bill.

117
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,370
Bill, mister Bill,

118
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:33,850
oh noooooo, mister Bill, oooooooh.

119
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:37,440
S&L ? When they pull him apart.

120
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,610
You could always get
rolled over by something.

121
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:42,582
- Ni... nice to meet you...
- Nice to meet you too.

122
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,302
This is smaller than your old place.

123
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:47,112
Yes, well I'm buying it
and I'm not renting it.

124
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,632
So it's still an upgrade.

125
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,691
He doesn't know anything
about property ownership.

126
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:53,980
He's kind of an idiot. 

127
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:56,791
Actually, I do own property.

128
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:59,742
My grandfather left me
a sixty acre working beet farm.

129
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:01,771
I run it with my cousin Mose.

130
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:05,801
We sell beets to local
stores and restaurants,

131
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,440
it's a nice old farm.

132
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:11,860
Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.

133
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,702
- Are we ready to sign some papers ?
- Actually no.

134
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:16,692
We have a couple of questions,

135
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:20,811
- about the neighborhood ?
- It's very safe, it's very clean,

136
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,743
also  it's very accepting
of all life styles.

137
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,022
It's a very gay friendly neighborhood.

138
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:32,340
- Oh good, that's good.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:35,551
It's good to be accommodating of that.

140
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,981
Let's go check out the master bedroom.

141
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:42,201
Stanley, I just played
Dunder Ball with Toby,

142
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,603
- What about you ? You got any games ?
- Yeah, I got a game,

143
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:48,330
it's called work hard so
my kids can go to college.

144
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:50,636
Fair enough.

145
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:54,900
This, my friends, is
the master bedroom !

146
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:59,016
Check out the cathedral's ceilings,
those are like 17 feet high,

147
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:01,602
we have cable readiness right there.

148
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:03,572
I am going to totally
pimp this place out.

149
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:06,162
I am going to put
a surround sound system,

150
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,083
I am going to put a plasma
screen right against this wall...

151
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,881
owww terrible idea

152
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:11,322
- I'm pulling my bed right over here
- No...

153
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,062
This is a shared wall,

154
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,793
Neighbor threw his wife into the wall,

155
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,963
Plasma screen hits the floor,
totally smashed.

156
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:19,300
- Well then I will get a warranty,
- Warranties don't cover it,

157
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:19,982
plus they're a rip off.

158
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:21,403
- Well I won't get a warranty,
- hush...

159
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:26,382
- There's the problem, it's solved.
- Listen, listen, can you hear that ?

160
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:34,321
Oh man, these babies are thin !

161
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:43,783
Games of the 1st
Dunder Mifflin Olympiad

162
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,472
This scented candle,

163
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:49,631
which I found in the men's bathroom,

164
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:53,211
represents the eternal...

165
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:56,721
burning of competition...

166
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:59,521
- or something.
- It smells like cookies.

167
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:03,452
Yes it does, yes it does my friend.

168
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:08,633
Ok we will be competing for gold,
silver and bronze yogurt lids.

169
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,791
Now the bronze are really blue,

170
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:15,563
and they're also the backside of the
gold, so no flipping ok ? honor system.

171
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:22,302
I do play games, I sing,

172
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:25,040
and I dangle things in front of my cats.

173
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,130
I play lots of games, just not at work.

174
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,510
Let the games begin !

175
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:38,653
And then I just need you
to sign here at this ara

176
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:42,510
- What kind of mortgage did you get ?
- 10 year.

177
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:49,562
- Well, 10 over 30, so 30 year total.
- What ? wha... you said 10

178
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:54,710
10 year fixed, over 30, 30 year total

179
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:57,852
- Ow 30 years !
- Ok, ok.

180
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:02,423
Wow you'll be paying this off
in your mid-seventies.

181
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,990
Forget about retiring when you're 65

182
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,090
Hey I have an idea,

183
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:08,933
you know that extra bedroom, if the
all girlfriend thing never happens,

184
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:12,202
- that's where the nurse can live.
- Ok, all right.

185
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,422
- Well this is it.
- Whenever you're ready.

186
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:19,821
Yeah, huh, okay,

187
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:22,883
- Is that supposed to come off ?
- Actually yeah.

188
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:22,880
<i>Hey look cool ! carpenter ends.</i>

189
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:27,720
I'm gonna take a little breather
for a second. Excuse me.

190
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:30,662
- We'll be here waiting for you.
- Oh man !

191
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,771
A 30 year mortgage at Michael's age,

192
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:35,060
essentially means
that he's buying a coffin.

193
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,182
If I were buying my coffin,

194
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:42,061
I would get one with thicker walls,
so you couldn't hear other dead people.

195
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:47,082
Whenever you're ready Michael !

196
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:53,882
You have what is the national sport
of Icelandic paper companies,

197
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,413
and I'm blanking on the name...
could you help me out Pam ?

198
00:10:57,465 --> 00:11:02,043
Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton,

199
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:05,170
in English "box of papers
snowshoe racing."

200
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,312
Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.

201
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:11,230
The thing about Jim is,

202
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,370
when he's excited about something
like the office Olympics,

203
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:18,712
he gets really into it and
he does a really great job,

204
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:23,903
but the problem with Jim is that he
works here so that hardly ever happens.

205
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:28,630
So, who will be challenging Kevin
in flankerton ?

206
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:30,582
- Anyone ?
- I'll do it.

207
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,881
Yes Phyllis.

208
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:39,731
Phyllis, you just put your foot right
trough here, right trough the flank.

209
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,992
The ceilings are lower than
they were last week, that, I don't,

210
00:11:44,168 --> 00:11:46,553
I don't know if you showed
me the same unit or not ?

211
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,742
What ?

212
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:51,310
- Michael this is the unit you saw and...
- Where are all the hot people ?

213
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:54,460
I was told that there would be
all these attractive singles,

214
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:56,020
- Who told you that ?
- And as far as I can I tell,

215
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:58,013
I'm the best looking person here.

216
00:11:58,077 --> 00:11:59,903
There's a basic principle,
in real estate,

217
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,320
that you should never be the best
looking person in the development.

218
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:06,312
It's sort of a common sense,
because if you are,

219
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:09,893
then you'll get no place to go but down.

220
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:14,803
Is this a financial thing ? if it's
a financial thing what some people
do is they rent out the third bedroom.

221
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:17,110
- No, no...
- That's an extra income for you...

222
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,101
I am not going to rent
the third bedroom,

223
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:22,693
I want a price reduction
or I am walking.

224
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:28,063
You will lose 7 000 $
if you walk away right now.

225
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:33,990
I made the right decision.
I'm glad I signed,

226
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,633
I'm a home-owner, right ?

227
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:40,233
Good to be a home-owner,
diversifying, this is good.

228
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:43,583
- This is fun, we're having fun !
- Totally having fun !

229
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:47,873
Can you imagine those poor saps
stuck at the office today ?

230
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:57,700
It's Phyllis !

231
00:12:57,836 --> 00:13:00,810
Phyllis by a nose
gold-medal in flunenton,

232
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:04,180
- flunkerton !
- Thank you ! Delegate from Iceland.

233
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:16,613
Wow, ok no one else
should even try, gold medals.

234
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,920
Give  him medals !

235
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:20,950
Wah !

236
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:26,171
There's something else Dwight,
I want to talk to you about.

237
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:28,070
I have a surprise for you,

238
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:30,360
- for helping me out today.
- Ow you don't have to d...

239
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:32,330
No, no I insist, I insist,

240
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:34,730
because you've really done
some great work, great work !

241
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:39,580
And that is why I am going to let you
move in to my third bedroom,

242
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,482
and pay me rent.

243
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:48,180
Why did I do it ? Because I believe
in rewarding people for their efforts,

244
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:53,052
I rewarded Dwight with the room,

245
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:58,403
and he is rewarding me back
with 500 $ plus utilities.

246
00:13:59,117 --> 00:14:00,620
I don't even know what to say...

247
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:04,291
I'm thinking, lock into
a 4 year commitment,

248
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:06,092
we'll go month to month after that,

249
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:10,393
or until I start dating, have
a girlfriend and then you're...

250
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,941
you know, you're gone. So...

251
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:15,232
Question :
where can I put my terrarium ?

252
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:18,680
What the hell is a terrarium ?

253
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:21,353
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.

254
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,270
Oh, so an aquarium.

255
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:29,251
That will not come into this place ok ?

256
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:30,801
- Question :
- Oh my god !

257
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:34,872
my grandparents left me
a large number of armoires.

258
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:37,552
- Are you sure you don't wanna play ?
- I'm sure.

259
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:42,041
- Come on Angela don't you have a game ?
- I have one yes.

260
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:45,670
- Well, let's play what is it ?
- I call it Pam-Pong,

261
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:47,800
I count how many times
Jim gets up from his desk

262
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:50,533
and goes to reception to talk to you.

263
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,681
- We're friends.
- Apparently.

264
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:57,862
<i>- Very nicely done. Ok so
I think that's a HOR for Stanley,</i>

265
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,101
- and HO for Phyllis.
- Are you calling me a ho ?

266
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:04,983
Oh my god,
Phyllis coming alive, I like it.

267
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:07,471
Question : what about carpooling ?

268
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,733
- Who pays for the gas ?
- We take separate cars.

269
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,701
and question can sometimes
I drive you car and you drive mine ?

270
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:13,822
- Why would we do that ?
- Just for fun.

271
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:14,483
No.

272
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,470
Question : who's the primary
in the fire insurance ?

273
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:18,821
HEP... GAME OVER !

274
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,253
Offer revoked Dwight.

275
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:25,702
I'm sorry, but you reach out,
and you try to be a nice guy,

276
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,552
and help out a friend,
and this is what happens.

277
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:30,540
This is what I get.

278
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,150
God, I'm... ok.

279
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:38,981
Thank god !
It was nice of him to offer,

280
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:41,653
but I live in a nine bedroom farmhouse.

281
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:45,573
I have my own crossbow range, 
it's a perfect situation for me.

282
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:49,803
Well look 2 bathrooms would have
been nice, we just have but one.

283
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:52,392
And it's under the porch.

284
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:56,873
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration

285
00:15:57,348 --> 00:16:02,533
Ryan Howard !
Ryan, gold medal.

286
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:03,603
- What's up ?
- I made something,

287
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:07,860
- For a closing ceremony.
- What ? Oh my god !

288
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:11,192
- When did you have time to make that ?
- Automatic voice-mail.

289
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,233
All right Pam, all right.

290
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,631
Nice  work.

291
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:28,131
You know you can always
refinance your mortgage.

292
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:30,980
We had a 15 year on our beet farm,
we headed off early.

293
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:34,320
Yeah, well you know what nobody
cares about your stupid beet farm.

294
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:36,030
Beets are the worst !

295
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,791
- People loved beets !
- Nobody likes beets.

296
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:41,453
- Everyone loves beets.
- Nobody likes beets Dwight.

297
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:44,263
Why don't you grow something
that everybody does like ?

298
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:46,303
You should grow candy.

299
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:50,450
I'd love a piece of candy right now,

300
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:52,350
not a beet.

301
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:55,320
- Let's get this roof com...
- Stop it !

302
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:57,762
<i>Final lap, final lap.
 Oscar ! </i>

303
00:16:57,788 --> 00:17:01,450
Time to beat is 1'15,
time to beat is 1 minute 15 seconds !

304
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,351
Here they come !

305
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,152
Guys ?

306
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:14,051
- What is going on ?
- Nothing.

307
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:18,620
- Guys, time is still going, or...
- That's my stopwatch.

308
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,500
There you go, all done.

309
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:40,760
Great.

310
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:43,201
Yeah, I filled out
these expense reports.

311
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:47,511
That take about 5 minutes and
then I close 2 sales at lunchtime.

312
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:49,700
So...

313
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:52,120
About as productive as any other day,

314
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:54,140
if not more so...

315
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:03,560
I figured I could throw it away now,

316
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:08,422
or I could keep it, for a couple
of months and then throw it away.

317
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,023
I mean it was really nice at Pam
to make them, but...

318
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:14,391
what am I gonna do with
a gold medal made of

319
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,161
paperclips and an old yogurt lid ?

320
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:29,750
- Hey !
- I have 59 voice mails.

321
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:34,790
Hey can you ignore those and
do something for me instead ?

322
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:37,382
- Sure.
- Ok.

323
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:41,610
Today, at 5 o'clock, closing ceremonies.

324
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:44,790
- Really ?
- Notify the athletes.

325
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:45,933
Cool.

326
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:52,023
- Michael ?
- Yep. Jim, slim Jim.

327
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,331
What's going... what's going on ?

328
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:57,491
Nothing I just want to
congratulate you on your condo.

329
00:18:57,557 --> 00:19:00,111
Oh thanks, thanks very cool,

330
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:02,970
- it's a 3 bedroom gay-friendly,
- Nice,

331
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:03,961
You know...

332
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:06,210
Hey would you mind
coming out here for a second ?

333
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,503
- I have something for you.
- Really ?

334
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,541
What's this ?

335
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:16,100
These are the closing ceremonies,
step up !

336
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:20,840
Here on the top one.

337
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,150
Congratulations to Michael,
because he closed on his condo,

338
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:26,712
so gold medal !

339
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:37,741
I don't really know what to say,

340
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:42,613
I'm not one for making speeches, but...

341
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,133
My heart is very full at this moment.

342
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:52,061
And for Dwight Schrute the silver medal.

343
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:56,112
Get on up here Dwight !

344
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:05,613
- Silver medal.
- Yep, but not as good as gold !

345
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:13,753
Why are you playing
the national hymn ?

346
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:18,592
- Cause your condo is in America.
- Oh.

347
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:29,490
- What the hell is that ?
- Those are the doves.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
