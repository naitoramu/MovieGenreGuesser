1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,266
What's going on?

2
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:20,146
My eye is a little itchy.

3
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,106
Mine too. Yeah.

4
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,485
It's really red.
You should go see my eye doctor.

5
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,987
I'm not gonna see your ex-boyfriend.

6
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,992
That's all I hear.
Richard, Richard, Richard.

7
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,870
Since we've dated,
I've said his name twice.

8
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,247
Okay. So Richard, Richard.

9
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,376
It's not Richard.
It's this new guy. He's good.

10
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,212
I'm sorry. I'm not going
to an eye doctor.

11
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,423
Oh, God. Here we go.

12
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:52,303
Anytime anything comes close
to touching her eye or anyone else's...

13
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,889
...she, like, freaks out. Watch.

14
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,514
Ross, come on!

15
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:01,853
I have a weird thing with my eye.
Can we not talk about it?

16
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,775
Hey, Rach. You know that great song?
"Me, myself and eye".

17
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,485
Monica! Come on!

18
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,571
All those in favor
of getting lunch, say "eye".

19
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,240
Ross! Stop it!

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,368
How much did I love
<i>The King and "Eye"!</i>

21
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,494
Chandler!

22
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,703
Me too, me too!

23
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,708
Just stop it! That's enough!

24
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,254
- You okay there, man?
- Yeah. I got too excited.

25
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,466
The One with Joey's Big Break

26
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,765
I gotta go.
I'm taking Ben to the park.

27
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,310
- Give him a kiss for me.
- All right. Bye.

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,228
Later.

29
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,273
I'm so sorry you got caught
in the middle of that.

30
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:33,821
I didn't mean to be so out there,
but I am furious with him.

31
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,034
Calm down?

32
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:43,455
I'm trying.
Man, that guy can push my buttons!

33
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:44,998
Why are you so mad?

34
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,877
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- It seems like...

35
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:52,130
You wanna be on my list too?
Keep talking.

36
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,509
Has anyone seen my list by the way?

37
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,261
No. What's it look like?

38
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:02,016
- A piece of paper and it says "Ross".
- I see.

39
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,229
I just got off the phone with Estelle.
Guess what?

40
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,189
I got the lead!

41
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,067
You got the lead in a movie?
What's it about?

42
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,570
It's called "Shutterspeed".
It's really cool.

43
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:19,867
I meet this girl in the subway
and we fall in love in, like, a day.

44
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,996
And then she disappears.
But I find out where she lives.

45
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:27,499
This old lady answers the door.
I say, "Where's Betsy?"

46
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:34,256
And she says, "Betsy's been dead
for ten years."

47
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,341
Chilling!

48
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:40,221
The best part is we're filming
in the desert outside of Vegas.

49
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,514
- You know what that means.
- I know.

50
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,851
Road trip! We can rent a car.
I have to be there by Tuesday.

51
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:51,148
Wait! My grandmother's dead.

52
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,488
We can talk about that too, Pheebs.

53
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,697
No, her cab.

54
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,033
She probably won't be using it.
Drive it to Las Vegas.

55
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,786
All right! Thanks!

56
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,956
What are we gonna do about my job?

57
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,249
Not go.

58
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,626
Great! Road trip, baby!

59
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,544
Is this okay?

60
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,256
Chandler, you don't have to ask
for my permission.

61
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,592
You can go.

62
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,303
Rach, we'll be late
for the eye doctor.

63
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:25,766
All right. Let's get this over with.

64
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:33,482
Look what I did.

65
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,651
I mean, look at this mess.

66
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,363
We're gonna probably have to
clean this up.

67
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,033
I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule!

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,412
If you thought that this mess
was gonna bother me, you are wrong!

69
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:51,041
All right, let's go, Blinky.

70
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,637
Hey, Joey. What's up?

71
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,765
I can't decide which route
to take to Vegas.

72
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,850
You've traveled a lot, right?

73
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,728
Yeah, I've been around.

74
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,273
Which route should I take?
The north or the south route?

75
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:19,653
If you take the north route,
there's a man with a beard of bees.

76
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,990
Great! Problem solved!

77
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,162
On the south route, there's a chicken
that plays tic-tac-toe.

78
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,123
Well, back to square one.

79
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,292
I know a way that you can decide.

80
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,713
I'll ask you a series of questions
and you answer as quickly as you can.

81
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,047
Yes!

82
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,967
Good. But wait.

83
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,970
Here we go. I want you to relax.

84
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,847
Take a deep breath.

85
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,182
Clear your mind.

86
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,685
- Peanut butter or egg whites?
- Peanut butter.

87
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,104
- Be a fireman or a swimmer?
- Swimmer.

88
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,608
- You'd sleep with Monica or Rachel?
- Monica.

89
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,153
I always thought it'd be Rachel.

90
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,989
- No thinking. Tie or ascot?
- Ascot.

91
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,657
- North or south route?
- North.

92
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,661
Bam! There you go! Huh?

93
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:14,417
That was incredible!
Beard of bees here I come!

94
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,212
This guy again.

95
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,632
Hey, what's up?

96
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,176
Not much. Wanna see a movie tonight?

97
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,802
What do you wanna see?

98
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,096
I don't know.

99
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,890
I know how to decide.
Show him your game.

100
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,185
No, thank you.

101
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,687
What's with her?

102
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,022
I don't know.
I know how we can decide.

103
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm gonna ask you questions
and you answer real quick.

104
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,194
- Action or comedy?
- Action.

105
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:46,782
Who would you rather sleep with,
Monica or Rachel?

106
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,205
Dude, you are sick.

107
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,628
I'm sorry. I forgot you had
that whole Rachel thing.

108
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:08,178
Oh, my God. What does that thing do?

109
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,056
- An eye removal machine.
- I'm out of here.

110
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,891
I'm kidding.

111
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,809
Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.

112
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,272
Monica said you were nervous.
Everything will be fine.

113
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,734
- So we're done.
- Almost, but first we gotta start.

114
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:26,280
This is a glaucoma test. Sit down.

115
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,907
Put your chin here.

116
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,327
Now, you'll feel a small puff of air
in each eye.

117
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,163
What?

118
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:39,084
A small puff of air.
Now, come on!

119
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,878
Here we go.

120
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:46,175
One, two, three.

121
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,593
I'm sorry. All right.

122
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,471
I'm gonna stay in here this time.

123
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,722
Ready?

124
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,892
- One, two...
- I'm sorry.

125
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,686
You know what?
I'm gonna hold her head.

126
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,981
That's okay.

127
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,444
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,531
You're young.
You don't have glaucoma.

129
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,287
So it was very, very nice
to meet you, sir.

130
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,831
What are you...
Are you crazy?

131
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,626
You got a small, minor infection
in that left eye.

132
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,506
Take these drops for a week
and you'll be as good as new.

133
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,384
No, I don't put things in my eye.

134
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:32,888
We'll see you here in three months.
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.

135
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,308
Give me the damn drops!

136
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,228
Dr. Miller?

137
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,481
P-E-C-F-D.

138
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,444
Very good, Monica!

139
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:50,823
- You know where they are.
- I sure do.

140
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,453
And you don't get one.

141
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,001
You know, those eye drops
are a miracle.

142
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,086
My eye is 100% better.

143
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:08,131
- They're still in my coat.
- Damn!

144
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,424
You ready to go?

145
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:15,181
How cold will it be there?
Will all these sweater vests be enough?

146
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,600
- What?
- I love you.

147
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,312
I wish Ross was coming with us.
I'll miss him.

148
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:26,609
Thanks. I just got
that jerk out of my mind.

149
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,862
Is the movie putting us up
in a big hotel suite?

150
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,197
Not really.
It's an independent film.

151
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:37,077
We don't have a big budget.
I'll stay in your room.

152
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,414
Once you get paid,
you'll be springing for a suite.

153
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,666
They must be paying you a lot.

154
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,919
For every dollar "Shutterspeed" makes...

155
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,924
...one penny of it goes
right in Joey's pocket.

156
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,927
You don't get paid unless
it makes money?

157
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,597
Did you not hear the plot
of the movie?

158
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,142
"She's been dead for ten years."

159
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:04,021
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

160
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,482
I wanted to say goodbye.

161
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:10,027
And to see if you guys would
place a little bet for me.

162
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,571
Twenty bucks on black 15.

163
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,990
- You got it!
- All right.

164
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,118
- All right. Bye-bye, now.
- Bye, you guys.

165
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,037
I'll say bye at the car.

166
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,415
Anyone wanna say bye to me
at the car?

167
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:29,337
I'll say goodbye to you at the car
if you don't mind the pus.

168
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,882
See you!

169
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:37,596
But wait a minute. The pus is good.
It means it's healing.

170
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:43,853
Hey, Pheebs. What you reading?

171
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,943
Hello?

172
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,033
Come on!

173
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,620
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

174
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:05,374
Pheebs, are you mad at me
or something?

175
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,168
If you are, please tell me
what it is I did.

176
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,087
- If you don't know, I can't help you.
- I don't know.

177
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,132
Well, I can't help you.

178
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:19,889
Well, whatever it is,
I am very, very sorry. Okay?

179
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,891
Apology accepted.

180
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,395
So we're good?

181
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,942
I'll see you later, okay?

182
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,193
Bye, fat ass.

183
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,404
All right!

184
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:40,075
Will you please tell me what it is
that made you so mad at me?

185
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:44,079
I don't know! I don't remember!

186
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,666
If you can't remember,
can't we just forget about this?

187
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,169
Oh, no. I am mad at you.
I know that much.

188
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,843
But I'm sorry about the "fat ass" thing
because you have a sweet, little heinie.

189
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:09,020
I'm getting pretty tired.
You'll have to take over soon.

190
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:13,442
We've been driving for a half-hour.
You haven't looked at the road once.

191
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,696
Don't worry. It's out there.

192
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,950
Maybe I just need lunch.
You wanna eat?

193
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,577
My treat.

194
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,289
Isn't that Ross' money?

195
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,584
Ross' treat.
Where do you wanna eat?

196
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:31,918
I don't know.

197
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,837
I know how we can decide.

198
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,006
I'll ask you questions.

199
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,675
And then you have to answer real fast.

200
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,304
So clear your mind.
Clear it right out. Clear it out.

201
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:46,016
- Would you rather be too wet or too dry?
- Too dry.

202
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,684
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- No.

203
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:51,689
- Will this movie be my big break?
- No.

204
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,524
- What?
- Yes.

205
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:58,028
- Dude, you said, "No."
- I also said, "Yes."

206
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,532
- This won't be my big break?
- No.

207
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,411
I don't believe this.

208
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:09,165
Look, I just don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

209
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,375
What are you talking about?
I'm the lead in a movie!

210
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:16,755
They're not even paying you!
This doesn't sound like a real movie!

211
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,008
I don't know why you're dumping
all over my big break.

212
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,970
I don't think this is gonna be
your big break.

213
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,056
Are you on this trip
to make me feel like a loser?

214
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,059
- I'd rather be alone.
- You don't want me here?

215
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,644
Not if you're like this.

216
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,980
The next time you ask me
a question like that, I'll lie.

217
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,858
I don't want you on the trip.

218
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:38,652
Why don't you pull over?
I'll get out now.

219
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,947
Fine.

220
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:43,823
Get out.

221
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,826
You can't stop on a bridge.

222
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,454
- Get out!
- Fine!

223
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,334
<i>Wait! Wait! There's no sidewalk!</i>

224
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:57,588
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna die here.</i>

225
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:03,927
Are you mad at me
because my hair gel smells?

226
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,556
Because I said your handwriting
is childlike?

227
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,767
No. That made me feel precious.

228
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,979
Because he's always
correcting people's grammar?

229
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:18,942
"Whom, whom." Sometimes it's "who"!

230
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,362
Yeah? Sometimes it's...

231
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:27,868
Did you beat him at a board game?
He's such a baby when he loses.

232
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,411
Okay, I'm the baby.

233
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,831
Hey! Stop it!

234
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,042
What are you doing here?

235
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,669
Joey kicked me out of the car
on the bridge.

236
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,964
- Why?
- I don't know. He went crazy.

237
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,718
We played that game where you
ask questions and answer fast.

238
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,513
That game should not be played
without my supervision.

239
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,266
I don't know what made him mad.

240
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,394
All I said was that
this wouldn't be his big break...

241
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,771
...that it wouldn't do
anything for him...

242
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,731
...and that it didn't sound real.

243
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,734
Okay, he should've
pushed me off the bridge.

244
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:01,985
What's in the bag?

245
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,863
I figured you'd be mad at me...

246
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,198
...so I got gifts that I found
on the roadside.

247
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:11,495
- Who wants the one-legged teddy bear?
- I do!

248
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:23,299
- Not even close.
- I need help! I can't do this.

249
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:25,342
Come on. Let's do it.

250
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:30,597
Sit down.
All right, put your head back.

251
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:34,976
- Now, open your eyes.
- Okay, they are.

252
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,687
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Four.

253
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,189
I was thinking four.

254
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,483
- Really?
- Yes!

255
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,736
Why don't we start
with a practice one?

256
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,656
- No drops.
- Great!

257
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:52,911
On three. One, two, three.

258
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,496
My pillow's all wet!

259
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,706
Well, you said it was practice!

260
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,041
Why did you move?

261
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,170
I knew you were lying!

262
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,922
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

263
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:06,175
Stop it! Oh, my God!

264
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:08,302
I am going...

265
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,345
Turn it over!

266
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,724
I am going to get...

267
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,601
...get these drops in your eye.

268
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:20,189
Oh, my God! You really are
freakishly strong.

269
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,024
Stop! Stop!

270
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,860
Stop it!

271
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,070
Damn, it's empty!

272
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:32,618
If Joey and Chandler walked in now,
we could make a fortune.

273
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,376
That is definitely Chandler,
Joey or Ross.

274
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,170
Or Rachel.

275
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,009
It's Joey.

276
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:52,554
Chandler told me what happened.
He's really upset.

277
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:58,935
Not as upset as he'll be when he finds
out what I did with his sweater vests.

278
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,812
What did you do to them?

279
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:05,276
There's a well-dressed
pack of dogs in Ohio.

280
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,988
I gotta ask Phoebe
something about the car.

281
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,116
<i>Hold on one second.</i>

282
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,368
- Hey, dude.
<i>- Hey, Pheebs.</i>

283
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:17,621
This wooden box keeps sliding out.
What is it?

284
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,332
My grandma.

285
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,755
And thanks.
She's having a great time.

286
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,259
Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.

287
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:33,095
Chandler's here.
He was wondering if...

288
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,723
I guess he ran out of change.

289
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,853
How am I gonna apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?

290
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:45,190
Send him something. So when he
gets there, he'll know you're sorry.

291
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,987
That's a good idea. I wonder where
I could get a basket of porn?

292
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,491
No, don't say I'm sorry with porn.

293
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,160
You should send him
a carton of cigarettes.

294
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,456
Because that way he can trade it
for protection.

295
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:03,542
No. That's prison.

296
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,380
I know how we're gonna
figure this out.

297
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,798
Clear your mind...

298
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:14,803
...and answer the first thing
that comes into your head.

299
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,222
- Do you like flora or fauna?
- Fauna.

300
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,057
- Simon or Garfunkel?
- Garfunkel.

301
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:23,437
- Why are you mad?
- You said I was boring.

302
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,357
When did I say that?

303
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,652
Oh, my God! I remember now!
We were playing chess.

304
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,822
Phoebe, you and I
have never played chess.

305
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:38,201
Remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing. You said I was boring.

306
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:43,916
Then you took off your energy mask
and you were Cameron Diaz.

307
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:49,505
There's a chance this
may have been a dream.

308
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,826
Stanley!

309
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,662
Your leading man is here.
Let's get to work.

310
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,331
Slight change of plans.

311
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,708
We've shut down.

312
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,169
What? Why?

313
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:32,464
It's a money thing.
We don't have any.

314
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,801
You're kidding, right?

315
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,052
What?

316
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,554
It's probably just temporary.

317
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:43,100
We're hoping to get some money soon.
Just hang out.

318
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,269
Hang out? How long?

319
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,148
I don't know. A week. Maybe two.
The money'll turn up.

320
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:53,527
People always wanna invest in movies.
You're not rich?

321
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,363
Worth a shot.

322
00:19:56,697 --> 00:20:01,493
Well, Joey. Let me know
where you're staying, okay?

323
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,205
Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?

324
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,873
These got left for you.

325
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,752
Thanks.

326
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:15,049
"Congratulations on your big break."

327
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,415
<i>- Monica, it's Joey.</i>
- Hey, Joey.

328
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,042
You remember me
even though you're a star.

329
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:56,131
<i>Come on. It'll be years</i>
<i>before I forget you.</i>

330
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,384
What's it like on a movie set?

331
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,720
Do you have a dressing room
and a chair with your name?

332
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,556
<i>Yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.</i>

333
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,726
<i>Tell Chandler he couldn't</i>
<i>have been more wrong.</i>

334
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:12,898
<i>I gotta go, Monica. My sushi's here.</i>

335
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,821
Sorry about that.
Thanks for waiting.

336
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,991
Everybody smile.

337
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:29,290
Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stay
at Caesar's. We hope it's toga-rific.

338
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:33,460
Kill me. Kill me now.

339
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:40,843
Rach, can you pass me the "TV Guide"?

340
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,344
