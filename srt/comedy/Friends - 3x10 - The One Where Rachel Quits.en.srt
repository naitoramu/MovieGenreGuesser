1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,240
-Oh, I don't know.
-What?

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,770
Well, as old as he is
in dog years. . .

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,320
. . .do you think Snoopy should
still be flying this thing?

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,720
Rachel?

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,730
Yeah?

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,640
Remember when you first came here and
you got trained by another waitress?

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,450
Sure! Do you need me
to train somebody new?

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,850
Good one.

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,770
Actually, Terry wants you
to take the training again.

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,920
Whenever.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,090
Do you believe that?

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,440
Yeah.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,690
The One Where Rachel Quits

14
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,960
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

15
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,330
So that's two boxes
of the Holiday Macaroons.

16
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,050
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,
I salute you.

17
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,330
Just admit it. You have no backhand.

18
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,450
Excuse me, little one.
I have a very solid backhand.

19
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,770
Shielding your face
and shrieking like a girl. . .

20
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,690
. . .is not a backhand.

21
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,770
I was shrieking. . .

22
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,050
. . .Iike a Marine.

23
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,490
All right, watch me execute
the three P's of championship play.

24
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,810
Power. . .

25
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,680
. . .precision. . .

26
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,050
. . .and panache.

27
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,370
You broke a little girl's leg?

28
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,130
I know. I feel horrible, okay?

29
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,330
It says here that a Muppet got whacked
on Sesame Street last night.

30
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,930
Where exactly were you around 1 0-ish?

31
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,530
I'm going to see her.
I wanna bring her something.

32
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,170
-What would she like?
-A Hello Kitty doll?

33
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,370
The ability to walk?

34
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,930
I'm gonna get back to retraining.

35
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,050
All right. See you, guys.

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,970
Look out, kids! He's coming!

37
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,050
I gotta go sell Christmas trees.

38
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,730
Have fun.
Oh, wait! No, don't!

39
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,930
I forgot. I am totally
against that now.

40
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,930
What? Me having a job?

41
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,970
No, I am against innocent trees
being cut down in their prime. . .

42
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,930
. . .and their corpses
grotesquely dressed. . .

43
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,650
. . .in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

44
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,050
How do you sleep at night?

45
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,530
Well, I'm pretty tired
from lugging the trees around.

46
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,370
You got this all wrong. Those trees
were born to be Christmas trees.

47
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,570
They're fulfilling their life purpose
by making people happy.

48
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,850
Really?

49
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:28,840
Yes!

50
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,240
Yes, and the trees are happy too. . .

51
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,560
. . .because for most of them,
it's their only. . .

52
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,330
. . .chance to see New York.

53
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,370
After you deliver the drinks,
take the tray--

54
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,970
Gunther, please. I have worked here
for two and a half years.

55
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,770
I know the empty trays go over there.

56
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,890
What if you put them here?

57
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,970
That's actually a good idea.
They'll be closer to the mugs.

58
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,570
You should have the other
waitresses do that too.

59
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,330
They already do.

60
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,640
That's why they call it the tray spot.

61
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,840
I heard them talk about that. I just
thought it was a club they went to.

62
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,320
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

63
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,290
Sweetheart.

64
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,650
So this must be kind of neat
for you, huh?

65
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,120
Your dad tells me
you get school off. . .

66
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,530
. . .and you don't have to sell
those cookies anymore.

67
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,130
I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.

68
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,970
Whoever sells the most
wins a trip to Space Camp. . .

69
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,170
. . .and gets to sit in a real shuttle.

70
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,770
You really like
all this space stuff, huh?

71
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,370
My dad says if I'd spend as much
time helping him clean apartments. . .

72
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,920
. . .as I do daydreaming
about outer space. . .

73
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,770
. . .he'd be able to afford a trip
to the Taj Mahal.

74
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,960
You'd have to clean a lot of apartments
to go all the way to lndia.

75
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,210
No. The one in Atlantic City.
Dad loves the slots.

76
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,530
He says he'll double the college
money Grandma left me.

77
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,330
Well, good luck to Dad.

78
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,730
Say, how many more boxes would you
have to sell in order to win?

79
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,010
The girl who won last year sold 475.

80
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,970
So far, I've sold 75.

81
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,970
Four hundred, huh?

82
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,330
Well, that sounds doable.
How much are the boxes?

83
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,600
Five dollars a box.

84
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,400
And what is second prize?

85
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,090
A 1 0-speed bike. But I'd rather have
something my dad couldn't sell.

86
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,130
Well, that makes sense.

87
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,760
Could you do me one favor?

88
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,530
Yeah, Sarah. Anything.

89
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,570
Could you pull the curtains open?

90
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,450
The shuttle astronauts
are gonna be on the news.

91
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,920
We don't have a Tv,
so the lady across the alley. . .

92
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,330
. . .said she'd push hers up
to her window so I can watch it.

93
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,560
Yes?

94
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,330
Hi. I'm selling
Brown Bird cookies.

95
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:21,050
You're no Brown Bird.
I can see you through my peephole.

96
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,330
Hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.

97
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,360
What does that mean?

98
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,450
It means that I can sell cookies,
but I'm not invited to sleepovers.

99
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,850
I can dial 91 1 at the press
of a button, you know.

100
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,320
Now, go away!

101
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,250
Please, please.
It's for a poor little girl. . .

102
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,770
. . .who wants to go to Space Camp
more than anything in the world.

103
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,330
I'm pressing.

104
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,410
A policeman is on his way.

105
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,210
Okay, okay!
I'm going, I'm going.

106
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,530
I can still see you!

107
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,800
All right!

108
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,570
-What are you doing here?
-I thought a lot about what you said. . .

109
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,250
. . .and I realize maybe
I was a little judgmental.

110
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,330
Yeah. Oh, but, oh.

111
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,690
Now, now, Phoebe, remember. . .

112
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,330
. . .they're just fulfilling
their Christmas--

113
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,890
-Destiny. Yes.
-Sure.

114
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,930
That one doesn't look
very fulfilled.

115
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,330
That's one of the old ones.
He's just taking it to the back.

116
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,730
You keep the old ones in the back?

117
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,570
That is so ageist.

118
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,850
We're making room for the fresh ones.

119
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,330
So what happens to the old guys?

120
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,250
They go into the chipper.

121
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,530
I have a feeling that's not
as happy as it sounds.

122
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,520
These are shaped like
Christmas characters.

123
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,250
Santa, Rudolph and Baby Jesus.

124
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,610
I'll take a box of the
cream-filled Jesuses.

125
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,370
One box? I'm trying to send
a little girl to Space Camp.

126
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,330
I'm putting you down for 5 boxes.
What about you?

127
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,090
All right. Do you have any
coconut-flavored deities?

128
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,810
No, but there's coconut in the
Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

129
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,410
I'll put you down for 8 boxes.
One for each night.

130
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,410
Mon?

131
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,130
I'll take a box of the Mint Treasures.

132
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,730
One, and that's it.

133
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,210
I gained weight after
I joined the Brown Birds.

134
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,290
Remember? Dad bought every one
of my boxes and I ate them all.

135
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,050
No, Mon. Dad had to buy
every one of your boxes. . .

136
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,130
. . .because you ate them all.

137
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,610
But, you know, I'm sure that's
not gonna happen this time.

138
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,570
Why don't I put you down for 3 Mint
Treasures and a couple of Rudolphs?

139
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,850
No.

140
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,850
Oh, come on, now.
You know you want them.

141
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,570
Don't do this.

142
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,930
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you the first box for free.

143
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,930
Oh, God! I gotta go!

144
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,650
Come on! All the cool kids
are eating them.

145
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,170
And later, I'll show you why
we don't just trap spiders. . .

146
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,930
. . .under coffee mugs
and leave them there.

147
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,450
I'm training to be better at a job
that I hate. My life officially sucks!

148
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,320
Wasn't this supposed to be temporary?
You wanted to do fashion stuff.

149
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,770
Yeah, I'm still pursuing that.

150
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,770
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

151
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,720
Other than sending out resumes,
like, what? Two years ago?

152
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,010
Well, I'm also sending out. . .

153
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,170
. . .good thoughts.

154
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,370
If you ask me, as long as you
got this job. . .

155
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,130
. . .you got nothing pushing you
to get another one.

156
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,970
You need The Fear.

157
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,210
-The Fear?
-He's right.

158
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,930
Quit this job, and you'll have motivation
to go after a job you really want.

159
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,610
Why are you still at a job you hate?
Why don't you quit and get The Fear?

160
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,040
Because I'm too afraid.

161
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,680
I don't know. I'd give anything
to work for a designer or a buyer.

162
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,850
I just don't want to be 30
and still work here.

163
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,370
Yeah, that'd be much worse than
being 28 and still working here.

164
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,930
Remind me to review with you which
pot is decaf and which is regular.

165
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,730
Can't I just look at the handles
on them?

166
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,250
You would think.

167
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,130
Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?
I am a terrible waitress.

168
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,050
Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?
Because I don't care.

169
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,610
I don't care which pot
is regular and which pot is decaf.

170
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,530
I don't care where the tray spot is.

171
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,610
I just don't care.
This is not what I want to do.

172
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,370
So I don't think I should do it anymore.

173
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,370
-I'm giving my week's notice.
-What?

174
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,730
Gunther, I quit.

175
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,130
Does this mean we have to start
paying for coffee?

176
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,690
Okay, 1 2.

177
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,760
Twenty-two.

178
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,560
Eighteen.

179
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,210
What?

180
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,130
I spelled out "boobies" .

181
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,040
Put me down for another box
of the Mint Treasures, okay?

182
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,130
Where are the Mint Treasures?

183
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,490
We're out. I sold them all.

184
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:55,930
What?

185
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,930
Monica, I'm cutting you off.

186
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,170
Just a couple more boxes.

187
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,280
It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.

188
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,730
You gotta help me
with a couple more boxes!

189
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,170
Look at yourself.
You have cookie on your neck.

190
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,610
Oh, God!

191
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,450
-So how many you sold so far?
-Check this out.

192
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,730
-Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
-Oh, my God! How did you do that?

193
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,040
The other night I was leaving
the museum. . .

194
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,330
. . .just as Laser Floyd was letting out
of the planetarium.

195
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,330
Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes!

196
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,010
That's when it occurred to me.
The key to my success: The munchies.

197
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,130
So I started hitting the NYU dorms
around midnight.

198
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,530
I am selling cookies by the case.

199
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,330
They call me "Cookie Dude" !

200
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,170
Stop what you're doing. I need
envelope stuffers, stamp lickers. . . .

201
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,930
-Who did these resumes for you?
-Me. On my computer.

202
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,930
You sure used a large font.

203
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,130
Yeah. Well, "Waitress at
a Coffeehouse" . . .

204
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,330
. . .and "Cheer Squad Co-Captain"
only took up so much room.

205
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,290
Hey, that's funny!

206
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,970
You're funny, Chandler!
You're a funny guy!

207
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,970
You know what else is funny?

208
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,050
Something else I might have said?

209
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,130
I don't know. Weren't you the guy
that told me to quit my job. . .

210
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,130
. . .when I had absolutely
nothing else to do?

211
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,130
Calm down. It's gonna be okay.

212
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,570
No, it's not gonna be okay.
Tomorrow is my last day. . .

213
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,690
. . .and I don't have a lead.

214
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,370
You know what?
I'm just gonna call Gunther. . .

215
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,330
. . .and tell him I'm not quitting.

216
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,930
You don't want to give in to The Fear.

217
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,330
You and your stupid Fear!
I hate your Fear!

218
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,850
I would like to take
you and your Fear--

219
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,240
Hey! I got great news!

220
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,720
Run, Joey! Run for your life!

221
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:07,210
What? Rach, listen. Have you ever
heard of Fortunata Fashions?

222
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,730
My dad's got a plumbing job there
and he heard there's an opening.

223
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,770
You want him to get you an interview?

224
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,770
Oh, my God, yes! I would love that!
That's so sweet, Joey.

225
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,130
Not a problem.

226
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,560
And now, for the great news.

227
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,370
That wasn't the great news?

228
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,410
Only if you think
it's better than this.

229
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,410
Snow-in-a-Can!

230
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,330
You want me to decorate the window?

231
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,370
Give it kind of a Christmas looky?

232
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,170
Christmas cookie?

233
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,770
Okay, and this one here's
a Douglas fir.

234
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,250
Now, it's a little more money,
but you get a nicer smell.

235
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,930
Looks good. I'll take it.

236
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,320
Wait, wait. No, no!
You don't want that one!

237
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,450
No, no. You can have
this cool brown one.

238
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,890
It's almost dead.

239
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,040
That's why you have to buy it,
to fulfill its Christmas destiny.

240
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,530
Otherwise, they'll throw it
into the chipper. Tell him.

241
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,130
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill
their Christmas destiny. . .

242
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,130
. . .are thrown in the chipper.

243
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,450
I think I'm gonna look around
a little bit more.

244
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,050
You gotta stop doing this.
I'm working on commission here!

245
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,730
I'm here to pick out
my Christmas tree.

246
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,970
Well, look no further!
This one's yours!

247
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,330
Is this the one
that I threw out last year?

248
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,690
Never mind!
Everybody wants a green one!

249
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,440
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to get so emotional.

250
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,690
The holidays are just hard.

251
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,400
Oh, honey. Is that because
your mom died around Christmas?

252
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,880
I wasn't even thinking about that.

253
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,930
Hi there.
How many did you sell?

254
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,130
I'm not gonna tell you. You're the
bad man who broke Sarah's leg.

255
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,210
Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?

256
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,610
You're a big scrud.

257
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,130
What's a scrud?

258
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,330
Why don't you look
in the mirror, scrud?

259
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,290
I don't have to.
I can just look at you.

260
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,130
All right, girls. . .

261
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,650
. . .and man.

262
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,120
Let's see your final tallies.

263
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,050
Debbie.

264
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,650
Three hundred and twenty-one
boxes of cookies. very nice.

265
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,690
Not nice enough.

266
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,010
Charla.

267
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,130
Two hundred and seventy-eight.

268
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,130
Sorry, dear, but still good.

269
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,290
Good for a scrud.

270
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,130
Yes, Elizabeth.

271
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,290
Eight hundred and seventy-one.

272
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,810
That's crap!

273
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,130
Sister Brown Bird.

274
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,240
Good going.

275
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,650
Who's next?

276
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,890
-Hi there.
-Hi.

277
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,290
And batting for Sarah. . .

278
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,570
. . .Ross Geller.

279
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,720
Eight hundred and seventy-two.

280
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,690
Although, it looks like you bought
an awful lot of cookies yourself.

281
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,250
That is because my doctor
says that I have. . .

282
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,450
. . .a very serious. . .

283
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,890
. . .nougat. . .

284
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,490
. . .deficiency.

285
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,930
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.

286
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,330
I lost. Some little girl loaned
her uniform to her 1 9-year-old sister. . .

287
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,160
. . .who went down to the U. S. S. Nimitz
and sold over 2000 boxes.

288
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,050
-How'd the interview go?
-Oh, I blew it.

289
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,330
I wouldn't have even hired me.

290
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,160
Come here, sweetie.

291
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,480
Listen. . .

292
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:13,490
. . .you're gonna go on, like,
1 000 interviews before you get a job.

293
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,330
That's not how that was supposed
to come out.

294
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,850
This is just the worst Christmas ever.

295
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,050
Maybe you should just
stay here at the coffeehouse.

296
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,170
I can't. It's too late. Terry already
hired that girl over there.

297
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,450
Look at her.

298
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,530
She's even got waitress experience.

299
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,610
Last night she was. . .

300
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,850
. . .teaching everybody
how to make. . .

301
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,320
. . .napkins. . .

302
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,370
. . .into. . . .

303
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,690
That word was "swans. "

304
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,930
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet
himself really perked up my Christmas.

305
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,130
Oh, my God!

306
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,330
Merry Christmas!

307
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,960
You saved them!
You guys!

308
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,010
Oh, God, you're the best!

309
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,370
Looks like Night of the
Living Dead Christmas Trees.

310
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,090
Yeah, this is she.

311
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,690
You're kidding! You're kidding!

312
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,210
Oh, thank you! I love you!

313
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,610
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.

314
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,330
I got the job!

315
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,760
That's great.

316
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,890
God bless us, everyone!

317
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,210
Here we go. I'm serving
my last cup of coffee.

318
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,440
There you go.

319
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,890
Enjoy.

320
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,160
-Should I tell her I ordered tea?
-No.

321
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,040
Excuse me, everyone?

322
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,400
This is my last night working here. . .

323
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,370
. . .and I just wanted to say. . .

324
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,760
. . .that I made some good friends here.

325
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,570
And it's just time to move on.

326
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,170
And no offense to everybody
who still works here. . .

327
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,720
. . .but you have no idea how good
it feels to say. . .

328
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,320
. . .that as of this moment. . .

329
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:32,130
. . .I will never have
to make coffee again.

330
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,970
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.
Iikes his coffee strong.

331
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,410
So you want to use two bags
instead of one.

332
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,250
Now, pay attention.
This part's tricky.

333
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,770
See, some people use filters
just once. . . .

334
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,370
I'm sorry you didn't get to go
to Space Camp. . .

335
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,480
. . .and I'm hoping that maybe somehow
