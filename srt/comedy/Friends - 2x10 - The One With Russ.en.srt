00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:10,428
Slow down! The paper won't be
sold out at 1:00 in the morning.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,221
I'm excited!
I've never been reviewed before!

5
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:17,017
You were so amazing as the king!
I'm really impressed.

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,477
But you know what?

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,521
You might wanna wear
underwear next time.

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:25,150
When you sat on the throne,
you could see your...

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,944
...royal subjects.

10
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,239
Here it is! Here it is!

11
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:34,034
"The only thing worse than
the mindless adolescent direction...

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:39,331
...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly
unskilled portrayal of the king."

13
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,792
Okay, look.
That is one guy's opinion.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,628
All right?
Pheebs, read yours.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,465
"The only thing worse than
the mindless, adolescent direction..."

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,302
Anybody have a different paper?

17
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,929
Ross, read yours.

18
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,099
I don't want to.

19
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,769
Joey, they don't know
what they're talking about.

20
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,062
Maybe they do.

21
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:06,399
I've done this 10 years and I'm
nowhere. There's gotta be a reason.

22
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,902
Come on, you're just
paying your dues.

23
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,279
No, no, no. It's too hard.

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,407
It's not worth it. I quit.

25
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,867
Come on, Joey!

26
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,494
Wait, wait one minute.
Wait a minute.

27
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,413
I believe this will change your mind.

28
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:25,377
"In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani
achieved brilliant levels of...

Continued on page 153.

30
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,924

00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,220
The One With Russ

33
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,431
I used to want to be a vet.

34
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:24,603
Then I found out you have
to put your hands into cows.

35
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,441
Are you okay?

36
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,277
Just a tough day at work, you know?

37
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:36,365
Stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.

38
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,452
I know this jacket.
This is Fun Bobby's jacket!

39
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,787
Where is he?
He's here, isn't he?

40
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,082
- Maybe.
- Don't toy with me.

41
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,124
Geller!

42
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,002
Hey, Fun Bobby!

43
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,045
Hey! You been working out?

44
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,338
Not at all.

45
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,216
I love this guy!

46
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,843
I'm psyched to hear
you're back with Monica.

47
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,179
- You and me both!
- So what'd I miss?

48
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,265
We were trying
to make Joey feel better.

49
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,059
Need me to pick you up?

50
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,727
No, I'm all right, man.

51
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,354
No, I'm picking you up!

52
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,399
No, seriously.
I don't need you to...

53
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:13,861
It still works!

54
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,324
Before I go, does anybody else
need to be picked up?

55
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,701
I'm still gonna go.

56
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,829
See you later, babe.

57
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:29,752
Public display of affection coming up.
You can avert your eyes.

58
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,968
See you.

59
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,594
Fun Bobby is so great.

60
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:40,971
Oh, isn't he?

61
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,851
I think this time it may work with him.
He makes me feel so good.

62
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,396
I've been feeling so lousy lately.
No job, no boyfriend.

63
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,399
Well, at least my cup is half full.

64
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,278
Half full of love!

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,949
For our two-week anniversary,
he's taking me to his cousin's cabin.

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,704
Cabin of love!

67
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,623
We went through
a lot of wine tonight.

68
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,083
I only had two glasses.

69
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,376
I had a glass.

70
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,418
Two.

71
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,460
I had one glass.

72
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,129
I had a mug full in this...

73
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,967
...I-got-boned-at-the-
Museum-of-Natural-History mug.

74
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,846
Okay, so that's what?
Two bottles.

75
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,057
And yet somehow we went through five?

76
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,614
So what?
So he drank a lot tonight.

77
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,325
Now that I think about it,
I don't think...

78
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:47,913
...I've ever seen Fun Bobby
without a drink.

79
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,750
And did you notice how
he always starts his stories with...

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,671
..."Okay, I was so wasted!"
or "Oh, we were so bombed!"

81
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:01,427
"So I wake up and I'm in
this dumpster in Connecticut!"

82
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,763
Have you been with him
when he wasn't drinking?

83
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,683
We just happen to go to a lot
of places where you might drink.

84
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,312
How do you go to a wine-tasting
without having a drink?

85
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,024
Or to a club, or to the...

86
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,027
...zoo.

87
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,074
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

88
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,911
I don't know, taste it.

89
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,709
Too late, you already had some.

90
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:40,423
What do you say
we make these coffees Irish?

91
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,762
Cake!

92
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:49,141
Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.

93
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,187
It seems like you've been making
an awful lot of stuff "Irish" lately.

94
00:05:54,438 --> 00:06:00,319
I'd make them Belgian, but the waffles
are hard to get into that flask.

95
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,488
Yeah, okay.

96
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:07,576
Maybe it's none of my business.
Or maybe it is, I don't know.

97
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,870
I'm worried about you.

98
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,458
This isn't the first time somebody
said something to me about this.

99
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,420
But I always made excuses,
like "I'm just a social drinker."

100
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,674
Or "Come on, it's Flag Day!"

101
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,595
So, what are you saying now?

102
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,430
I guess I'm saying...

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,390
...I'll try and quit.

104
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,978
I like that you worry about me.

105
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,231
So, what's going on?

106
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,567
I am gonna try and quit drinking.

107
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,945
Oh! Why?

108
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,163
Guess who's back in show biz!

109
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,873
Lorne Greene?

110
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,209
No. You know why?
Because he's dead.

111
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,213
Oh, no.

112
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,050
This is gonna seem bittersweet now...

113
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,552
...but Joey, that's who!

114
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:11,223
My agent called with an audition
for "Days Of Our Lives"!

115
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,433
Kick ass!

116
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:17,062
We have to celebrate!
We should do a soap opera theme.

117
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:22,317
We could all sleep together,
then one of us could get amnesia!

118
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,282
When do you get off?
We'll do something tonight.

119
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:33,162
Well, actually, I'm already done.
But I kind of got plans.

120
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,498
You have other friends?

121
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,917
I have a date.

122
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:39,919
What?

123
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,338
With a man?

124
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,757
What's so strange
about me having a date?

125
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,175
What about Ross?

126
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,886
You're still mad
because he made that list?

127
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,513
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

128
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,349
I'm not really "anything"
at him anymore.

129
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,562
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

130
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,231
Whatever I was feeling, I'm...

131
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,273
...not.

132
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,109
But you guys came so close.

133
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,404
I'm sorry. You'll have
to get used to the fact...

134
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,283
...that I will not be dating Ross.

135
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,411
Here he is.

136
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,206
Guys, this is Russ.

137
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,680
I'm not saying you're not talented.
You're very talented.

138
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:38,185
But with the bird dead and all,
there's very little act left.

139
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,687
Honey, give me a break, will you?

140
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,273
I'll talk to you later.

141
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,358
There's my favorite client!

142
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,194
So tell me, darling,
how was the audition?

143
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:51,365
I think it went well.
I got a callback for Thursday.

144
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:55,828
Joey! Have you ever
seen me ecstatic?

145
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,248
Well, here it is.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,837
Okay! Listen, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

147
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,131
The casting lady...

148
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,425
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

149
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,136
She's great.

150
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:16,723
But I kind of got the feeling that
she was sort of coming on to me.

151
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:22,855
And I definitely would get the part
if I were to, you know...

152
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:29,695
If I sent the little general in.

153
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,325
I see! Well, I'm just gonna
put in a call here...

154
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:39,038
...and we'll find out what's going on
and straighten it out.

155
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,249
Lori, please.

156
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,668
Hi, darling!

157
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,838
How about Joey Tribbiani
for the part of the cab driver?

158
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,383
Isn't he terrific?

159
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,555
Okay, doll, talk to you later.

160
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:00,475
You're gonna have to sleep with her.

161
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,813
- What's the matter?
- Fun Bobby.

162
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,356
What? Isn't he sober?

163
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,983
Oh, he's sober all right.

164
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:12,529
Turns out that Fun Bobby
was fun for a reason.

165
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,785
All right, here you go, sweetie.

166
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,580
Thanks. You wanna
hear something funny?

167
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,958
Oh, God, yes!

168
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:30,965
There are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

169
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,927
That is funny.

170
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:39,890
I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out
walking around the neighborhood.

171
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,475
But apparently...

172
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:48,065
...there are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

173
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,862
Don't you have to
be at your interview?

174
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,531
Oh, yeah.

175
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,451
See you guys.

176
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,161
Bye...

177
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,706
...ridiculously dull Bobby.

178
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,250
Oh, my God.

179
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,751
He's not that bad.

180
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,922
Not that bad?
Did you not hear the hammer story?

181
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,884
Okay, don't get all squinky.

182
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,804
Maybe it's the kind of story
where you had to be there.

183
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,389
But I'm gonna be there!

184
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,268
For the rest of my life.

185
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,105
I can't dump him. I made him
quit drinking. I made him dull!

186
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,481
Don't say that.

187
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,109
He's probably always been dull.
You just, you know...

188
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,196
...set it free.

189
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,574
Hey, Ross.

190
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:41,618
Hi, Russ.

191
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,955
I've got two more tables
to clean, and then we'll go.

192
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,624
I'll just sit here and...

193
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,378
...chat with your...

194
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:55,257
...friend-type people.

195
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,513
Rachel?

196
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,808
So, you know what
you're doing, right?

197
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,226
Waitressing?

198
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,521
Well, yeah. But, no.
I mean...

199
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,276
Doesn't Russ just
remind you of someone?

200
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,153
Bob Saget?

201
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,405
Oh, yeah!

202
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,199
No, no, no!

203
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,285
Oh, my, oh!

204
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,954
What's wrong?

205
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,498
She's upset because...

206
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:32,253
...she buttered a spider
into her toast this morning.

207
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,297
All right.

208
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,884
Listen, Pheebs.
This is gonna be okay.

209
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,596
Ross, Russ.
Russ, Ross.

210
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,226
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

211
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,477
Yes. Yes, I am.

212
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,355
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

213
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,525
Actually, I'm kind of a...

214
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,151
...you know...

215
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,362
...a date-type thing...

216
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,240
...of Rachel's.

217
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,117
A date?

218
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,535
I'm her date.

219
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,537
Oh! Oh, you're a...

220
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,540
Oh, you're the date.

221
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,083
This is actually good...

222
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,670
...because if we lose Ross,
we have a spare.

223
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,798
Oh! You are the paleontologist.

224
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:22,636
Yes. Yes, I am.
And you are a...

225
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,054
Periodontist.

226
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,933
See? Now they're as
different as night and...

227
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,976
...later that night.

228
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,814
Well, I am going to get a beverage.

229
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,108
It was nice meeting you.

230
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,902
Ditto.

231
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,535
Well, I met Russ.

232
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,747
Hey, I didn't know
we were seeing other people.

233
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,502
Well, we're not
seeing each other, so...

234
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,629
For your information,
there's a woman at the museum...

235
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,884
...who's curator of moths and other...

236
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,511
...winged things...

237
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:09,391
...who's let it be known that
she is drawn to me, much like a...

238
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,018
...you know.

239
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,854
I've kept her at bay,
but if this is the deal...

240
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,273
This is the deal.

241
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,192
Okay, well, have a nice evening.

242
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,279
Russ, you ready?

243
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,870
She's dating?

244
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,163
She's dating?

245
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:35,042
Yes, but did you see
who she was dating?

246
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,585
What do you mean?

247
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,545
- Do you not see it?
- See what?

248
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:43,133
I don't know what she sees
in that goober!

249
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,429
It takes him, what?
Like, I don't know...

250
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,057
...hello, a week
to get out a sentence?

251
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,228
It's annoying, isn't it?

252
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,578
You didn't get the part...

253
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,913
...or Italy called
and said it was hungry?

254
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,458
The part's mine if I want it.

255
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,584
Oh, my God!

256
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,588
If I'm willing to sleep
with the casting lady.

257
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:21,964
Oh, my...

258
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,341
...God?

259
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,303
Ten years I've been waiting
for a break like this. Ten years!

260
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:32,933
I mean, "Days of our Lives".
That's actually on television!

261
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,559
What are you gonna do?

262
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,313
I guess I could sleep with her.
I mean...

263
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,939
How can I do that?

264
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:43,527
I've got a pop-up book that told me
everything I need to know.

265
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,904
I've never slept
with someone for a part.

266
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,823
Well, is she...

267
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,827
Sorry.

268
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,787
Is she good-looking?

269
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,290
She's totally good-looking.
If I met her in a bar...

270
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,336
...I'd be buying her breakfast.

271
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:05,090
After having slept with her.

272
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,347
Maybe this isn't such a big deal.

273
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:17,019
The way that I see it is, you get a
great job, and you get to have sex!

274
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:21,857
Throw in a tree and a fat guy,
and you've got Christmas!

275
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,946
I just don't think that
I want it that way, though.

276
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,658
I mean, let's say
I do make it, all right?

277
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:35,079
I'll always look back and wonder
if it was because of my talent or...

278
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,666
...you know, the little general.

279
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,795
Didn't you used to call it
"the little major"?

280
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:47,049
After Denise DeMarco,
I had to promote it.

281
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,972
Something from the bar?

282
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,725
Yes, I would like something.

283
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,018
No. No, thank you.

284
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,980
If you wanna drink, it's okay with me.
I've gotta get used to it.

285
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:05,067
No, no, really.
I wouldn't feel right about it.

286
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,152
Just some water, please.

287
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:12,532
- So my refrigerator light's out.
- Scotch on the rocks with a twist!

288
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,328
We're having some fun now, huh, Ross?

289
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,457
Wanna do another one?
Huh, Russ?

290
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,460
Eleven letters...

291
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,380
...atomic element number 101,
ends in "ium".

292
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,007
Dysprosium.

293
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,634
Dysprosium.

294
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,427
Try mendelevium.

295
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,347
And weenie number two has it.

296
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:40,936
Unless "Knights in White Satin"
was sung by the Doody Blues.

297
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,816
You don't see it?
You actually don't see it?

298
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,234
What?

299
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,277
Honey, you're dating Ross.

300
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,196
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.

301
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,865
Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

302
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,201
Steve, sleeve.

303
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,787
No one is named sleeve.

304
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,914
What are you talking about?

305
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:05,210
Other than their names being similar,
I do not see what you're seeing.

306
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,087
For your information...

307
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,589
...it's a card sharp,
not a card shark.

308
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,425
You could not be more wrong.

309
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,845
You could try,
but you would not be successful.

310
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:20,851
I'm gonna get some more coffee before
the pinching and eye-poking begins.

311
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,436
I know your problem.

312
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,396
Oh, you do, do you?

313
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,023
You're jealous.

314
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,777
Of what?

315
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:33,989
You're jealous
because I'm a real doctor.

316
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,241
Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

317
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:40,537
That's the smallest body part
you can major in.

318
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,290
Day one, floss.
Day two, here's your diploma.

319
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,624
You listen here...

320
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,668
- Let me finish.
- No, let me finish.

321
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,423
No, you let me fin...

322
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,103
Did Joey say what he was gonna do?

323
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:06,814
I don't even think he knew.

324
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,775
Would you sleep with somebody
to get a great job?

325
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,319
Who would I have to sleep with?

326
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,155
Me.

327
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,908
Why with you?

328
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,953
It's my game.
You want the job or not?

329
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,040
Good morning.

330
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,333
Where you going?

331
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:30,670
Bobby and I are going away
for the weekend. Remember?

332
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,548
What's with all the liquor?

333
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,217
What's going on?
Is Bobby drinking again?

334
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:39,096
This is not for him.
This is for me.

335
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:44,560
That way, he's sober but his
shoelace stories are more amusing.

336
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:52,526
God! Even his knock is boring!

337
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:56,822
- I'll be ready in a second.
- Could I talk to you?

338
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,449
Sure.

339
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,494
This is hard for me to say.

340
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,453
You fell off the wagon!

341
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,206
Oh, no, no.

342
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,665
It's about you.

343
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,375
What about me?

344
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,379
I think you may have
a drinking problem.

345
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,091
What, these?

346
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:20,011
No, these are for cuts and scrapes.

347
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:25,517
Look, I'm not strong enough to be
in a codependent relationship.

348
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,687
Oh, shoot.

349
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:34,317
Well, anyway,
I hope we can be friends.

350
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,196
Take care.

351
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:42,451
- You too.
- Goodbye.

352
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,997
What happened?

353
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,292
We kind of broke up.

354
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,424
Does anybody want these?

355
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,634
I'll take one.

356
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:04,932
Sometimes I hold stuff like this
and pretend I'm a giant.

357
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,604
How'd the callback go?

358
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:14,566
It was unbelievable. I walked
in there and she was all over me.

359
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,860
- What did you do?
- I couldn't do it.

360
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,945
I didn't want the part that way.

361
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:19,988
Good for you!

362
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,782
But wait!
I left her office...

363
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:26,286
...and she caught up with me
and offered me a bigger part.

364
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,040
So, and?

365
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:33,627
So, you are now looking at
Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...

366
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:37,464
...recurring in
at least four episodes!

367
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:41,051
All right, I gotta go shower.

368
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:59,111
I guess you guys heard
Rachel dumped me.

369
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,196
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

370
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,740
She said I remind her
too much of somebody.

371
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:07,328
Any idea who
she's talking about?

372
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:11,957
Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

373
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,460
She hates him.

374
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:16,670
Hey, Julie!

375
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,463
How are you doing?

376
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,842
I don't know. It's weird
not being with Ross...

377
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,177
...but I guess I'm doing okay.

378
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:28,807
Actually, I've got some
of his stuff that he...
