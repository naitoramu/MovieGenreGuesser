00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:52,263
he wrote out,
"as soon as possible."

329
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:53,431
Mm.

330
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:57,702
Ugh, looks like
it's pretendy time again.

331
00:12:57,704 --> 00:12:59,270
Write back,

332
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:01,155
"looking for dirt."

333
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:02,957
Oh, can I help?

334
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,609
We could say someone
is related to, um,

335
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:07,662
Tonya Harding.

336
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:10,948
Pam, I'm related
to Tonya Harding.

337
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,050
Oh--
gee, I'm--

338
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:15,136
No, I'm just
practicing my lying.

339
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:17,288
- I love it.
- Brilliant.

340
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,424
What should we say about Jim?

341
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:22,727
Um, oh-- uh, say
he's related to Richard Nixon.

342
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:23,845
It's an inside joke.

343
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:25,730
He looks really Nixony
when he wakes up.

344
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:27,899
My ex behaved like Nixon.

345
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:32,186
All of the lying,
none of the sexual charisma.

346
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,305
I just made a joke then.

347
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:35,406
I'm sorry.

348
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:36,991
It's just, um--

349
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,509
I actually do have
this weird feeling

350
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:40,144
that there's something
Jim isn't telling me.

351
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:42,029
Oh, no.

352
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:43,564
Ugh, an affair.

353
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,817
It is always an affair.

354
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:47,652
Jim?
No.

355
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,787
[Sighing] How can you be sure?

356
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:53,741
Because he just
loves me too much.

357
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:56,961
You're a cocky little thing,
aren't you, Pam?

358
00:13:56,963 --> 00:14:00,998
I have done a little
genealogy research of my own.

359
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,668
Turns out I'm not the only one
with a few skeletons

360
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,803
in the ol' family closet.

361
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,372
For example,

362
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:10,007
Phyllis'
great-great-grandmother

363
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,311
was responsible for spreading
cholera to the United States.

364
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:14,395
Ew.

365
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:17,181
Kevin is related to both
John Wayne Gacy

366
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:18,850
and John Wayne Bobbitt.

367
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:21,319
And John Wayne?

368
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:22,820
No. Not that
I see here.

369
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:25,606
Wayne Johnson?
The Rock?

370
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:28,693
You mean Dwayne, and no.

371
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,528
What about Jim Halpert?
Uh-oh.

372
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,397
Turns out, distant relative
of the reviled

373
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,283
Richard Nixon.

374
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:37,368
Pam always says
I look like Nixon.

375
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,170
That's crazy, right?

376
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,756
I mean, there's nothing there.

377

00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:48,996
Oh, no.

379
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:50,097
Dwight's grandfather--

380
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,883
Was a member of the Bund,

381
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:53,935
which is not technically
the same thing

382
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:54,969
as the Nazi party.

383
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:57,638
So--
[Clears throat]

384
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,774
I was gonna say
he was a tax evader.

385
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,776
Oh.

386
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:03,861
I was joking about
that whole Bund thing.

387
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:05,696
Oh-ho, the look
on your faces.

00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:12,620

[Mimi<i>psycho</i> stabbing

Stop it! Stop it,
you're frightening me.

394
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:16,707
Andy, did you call this meeting

395
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,043
just to talk junk
about our families?

396
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:21,111
Yeah, that-- you're being
really mean.

397
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:23,447
No, I'm proving a point, okay?

398
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,115
We all have ancestors
who may have

399
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:27,284
done horrible things
in the past.

400
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:29,720
But it's in the past,
and it's not our fault.

401
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:31,622
So we don't have
to talk about it.

402
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:33,975
The difference is, Andy,
that you're the only one here

403
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:36,811
still benefitting
from the terrible things

404
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:37,962
your ancestors did.

405
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:40,765
Might have done,
and how do you figure?

406
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,433
Your family's rich.

407
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:43,818
I have to believe
that a big part

408
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,470
of the Bernard fortune was
earned on the backs of slaves.

409
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:47,605
You know, there's nothing wrong

410
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,306
with being successful
in America, Oscar.

411
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:51,692
I'm not gonna apologize
for my family's wealth.

412
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:55,145
That wealth could one day
benefit society,

413
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:57,131
if capital gains are ever
taxed at the same rate

414
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,182
as earned income.

415

[Cell phone ringing <i>Dixie]</i>

Okay, Kevin did that.

417
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,505
I do not wish I was in Dixie.

418
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:05,756
Hey, mom.
How are you?

419
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,676
Did any Bernards ever own

420
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:12,013
a plantation in the South?

421
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:13,598
She said no.
Take that!

422
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,900
Follow-up question,
did any Bernards

423
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:18,936
ever make money
in an unsavory way?

424
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,076
[Quietly] I just
asked you--

425
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:26,994
why didn't you
used to say that?

426
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:28,696
Okay, stop, stop.

427
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:29,947
Stop talking.
Stop talking.

428
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,950
That's-- no.
I don't want to know that.

429
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:34,335
Okay, you're interrupting
a meeting.

430
00:16:34,337 --> 00:16:35,369
I have to go.

431
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:38,122
Love you.
Bye.

432
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:41,509
Well, turns out the Bernards
of yore did not own slaves.

433
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:42,760
Really.

434
00:16:42,762 --> 00:16:44,345
We merely transported them.

435
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:48,182
Which, at worst,
makes us amoral middlemen.

436
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:54,918
Yo, D-Dog.
I need your help.

437
00:16:57,621 --> 00:16:58,955
I'm trying to think of things
I can say that make it

438

442
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:06,596
Actually, Andy,
you promised me five minutes

443
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:08,097
to talk about productivity
suggestions--

444
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,483
What if I said
that my dad beat me,

445
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:12,936
and I just left out
the croquet of it all?

446
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:15,321
Or, I could just go all the way

447
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:16,873
and say I grew up
in an apartment.

448
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,608
Or is that too crazy?

449
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,560
That could work.

450
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:22,278

manager stuff here,

all the heavy lifting.

Yeah.

it's every day.

the better title I have,

there was another job

that you and I could both have.

like sports marketing, or--

- Hell yeah.
- Right?

that it was in Philly?

00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,279
- So you'd have to--
- I love Philly.

Right?

- It's not even a thought--
- Not even a thought.

00:18:59,677 --> 00:19:01,511
Oh, it's happening.

491
00:19:01,513 --> 00:19:02,845
Let's just keep it
between you and me

492
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:04,130
- for right now, all right?
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

493
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:05,414
For sure, for sure, for sure.

494
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,301
Man.
And Pam's into it?

495
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:09,552
We gotta have a talk about it,

496
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:10,937
but I think
that she's--

497
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:12,105
I think she understands...

498
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:13,439
- Aw, come on, man.
- ...what this is.

499
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:14,807
I thought you had
something real.

500
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:15,892
What?
No, no, no.

501
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:17,193
Come on.
This is real.

502
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:19,428
It's not real

503
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,483
until your wife is on board.

504
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,602
So what did you
want to show me?

505
00:19:26,604 --> 00:19:29,705
That is quite an ugly wall,
isn't it?

506
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:31,774
Yeah.
It's really ugly.

507
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:33,576
Needs something, doesn't it?

508
00:19:33,578 --> 00:19:34,794
I'm thinking,

509
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:37,797
a mural.

510
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,831
You mean me?

511
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,832
Yes, you.

512
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,668
You are so talented.

513
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,504
It's going to be my next
special project.

514
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:47,090
Hiring Scranton's most
dangerous young muralist

515
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:49,092
to paint the warehouse wall.

516
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:50,560
Oh, my God, I love it!

517
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:51,978
Uh-- I--
Nellie,

518
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,729
this is brilliant!

519
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:54,847
- Hey!
- Hey.

520
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:56,732
Can I talk to you for a second?

521
00:19:56,734 --> 00:20:00,103
Anything you have
to say to her,

522
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:01,137
you can say to me.

523
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:02,188
She never loved you.

524
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,940
What? No, I--
I got this.

525
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:05,141
[Giggling] Okay.

526
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:06,308
[Quietly] Okay.
This is his fault.

527
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,860
It is not your fault.

528
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:11,497
I am gonna find you
someone better, and rich.

529
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:13,449
And Filipino.

530
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:17,420
But we'll break that
to her later.

531
00:20:17,422 --> 00:20:19,205
You know what
this is all about?

532
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:20,923
Yeah.

533
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:21,991
You too, huh?

534
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:25,494
Yeah.

535
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:28,598
Go on, spill it.

536
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,435
Tell her all the gory details,
you snake.

537
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:33,769
Hey.

538
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:35,454
He deserves this.

539
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:39,308
And he said I could
get in on it too.

540
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,145
[Whispering] Yeah.

541
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:44,897
Oh, Pam, no.

542
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:46,782
Oh, I can't bear to watch this.

543
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:48,951
I don't know what I was
so worried about.

544
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:52,622
I have the best wife
in the world.

545
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:55,641
I still can't believe
he didn't tell me.

546
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:05,961
I was helping
Nellie drive--

547
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:08,798
Do not care.

548
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,671
<i>Fonas chek!</i>

549
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:18,307
<i>Dothras chek!</i>

550
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:21,644
[Giggles]

551
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,712
I like that guy.

552
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:25,765
We should hook him up
with Meredith.

553
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:26,682
Hmm--

554
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:35,615
