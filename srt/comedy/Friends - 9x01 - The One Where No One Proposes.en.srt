1
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,676
Joey?

2
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,263
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,934
Okay.

4
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,908
So I guess we should
make it official, huh?

5
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,662
Look, Rach, I...

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,291
Hey, Ross is here!
Hey, look, it's my good friend Ross!

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,378
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey, Joey.

8
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,506
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

9
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:53,178
And he brought flowers! Thanks, Ross.
I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.

10
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,264
You're weird today.

11
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,021
Listen, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

12
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,941
Yeah. Actually, I kind of need
to talk to you too.

13
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,944
- Joey, could you give us a minute?
- No.

14
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,909
- What?
- I'm sorry. I meant, "No."

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,202
Hi. Hey, look who's here.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,373
Where's my granddaughter?
I've been practicing my magic tricks.

17
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,376
He pulled a quarter out of my ear.

18
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,963
- Hey, where's Mom?
- She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.

19
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,841
Aunt Liddy's coming?
That means we get $5 each!

20
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:36,847
So when do I get to meet Emma
and show her this:

21
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,432
Okay, wow.

22
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,520
Emma's in the nursery.
I'll take you now if you want.

23
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,232
- But I really want to talk to you.
- I know. I still need to talk to you.

24
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,818
But before you guys do that,
I need to talk to you.

25
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,905
And, Ross, I need to talk to you.

26
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,449
- And I need to talk to you.
- About what?

27
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,327
To see if you know
what these guys are talking about.

28
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,664
The One Where No One Proposes

31
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,336
Isn't she beautiful?

32
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:53,131
Look at her, my first grandchild.

33
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,095
What about Ben?

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,891
Well, of course, Ben.
I meant my first granddaughter.

35
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,483
Have you thought any more
about you and Rachel?

36
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,987
Yeah, actually I was gonna talk to her
when you guys came in the room.

37
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,491
That's so exciting! Wow.
You could've done that with us there.

38
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,661
- Yeah, right.
- Sure. Okay.

39
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,165
You can touch yourself in front of us,
but you can't talk to Rachel.

40
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,835
What? When have I ever
touched myself in front of you guys?

41
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:35,591
Oh, please. Just before,
when you were asleep in the lounge.

42
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,843
That Armenian family was watching you
instead of the TV.

43
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,809
That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegian
still has my Game Boy.

44
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,646
- Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

45
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,067
Dude, I just did something terrible.

46
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,945
That was you? I thought it was Jack.

47
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,949
No, no. That was Jack.
Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.

48
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:05,788
- What? Why does she think that?
- Because it kind of looked like I did.

49
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:07,998
Again, what?

50
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,418
Okay, I was down on one knee
with the ring in my hand...

51
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,130
As we all are at some point
during the day.

52
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,925
It wasn't my ring.
It fell out of Ross' jacket...

53
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,219
...and when I knelt down to pick it up,
Rachel thought I was proposing.

54
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,513
Ross had a ring?
And he was gonna propose?

55
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,850
- I guess.
- And you did it first?

56
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,229
This is gonna kill him. You know
how much he loves to propose.

57
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,065
I know. I know. It's awful.

58
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,650
Well, what did she say?

59
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,527
She said, "Yes."

60
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,781
Does Ross know?

61
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,909
Oh, my God.
What the hell am I gonna tell him?

62
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,620
- Maybe you don't have to tell him.
- I like that. Yeah.

63
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,415
If you clear things up with Rachel,
Ross never needs to find out.

64
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,502
But you have to do it before
he hears about it and kicks your ass.

65
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,880
All right, let's not get carried away.

66
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,841
I want a baby.

67
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:04,179
Honey, we've been over this.
I need to be facing the other way.

68
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:09,810
If we have sex again, it'll double
our chances of getting pregnant.

69
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,898
- I think that closet's still available.
- I am so tired.

70
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,447
- Yeah, okay, but no foreplay.
- Deal!

71
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,661
Dad, seriously!

72
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:33,041
You know, you really should
see someone about that.

73
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,085
Noted.

74
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:40,132
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.
Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?

75
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:44,678
Are you kidding me?
I could stay and look at her forever.

76
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,099
Actually...

77
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,980
- Hey.
- Hi.

78
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,483
Are you all right?

79
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,906
- I think I just got engaged.
- Oh, my God! He did it?

80
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,241
What? Did you know
he was gonna ask me?

81
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:10,787
Are you kidding?
I'm, like, the one who talked him into it.

82
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,749
I like to think of myself
as the puppet master of the group.

83
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,796
- And you really think this is a good idea?
- I just talked him into it.

84
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,716
Don't tell me I have to do you too?

85
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,553
- The puppet master gets tired, people.
- Okay.

86
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,431
I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.

87
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,269
Why? You two are so meant
to be together. Everybody thinks so.

88
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,896
Really? Even Ross?

89
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,025
Especially Ross.

90
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:46,573
Hey, Pheebs. You know what?
I'll come back later.

91
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,453
Wow. Kind of a full house here.

92
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,500
I guess I'll just... I'll come back.

93
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:02,006
There he goes. Your fiance.

94
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,467
I guess so.

95
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,179
Although he does
play with himself in his sleep.

96
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,432
I can't say I'm surprised.

97
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,397
- Dad, what are you doing?
- There are people in there having sex.

98
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,945
It can't be me. I'm standing right here.

99
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,197
- Wanna peek?
- No!

100
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,448
Come on.

101
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,536
You know what?
I don't like you without Mom.

102
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,788
Come on.

103
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,333
We're not peeking?

104
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,213
Well, I'm peeking.

105
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,924
Oh, my God!

106
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:50,345
Hello, sir. You know Monica.

107
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,322
- Hey, is it okay to come in?
- Of course.

108
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,451
Joey, this ring, l...
It's beautiful. I love it.

109
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:18,207
Yeah. Look, Rach,
there's something I gotta tell you.

110
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,457
- Hey.
- Hi.

111
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,879
- Are you ready to try nursing again?
- Yeah. Hi, Emma.

112
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,048
Why do you think
she won't take my breast?

113
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,592
It's all right.
It takes babies a while to get it.

114
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,428
- But don't worry, it'll happen.
- Okay.

115
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:39,061
Okay, sweetie, you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.

116
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,397
Dear Lord.

117
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,736
- I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?
- Yeah, look, I think that...

118
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,823
Because, look! She's pulling away again.

119
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,701
Do you think my nipples
are too big for her mouth?

120
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,082
She looks scared.
Doesn't she look scared?

121
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,543
You know, I don't really know her.

122
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,672
Why don't we try massaging
the breast to stimulate the flow?

123
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,300
- Okay.
- Are you kidding me?

124
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,221
This is so frustrating.
Why doesn't she want my breast?

125
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,807
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!

126
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,354
- Hey, wait up.
- Hi.

127
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,273
Congratulations.

128
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,651
I didn't want to say anything in front
of Joey. I didn't know if he knew.

129
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,364
What? That we had a baby?
Now let's give him a little credit.

130
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,992
Although he did eat a piece
of plastic fruit earlier.

131
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,827
No, no, that you
and Rachel are engaged.

132
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,707
- What?
- Oh, it's a secret?

133
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:46,128
Goody. Yes! We haven't done
the secret thing in a long time.

134
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,382
Phoebe, there is no secret, okay?
I didn't propose.

135
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:51,633
Are you lying?

136
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:56,263
Is this like that time you tried
to convince us you were a doctor?

137
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,352
I am a doctor!

138
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,107
You know what? I'm just gonna go
and talk to Rachel myself.

139
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,860
All right. Well, me too.

140
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:15,074
- Well, should we wake her up?
- No. No. Come on, let her sleep.

141
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,661
- She's so exhausted.
- And so engaged.

142
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:34,343
Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged!

143
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,305
Why? Why, why would
she think we're engaged?

144
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,558
Perhaps because you gave her
an engagement ring?

145
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,436
You know, Ross,
doctors are supposed to be smart.

146
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,148
- I didn't give her that ring.
- You didn't?

147
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,609
- No!
- So whose ring is it?

148
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,069
It's mine.

149
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,072
- Is it an engagement ring?
- Yes.

150
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,074
- But you didn't give it to her?
- No.

151
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,327
- But you were going to propose?
- No!

152
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,289
I might be losing interest in this.

153
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,168
Look. Look, my mom
gave me that ring...

154
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,379
...because she wanted me
to propose to Rachel.

155
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,757
But all I wanted to do was see...

156
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,760
...if she maybe, kind of wanted
to start things up again.

157
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,513
What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

158
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:23,934
I didn't want to rush into anything.
It seemed like she didn't want to either.

159
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,104
But I don't understand
how any of this happened.

160
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:31,233
What, did she find the ring in my jacket,
assume I was gonna propose...

161
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,778
...throw it on
and just start telling people?

162
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,907
No, no. She said you
actually proposed to her.

163
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:43,245
Well, I didn't! I didn't propose!

164
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,622
Unless...

165
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,292
Did I?

166
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:58,093
I haven't slept in 40 hours and...

167
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:04,474
It does sound
like something I would do.

168
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,777
Look, we can't stay in here forever.

169
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,281
It's just, I still can't believe
that my dad saw us having sex.

170
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,743
He didn't make it to one
of my piano recitals, but this he sees!

171
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:28,082
This is okay. We're all adults here.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

172
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,960
Now, let's put our underwear
in our pockets and walk out the door.

173
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,302
Hi, Dad.

174
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:46,099
- I can still call you that, right?
- Of course. I'll always be your dad.

175
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:51,271
I just want you to know that what you
witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.

176
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,610
- It wasn't fun?
- Why, why, why would you...?

177
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,696
Look, I just don't want you to think...

178
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,532
...that we're animals who do it
whenever we want.

179
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,409
Well, I don't think that.

180
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:08,413
Before today, I never thought
of you two having sex at all.

181
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,208
It was a simpler time.

182
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,128
The truth is, Dad, we're trying.

183
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,798
- What?
- Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.

184
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,175
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

185
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,761
Well, get back in there!
I'll guard the door!

186
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,848
That's okay, Dad,
we can wait until later.

187
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,141
Whoa! I don't think so.
Aren't you ovulating?

188
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,561
Daddy!

189
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,354
You gotta get at it, princess.

190
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,648
When your mother and I
were trying to conceive you...

191
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,401
...whenever she was ovulating,
bam, we did it!

192
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,111
That's how I got my bad hip.

193
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,324
That's funny. This conversation's how
I got the bullet hole in my head.

194
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:48,120
This one time I had my knee
on the sink, and your mother was...

195
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:52,374
Daddy, I don't think we need to hear
the specific positions you and Mom had.

196
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,211
You're right.
This is about your positions.

197
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:59,006
Now, what I saw in the closet
is not the optimum position...

198
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,300
...for conceiving a child.

199
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,220
- Although it might feel good.
- I don't feel good right now.

200
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:09,308
But pleasure is important,
and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.

201
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,812
You up to the task, sailor?

202
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,106
Seriously, sir,
my brains, all over the wall.

203
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,198
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, I need to tell you something.

204
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:30,412
Well, now's a good time.
I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.

205
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,372
Joey asked me to marry him.

206
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,583
- What?
- Joey proposed to me.

207
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:39,170
- Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!
- Well, I said yes.

208
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,132
What, are you crazy?
You just had Ross' baby!

209
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,470
It's so inappropriate.
No, it is worse than that. It is wrong.

210
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,390
It is bigger than mine!

211
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:54,936
I know. "Days of our Lives",
thank you very much.

212
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,480
- You can't marry him.
- Why not?

213
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:01,152
Come on, I don't want to do this alone,
and he's such a sweet guy.

214
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,820
And he loves me so much.

215
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,279
Well, do you love him?

216
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:06,865
Sure.

217
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:12,746
- Sure?
- Yeah, I mean, whatever.

218
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,708
Honey, the question is...

219
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,584
...do you really want to marry Joey?

220
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,213
No.

221
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,216
No, I don't.

222
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:30,263
Could you be a dear and go tell him?

223
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,017
You still haven't told Rachel
you weren't proposing?

224
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,560
No. She had the ring on...

225
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,814
...she seemed so excited,
and then she took her breast out.

226
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:44,194
Joey, you have to tell her what's
going on. And what did it look like?

227
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,822
I didn't look at it.

228
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,325
The stupid baby's head
was blocking most of it.

229
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,036
Go and tell Rachel right now,
before Ross finds out.

230
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,665
Look, it's not that easy.
She said she wanted to marry me.

231
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,460
I don't want to hurt her.

232
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,171
Okay, look, just do it gently.

233
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,548
You're right.

234
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:08,719
You're right. I'll go tell her now
before Ross finds out, and I'll be gentle.

235
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:13,140
I can do that. I am a gentle person.

236
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:17,686
By the way, two people screwing
in there if you want to check that out.

237
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,571
Hey.

238
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,489
Hey.

239
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,830
Listen, I heard about the engagement.

240
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,582
Surprised?

241
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,544
And confused.

242
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,801
Rach, sweetie...

243
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,553
...I didn't propose to you.

244
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,307
I know.

245
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,394
I don't think you do.

246
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,275
You didn't propose to me.

247
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,027
Joey did.

248
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,739
Poor baby, you're so tired.

249
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:16,996
Rach, I didn't propose to you.

250
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,123
Joey didn't propose to you.

251
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,420
And Chandler didn't propose to you.

252
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,716
You didn't propose to me.

253
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,969
Chandler didn't propose to me.

254
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,929
But Joey did.

255
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,099
Joey proposed to you?

256
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,604
- I can come back.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

257
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:45,316
- Joey, did you propose to her?
- No.

258
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,945
- Yes, you did.
- Actually, technically, I didn't.

259
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,615
- Well, then, why did you give me a ring?
- Wait.

260
00:17:53,782 --> 00:18:00,205
- You gave her the ring?
- No, and I did not ask her to marry me.

261
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,790
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

262
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,167
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

263
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,295
Yes, you did, and don't
you say you didn't!

264
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:09,381
He was right there. He got down
on one knee and he proposed.

265
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,925
- You were down on one knee?
- Yeah, that looks bad.

266
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:16,638
But I didn't propose.

267
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,558
- Then what did happen?
- Yeah, what did happen?

268
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,852
Okay, the ring fell on the floor,
and I went down to pick it up...

269
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,398
...and you thought I was proposing.

270
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:30,694
Yeah, but you said,
"Will you marry me?"

271
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,780
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

272
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,325
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.

273
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:45,167
- Why didn't you tell me that before?
- Well, I tried...

274
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:49,755
...but people kept coming in,
and then you took your breast out.

275
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,843
You saw her breast?

276
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,139
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.

277
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,268
Then what the hell were you
doing with an engagement ring?

278
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,063
It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.

279
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:10,901
That's why I felt so bad, Rach,
because he was gonna propose.

280
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,485
What?!

281
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,656
You were gonna propose to me?

282
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,537
No.

283
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,508
Well, this is awkward.

284
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:42,474
But I was going to see if, you know,
maybe you wanted to start dating again.

285
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:48,522
- But that, I mean, that was all, Rach.
- Dude, step up. I proposed.

286
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,482
No, you didn't.

287
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:56,196
That's right. There's a lot going on here,
and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.

288
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:03,620
Hey, she just woke up. She's hungry.
Why don't we give this another try?

289
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,290
I can't believe you told her
I was gonna propose.

290
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:10,251
- I can't believe you're not gonna.
- Hey, I am not gonna rush into anything.

291
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,504
Yeah, dude, I totally understand.

292
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,133
Usually after I have a baby with
a woman, I like to slow things down!

293
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,927
- Oh, my God!
- What?

294
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,846
She's doing it!
She's breast-feeding!

295
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,391
It's beautiful.

296
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,103
- I'll come back for her later.
- Thank you.

297
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:33,692
- Wow, this feels weird.
- What, good weird?

298
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,945
Wonderful weird.

299
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,115
You know what, you guys?
I'm gonna go too.

300
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:44,536
And I'm sorry about everything.

301
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:48,582
- Honey, don't worry, it was my mistake.
- No, Rach, I should've told you sooner.

302
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,459
It's just that...

303
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,503
Man, that kid is going to town!

304
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,645
She's perfect.

305
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,063
We're so lucky.

306
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,399
We really are.

307
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:23,909
Look, I know it's not a proposal,
and I don't know where you are...

308
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:27,997
...but with everything that's been
going on and with Emma, I'm...

309
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:32,084
- I've been feeling...
- Yeah, I know.

310
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,128
I've been feeling...

311
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,129
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

312
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,092
Okay, well, that...
Wow, okay, well...

313
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,930
Then maybe at least we can
talk about us again?

314
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,267
Yeah. Maybe.

315
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,603
Well, good. Okay.

316
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,565
I kind of think, you know, if we, if...

317
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,613
You're wearing the ring.

318
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,370
What's that?

319
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,418
And you told Phoebe
you were engaged.

320
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,548
I'm sorry, what?

321
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,055
When you thought Joey proposed...

322
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,014
...did you say yes?

323
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,741
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up
these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.

324
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:49,328
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

325
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:58,921
Sorry to bother you again,
but could you pass my pamphlets back?

326
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,758
Thank you.

327
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:09,098
