1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:02,905
Hey. Any luck with that big meeting yet ?

2
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:04,850
I've got Michael's lucky tie.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,981
No, they're in the conference room.

4
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:09,512
- Okay.
- Wait, are those Michael's Levis ?

5
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:11,854
Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans ?

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,010
Michael and his jeans.

7
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,620
He gets in them and....

8
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,611
I'm not exactly sure what happens.

9
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:18,689
But...

10
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:22,110
I can tell you, he loves the
way he looks in those jeans.

11
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:25,106
I know that's why he
started casual Fridays.

12
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:26,950
I'll take those.

13
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,526
Thanks.

14
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:00,281
Episode 7 - season 2
" The client"

15
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:01,943
Synchro: Occeane

http://pmag.f2o.org/theofficeus

17
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:09,571
This is a projection of
the county's needs.

18
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:12,620
Graphs and charts

19
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:14,863
Somebody's been really
doing their homework.

20
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:17,292
- Looks like USA Today.
- 13 schools,

21
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:19,161
2 hospitals...

22
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:20,983
<i>So this possible client
they're talking about</i>

23
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:22,163
Actually a big deal.

24
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,480
It's Lackawanna County.

25
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:25,302
Our whole county.

26
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:29,193
And if we get this, they might
not have to downsize our branch.

27
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:32,631
And I could work here for years.

28
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:35,683
And years...

29
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,752
Years.

30
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,131
So, when we get to
the Radisson, I'd like to

31
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,952
I changed it to Chili's.

32
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:44,771
Excuse me ?

33
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:47,452
Radisson just gives out this vibe.

34
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:49,353
It's like,
"Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson."

35
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:51,483
It's kinda snooty, so...

36
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,063
You had no right to do that, Michael.

37
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:56,463
Here's the thing, Chili's
is the new golf course.

38
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,633
It's where business happens.

39
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,190
Small Businessman Magazine.

40
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,113
It said that.

41
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,510
It will. I sent it in.
Letter to the editor.

42
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:08,043
Alright.

43
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:10,531
But you will let me run this meeting.

44
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:14,003
- Powertrip.
- What ?

45
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,793
She had done a background check on me.

46
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:18,573
She had it printed out,

47
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,021
Yeah.

48
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,531
And she was asking me about stuff line
by line while we were having dinner.

49
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:26,240
- What's going on ?
- We are doing worst first dates.

50
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:28,340
Oh my God. I win.

51
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:29,373
Okay.

52
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:32,193
it was a minor league hockey game.
He brought his brother.

53
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,913
And when I went to the bathroom,
the game ended,

54
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:36,910
- And they forgot about me.
- Okay, that's a joke.

55
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:38,861
No, they had to come back for me.

56
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:41,130
Wait, when was this ?

57
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,680
It was, not that long ago.

58
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:49,912
Wait, not Roy.
Say it's not your fiancé

59
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:53,712
I always knew...

60
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:56,261
Pam has refused to go to
sports games with Roy.

61
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:58,860
But, I never knew why.

62
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:01,570
Interesting.

63
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,083
Okay, let's do this thing.

64
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:06,243
- Wish us luck.
- Good luck Michael,

65
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:07,630
- Good luck Jan.
- Thank you.

66
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:09,361
Kiss ass. Okay !

67
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:12,363
Probably going to go late tonight,
burning the midnight tequila.

68
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:13,880
So,

69
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:15,841
I think you all could, just take off now.

70
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:17,891
Michael, this shouldn't take
more than an hour.

71
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:18,403
Well...

72
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:21,113
Do you always shut down the entire
office when you leave for an hour ?

73
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,021
No, no, that would not be efficient.

74
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:27,741
Actually,  they just don't get very
much work done when I'm not here.

75
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:30,781
That's not true.

76
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,611
I know how to delegate.

77
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:35,093
And they do more work when I'm not here.

78
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:37,212
Not more...

79
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,043
The same amount of work...

80
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,943
Is done whether I am here or not.

81
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,221
HEY EVERYBODY LISTEN UP !

82
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,450
This is what we're gonna do.

83
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:48,333
You sit tight untill I
return, sound good ?

84
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,120
Doesn't matter.
It's an order.

85
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,953
Follow it blindly.

86
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,431
Okay ?

87
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:57,030
Alright, ciao.

88
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:58,600
Adios !

89
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:02,312
- So which way is Chili's ?
- I'll drive.

90
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:04,300
No, that's alright.
I want to leave straight from there.

91
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:06,201
It's just a couple blocks away. So..

92
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:07,720
Boy, you really don't
know Scranton, do you ?

93
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,133
- I know Scranton.
- At all.

94
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:10,951
- Alright.
- Have you ever been to Scranton, Jan ?

95
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,070
it's just a couple blocks away
we can go together.

96
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:15,822
<i>Jan Levinson-Gould.</i>

97
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:17,371
<i>Jan is cold.</i>

98
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:19,331
If she was sitting across
from you on a train,

99
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:21,450
and she wasn't moving,
you might think she was dead.

100
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:24,480
We should come up with
a signal of some sort.

101
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:27,932
Why would we need a signal ?
Well, in case one of us gets into trouble.

102
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,570
The other one can signal...

103
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:31,490
What kind of trouble are you
planning on getting in Michael ?

104
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:33,343
Well, I, it could be either of us.

105
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:36,323
You're going to let me do the talking,
we agreed on that.

106
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:37,993
Yes !

107
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:43,032
Hello ? Christian ?

108
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,492
- Yes.
- I thought that was you. Hi.

109
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:46,880
Michael Scott, this is
Jan Levinson-Gould.

110
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:48,861
-  Just Jan Levinson.
- No Gould ?

111
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:49,583
No.

112
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:51,602
Thank you very much for meeting with us.

113
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:53,430
- Have you been waiting long ?
- No, not long.

114
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:55,221
- Good.
- Jan, what happened ?

115
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,710
- Michael.
- Is Gould dead ? What...

116
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:00,251
Michael. We got divorced, okay ?

117
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:02,271
- I'm so sorry, excuse me.
- Wow, you're kidding me

118
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:04,203
- Do you wanna talk about it ?
- Michael.

119
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:06,711
- Could we have a table for three please ?
- When did this happen ?

120
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:09,250
- We're in a meeting.
- Okay.
<i> This way please</i>

121
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:10,961
- Christian...
- Alright, after you

122
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:12,820
Thank you

123
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,761
I thought we could start by going
over the needs of the county.

124
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:20,960
Right.

125
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:23,343
Well, Lackawanna County
has not been immune,

126
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:27,021
to the slow economic growth 
over the past five years.

127
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:30,841
So for us, the name of the
game is budget reduction.

128
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:33,413
- Awesome Blossom ?
- What ?

129
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,292
I think we should share
and Awesome Blossom.

130
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:36,833
What do you say ? They are awsome.

131
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,521
You want to, Christian ? Awesome ?

132
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:40,990
- Sure.
- Okay, it's done.

133
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:42,590
Actually, Megan !

134
00:05:42,655 --> 00:05:44,830
May we have an Awesome Blossom, please ?
Extra  Awsome ?

135
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:46,231
Not it's done.

136
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,661
-  So, if you have a...
- Hey, I heard a very, very, funny joke...

137
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,911
- You wanna hear it ?
- Christian...

138
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,010
You don't have to listen to this.

139
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,283
- It's okay, I like jokes.
- Okay.

140
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:59,420
- Just the one.
- Just one joke ? Okay.

141
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:04,601
Well, if it's just gonna be one...
I, will think of a different joke.

142
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:08,381
Let's see.

143
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,080
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

144
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,636
<i>Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into
my office and check some data for me.</i>

145
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:15,300
Okay,

146
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,836
- You want me to read 'em ?
- Yes

147
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,530
Okay, um, a fisherman is walking down 5
th Avenue leading an animal behind him.

148
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:25,372
No! Nope. Told it. Not as good
as you think. Pick another one.

149
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:26,321
Okay.

150
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,581
There's a transcript
between a Naval ship.

151
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:31,823
Bingo! And a lighthouse.

152
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:34,441
Yes, that is hysterical. Could you
start that one from the beginning ?

153
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:37,990
<i>Sure, there's a transcript between
a Naval ship and a lighthouse.</i>

154
00:06:57,398 --> 00:06:59,423
Is this real ?
It is a screenplay...

155
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:01,863
Starring himself.

156
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:04,011
Agent Michael Scarn.

157
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:05,450
Of the F.B.I.

158
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,933
How long is this ?

159
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:09,333
Pam, good work.

160
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:11,880
Wait, stop.

161
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:14,731
- Drawings.
- What is that?

162
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,551
Those are drawings in case,

163
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:20,193
the writing didn't really,
put a picture in your head.

164
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:23,312
And there he is, in the flesh,
Agent Michael Scarn

165
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:25,562
Now we know what he looks like.

166
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:29,800
First guy says, "Well, I'm
an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn."

167
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,181
And the second guy says,

168
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:34,520
"Well, I am a pimp, so I
drive a cheap Escort."

169
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:36,200
And the third guy says,

170
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:41,090
"I got you both beat, I'm a proctologist,
so I drive a brown Probe."

171
00:07:45,438 --> 00:07:47,540
Oh, no! Oh my God, that's funny! I

172
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,882
almost had Awesome Blossom
coming out of my nose!

173
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,580
"S'il vous plaît," could I have
a vodka tonic, please?

174
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:58,333
Do we all have our copy of "Threat
Level Midnight" by Michael Scott ?

175
00:07:58,498 --> 00:07:59,733
Yeah.

176
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:00,711
Alright.

177
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,320
Let's get this started. I'm gonna be
reading the action descriptions

178
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:08,023
And Phyllis, I would like you to
play Catherine Zeta-Jones.

179
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,563
- That's the character's name?
- You guys  should not doing this/

180
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,270
Why not Dwight? This is a movie.

181
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:15,951
I mean this is for all of
America to enjoy.

182
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,242
You took something that
doesn't belong to you.

183
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:20,931
- Dwight. do you want to...
- Brought it in here, made copies of it...

184
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:23,920
The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn ?

185
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:30,550
That's delicious! I love it.

186
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,522
We would probably be upset with ourselves

187
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:36,143
if we went this whole night
without talking business.

188
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,092
So, Dunder Mifflin can provide,

189
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:41,560
a level of personal
service to the county,

190
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:44,042
that the warehouse chains
just can't match.

191
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:47,063
- Well, we are out to save money.
- What's the bottom line?

192
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,670
Blah! Blah blah blah. Blu bad be bah.

193
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,532
That's why I wanted a signal.

194
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:53,781
Between us.

195
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:54,612
So,

196
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:57,352
I wouldn't have to just shout
nonsense words. That's her fault.

197
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:01,441
Did somebody say babyback ribs ?

198
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:07,183
I don't think Christian has time for that.

199
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:08,642
- Michael.
- I have time.

200
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:13,460
I want my babyback, babyback, babyback...

201
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:17,841
Chili's babyback ribs..

202
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:21,651
Inside the F.B.I., Agent Michael Scarn
sits with his feet up on his desk

203
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:23,922
Catherine Zeta-Jones enters.

204
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:26,653
- Sir, you have some messages.
- Not now !

205
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:27,863
They're important.

206
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,673
Okay, what are they ?

207
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,370
The first message is "I love you."

208
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,081
That's from me.

209
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:36,550
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.
We work together.

210
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,232
And get off my desk.

211
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:39,710
Yes, I have acted before.

212
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:42,333
I was in a production of Oklahoma !
in the seventh grade.

213
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:45,471
I played the part of Mutie the mailman.

214
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,291
They had too many kids, so they
made up roles like that.

215
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:51,711
And I was good.

216
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:53,641
If it isn't my old partner.

217
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:55,603
Samuel L. Chang.

218
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:59,583
Agent Michael Scarn, you
lost some weight.

219
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:02,090
Thank you for noticing.

220
00:10:02,356 --> 00:10:04,702
Now, keep me company fo
r one more mission.

221
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:07,371
Hey, I have to work late.

222
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,940
You're joking, right?

223
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,771
Agent Michael Scarn takes
out a nine millimeter gun

224
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:14,683
And shoots the cake to bits.

225
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,792
Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.

226
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:20,003
Word.

227
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:21,621
Michael's movie ?

228
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:23,850
Two thumbs down!

229
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:35,421
A man sitting several seats down who
has a gold face turns to Michael Scarn.

230
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:39,361
Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?

231
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:41,802
Mr. Scarn !

232
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:44,310
perhaps you would be more
comfortable in my private jet.

233
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:48,142
Yes, perhaps I would Goldenface.
Sam, get my luggage.

234
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:49,863
I  forget it, brotha.

235
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:53,320
Samuel, you are such and idiot !
You are the worst assistant ever.

236
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,673
And you're disgusting Dwigt.

237
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:57,822
Wait, who's Dwigt ?

238
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:59,611
Here's what we think happened.

239
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:03,693
Michael's sidekick, who all through
the movie is this complete idiot,

240
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:08,401
who's causing the downfall of the United
States, was originally named Dwight.

241
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:13,372
But then Michael changed it to Samuel L.
Chang using a search and replace.

242
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:15,850
But that doesn't work on
misspelled words.

243
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:18,721
Leaving behind one, Dwigt.

244
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:21,072
And Dwight figured it out.

245
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:22,312
Oops.

246
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:25,440
D-W-I-G-H-T

247
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:29,061
Okay, you know what ?
I am done with this. That's it, the end.

248
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,942
Well, some of us wanna
keep reading, so...

249
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:33,563
You don't speak for everyone, Jim.

250
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:37,212
Okay, announcement.
My uncle bought me some fireworks.

251
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,421
And anyone who wants to see a real show,
come with me outside now.

252
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:45,200
That's actually a good idea,
we'll all take a brief intermission.

253
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:46,861
Hey, are you hungry?

254
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:48,492
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

255
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:51,663
And so after watching my mom
go through so much pain,

256
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:54,070
I decided to keep that promise,

257
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,612
that I made to her and take care of her.

258
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:00,790
This brings us to Jan. Truth or dare ?

259
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,052
- Tell us about your divorce.
- Oh, no, Michael. Michael, Michael.

260
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:06,462
- Ooh, right ?
- Michael please, no.

261
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:09,143
Hey. So you're not gonna play.
She's not playing.

262
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,422
She's not playing the game.

263
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,662
- We've been fighting for a while,
- That's not fair.

264
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:13,670
he didn't want kids.
I knew that going into it.

265
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:17,242
But he also knew that I did. So I guess
I thought that he would change his mind.

266
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,270
He thought that I would change mine.

267
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:20,750
You didn't.

268
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,103
I was stupid.

269
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:23,972
No. No.

270
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,612
You were not stupid.

271
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,841
- Gould was stupid, right ?
- That's right.

272
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,561
You know, you were really brave.

273
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:34,191
I mean, you, you put your arms
out there, you slit your wrists.

274
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:35,273
It's true. Yous said :

275
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:37,570
"World, this is my blood, it's red."

276
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:40,012
"Just like yours, so love me."

277
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,851
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.

278
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,752
<i>Which I had to cancel.</i>

279
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,343
But this is cool too.

280
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:49,463
I'm not a complainer.

281
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:54,663
Wow. 

282
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:56,481
For the bugs.

283
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:57,773
Nice.

284
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:00,521
That's excellent because bugs love..

285
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:02,943
My famous grilled cheese sandwich.

286
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,013
Yes !

287
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:05,731
Nice.

288
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,702
I can't remember the last time
someone made me dinner.

289
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:25,022
Right down the street ?

290
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,223
Kenneth  Road, born and raised.

291
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:30,083
Spent my whole life right
here in Lackawanna County

292
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:32,010
And I do not intend on moving.

293
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,902
I know this place. I know how
many hospitals we have.

294
00:13:36,905 --> 00:13:39,432
how many schools we have.
It's home, you know?

295
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,311
I know the challenges that
this county's up against.

296
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,900
Here's the thing about those discount
suppliers, they don't care.

297
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:48,680
They come in, they undercut everything.

298
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:50,603
And they run us out of business.

299
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:53,771
And then, once we're all gone,
they jack up the prices.

300
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:54,822
- I know.
- It's bad.

301
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:57,192
- It's terrible.
- It is, you know what ? It really is.

302
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,622
I don't know.

303
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:03,071
I guess I could give you
guys our business but,

304
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:05,491
you have to meet me halfway, okay ?

305
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:07,583
Because they're expecting
me to make cuts.

306
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:12,753
Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic,
but, you think we could, Jan?

307
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:19,111
So, I guess I'll see you in..

308
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:21,130
10 hours.

309
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:23,070
What are you going
to do with your time off?

310
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:24,520
- Travel.
- Yeah.

311
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:26,123
I've been looking forward to it.

312
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:28,592
It's gonna be...

313
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,680
really nice. I'm gonna find myself.

314
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,200
You have new music ?

315
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,553
Yeah.

316
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:37,600
Definitely.

317
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,410
- See ya !
- Bye !

318
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:53,262
Thanks.

319
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:55,762
- Yes !
- We did it.

320
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:56,973
- We got it !
- We nailed it.

321
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,540
- I mean we got it!
- Come here.

322
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,300
I am really...

323
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,261
...thrilled.

324
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:20,241
- Let's go.
- What ?

325
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:21,910
- Let's go.
- Go and, okay.

326
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,181
Where are we going ?
Doesn't matter.

327
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,441
Goin' to the go-go

328
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,072
Okay.

329
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,150
Michael ?

330
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,212
Michael ?

331
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:54,590
Michael ?

332
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,263
His car's not in the parking lot.

333
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:05,601
I should check the accident reports.

334
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:10,003
Who's this ?

335
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,252
Jan?

336
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:33,072
Morning, Pam.

337
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:38,481
No, nothing happened.

338
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,712
I swear ! Nothing happened.

339
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:45,413
What I'm...

340
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:48,032
totally being serious.

341
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:51,430
A gentleman does not kiss and tell.

342
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:54,531
And neither do I.

343
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:58,512
I'm...seriously, guys, I'm, I'm not,
I don't wanna go into it at all.

344
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,080
t's of limits. (

345
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:06,881
Fine, I took her back to her hotel,
and we made out for a little while.

346
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:08,942
It was great. I mean she told
me about her divorce.

347
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:12,432
We talked for about five hours,
she fell asleep on my arm. You know.

348
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,512
- Hello, Dwight.
- Did you do her?

349
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:24,342
- Who ?
- Jan Levinson-Gould.

350
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:27,040
No, no...

351
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,412
- No Gould.
- Did you do her ?

352
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,420
This is none of your affair.

353
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:34,742
- And she is your boss.
- And she is a woman.

354
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,452
She is a strong, soft...

355
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:40,820
...thoughtful, sexy woman.

356
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,302
And you know what ?
I don't think I can sit here,

357
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,572
And let you talk about her that way,

358
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:49,621
Without me defending her honor. 
Jan, I defend your honor.

359
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,122
Is that all ?

360
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:58,782
Jan didn't come back for
her car last night.

361
00:17:59,427 --> 00:18:01,023
What ?!

362
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,730
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn
has finally found his Catherine Zeta ?

363
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:06,860
Oh, I don't know...

364
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,662
Oh, my God !

365
00:18:09,765 --> 00:18:12,801
- This is Jan's cell.
- No way.

366
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,053
Dunder  Mifflin, this is Pam.

367
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:17,300
I know we have to register,

368
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:20,382
as a consensual sexual
relationship with HR.

369
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,522
My question, do I do it as the man,

370
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:26,010
does she do it as my superior ? I

371
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,482
I don't know. That leads to other issues
that we may have, in our relationship.

372
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:33,143
It's...Excuse me

373
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:37,132
Hello? Hi, just talking about you.

374
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:39,532
The camera.

375
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:42,413
No.How's traffic ?

376
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:44,911
I miss you, what ?

377
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:47,333
Okay.

378
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:50,363
Well.

379
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,073
if it was a mistake, it was
a wonderful mistake.

380
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:58,232
No, just...

381
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:02,991
No, I did not intentionally
get you drunk.

382
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,760
No, no. This is just a fight.

383
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:12,921
This is just a first fight of
many fights we're gonna have.

384
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:15,702
Right.

385
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:17,063
No.

386
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:20,001
You, I don't understand.
You wanna see other people.

387
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:22,913
Only other people.

388
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:26,651
I think you're still a little bit drunk.
Excuse me, Excuse me ?

389
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:30,152
I think you're stil- yes.

390
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:32,103
Why don't you just come back here?

391
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:34,451
We can go to the hotel.
Have a few drinks.

392
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:36,701
No, I didn't slip you something !

393
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:39,903
Some might even say we
had our first date last night.

394
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:41,940
- Oh really?
- Really.

395
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:46,301
- Why might some say that ?
- 'Cause there was dinner, by candelight

396
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:49,371
Dinner and a show, if you
include Michael's movie.

397
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:53,580
And there was dancing and fireworks.

398
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,092
- Pretty good date..
- We didn't dance

399
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:59,543
You're right, we didn't dance.
It was more like...

400
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:01,372
swaying.

401
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:04,963
- But, still romantic.
- Swaying isn't dancing.

402
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:11,221
At least I didn't leave you at a
high school hockey game.

403
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,282
I have some faxes to get out.

404
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,691
Oh, come on. Pam, I'm...

405
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:25,560
Okay, we didn't dance.

406
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:27,702
And I was totally joking, anyway.

407
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:32,123
it's not really a date if the
girl goes home to her fiancé.

408
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,471
Right ?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
