1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:08,842
Guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy's
putting stuff in boxes.

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,680
I'd say our naked buddy is moving.

3
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:18,769
Ironically, most of the boxes
seem to be labeled "Clothes".

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,438
I'm going to miss that big
old squishy butt.

5
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:25,942
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.

6
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:30,114
If he's moving, maybe I should
try to get his place!

7
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,033
It would be so cool
to live across from you guys.

8
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,327
We could do that telephone thing...

9
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,163
...where you have a can,
we have a can...

10
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,708
...and it's connected by a string.

11
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:46,046
Or we could do
the actual telephone thing.

12
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,591
The One Where
Everyone Finds Out

13
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,847
Oh, my God. I love this apartment!

14
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,390
Isn't it perfect?

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,227
I can't believe I never realized
how great it is!

16
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:46,231
Because your eye goes
to the big naked man.

17
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,774
It's amazing!

18
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:52,530
Hurry up with an application,
or I'll beat you to it.

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,288
Well, I'm going to use
Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.

20
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,044
Look! There's Monica and Chandler.

21
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,381
Hey, you guys!

22
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,767
Chandler and Monica!

23
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,938
Oh, my God!

24
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,732
Oh, my eyes!

25
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,568
My eyes!

26
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,070
It's okay!

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,239
- They're doing it!
- I know!

28
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,449
- I know!
- You know?

29
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,828
Yes, I know it. Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!

30
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,707
What's going on?

31
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,626
- What?
- Nothing!

32
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,421
We are so excited
that you'll get this apartment!

33
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,631
Looks really good.

34
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,592
Looks pretty good!

35
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,429
Get in here!
Come on!

36
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,229
You mean whenever
Monica and Chandler...

37
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,649
...were doing laundry
or going grocery shopping?

38
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,985
The time Monica spent on the phone
with Linda from camp?

39
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,406
Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.

40
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,366
I can't believe it!

41
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,035
I think it's great. For him.

42
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,289
She could do better.

43
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,873
Hey, you guys.

44
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,459
Come here!

45
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,878
Phoebe found out
about Monica and Chandler.

46
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:35,174
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?

47
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,384
Joey, she knows.

48
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,346
We saw them doing it
through the window.

49
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:46,435
Actually, we saw them doing it
up against the window.

50
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:50,022
So they know you know,
and they don't know Rachel knows?

51
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,275
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

52
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,695
Now enough of us know
that we could just tell them we know.

53
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,948
All the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

54
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,454
Or, we could not tell them we know,
and have a little fun.

55
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,080
What do you mean?

56
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:12,795
If they say they are doing laundry,
we'll give them laundry to do.

57
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,463
I would enjoy that.

58
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,509
You know what would be even more fun?
Telling them.

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,720
No, I want to do Phoebe's thing.

60
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,846
I can't take...

61
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,683
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them we know.

62
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,686
I can't take anymore secrets.

63
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:33,691
I got your secrets, their secrets,
secrets of my own.

64
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,735
You don't have any secrets.

65
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:42,157
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,
my bedtime penguin pal.

66
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,623
How are we going to mess with them?

67
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,376
You could use your position
as the roommate.

68
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,213
And I would use the strongest tool
at my disposal.

69
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,966
My sexuality.

70
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,010
Hello, children.

71
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:06,056
Watch. Learn.
And don't eat my cookie.

72
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,312
That jacket looks great on you.

73
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,732
- Really?
- The material is so soft.

74
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,319
Hello, Mr. Bicep.

75
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,404
You're working out?

76
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,199
I try to squeeze things.

77
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,456
Are you okay?

78
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,833
If you really want to know...

79
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,335
I can't tell you this.

80
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,296
You can tell me anything.

81
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,716
Actually, you are the one person
I can't tell this to.

82
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:45,053
And the one person I want to the most.

83
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,432
What's going on?

84
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,935
I just haven't been
with a guy in so long...

85
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,730
...and sometimes you're
looking for something...

86
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,650
...and it's right there
in front of you, sipping coffee...

87
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:02,696
Oh, no. Have I said too much?

88
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:08,410
Just something to think about.
I know I will.

89
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,132
You are so cute.

90
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,718
How did you get to be so cute?

91
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,179
My grandfather was Swedish.

92
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:31,600
And my grandmother was
a tiny little bunny.

93
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,978
Now you're even cuter.

94
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,483
You know, that is a popular
opinion today, I must say.

95
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,319
The weirdest thing happened
at the coffeehouse.

96
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,197
Phoebe was hitting on me.

97
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,115
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,911
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

99
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,708
It's not possible.

100
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,005
I'm sorry, Phoebe's just
always thought you were charming...

101
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,341
...in a sexless kind of way.

102
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,553
You know, I can't hear that enough.

103
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,015
I just think you misunderstood her.

104
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,851
I didn't, okay?
She was all over me.

105
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,895
She touched my bicep,
for crying out loud.

106
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,355
This bicep?

107
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,776
Well, it's not flexed right now.

108
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,951
Mon, you want to come
see a movie with us?

109
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:35,539
Actually, I was going
to do some laundry.

110
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,083
Want to do it with me?

111
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,378
Sure, I'll do it with you.

112
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,507
Okay, great.
Hold on a second.

113
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,010
Here you go.

114
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:53,390
That would really help me out a lot.
Thanks.

115
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,101
You know what?
I don't have enough quarters.

116
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,729
I have quarters!

117
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,777
Hey, any word on the apartment yet?

118
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,614
I called there, and it turns out
Naked Guy is subletting it.

119
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,283
He's already had 100 applicants.

120
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,909
No, I've got the edge.

121
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,913
It's not exactly ethical,
but I sent him a bribe...

122
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,624
...to tip the scales in my direction.

123
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,002
You can see it from the window.

124
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,466
Is it that pinball machine
with the big bow on it?

125
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:32,221
That new mountain bike?

126
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,098
What did you send?

127
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,019
A basket of mini muffins.

128
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,565
There's a whole table of them.
Which one did you send?

129
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,359
The small one.

130
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,490
You actually thought that basket
was going to get you the apartment?

131
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,411
Someone sent us a basket at work, and
people went crazy over those muffins.

132
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,289
It was the best day.

133
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,001
Your work makes me sad.

134
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,254
Oh, man, I want that place so much!

135
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,215
And I was so sure
that was going to work.

136
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:12,177
There's 12 bucks
I'll never see again.

137
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,430
We'd better go if we want
to catch that movie.

138
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,266
Bye.

139
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,854
Bye, Chandler.
I miss you already.

140
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,402
Did you see that? The inappropriate,
and the pinching?

141
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,736
Actually, I did.

142
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:34,033
So do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

143
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,494
Oh, my God!
She knows about us!

144
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,662
Are you serious?

145
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,623
She knows, and she's trying
to freak us out!

146
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,419
That's the only explanation!

147
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:51,842
But what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

148
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,761
She knows!

149
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,689
Phoebe knows about us.

150
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,232
I didn't tell them!

151
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,525
Them?

152
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,194
Who's "them"?

153
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:15,407
Phoebe and Joey.

154
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,910
And Rachel.

155
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,373
I would have told you,
but I promised not to tell.

156
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,457
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,417
But it's over now, right?

158
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:31,631
You can tell them you know they know,
and I can go back to knowing nothing!

159
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,091
Unless...

160
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,845
Not "unless"!
This must end now!

161
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,598
They think they are so slick
messing with us.

162
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:44,519
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

163
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,353
So...

164
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:50,984
The messers become the messees!

165
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,740
Honey, you got to stop
torturing yourself.

166
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,991
Why don't you find another apartment?

167
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,078
I've already looked
at 1000 apartments this month.

168
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,997
None of them even compares
to that one.

169
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,458
You know what?

170
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,836
You should find out his hobbies
and use that to bond with him.

171
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,006
Like if I wanted something from Joey...

172
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:17,970
...I would strike up a conversation
about sandwiches...

173
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,265
...or my underwear.

174
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,435
I'm listening.

175
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,314
That is a great idea!

176
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:33,110
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.

177
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,738
So that gives me back my edge!

178
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,742
Let's see now.
He had the trampoline.

179
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:40,910
He broke that.

180
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,954
- He had gravity boots.
- He broke those too.

181
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,710
So he likes to break stuff.

182
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,631
I've got to go pick up Ben.
But I will figure something out.

183
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,634
Didn't he used to have a cat?

184
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,595
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would bum him out.

185
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:04,224
Poor cat never saw
that big butt coming.

186
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,898
Hold on a second,
she's right here.

187
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,525
It's Chandler.

188
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,612
Hello, you.

189
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:22,242
Phoebe, I've been thinking
about you all day.

190
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:27,831
You know that thing you said before?
I was intrigued.

191
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,207
Really?

192
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,043
Joey won't be here tonight.

193
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:35,130
Why don't you come over?
I'll let you feel my bicep.

194
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,925
Or maybe more.

195
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:43,722
I'll have to get back to you on that.

196
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:48,686
He wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more!

197
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,062
Are you kidding?

198
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:54,358
I cannot believe
he would do that to Mon...

199
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:05,911
Joey? Do they know that we know?

200
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,038
They know you know.

201
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,707
I knew it!

202
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,002
I cannot believe those two!

203
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:18,549
They thought they could mess with us?
Trying to mess with us?

204
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:23,971
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

205
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,139
Joey, you can't say anything.

206
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,727
Couldn't if I wanted to.

207
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:39,986
Good evening, sir. I'm Ross Geller.
I'm one of the applicants.

208
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:45,826
I realize that the competition
is fierce but...

209
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:52,124
I'm sorry, I can't help but notice
that you're naked.

210
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,003
I applaud you.

211
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,131
Man, I wish I was naked.

212
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,926
I mean, this looks so great.

213
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:07,348
That is how God intended it.

214
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,892
Look. They're panicked!

215
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:13,103
They'll totally back down.

216
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,273
If he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.

217
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,108
I'm going to go in.

218
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,319
Be sexy.

219
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,948
Please.

220
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,670
I'd love to come by tonight.

221
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,006
Really?

222
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,926
Absolutely.
Say, around seven?

223
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:53,351
I'm really looking forward to you
and me having sexual intercourse.

224
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,316
Hey, check it out!

225
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,903
Naked Guy's got a naked friend.

226
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:14,373
Oh, my God!
That's our friend!

227
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:18,252
It's Naked Ross!

228
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,133
Showtime!

229
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,926
Rachel, get me perfume.

230
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:30,597
Joey, can you get me
a bottle of wine and glasses?

231
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:41,983
Make her think you want to have
sex with her and it will freak her out.

232
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,528
How far would I have to go with her?

233
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,738
She'll give in way before you do.

234
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:47,865
How do you know?

235
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:52,536
Because you're on my team.
My team always wins.

236
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,038
At this?

237
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,376
Just go get some! Go!

238
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,546
Now, I'm going to try to listen
from right here.

239
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,464
Oh, wait.

240
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:05,966
Good idea.

241
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,970
Don't give away the farm.

242
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,772
Come on in.

243
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,651
I was going to.

244
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,404
I brought some wine.
Would you like some?

245
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,448
Sure.

246
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,457
So here we are.

247
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,750
Nervous?

248
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,044
Me? No. You?

249
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:45,214
I want this to happen.

250
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:48,509
So do I.

251
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,023
I'm going to put on some music.

252
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:07,527
Maybe I'll dance for you.

253
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:28,424
You look good.

254
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,217
Thanks.

255
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,346
You know, when you say
things like that, it makes me...

256
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:39,893
...want to rip that
sweater vest right off.

257
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,188
Why don't we move into the bedroom?

258
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,271
Really?

259
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:47,067
Do you not want to?

260
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:50,362
First I want to take off
all my clothes...

261
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,616
...and have you rub lotion on me.

262
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:58,204
That would be nice.

263
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll go get the lotion.

264
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,505
It's way out of hand.
She wants me to put lotion on her!

265
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,424
- She's bluffing!
- She's not backing down.

266
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,887
She went like this...

267
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:20,016
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

268
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,353
Aren't you guys done yet?

269
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,440
I want to sit in my chair!

270
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,737
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner
it's over and out in the open.

271
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:34,406
I like that.

272
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:39,995
Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

273
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,379
You didn't rip off any buttons.

274
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:51,715
It's not my first time.

275
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,427
Go back there and seduce her
till she cracks!

276
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,721
Give me a second.

277
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:02,434
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course!

278
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,231
You're going?

279
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:12,027
Not without you, lover.

280
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:20,285
So, this is my bra.

281
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:26,250
It's very, very nice.

282
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,086
Well, come here.

283
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:33,590
I'm very happy we're going
to have all the sex.

284
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:38,637
You should be.
I'm very bendy.

285
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,142
I'll kiss you now.

286
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:46,770
Not if I kiss you first.

287
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,042
I guess there's nothing
left for us to do but kiss.

288
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,962
Here it comes.

289
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,298
Our first kiss.

290
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,185
You win!

291
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:27,269
I can't have sex with you!

292
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,563
- And why not?
- I'm in love with Monica!

293
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,733
You're what?

294
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,651
Love her!

295
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:36,112
I love her!

296
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:40,448
I love her!

297
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,830
I love you, Monica.

298
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,624
I love you too, Chandler.

299
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:58,676
I thought you were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love!

300
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,930
Dude!

301
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,226
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.

302
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,895
May I say your breasts
are still showing?

303
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,314
God.

304
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,107
All right!
So that's it?

305
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,068
It's over.
Everybody knows!

306
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,820
Actually, Ross doesn't.

307
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,074
We'd appreciate it
if no one told him yet.

308
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,457
A new place for a new Ross.

309
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:34,461
I'll have you and the guys from work
over, once it's furnished.

310
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,838
It's nice to see you
back on your feet.

311
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:41,051
I am that, and the whole rage thing
is definitely behind me.

312
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,387
I wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our museum team?

313
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,014
That would be great.

314
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:51,145
I am totally ready
to come back to work.

315
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,485
What are you doing?

316
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:03,240
Get off my sister!
