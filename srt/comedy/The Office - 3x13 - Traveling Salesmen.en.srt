00:00:00,615 --> 00:00:02,382
Jim, could you 
come in here, please?

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,030
Hi, Jim.

3
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,008
Hello.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,862
<font color=lightblue>I am Harvey, a computer. 
Jim sucks.

5
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:19,434
- Sorry! 
- Zing!

6
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:23,996
That's so rude. 
I'm sorry, I can't control him.

7
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:25,064
Yeah, you can.

8
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:26,154
You know what? Get Pam.

9
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,182
For this?

10
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:28,096
Pam!

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,339
<font color=lightblue>Pam, you look very hot today.

12
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:37,004
Pam, it's Harvey.

13
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,302
This is Michael's new friend.

14
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:39,063
Great.

15
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:40,469
<font color=lightblue>Me so horny.

16
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,209
<font color=lightblue>Me love you long tim.

17
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:45,014
That is gross!

18
00:00:45,014 --> 00:00:46,343
<font color=lightblue>Who's Long Tim?

19
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,928
<font color=lightblue>Long time. 
Me lobe you long time.

20
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,060
Well, you should bring 
Long Tim in one day.

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,619
No

22
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:57,149
I'd love to meet Long Tim. 
Yeah, right?

23
00:00:58,144 --> 00:00:59,987
<font color=lightblue>You ruined a funny joke.

24
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:01,708
<font color=lightblue>Get out of my offfive.

25
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:05,387
Okay, bye Harvey.

- Angela
- What?

30
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:43,350
There was a voicemail 
that corporate left last night.

31
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,079
They did not get our tax forms.

32
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,361
<i>Did you send them?

33
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:49,875
They arrived this morning.

34
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:51,403
Are you sure?

35
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,234
It is a big deal...

36
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:54,379
Is it a big deal?

37
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,523
Is it, Kevin?

38
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:59,419
Do you really not know?

39
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,142
Because it is a big deal.

40
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:05,566
Five of us transferred 
from Stamford.

41
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,830
There's two of us left.

42
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,896
Me, and Karen.

43
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,700
It's like we're touring 
Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory

44
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,052
and dropping off one by one.

45
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:16,719
Well, guess what.

46
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,060
I¡®m not falling in a chocolate river.

47
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:27,749
Everything okay?

48
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:28,926
It's fine.

49
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:30,724
You're in the clear.

50
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:31,885
Thank you.

51
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,562
I don't- I don't want those.

52
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:42,541
Dwight,

53
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:44,702
Care to join us finally.

54
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:47,158
Thank you.

55
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:49,039
Hey, Dwight, 
pass the tardy sauce.

56
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,379
Get it, Michael?

57
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,053
Okay, here is the dream team.

58
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:56,004
My sales dream team.

59
00:02:56,374 --> 00:02:58,412
Today we're going to 
team up our sales calls.

60
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,542
<i>Andy, since it was your idea,

61
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:01,684
<i>you get to pick first.

62
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:06,469
Hmm- well- let me think 
about this for a minute.

63
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:07,572
Oh, I don't know.

64
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,000
Michael Scott.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,535
PhD. Doctor of sales.

66
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:14,152
Well, I appreciate that.

67
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,732
That's very gracious of you.

68
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:18,194
Well, it's very gracious 
of you to accept.

69
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:19,292
Thank you, though.

70
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:23,226
Okay, now going by seniority,

71
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,199
Phyllis, our resident senior.

72
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,458
We're the same age.

73
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:30,591
And, I'll pick Karen.

74
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:32,751
Oh- Ah- thanks.

75
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:34,943
Good. Next up,

76
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:37,409
The Super Fly himself, Stanley.

77
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:38,373
Pass.

78
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:38,766
You can't pass,

79
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:40,158
You gotta pick somebody.

80
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:46,216
I'll take the kid.

81
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,273
<i>I'm very flattered.

82
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:51,409
I was his second choice, after "pass".

83
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:54,260
So that just leaves 
Dwight and Jim.

84
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,115
Okay, wait. 
Does anyone wanna trade?

85
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:57,507
Yeah, I'll trade.

86
00:03:58,883 --> 00:04:00,909
Dwight and I used to go 
sales calls all the times.

87
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,936
In fact, I have a picture 
to remember that time.

88
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:06,261
Oh, young Jim.

89
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:08,181
I was just... so much...

90
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,044
I need to warn you about,

91
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,281
and yet,

92
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:12,968
tragically,

93
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,507
I cannot.

94
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:17,307
Sebring, by Chrysler.

95
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:20,169
A heck of a motor carriage.

96
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:22,682
Dwight, here you go!

97
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:25,669
You want shirts on hangers?

98
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:26,447
What do you use...

99
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:27,605
Does he do your laundry?

100
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,098
Long story.

101
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:31,775
Alright everybody, circle up.

102
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,371
Here we go!

103
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,247
You know what this is?

104
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,072
This is the Amazing Race.

105
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,340
And, you guys are 
the retired marines.

106
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,209
And, you guys are 
the mother and daughter.

107
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:43,721
And, you guys are 
the gay couple.

108
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:46,582
And, we are 
the fire fighter heroes.

109
00:04:46,582 --> 00:04:47,412
Are you ready to go?

110
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,087
Wait, Amazing Race, 
like the biggest sales win?

111
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:52,793
No, we're just gonna rush out,

112
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,835
do the sales things, 
and come back.

113
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,620
Is there a prize?

114
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,905
Just bragging rights.

115
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:57,322
Then, how is this 
amazing race?

116
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,202
It's... just...

117
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:02,051
It's Amazing Race, 
Phyllis, okay?

118
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,430
We are teams of two, 
and we are on a mission.

119
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,670
Alright, so on your market, 
set go!

120
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,211
- Let's do it!
- Come on!

121
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:15,310
Michael

122
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:20,347
- Vamanos!
- Bueno!

123
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,031
Do you have a pole?

124
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,770
Let's go get a broom.

125
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,041
Seriously, 
you're gonna sit in the back?

126
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:30,004
Uh, yeah. 
It's the safest part of a car.

127
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,091
In the event of a crash,

128
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,266
the driver always protects 
his side first.

129
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:39,222
Here we go!

130
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:42,063
In order to take down Dwight,

131
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:43,801
I have to chip away at his ally:

132
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,795
In this case, it's Michael.

133
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:46,204
Here's the good news.

134
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:48,399
every success I've ever had,

135
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,257
at my job or with "the lady-folk,"

136
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:55,633
Has come from my ability 
to slowly, and painfully,

137
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,853
wear someone down.

138
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:00,542
What's the deal with Dwight 
doing your laundry?

139
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:04,175
That's a long story.

140
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:06,877
Couple months ago,

141
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:10,674
Dwight tried to 
go my behind back with Jan,

142
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:11,868
And, get my job.

143
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:15,363
And, now I am having him 
do my laundry as a punishment.

144
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:18,346
Wow, that is a long story,

145
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:20,594
but quite well told, Michael.

146
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:22,515
I find it very interesting.

147
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,873
Especially the part about 
Dwight going behind your back

148
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:28,016
and basically being 
like a terrible person.

149
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:32,788
You know if you want 
you laundry done right,

150
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:35,164
I used to work at Abercrombie,

151
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,736
So... pretty good folder.

152
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,594
Why are we turning in here?

153
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:42,755
This is beauty salon.

154
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,586
Hey, do you mind 
if I take the lead on this one?

155
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:49,657
And then, you can critic me after?

156
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:50,922
You want the lead?

157
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:52,725
Yeah, if you don't mind.

158
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:53,392
Mind?

159
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:55,430
Nothing would delight me more!

160
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:03,897
Hey, Pam.

161
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:06,469
Would you like to go with me
and grab a coffee?

162
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,414
Really?

163
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:09,101
Yeah.

164
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,742
I thought you could use 
some fresh air.

165
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:12,230
It might be fun.

166
00:07:12,413 --> 00:07:14,274
Okay, sure.

167
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:15,204
Okay.

168
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:23,869
Leave the keys.

169
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:25,463
You still do that thing?

170
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:26,851
Leave the keys.

171
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:50,895
I think that you have the symbol 
of the amazing team in Scranton.

172
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:52,574
It's really a pleasure 
to be the part of it.

173
00:07:52,574 --> 00:07:55,042
It's like everyone has 
their own special skills,

174
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:57,197
You know, 
just like the Super friends.

175
00:07:58,268 --> 00:07:59,421
Except for Dwight.

176
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,982
He is kind more of a super dud.

177
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:03,639
I mean, 
he'd be a super friend,

178
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,967
if there was a Super Friends

179
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,485
who has super power 
was always being late.

180
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:09,667
You know.

181
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:12,578
Hawkman.

182
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:17,276
My plan is talking 
longer than I thought.

183
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,158
But, I don't give up easily.

184
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:23,664
I have walked 
two marathons, so...

185
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,519
Let's go.

186
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,241
The men's room was disgusting.

187
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:37,662
Thank you, sir.

188
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:38,318
No thank you.

189
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,909
I've never let 
anyone walk behind me.

190
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,770
7 out of 10 attacks are 
from the rear.

191
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,727
Okay, but that still leaves 
a 30 percent chance

192
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:44,919
that I'll attack you 
from the front.

193
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,995
Uh, yeah, 
but it will be easier to stop.

194
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:48,488
I can always block the blow.

195
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:49,607
Or I can counter it with?

196
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,330
Hey, did you catch that 
upon lake Wallenpaupack?

197
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,154
Yeah

198
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:05,160
You know I used to go up there 
all the time with my step dad,

199
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,958
And I never caught 
anything like that big.

200
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:11,276
I caught an 80-pound 
shark off Montauk.

201
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:12,530
It's in Hamtons.

202
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:15,284
My dad's got a 42-foot Bayliner.

203
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:18,504
Sniped it with a rifle 
from the crow's nest.

204
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,452
I also shot a dear once.

205
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:23,168
You know what, 
let's get it right down to it.

206
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:24,801
Dunder-Mifflin,

207
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,288
may be just two rooms 
and a warehouse

208
00:09:27,288 --> 00:09:28,816
But what we lack in flash,

209
00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:32,785
we will make up for- 
with hard work, and decency.

210
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:35,562
Okay, this is the classic undersell.

211
00:09:35,562 --> 00:09:39,977
Because, you should know 
we don't work out of a log cabin.

212
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:42,045
We trade on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

213
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,346
Ever heard of it?

214
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:44,459
It's in New York.

215
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,095
Um- I have to say 
I'm little aware of

216
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:48,567
get involve with 
a big company.

217
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,419
We've had 
some problems in the past.

218
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:53,012
And, I think 
what Andy is trying to express

219
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:56,772
is that while we have 
the resources of a large company,

220
00:09:56,772 --> 00:10:00,202
We will give you the care 
and attention of small company.

221
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:03,608
- That is like poetry
- No

222
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:06,910
- I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
- Stop it, stop it.

223
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:14,657
Oh man, talk about 
your classic lame-dash-o.

224
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,428
Do we even want that guy 
buying our paper?

225
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:19,303
Yes.

226
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:22,377
Angela, you seem so happy.

227
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:26,472
I bet you wish you were like this 
all the time.

228
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:28,777
This friend of mine?

229
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,973
let's call her, Noelle.

230
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:34,716
She missed this deadline

231
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:37,231
turning something in to 
corporate in New York.

232
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:39,773
But then this gallant gentleman?

233
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:41,683
We'll call him Kurt.

234
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:43,215
he drove all the way 
to New York

235
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:44,644
and handed it in for her!

236
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,604
Because? I don't know?

237
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:49,578
I guess he just really likes her a lot.

238
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,825
Well, that's great.

239
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:54,161
Yes, it is.

240
00:10:58,698 --> 00:10:59,920
Hello!

241
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:03,419
I'm- I'm so sorry, man.

242
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:06,863
I really screwed that up.

243
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:08,417
- Really- 
- No, don't worry about it.

244
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,025
I really Schruted it.

245
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,267
What?

246
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,049
Schruted it.

247
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,185
This is the thing that people say 
in your office all the time.

248
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:20,175
Like when you screw something up 
in a really irreversible way,

249
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:21,392
You Schruted it.

250
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,751
I don't know where the word 
comes from, though.

251
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:26,403
I think it comes from 
Dwight Schrute.

252
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:27,709
I don't know.

253
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,355
Who knows 
how words are formed?

254
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:35,191
- That's a big order. Thanks Kenny. 
- Thank you.

255
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,262
Hey, how's Annie.

256
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,413
Oh, she's great.

257
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:39,995
This is us last year in Bermuda.

258
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:44,893
Lovely place.

259
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:46,288
You've ever been Bermuda?

260
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:48,227
Stanley hudson!

261
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,802
Hi Julius, how's going?

262
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:51,820
Great, great, great.

263
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,151
Stanley, so good to see you, too.

264
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,916
I'd like you fellows 
to meet Ryan Howard.

265
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,677
Hi

266
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:59,796
I'm gonna let Ryan 
do a little pitch for you,

267
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,237
While I do 
my crossword puzzles.

268
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,019
Ryan.

269
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:07,492
Um...

270
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:14,974
Hi

271
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:17,267
Hello, Ryan. 
What do you have for us?

272
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:24,310
We can offer our biggest discounts on 
30% recycled, and ultra premium laser.

273
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,817
Okay, Okay.

274
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:26,738
Can I use your phone?

275
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:28,512
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

276
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:31,131
Let me talk to you about 
few other things that we can offer.

277
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:33,260
Mainly, we know 
the tax season is coming up,

278
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,378
So, by April first we can have you

279
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,625
- fully stocked.
- One

280
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,355
Discount prices on ink cartridges.

281
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,344
Three

282
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:40,271
- And, also any forms you're gonna need,
- Seven

283
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:41,292
We can custom make'em.

284
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:48,098
And you just said,

285
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:50,328
"Hi. Hi. Hi."

286
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,928
You sounded like

287
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:56,944
my niece.

288
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,176
And she's six months old!

289
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,039
I appreciate 
what you guy's were saying,

290
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,013
But it makes more physical sense 
to go one of the big guys.

291
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:07,026
Sure That's true

292
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:08,352
We can't compete with their prices.

293
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:09,124
But, let me ask you something.

294
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:11,135
How importantly 
do you consider customer service?

295
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,008
Very.

296
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:12,850
<font color=lightblue>Please keep holding.

297
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,774
<font color=lightblue>Your call is very important to us.

298
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:17,710
That's one of the big guys.

299
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:19,491
But, on hold this whole time.

300
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:21,633
And, this is Dunder-Mifflin.

301
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:24,926
<font color=lightblue>Dunder Mifflin customer service, 
this is Kelly.

302
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:26,485
Hi Kelly, this is Jim.

303
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:27,900
<font color=lightblue>Oh my god, Jim, how are you?

304
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,812
<font color=lightblue>I wanted to tell you...

305
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:30,612
Here's my card.

306
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:31,921
It's got my cell number,

307
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,110
my pager number, my home number,

308
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,184
and my other pager number.

309
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,367
I never take vacations,

310
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,028
I never get sick,

311
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,853
and I don't celebrate 
any major holidays.

312
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:38,765
Alright.

313
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:39,977
I get it.

314
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:40,797
We got our deal.

315
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:43,599
Thanks, that was fun.

316
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,186
Yeah, I really enjoy 
spending time with you.

317
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:47,430
You're a very nice person.

318
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:48,875
Thank you.

319
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,291
And I'm so glad you're with Jim.

320
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,956
He was hung up on Pam 
for such a long time...

321
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:56,936
I didn't think he'd ever get over her.

322
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,435
That's nice.

323
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:06,080
You can pay me back later 
for the makeover.

324
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:17,902
<i>- Hey boss, got a minute? 
- Yes, Andy

325
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:20,420
<i>I forget why did Dwight say 
he was late for this morning.

326
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,284
<i>He didn't say.

327
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:21,994
<i>That's weird.

328
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,241
<i>Because, I was just passing the desk,

329
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:25,423
<i>and I saw this.

330
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:28,541
<i>Which is a tool-booth receipt 
from New York city.

331
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,349
Stamped early this morning.

332
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:36,693
Why would Dwight go New York 
without telling anyone?

333
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:39,044
You think he went to see Jan?

334
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,806
That's not like him.

335
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:42,098
Isn't?

336
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:45,920
Someone told me 
a story about this,

337
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:48,231
with, like laundry and betrayal.

338
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:52,121
Did you betray Dwight

339
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:53,902
and try to steal 
his job or something?

340
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:54,488
No.

341
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:57,298
you are remembering it wrong.

342
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,827
Dwight betrayed me once before.

343
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:03,083
So, this is his strike two.

344
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,089
You know what they say?

345
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:06,720
Fool me once,

346
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:08,114
strike one.

347
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:10,299
But fool me twice...

348
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,282
strike three.

349
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:18,450
I like Karen.

350
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,891
She's pretty.

351
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:21,503
Appears intelligent.

352
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,514
Well, I like pretty women

353
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:27,204
who have the appearance 
of intelligence.

354
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:31,135
My girlfriend is also 
beautiful and smart.

355
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:32,464
She could be a model.

356
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,784
Or a college professor.

357
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:36,837
Which is intimidating 
to a lot of guys.

358
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:40,141
We should go on a double date.

359
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,272
No thank you.

360
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:46,110
Dwight's name is 
on the security sigh sheet.

361
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,064
But, I don't know 
who he met with.

362
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,803
And where it asks you to 
state your business,

363
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:53,139
he wrote, "Beeswax Not Yours, Inc."

364
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:54,470
I know it.

365
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:01,133
Ooooh, doggy.

366
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,942
Hey, you wanna grab a coffee?

367
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:05,251
Sure

368
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:06,963
Look at you.

369
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:14,976
Hey, we made the sale!

370
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:16,082
Where were you this morning?

371
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:18,124
I overslept.

372
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:19,571
Damn rooster didn't crow.

373
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:22,080
Why do you lie, liar?

374
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,786
I'm not a liar.

375
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:24,244
You are lying right now.

376
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:25,823
Sure seems like he's lying.

377
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:26,886
Stay out of this, you...

378
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,320
I know that you went to 
corporate this morning.

379
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,712
And, I know 
that you lied about it.

380
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:34,554
And, given our history,

381
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:37,169
I need you to tell me, 
right now.

382
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,637
Exactly what you were doing 
this morning.

383
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,198
Michael, I cannot tell you 
what I was doing there.

384
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:43,953
But, you have to trust me.

385
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:47,467
I would never do anything 
to hurt you or this company.

386
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:48,576
Okay, you know what?

387
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:51,411
I want you to think about 
your future at this company.

388
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,453
I want you to think about it 
long and hard.

389
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:54,705
That's what she said.

390
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:56,739
Don't you dare.

391
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:01,411
I want to know 
what you were doing this morning

392
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:02,524
by the end of the day.

393
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,288
It's gonna be okay.

394
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,863
How is it going to be okay, Dwight?

395
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:14,637
Everyone will know 
our business.

396
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,693
That's not the worst 
thing in the world.

397
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,360
I'll just stand up 
in front of the office

398
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,290
and reveal our true love.

399
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:23,875
It won't be that bad.

400
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,248
Look at Kelly and Ryan.

401
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,324
I hate those two people

402
00:17:27,324 --> 00:17:29,414
more than anything 
in the entire world.

403
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:32,780
Well, I don't have a lot of choices.

404
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:36,063
So, let me ask you a question.

405
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:36,703
Okay.

406
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:39,574
Did you ever have 
a thing for Pam?

407
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:41,093
Pam?

408
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:43,659
Did I ever have 
a thing for her?

409
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:44,536
No...

410
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:47,506
Why, did she say something?

411
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:51,314
I moved here 
from Connecticut...

412
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:52,056
Yeah?

413
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:55,298
okay, here's the...

414
00:17:56,987 --> 00:18:00,760
I... had a crush on her

415
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:02,086
before I left,

416
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:03,949
and I told her about it,

417
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,821
and she didn't feel 
the same way.

418
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:08,238
So it didn't amount to anything,

419
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:09,612
and I left.

420
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:15,205
I'm really glad you're here.

421
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,336
Okay?

422
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:18,821
Okay.

423
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:27,382
May I have your attention, please?

424
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,098
It will only take 
a moment of your time.

425
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:34,527
Although, I've loved this company

426
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,388
more than almost anything 
in the world,

427
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,937
I decided to step down from my post

428
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:40,965
and spend more time with my family.

429
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:42,660
<i>I do not fear the unknown.

430
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:45,057
<i>I will meet my new challenges head on,

431
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,526
and I will succeed,

432
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,391
<i>and I will laugh in the faces 
of those who doubt me.

433
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:52,066
It's been a pleasure 
working with some of you,

434
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,580
and I will not forget 
those of you soon.

435
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:55,993
<i>But remember...

436
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:57,991
while today it is me,

437
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,109
we all shall fall.

438
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:06,602
In other words, I'm quitting.

439
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:12,731
Oompa loompa, doompadee dossum,

440
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:14,458
Dwight is now gone,

441
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,333
which is totally awesome.

442
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,739
Why was he gone,

443
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:20,773
he was such a nice guy.

444
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:22,521
No, he was not,

445
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:24,748
he was a total douche.

446
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,612
Doompadee doom.

447
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:30,664
I would like to give 
the rest of my belongings

448
00:19:32,753 --> 00:19:34,250
... to Michael Scott.

449
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:36,589
Just a second.

450
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,135
Except this.

451
00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:40,707
- Good luck 
- ... and this.

452
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,725
Dwight will be missed.

453
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:49,833
Not by me ... so much,

454
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,591
but he will be missed.

455
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:53,811
Dwight?

456
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:55,813
From sales?

457
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,943
Was one of the most honorable 
and efficient employees

458
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:00,967
this company has ever had.

459
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:03,964
One of my life goals 
was to die right here,

460
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:05,254
in my desk chair.

461
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:07,249
And today,

462
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:10,042
that dream was shattered.

463
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,661
What happened on your sales call?

464
00:20:34,995 --> 00:20:37,542
Am I happy about 
the way things turned out?

465
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,117
Well, happy's such an ugly word.

466
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,010
But- um-

467
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:45,484
I saw it needed to be done,

468
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:46,686
and I did it.

469
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:48,358
And, now I'm thrilled.

470
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:50,715
So, it's pretty...

471
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:52,076
hello?

472
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:54,563
Pretty good.

473
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:58,563
