1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:05,839
Phoebe. Look at that guy
by the window. Wow!

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,926
He's awfully short.
And I think he's talking to himself.

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:14,098
And to be completely honest,
he's not that good in bed.

4
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:18,894
What is wrong with me lately?
It's like, every guy I see.

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,104
That guy, for example.

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,357
That's not someone
I would be attracted to.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:31,448
But right now, all I want to do is rip
off his sweatpants and fanny pack.

8
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:35,870
Wait! This is about the fourth month
of your pregnancy.

9
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,081
This is normal.
Your hormones start going crazy.

10
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:43,544
- Really? This has happened to you?
- Absolutely!

11
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,047
And I was carrying triplets.

12
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:50,634
So in medical terms,
I was thrice as randy.

13
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,553
This explains so much!

14
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:58,600
Last weekend, I went from store
to store, sitting on Santas' laps.

15
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:06,024
Yeah, I remember trying to steal a
cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield.

16
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:12,656
I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow. Maybe
she can give me a pill or something.

17
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,451
Yeah, that's what you need.
A good pill.

18
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,121

21
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,245
- I got our pictures developed.
- Great.

22
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,206
Want to see pictures of us skating?

23
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:10,464
Ordinarily, I would love to,
but I am just swamped right now.

24
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,763
Where are the ones
that pretzel vendor took of us?

25
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,474
Oh, yeah.
Probably at the end.

26
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,895
Oh, my God! All he took were pictures
of my breasts.

27
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,772
I'm missing picture time!

28
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,613
You know, she has a face, Ross.

29
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:40,286
- Okay, here's a good one of us.
- That is a good one!

30
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,622
It looks like a holiday card.
With the tree...

31
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,208
...and the skaters and the snow.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,378
I want to send out cards,
but I never do.

33
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,590
Do you want
to send this one out together?

34
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,222
Together? Like, to people?

35
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,893
Yeah. "Happy Holidays, from Mona
and Ross. " lt'll be cute, okay?

36
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,020
Okay.

37
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,023
I gotta go to work. Call me later?

38
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,400
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

39
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,948
Congratulations! You just got married!

40
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,868
Can you believe that?

41
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,954
What's the big deal
about a holiday card?

42
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,624
Married couples and families
send out cards.

43
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:32,838
People who just started dating
don't send out cards. Is she crazy?

44
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,008
That's your wife you're talking about!

45
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,928
Bing!
And the Bingette!

46
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,265
- You remember my boss, Doug.
- Yes. Hi.

47
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,978
Good news! The divorce is final.
I signed the papers this a.m.

48
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,564
You and Kara divorced?
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,943
Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out
of that bear trap.

50
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,907
- Congratulations to you guys.
- No leg-chewing for us.

51
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,701
Well, give it time.

52
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,039
The divorce, the marriage,
we got a lot to celebrate.

53
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,000
We should all go out
to dinner tomorrow.

54
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,878
I can't think
of anything we're doing.

55
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,964
Why can't I think of anything?

56
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,759
Tomorrow.
I'll be out of court by 6.

57
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:24,223
They keep throwing sexual harassment
cases at me, and I knock them out!

58
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,600
Okay, see you tomorrow.

59
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,356
We're not seeing him tomorrow. I can't
spend another evening with that man.

60
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,275
Remember how he behaved
at our wedding?

61
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,695
Because he wasn't invited.

62
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,489
He misbehaved
at our engagement party.

63
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:46,078
Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through
an ice sculpture, doesn't it?

64
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,920
Hi! I went by the photo shop.
Take a look.

65
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,965
Here is a mockup of our card.
What do you think?

66
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,011
Looks great.

67
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,932
Do you think it should say,
"Love, Ross and Mona"?

68
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:11,812
Well, we haven't said that
to each other yet...

69
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,232
...but I guess it's okay
to say it to others.

70
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:20,029
- How many did you want? I'll get 100.
- A hundred?

71
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,075
Well, I guess I'll take...

72
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,327
Mona?

73
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:33,459
I'm not sure
about the whole card thing.

74
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,169
Really? Why not?

75
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,882
Sending out a holiday card together?

76
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:44,804
I just don't know
if we're really quite there yet.

77
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,932
I didn't think of it that way.
You're right.

78
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,689
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

79
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,774
Where are we?

80
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:04,865
You know, where are we?
Where is this relationship going?

81
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:14,667
I love spending time with you.
I just hope we're moving forward.

82
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:18,212
We should talk about that,
don't you think?

83
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,013
Let's do the card!

84
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:33,394
- What?
- The card! I think we're there!

85
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:37,231
Okay. But I still think
we should have this talk.

86
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,274
Really?

87
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,527
Even with the card?

88
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:53,080
Dr. Long can't be here today,
so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.

89
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,625
Okay.
Can I ask you a question?

90
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:01,422
Was it me, or was the guy
who took my blood sample really cute?

91
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:06,593
You know who I'm talking about?
Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?

92
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:12,641
- Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.
- Yes, you are.

93
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,519
So, how's it going?

94
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,356
Really, really good.
But enough about me! Come on.

95
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,026
Where are you from?
What do you do?

96
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,530
- I'm a doctor.
- Right. I meant...

97
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,783
...in your spare time.
Do you cook? Ski?

98
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,245
Or hang out with your wife,
or girlfriend?

99
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,748
I have no wife or girlfriend,
but I do ski.

100
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:41,212
I love to ski!
How amazing is this?

101
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:46,425
- Are you experiencing any discomfort?
- No, I'm very comfortable.

102
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,179
- Any painful gas?
- No!

103
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,725
Dr. Schiff!
What kind of question is that?

104
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,437
Would you like
to lie down on the table?

105
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,317
Would you like me
to lie down on the table?

106
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:08,114
- Is there something going on here?
- Do you feel it too?

107
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:15,245
- Hi.
- How did your doctor's appointment go?

108
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,583
Let's see,
they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.

109
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,004
In the middle of the exam,
I put my pinkie in his dimple.

110
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,508
- Oh, my God!
- Why did you do that?

111
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:31,637
Remember my problem during
my fourth month of pregnancy?

112
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,640
Oh, yeah!
The Evander Holyfield phase.

113
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:39,061
Man! You were so hard up,
you practically came on to me.

114
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,522
You wish.

115
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,941
I could have had you
if I wanted you.

116
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,820
Oh, yeah? Come and get it.

117
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,072
Okay, even this is turning me on.

118
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:57,371
Ross! How's it going
with you and Mona?

119
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,457
Are you guys still together?

120
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:05,504
Yeah, we're moving forward.
You'll be getting our card.

121
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,798
You're doing a holiday card?

122
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:13,554
Not just a card. She wants to talk
about where the relationship is going.

123
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,931
Women!

124
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:20,185
I know! Why do you guys need
to have this conversation?

125
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,064
No man would ask a woman,
"So where is this going?"

126
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,024
Ross, you asked me that.

127
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:31,363
You were a closed book, okay?
I'm not a mind reader!

128
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:36,743
Besides, I hate those conversations.
I'm horrible at them. Really.

129
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,704
Maybe I need some kind of a gesture...

130
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,459
...that says we're moving forward
without talking.

131
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,170
Like asking her
to move in with you?

132
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,338
Smaller than that.

133
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,134
- Making her a mix tape?
- Bigger than that.

134
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:57,389
- Give her a key to your apartment.
- We were closer with the mix tape.

135
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,058
Have you said, "I love you"?

136
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,270
I don't think I'm quite there yet.

137
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:07,024
But I could say,
"I love spending time with you."

138
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,818
- We hate that.
- It's a slap in the face.

139
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:14,948
Forget it. You know what?
I'll just have the conversation.

140
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,579
I'll just say I like things the way
they are, and hope for the best.

141
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,664
What do you think, Rach?

142
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,168
I think if it was
a little colder in here...

143
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:30,130
...I could see your nipples
through that sweater.

144
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,054
Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.

145
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,848
We can't do it. Monica has to work.

146
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,684
My ex-wife didn't work.

147
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,396
Unless you call turning
into her mother "work."

148
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,067
Fine. Tomorrow night then.

149
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:54,029
- Tomorrow's no good for her, either.
- Why not?

150
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,283
It's the semifinals...

151
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,787
...of her bocce ball tournament.

152
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:08,919
What's going on, Bing? Does your wife
have a problem with me or something?

153
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,755
Well, now you're just talking crazy.

154
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,758
Then why can't we all go out together?

155
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,137
Because we split up.

156
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,014
Monica and I split up.

157
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,767
Hold me.

158
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:28,772
Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say
I'm altogether surprised.

159
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:34,194
I saw the way she looked at you,
and there was no love there.

160
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,199
And the way she looked at me,
pure lust.

161
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,371
What would really help me through
this tough time is choking someone.

162
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,917
Bing, my boy,
we're gonna get you over this.

163
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,795
Here's the plan:
We're going to a strip club!

164
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,006
Oh, no!
Monica would freak.

165
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:58,552
But to hell with that bitch!

166
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,557
Here we go.

167
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:10,731
Mona, it's time we had a conversation
about where things are with us.

168
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,610
Yeah, I think I suggested that.

169
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,446
We are so...

170
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:28,374
Well, I really like you.
And I love hanging out with you.

171
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:33,378
And I'm having a lot of fun.

172
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,009
Okay.

173
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:44,014
There's no point in spending time
with someone if it's just fun.

174
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:48,435
It's gotta be going somewhere, right?

175
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,730
So where is it going?

176
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:01,157
That's the real question.

177
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,954
And the answer is...

178
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:10,708
...it's going somewhere...

179
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,210
...fun.

180
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:19,508
I know what you're thinking.
Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.

181
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,220
But you're not getting any younger.

182
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,139
No! I mean, not you.
Not you.

183
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,268
You are getting younger!

184
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,524
You're getting younger by the second.
What's your secret?

185
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:43,866
- I'm sorry, so where are we?
- Well, to sum up...

186
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:52,041
...we're having fun.
You look young.

187
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,714
- Okay...
- But that's not enough.

188
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,886
So...

189
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,601
...here's a key to my apartment.

190
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,812
- Really?
- Really.

191
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,066
You don't think this is too fast?

192
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,575
You gave her a key
to your apartment?

193
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:31,454
Not just a key.
I gave her the only key!

194
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:37,086
I am now a homeless person
in a very serious relationship!

195
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:44,634
- Ross, how did the conversation go?
- Great. I live on the street.

196
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,262
Where?

197
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,599
- Hi.
- Okay, Monica, Rachel...

198
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:54,227
...this is my friend Roger.
- Hi, Roger.

199
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,773
I'll get us some drinks.
Could you help me?

200
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,859
Yeah, okay.

201
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,534
He's here to have sex with you.

202
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,539
- What?
- You're welcome.

203
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,294
- Phoebe, no!
- It's okay. He's a virgin.

204
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:28,762
Rachel, I was talking to this guy.
I think he'll have sex with you.

205
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,515
Let's leave them alone.

206
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:37,438
No! I don't care what my hormones are
doing! I won't do it with some guy!

207
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:42,985
Fine! Then you tell Roger, because
he was really looking forward to this!

208
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,963
Bing! Look at those twin sisters
dancing together.

209
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:07,134
Let me buy you a lap dance
with those girls.

210
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:12,180
That's all right, sir.
And that's just one girl.

211
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,934
- Bing, what's this?
- It's a hand.

212
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,437
You use it as a drink holder.

213
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:23,776
It's a wedding ring. Get rid of it.
We'll throw it in the East River!

214
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,402
- No!
- Yes!

215
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:31,741
I did it, and I felt a lot better! You
might even hit a seagull in the head.

216
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:36,497
Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch
of extra keys.

217
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:40,960
Apparently, I give them away
for no reason at all.

218
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,923
Ross, what's going on?
You're changing the lock?

219
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,383
No.

220
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,634
That guy is.

221
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:55,140
You give me a key to your apartment,
and then you change the lock?

222
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,018
Good luck, buddy.

223
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:06,360
I thought we were moving forward. Now
you're sending me these mixed signals.

224
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,488
What are you trying to tell me?

225
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,241
I'm trying to tell you...

226
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,870
...I made you a mix tape.

227
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,249
- What?
- I love you.

228
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,508
And I love spending time with you.

229
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:40,144
- Hi, honey, I'm home.
- From the tequila factory?

230
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:45,983
To avoid going to dinner with Doug,
I told him you and I split up.

231
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,153
So he took me
to these sleazy strip clubs.

232
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:54,157
When I wouldn't give him my wedding
ring, he threw a can at a bird.

233
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:58,579
Come here.
I can breathe through my mouth.

234
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,832
- Sweetie.
- You know what the worst part was?

235
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:05,002
I saw what my life would be
without you.

236
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:09,048
It was like "It's a Wonderful Life"
with lap dances.

237
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,969
Please promise
that you'll never leave me...

238
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:18,932
...that we'll grow old together,
and be with each other always.

239
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,851
I promise.

240
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,648
How about we send out
a holiday card together this year?

241
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,568
I don't know if we're there yet.

242
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,658
I'd like to order a pizza.
Can I ask you a question?

243
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:42,373
Is the cute blond guy delivering
tonight? Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."

244
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,167
- I'll call you back.
- Who was that?

245
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:49,630
- It's just the pizza place.
- You hung up on the pizza place?

246
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,800
I don't hang up on your friends.

247
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,512
- Sorry, I'm just having a rough day.
- What's wrong?

248
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,890
- You don't want to hear about it.
- Then why did I ask?

249
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:06,063
Okay, this is embarrassing. Lately,
with this whole pregnancy thing...

250
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,817
...I'm just finding myself...

251
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,944
How do I put this?

252
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,322
Erotically charged.

253
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:20,202
Is that college talk for "horny"?

254
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:26,083
Yeah. I have all of these feelings,
and I don't know what to do.

255
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:30,462
I can't date a normal person.
I don't need a relationship.

256
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:34,549
All I really want is one great night!
Just sex.

257
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,386
No strings attached.
No relationship.

258
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:42,183
With someone I feel comfortable with,
and who knows what to do.

259
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:48,814
For just one great night.
I mean, is that really so hard...

260
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,692
...to find?

261
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,532
So how was your day?

262
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:02,995
Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.

263
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,836
I gotta get up early,
and it's almost 7:00.

264
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,463
- I gotta go to my room.
- Good night!

265
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,715
Good night!

266
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,012
- I can't do it!
- I didn't ask you to!

267
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:24,475
- You're Rachel! My friend!
- You're Joey!

268
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:29,021
Plus, it would be wrong,
and weird and bad!

269
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:33,150
So bad!
But I didn't ask you to do anything!

270
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,527
I know!

271
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,495
- You wanna do it?
- No!

272
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,916
- I'm just testing you!
- No more of this talk!

273
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,253
- This talk never happened!
- Good night!

274
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,504
Good night!

275
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,305
Get back in there!

276
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:14,024
Listen, I'm sorry about
that whole thing with Roger.

277
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:18,279
It really wasn't right.
And I want to make it up to you.

278
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,407
So I brought you something
I think you'll really enjoy.

279
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:35,379
Now this is just a loan, okay?
I'm gonna want him back.

280
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,465
I'm gonna go now.

281
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:46,640
I'm sorry.
I thought I could do it, and I can't.

282
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:52,688
