1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,400
To me, the Sixers are a five seat tops. 

2
00:00:03,527 --> 00:00:05,962
I think they're going
to the Conference finals.

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,364
- No.
- Bynum, an obvious monster.

4
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:10,750
At three-point shooting,
don't even--

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:14,587
I bit my lip at lunch today.

6
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:17,590
Sucks.
Anyway, I just don't see it.

7
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:18,892
The Knicks are tough.

8
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,961
- The Nets are tough.
- Oh, the Nets are super tough.

9
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:26,048
Now I have this big bump
on my lip that hurts.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,318
I hate it.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,788
The Hawks are terrible.
They're always terrible.

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,740
Okay, you need
to think about it

13
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,076
before you come with the--

14
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,880
Whatever.
It's not a big deal.

15
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:42,248
You know, I always tell
my three-year-old,

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,000
if this is the worst thing
that's gonna happen--

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,868
You gotta be kidding me!

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,658
Okay. Pam, that's it.
I'm going home.

19
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:01,056


20
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:05,021
Morning, Meredith.

21
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,072
What?

22
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:08,191
Oh, sorry. Pam.

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,943
Yikes.

24
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,663
Jim's been spending
a few days a week in Philly,

25
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:16,916
and I'm not gonna lie--
it's been challenging.

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,588
Yesterday, things took
a turn for the worse.

27
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,408
I found out Cece has lice,
so I was up all night,

28
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,245
disinfecting every sheet,
towel, toy,

29
00:01:29,247 --> 00:01:31,798
item of clothing
in the entire house.

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,768
I'm exhausted.
But don't tell Jim.

31
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,089
He has a huge meeting today,
under a lot of pressure,

32
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:43,776
and he's doing it all
for the family.

33
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:46,029
I am meeting
Dr. J today,

34
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,647
otherwise known
as Julius Erving,

35
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,867
famed 76er
and my own personal hero.

36
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:52,952
But I have to be careful
not to rub it in Pam's face

37
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:56,039
because, let's be honest,
how would I feel

38
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,690
if I was at home,
stuck with the kids

39
00:01:57,692 --> 00:02:01,878
while she was go-karting
with John Stamos?

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,946
You sound tired.
Everything okay?

41
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:05,915
Great.
Everything's great.

42
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,051
Hey, are you nervous
about your big meeting?

43
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,619
Uh, a little bit.

44
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:11,471
It's a lot of pressure,
you know?

45
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,172
But that's what
I signed up for, right?

46
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,809
- Jim, the limo's here.
- Uh, you know what?

47
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:18,645
I gotta hop off because my, uh,

48
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:21,297
taxi is here to take me
to the meeting.

49
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,798
- Oh, call me later.
- Okay.

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,816
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

51
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:25,985
- I love you.
- Love you too. Bye.

52
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:28,972
How are you doing?

53
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:31,157
Okay. I mean,
it's what you want, so--

54
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,744
- It's how it has to be.
- I know, I know.

55
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:36,746
It's just hard.

56
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:38,331
Me and Val were going nowhere,

57
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,283
and if I'm gonna be
working in Philly,

58
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,618
I'm gonna need my freedom,

59
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,986
so I convinced Val
to break up with me.

60
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:45,588
Here's how you do it.

61
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,840
You say, "What are you gonna do,
break up with me?"

62
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:49,342
Like, as a joke.

63
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:51,494
And then you gain
a lot of weight.

64
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,796
I'll never be sorry,
not for a moment of it.

65
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,499
Me neither.
Come here.

66
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:01,638
Hey, Meredith, I need
your supply requests today.

67
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,838
Jeez H in the morning,

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,524
will you stop your nagging
already?

69
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:05,775
No wonder Jim left you.

70
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:10,179
He didn't leave me.
He just went part-time.

71
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,566
Can you just fill out
the form, please?

72
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,953
Yes.

73
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:19,072
I'm sure she's just confused.

74
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,909
People scratch their heads
when they're confused.

75
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,194
Not always like an ape,
the way Meredith just did,

76
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:27,213
but it happens.

77
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:28,364
Hurry up already.

78
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:29,916
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

79
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,718
Between the foster homes
and the orphanage,

80
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,203
I had lice 22 times.

81
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:36,205
Holy wow, that's a big one.

82
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:38,541
All right, pencils down,
everyone-- we've got lice.

83
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:41,644
Oh, God, Meredith!
Lice?

84
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:43,846
Did you not sign
a pledge to shower?

85
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:48,017
What? Lice?
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,154
Lock the doors.
We're on full quarantine.

87
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:53,055
Dwight, relax.
It's just lice.

88
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:54,490
Maybe, possibly.

89
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:57,360
Just lice, Pam?

90
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,779
Of all of the vermin
in God's great green kingdom,

91
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,065
lice are the ones
I detest the most.

92
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,417
My first day of school,
I had lice,

93
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,052
and no one would play with me.

94
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:09,071
For 15 years,
they called me "freak"

95
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:11,958
and "four eyes" and "sci-fi
nerd" and "girl puncher,"

96
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,094
all because I had lice
when I was seven.

97
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:16,095
- Make way.
- Dwight!

98
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:19,098
No.
Inspect me.

99
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,168
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp
I've ever seen.

100
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,636
- You are all clear.
- I should be.

101
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,471
I use lice shampoo
every morning.

102
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,473
- Hey!
- Oh!

103
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,192
- Stop that!
- Dwight!

104
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:31,394
Next.

105
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,262
Jeez, Meredith, you know,
this is an office.

106
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:35,264
It's not one
of your bean-bag orgies.

107
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:37,116
Uh, let's give her a break.

108
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:39,702
We don't know for sure
this is Meredith's fault.

109
00:04:39,704 --> 00:04:42,538
Pam, really?
Come on.

110
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,774
Hey, what do you want?
I know who I am.

111
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:47,744
Nobody's taking Meredith Palmer
to the opera to meet the queen.

112
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,745
Lice.

113
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,796
More lice.

114
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:52,948
- Angela has lice.
- Ew! Oh!

115
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,452
Ooh, yabber. Lice.
Yikers. Lice.

116
00:04:56,454 --> 00:05:00,623
No. How?
I am so clean.

117
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,308
- Oh, yeah. Big-time lice.
- Aah!

118
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,560
I wash my hands at least
six times a day.

119
00:05:04,562 --> 00:05:05,812
Toilet seat covers?

120
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:07,513
Yes, thank you,
even when I pee.

121
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,515
Apparently, none of that
is protection enough,

122
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,651
not when it comes to Meredith.

123
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,655
- Ooh.
- Oh.

124
00:05:15,657 --> 00:05:17,940
Hey, what are you wearing?

125
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,642
It's a hazmat suit.

126
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:23,813
That stands for hazardous
materials men's suit wearing.

127
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:25,281
If you rent
more than four times a year,

128
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,916
it just makes sense to buy.

129
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,838
Is there anyone else here
that is lice-free?

130
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,290
Excellent. You have
your own hazmat suits?

131
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,209
- No.
- No.

132
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,760
Ugh. Renters.

133
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,662
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to gather your belongings,

134
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:41,264
retreat to the warehouse.

135
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:43,516
Conduct your business there

136
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,635
until the infected
have been de-loused.

137
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,669
Let's get going.

138
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:48,104
I'm gonna stay here and fight.

139
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:50,306
If you don't hear from me
by lunch, call me.

140
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,808
I might want lunch.

141
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,360
All right. We're going
down to my warehouse.

142
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:56,446
That means we're playing
by my rules.

143
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:57,730
No messing with the baler,

144
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,365
and be cool
in front of me and Val.

145
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,150
We just broke up.

146
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,685
You got dumped?

147
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:05,204
- Yeah, she ended things.
- Break-ups are the worst.

148
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:06,789
The only thing
that got me through mine

149
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,691
was large amounts
of Shepherd's pie and Brandy.

150
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:10,626
The singer, not the drink.

151
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:13,028
Here, man.

152
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,414
You need them more than me.

153
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,801
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

154
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,339
Guys, I think we should
all ease up on Meredith.

155
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,341
This has got to be hard
for her.

156
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,342
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

157
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,094
I have not yet begun to shame.

158
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,545
That's it.
I'm getting my stuff.

159
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:30,563
I'm leaving for the day.

160
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:32,882
No, Stanley, if you leave now,

161
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,049
then you'll get it in your car,

162
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,067
and then you'll get it
in your house!

163
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,185
Get off me.

164
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,020
I'm trying to save you
from yourself!

165
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,439
All right, I'll stay!

166
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,409
There's a pencil
poking in my rolls.

167
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:45,745
Maybe it was Meredith.

168
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:48,063
Maybe she brought in lice
that are totally different

169
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:50,666
than the lice that I got
from Cece.

170
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:52,835
So let's not jump
to the simplest conclusion

171
00:06:52,837 --> 00:06:54,871
that she got her lice from me.

172
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:59,842
That is how wars get started.

173
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:03,629
Fine, I'll tell her it was me.

174
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,965
Oh, man.
That's fresh-squeezed.

175
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,751
And are all the snacks
complimentary?

176
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:10,720
Yeah, take some home
if you want.

177
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,856
Oh, no, no, no.
That's okay. I...

178
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:23,816
Um, I'm sorry.
Is this the conference center?

179
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,434
No.
Mr. Erving called.

180
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:28,738
Said he's rather meet you
at his private court.

181
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,159
You gotta be kidding me.

182
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:35,461
Hey, Meredith, I need
to tell you something.

183
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:36,746
Yeah, Pam?
What do you want?

184
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,447
Oh, my God.
Meredith, what are you doing?

185
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:40,282
Bakin' a cake. What does it
look like I'm doing?

186
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:42,418
- Getting rid of the lice.
- Oh, stop! I'm so sorry!

187
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,070
Oh, can you hold that thought?

188
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:45,504
That's my wax.

189
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:49,375
You know, I think these critters
migrated from down south.

190
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:50,927
What were you saying?

191
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,845
Nothing.

192
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,347
I'm going to tell her,

193
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,966
but now is clearly
not the time.

194
00:07:56,968 --> 00:08:00,636
I will buy her a wig,
we'll have a few laughs.

195
00:08:00,638 --> 00:08:03,472
There's a right way to do this.

196
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:08,425
♪, ♪,

197
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:11,211
follicle gypsies, hair lawyers.

198
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:13,847
One thing is clear--
it's kill or be killed!

199
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,849
No, no, no. It's more
of a nuisance, really.

200
00:08:15,851 --> 00:08:17,567
It's not that big a deal.

201
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:19,653
So I've collected
your hats and your coats...

202
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:21,638
- To be burned!
- ...to be washed.

203
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,139
What do we do about our heads?

204
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:25,659
I'm not gonna lie.
Lye!

205
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:28,328
No.
All we need is mayonnaise.

206
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,831
- Excuse me?
- She's right. It works.

207
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,332
I would imagine.

208
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:35,152
Yes. It helps to suffocate
the little buddies,

209
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:36,870
and it's
a really healthy alternative

210
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:39,456
to the chemicals found
in most lice shampoos.

211
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,957
I can appreciate that.

212
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,712
I also only eat
local organic produce.

213
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:48,331
Sha-boom!
How do you like me now?

214
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,183
- Oh!
- Wow!

215
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:52,001
Take a picture.
It'll last longer.

216
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:53,937
We don't want it
to last longer. It's horrible.

217
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:56,139
- Bald people make me sick.
- Yeah, yeah.

218
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:58,141
Everybody pile on Meredith.

219
00:08:58,143 --> 00:08:59,509
But I'm the only one
with the balls

220
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:03,346
to show them lice who's boss.

221
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:04,448
Okay, nobody panic.

222
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,817
If everybody just follows
my instructions,

223
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,435
then nobody else
needs to end up bald.

224
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:10,687
Not that it looks bad,
Meredith.

225
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:13,156
It looks--
it looks awesome.

226
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:15,876
You look like a baby
who suddenly aged 50 years.

227
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:19,129
A cute baby, but something
sucked the life force out of it.

228
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:20,997
I'm so sorry.
We need mayonnaise.

229
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,333
- We need it now.
- Oh, uh, uh, I'll go.

230
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:24,534
- Okay.
- Oh, thank you.

231
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:25,719
You're a saint, Pam.

232
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:27,003
No, it's not a big deal,
please, no.

233
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:28,388
Uh, Meredith, could I get you
something special

234
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,506
while I'm at the store?

235
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:32,225
Candy or-- or one
of those stylish turbans?

236
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:33,510
Thanks, Pam.

237
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:35,011
I'll take a pack
of Nicorette gum

238
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:36,012
and a pack of Kools.

239
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:38,765
Okay.

240
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:43,270
Let's talk pubes, people.

241
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:47,858
- Hey, Darryl.
- Oh, hey, Val.

242
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:53,613
Darryl.
Oh, that was tragic.

243
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:56,750
Oh, that was like a car crash.
I couldn't look away.

244
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:59,703
You two still clearly have
feelings for each other.

245
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,121
Yeah.

246
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:02,739
What's gonna make you
feel better, big guy?

247
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:04,257
When I was a kid,

248
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:05,876
my grandmother used to
make me chocolate cake

249
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:07,911
when I wasn't feeling good.

250
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:09,913
She's not around to do that
anymore.

251
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:11,214
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:16,085
I just need a moment to myself,
just to clear my head.

253
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:17,270
Oh, poor Darryl.

254
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:19,222
I can't bear to see him
suffer like this.

255
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:22,225
I think he needs some hugs

256
00:10:22,227 --> 00:10:24,945
and maybe some chocolate cake.

257
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:28,598
Mmm. This won't help him.
It's a muffin, not cake.

258
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,766
Listen,
let's try and get Darryl

259
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:31,117
the one thing in the world

260
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:33,703
he clearly wants
and needs the most.

261
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:37,607
- An Escalade.
- Or what's her name.

262
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:39,292
Val.

263
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:42,212
Let's get Darryl Val.

264
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:44,331
I hope you don't mind me
bringing you out here.

265
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,882
I can't get my knees
under a desk.

266
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:47,083
Are you kidding me?

267
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:48,885
I could literally
scalp tickets to this.

268
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:50,837
Well, you think you could
sink one from deep?

269
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:53,623
Listen, I don't mean
to intimidate you,

270
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,308
but I did play
a little high school ball.

271
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,262
Okay.

272
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:02,849
Wow. Halpert's got game.
All right.

273
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:05,735
Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.

274
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:07,771
This is my wife.
Can I take this?

275
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:09,739
If it's your wife,
you better take it.

276
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:12,642
Right?

277
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:15,245
Hey, what's up?
Everything okay?

278
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:16,913
Oh, no.
Everything's great.

279
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:19,833
Um, I was just calling to see,
uh, how the meeting went.

280
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:22,151
Oh, it's still happening
right now, actually, so--

281
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:24,320
He's, uh, really making you
work for it, huh?

282
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:28,174
Yes, it is very stressful.
Are you sure everything's okay?

283
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,877
Great.
I am killing it over here.

284
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:35,715
- Jim, I gotta go.
- Okay, bye.

285
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:38,268
- So sorry about that.
- Oh, no problem.

286
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,886
Hey, Jim, what size
do you wear, man?

287
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:42,606
I got a pair of Japanese Nikes
with your name on 'em.

288
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:45,942
- What do you think?
- I love it.

289
00:11:45,944 --> 00:11:47,227
Once it's all over your head,

290
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:48,562
just leave it there
for four hours.

291
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:51,531
That will be enough time
for the lice to fall asleep,

292
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,733
suffocate, and then pass away.

293
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:55,452
Oh, sure.

294
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:57,571
And when you're ready
to get serious,

295
00:11:57,573 --> 00:12:01,190
come to me
to get it done right.

296
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:04,961
Put those away
before you hurt yourself.

297
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:08,832
Oh, God. Oh, no.

298
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:12,836
No. No!

299
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:16,172
No! No! No!

300
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:19,542
No! No!

301
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:21,428
Okay, it's easier with a buddy,

302
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,929
so everybody pair up.

303
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:25,432
Oscar, you want to be
my partner?

304
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:28,685
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'd love to.

305
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:31,237
Hey, uh, mayo buddy, $5 tip,

306
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:33,657
you unclog my ears, okay?

307
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,742
Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry.

308
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:38,161
I'm-- I'm already partners
with Pete. Right, Pete?

309
00:12:38,163 --> 00:12:39,579
Uh, yeah.

310
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:41,731
We promised each other
if we ever got lice,

311
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:45,168
we'd buddy up, so, sorry, man.

312
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,405
Hey, Creed.
Want to be my buddy?

313
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:52,208
Oh, God.
Stuck with the weirdo.

314
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,132
Angela.

315
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,518
You don't want bugs, you know?

316
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,388
Who knows where those bugs
will end up.

317
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,924
You're getting a bargain.
I ain't got no hair no more.

318
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:15,098
Creed, I'm all done.
My turn.

319
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,267
I'm sorry, Pam.
It looks a little messy.

320
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,370
Well, wait.

321
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:26,376
- How's that?
- I feel it working.

322
00:13:28,446 --> 00:13:30,380
Ksk, ksk, ksk, ksk, ksk.

323
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:32,716
- Eiffel tower.
- Oh!

324
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:34,884
Now.

325
00:13:34,886 --> 00:13:35,669
Can I help you?

326
00:13:37,222 --> 00:13:38,555
- Well--
- Um--

327
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:39,889
We don't want to pry,

328
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:41,758
but we heard you broke up
with Darryl.

329
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,976
Yeah, that's true.

330
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,811
We think you made
a big, big mistake.

331
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:47,030
- Big mistake.
- Quite enormous.

332
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:50,533
He's a real catch,
and you should take him back.

333
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:53,486
Okay. Thank you.
Is that all?

334
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:55,605
No.
No, that is not all.

335
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,907
Let me tell you
what real life is like.

336
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:00,210
The men dry up,
and the nights get lonely.

337
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:01,878
The only calls on your machine

338
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,213
are from collection agencies

339
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:04,464
about that pair
of motorcycle boots

340
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:05,749
you've never even worn.

341
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:08,885
You stalk your old
high school boyfriend online,

342
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:10,720
go to his daughter's
soccer games, and make a scene.

343
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:12,822
You buy a diamond ring
for yourself

344
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:14,290
wear it on your right hand,

345
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,459
and tell yourself
you're all you need.

346
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:19,813
One day, you're alone, tired.

347
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,898
At your feet, a dying bird.

348
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,600
But where did it come from?

349
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:25,185
Why did you kill it?

350
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:27,070
It is because,
in some strange way,

351
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:28,805
it is you?

352
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:30,740
Thank you all for your concern,

353
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:33,326
but I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave, okay?

354
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:36,830
- Pfft! Well.
- Thank you.

355
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,998
Thank you.

356
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,484
So does this mean
you're gonna take Darryl back?

357
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:43,086
No.

358
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:44,370
Well, then, what would you say

359
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:47,657
to you and me hitting the town?

360
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:51,428
'Cause I'm free,
literally, forever.

361
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,513
Yeah, Kevin asked me out.

362
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:55,765
I was kind of feeling good about
re-entering the dating pool,

363
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,934
and then Kevin asked me out.

364
00:14:57,936 --> 00:15:01,137
Thought I might trade up
to a new level of man.

365
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,924
Then Kevin asked me out.

366
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,237
- Hello?
- Hi, honey, it's mom.

367
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,855
Look, Cece's school
just called.

368
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:22,191
- She still has lice.
- What? No, that can't--

369
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:23,710
I don't--
- Now, don't worry, don't worry.

370
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:25,161
I'm on my way to pick her up,

371
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:26,796
but you might have lice too.

372
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:27,997
You know, lice can be tricky.

373
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,166
Sometimes lice, like...

374
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:32,886
- Oh, my God.
- Shave her head.

375
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:37,199
Shave her head!

376
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:42,313
You guys, I am so sorry!

377
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,682
It's just been so chaotic
with Jim gone that I--

378
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:46,034
Yeah, yeah,
princess fancy-pants

379
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,486
letting Jane 12-pack over here
take the fall!

380
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:50,154
She's right, Pam.

381
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:52,206
Is there a volume knob
on that thing?

382
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,326
Yes, there's a volume knob
on that thing!

383
00:15:55,328 --> 00:16:00,581
Meredith, I am so sorry.

384
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,033
Well, a lot of good your
sorrys are doing her now, Pam.

385
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:06,637
She's a monster.

386
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,507
I meant to say something
earlier. I just--

387
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:13,978
Just? Just what?
Just forgot?

388
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,881
Who's the one that didn't
bring lice into the office?

389
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:18,816
Meredith.

390
00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:20,601
Sure, I gave everybody
pink-eye once,

391
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:22,270
and my ex keyed
a few of their cars.

392
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,889
And, yeah, I BMed
in the Shredder on New Year's,

393
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:27,807
but I didn't bring the lice in.

394
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:30,364
That was all Pam.

395
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:32,854
Attention, people of the office.

396
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:36,672
You have exactly 60 seconds
to evacuate the bullpen. 

397
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:38,633
At that time...

398
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:43,038
I will be tossing this powerful
insecticidal grenade,

399
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:47,510
which contains Piperonyl Butoxide, as well as...

400
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:50,887
Dwight, are you okay?

401
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:59,727
Whoa, the butoxide has a mild hallucinogenic effect that I don't
think has kicked in yet.

402
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:01,405
I'm gonna count down for ten.

403
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,089
Nine...

404
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,466
Yellow...

405
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:06,926
Cold.

406
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:08,074
What's that? 

407
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,244
Purple.

408
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,871
Wow.
He got to purple.

409
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:17,107
Ow!

410
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,660
Sorry.

411
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:23,131
You're waterboarding me!

412
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:26,884
Oops.

413
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:37,962
No, this is fine.
We're allowed to do this.

414
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:42,967
This is okay.

415
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:44,802
Okay, you're up.

416
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:47,939
Yeah, I'm actually kind of sad
to see this baby go.

417
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,974
You do kind of look like Elvis,

418
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:55,312
but we should probably wash
all the dead lice out.

419
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,786
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

420
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:06,490
Is that too cold?

421
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:10,511
No. Actually,
it feels kind of nice.

422
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:21,672
I wonder what happened
over there.

423
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:23,624
I've been sitting here
the whole time.

424
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:31,816
- Okay.
- Huh?

425
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:34,285
Let's give it a shot.
Let's make it work.

426
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,237
Oh, no.
I mean, I want to.

427
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:38,206
I just-- I don't want
to force you into doing

428
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,657
something you don't want to do.

429
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:42,860
You're not.
I believe in us.

430
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:44,591
But--

431
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,918
I'm back together with Val.

432
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,504
Yay.

433
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:59,176
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

434
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:00,377
Had a pretty good day today.

435
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,481
Not everything went exactly
according to plan,

436
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:07,217
but, lice, if you are watching,

437
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:10,688
I am ready for you anytime,
anywhere.

438
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:18,195
Hey, Erin already take off?

439
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:21,565
I guess so.

440
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,135
Okay.

441
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:28,337
You're Kareem, coming to help.

442
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:29,196
Okay, I'm Kareem.

443
00:19:29,197 --> 00:19:31,625
That makes total sense.
I'm Kareem, you're Dr. J.

444
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:32,999
That sounds weird
to say out loud.

445
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,851
And it went like this...

446
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:39,422
And that's all.

447
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:42,278
No one will believe this
back home but that's okay.

448
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,233
- Let me show you how...
- Yeah, you show me how to do it.

449
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:49,973
Hey, honey.
It's me.

450
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:52,138
Just trying to catch you
before going home.

451
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:53,191
Uh...

452
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:56,714
Well, just give me
a call whenever.

453
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:58,645
Hope your day
got better. Love you.

454
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,662
Hey.

455
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,496
What're you doing right now?

456
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:07,675
I'm just gonna go home.
My mom's been watching the kids all day.

457
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:09,436
Let her stay another hour.

458
00:20:09,471 --> 00:20:10,902
Let's go get a beer.

459
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:11,816
Really?

460
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:14,615
A beer sounds
incredible right now.

461
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,540
No-duh.
Let's go. You're buying.

462
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,590
Meredith, I am so
sorry about today.

463
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,827
Forget about it.

464
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:27,743
I just did not realize how hard it was
gonna be without Jim.

465
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:30,034
I mean, I really respect you

466
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:31,869
for being a single mom
all these years.

467
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,572
It whipped my ass
in half a week.

468
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:36,490
I have to say, there are
not a lot of people

469
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:39,210
who could pull off a shaved
head, but you're rocking it.

470
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:40,778
Right?

471
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,079
I got the bartender's
phone number

472
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:43,331
when you were in the john.

473
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,082
I'm gonna take that freak
to bone town

474
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:47,468
before the night is over.

475
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,420
Get it, girl!

476
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:56,665
This one's
