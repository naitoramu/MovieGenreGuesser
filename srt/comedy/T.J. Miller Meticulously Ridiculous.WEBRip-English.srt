1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,280
"I mean, you must understand that
he is in every sense of the word"

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,960
"a gilt-edged investment."

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,800
"I mean, he is
the most important personality"

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,800
"of the entire history
of show business,"

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,080
"and therefore, he has to be
watched very carefully indeed."

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,280
Give it up for the star
of Yogi bear 3-D, Mr. TJ Miller.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,520
Denver!

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280
Oh, Denver
I'm so happy to be here. I'm...

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm from Denver and I'm...

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,760
Yeah, why not?
Why not?

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,040
Well, we made it.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,760
Okay.

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,800
This is the only city,
that's how great

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,680
the city of Denver is,

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,440
is the only place that
you would cheer for the city

16
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,160
and Denver, not only does
the cheer not die down,

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,000
it builds, and it builds
and it builds, until...

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,400
Wasn't so
friendly here, I love it.

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
I really love Denver, I love uh...

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,040
Yeah, I just made a decision,

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,160
not going to say
Denver again in the show.

22
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,840
You're such friendly people.
Yeah, we're friendly people here.

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,640
That's not the case
in Los Angeles or New York,

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,160
you know what I mean?

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,640
You'll, you'll look someone
in the eyes in Denver

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,800
and not only will you not
look away, you'll smile.

27
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,720
That happened to me yesterday.
This guy was walking his dog,

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,440
he just walked by me
looked me directly in the eyes

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,320
and he's like...

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,720
Like some sort of fucking Colgate
commercial or something like that,

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,720
something like that.

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,160
But I wanted to throw him a smile
back, you know what I mean?

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,200
Why not, what's that cost ya, huh?

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,200
Not a pretty penny,
not a God damn dime,

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,520
not a fucking five dollar bill,
hmm. Hmm.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,440
So he gave me the little... yeah,
and I threw him one back,

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,360
I gave him a "Yeah!"

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,840
What's under there?

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,920
And he was like, "Under where?"
And I was like, "That's what I thought."

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,320
I bet you didn't think
you were going to see that today.

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,600
Not here,
not for this show,

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,640
not for this discerning crowd.

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,280
I mean...

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,560
I mean, this fucking city,
you know?

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,640
Have you guys been saying that?
I say it all the time.

46
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,560
Not, it's not about Denver,
it's just, I think it's very funny.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,880
You ever do that? Just drink,
drink your water

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,480
from the bottle like a little
gerbil, like a hamster?

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,040
What's that, Diane? No, no,
no, I, I, I don't need an appetizer.

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,680
This fucking city is a funny thing to
say because you can say it anywhere.

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,360
I was at a yogurt store
and I, uh I was like,

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,440
"Do you guys have
chocolate sprinkles?"

53
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
And the girl was like, "No,
we only have multicolored."

54
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,360
And I was like, "This fucking city."

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,520
"God damn it, no, it doesn't
have anything to do with you."

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,960
"But this, this fucking city
is tearing me apart."

57
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,840
You gotta start saying it. Do it
to your boss on Monday.

58
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,400
If he gives you a new task
just be like,

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,080
"Can you
get this done by Wednesday?"

60
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,160
"This fucking city."

61
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,400
"Are you, are you upset with me?"

62
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
"No, it's not you."

63
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,880
"It's this God damn municipality."

64
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,120
Do you guys ever have nightmares?

65
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,680
- Yeah!
- Oh, thank you.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
The last crowd,
this is real, I asked,

67
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,800
I said, "Do you guys
ever have nightmares?"

68
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,720
and they said... Nothing.
They said nothing.

69
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,240
You ask 2,000 people,
"Do you have nightmares?"

70
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,080
And they, "Mm-mm."

71
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,040
"Mm-mm, we don't have them,
we're just in yours."

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,400
You always want to tell people
about your nightmares.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,280
Why do we all want to tell, because it's
a prison of your own minds' devising.

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,160
It's really a horrible thing but
it, no one wants to hear it

75
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,080
because it's not a linear narrative.

76
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,360
Right? And we're used to stories,
okay, okay,

77
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,160
so I had this nightmare last night,
I woke up in m-,

78
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,920
it was like my principal's office but
it was also my parents bedroom,

79
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,640
but it was neither, does that
make sense? And then suddenly

80
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,440
I turn around and I'm on the beach
and I'm like, "Oh my God,"

81
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
"there must be jellyfish." Because,
you know, I'm scared of jellyfish.

82
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,600
Do you remember? Did I tell you,
when I got stung in New Jersey?

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,320
Haven't told you that story?
You're going to love that story.

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
Halfway through it they're,
you know your friends are like,

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,720
"Just stop, stop, stop. Don't
tell me, I don't want to hear this."

86
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,120
"Just stop wasting my time. Time is
an incredibly important commodity,"

87
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,640
"just stop."

88
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,160
And I was in the middle
of telling my nightmare

89
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,600
to this group of people,
and this guy,

90
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,720
you know he was kind of like a,
kind of a douchey,

91
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,600
kind of a guy, I'm trying to look around
and find somebody that...

92
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,120
You know, look like see there's no
douche bags in Colorado that didn't...

93
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,760
Well, look, he looked
a little like you.

94
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,520
Ki-, look he had a backwards
Pro back hat on.

95
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,280
No, not you, sir.
The person behind you.

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,680
You look like a cool teacher.

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,360
This fucking guy had his glasses like,

98
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,600
like reading glasses,
bifocals perhaps.

99
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,640
He's got reading glasses
but he's got sunglasses

100
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,040
hanging from his
white button down shirt,

101
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,960
like just that cool teacher that's like,
"Hey, school's out."

102
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,080
"Let's talk, let's rap.
How are you kids doing?"

103
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,600
"You guys all right? yeah?"

104
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,920
"A lot of people wanting
to do drugs. Huh?"

105
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,440
"Putting on the pressure.
You take it from me, all right?"

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,080
I did cocaine in the 1990s,
alright? A lot of it. Alright?

107
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,840
A lot.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,800
I ended up in a hotel,
a motor hotel room in Omaha,

109
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,320
coked out of my mind
after being up for eight days.

110
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,160
You know what
I told myself?

111
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,280
"God darn it,
I'm going to be a teacher,"

112
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,040
"and I'm going to be the coolest God
damn teacher on the face of the planet."

113
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,800
And I decided never to
button more than,

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,760
always will have two
or three buttons unbuttoned,

115
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,560
so that while I talk to you
my chest hair is distracting.

116
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,600
Mr. Gerlich I hate you.
Ha ha ha ha.

117
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,760
So, this kind of douchey
guy was just like,

118
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,080
"Oh, you have nightmares?
Ha ha. Hmm."

119
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,920
"Cause I actually ah,
I have night terrors."

120
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,160
I was like, "Fuck you, don't one up
me with your night, terrors."

121
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,440
You're like, "Oh, sorry to
hear about your bad dreams"

122
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,560
"about female horses. Sorry
to hear about your night-mares."

123
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,320
"But actually my nights,
my nights are filled with terror."

124
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,600
So, what I did is I went to
his house in the dead of the night

125
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,960
and I built a bed that was
a mirror image of his bed,

126
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,480
and I put the feet of the bed
together and I dressed exactly

127
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,720
as he was dressed in
identical sleeping garments,

128
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,240
and I went to sleep and I waited him
awaking from his night terror,

129
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,120
and then I also awoke
and mirrored

130
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,120
all of the things that he did.

131
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,080
So he was like... "ah!"

132
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,440
And I'm like, "Maah!"

133
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,720
And he's like, "Ah!"
And I'm like, "Maah!"

134
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,760
And then I hit a button and then
all these lights from Home Depot

135
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,680
that I had set up just
tuf tuf tuf tuf tuf,

136
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,400
just flooded the room
tuf tuf tuf tuf tuf tuf,

137
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,920
then I went, "Which is more terrifying,
your night or my day?"

138
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,840
It's super expensive.
And buddy I'll tell you what,

139
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,440
if they wake up while
you're setting up the lights

140
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,080
you can kiss
that friendship goodbye.

141
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,840
But so I'm from here, I live
in Los Angeles, I smoke marijuana

142
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
in Los Angeles,
I have a prescription...

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,120
I have a prescription
for marijuana,

144
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,320
that guy stood up,
hey, okay.

145
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,080
That's how high he was, he was like,
"Everybody's going to stand up"

146
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
"for marijuana, yeah! Oh."

147
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
"We're not, we're not standing? Okay."

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,080
"I thought everybody
was going to stand."

149
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,560
But I have a prescription
for marijuana in Los Angeles,

150
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,480
it's medicinal, okay?
It's for anxiety.

151
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,080
Primarily anxiety about
getting arrested for marijuana.

152
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,480
America was founded on two things.

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,400
One of them we don't like to
talk about and the other is tobacco.

154
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,520
So, marijuana
is the new cash crop

155
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,640
that's going to take us, you know,
through the next millennium.

156
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
It's excit-,
excit-, excit-, exciting.

157
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,720
And Denver's
at the forefront. I love it.

158
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,600
Now...

159
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,680
I like your laugh.
Ha ha ha ha.

160
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
You laugh like he looks.

161
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,280
You laugh, you laugh like
a cool teacher, like he just,

162
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,320
one of the kids made
a reference to snap chat

163
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,960
and he thought it was funny
and he was like,

164
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,880
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha."

165
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,600
I'm not making fun of your laugh,
I would never do that.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,720
Have you ever had a friend make
fun of the way you laugh?

167
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,240
Ever had a friend,
but you have?

168
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,120
You know what
your friend is saying

169
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,160
when they make fun of
the way that you laugh?

170
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,480
"Hey, you know that sound that you
make when you're happy and joyful?"

171
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,200
"And the tragedy
that permeates our everyday life"

172
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
"is momentarily abated
for an ephemeral escapism?"

173
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
"Yeah, you sound stupid."

174
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,640
"You should feel self-conscious
when you're happy."

175
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,560
You should be like, "Uh everything's
okay for a moment, ar ar ar ar."

176
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,120
"Wait, do I sound like a seal?
Ar ar ar ar."

177
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,120
"Don't throw me the ball.
Ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar."

178
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,320
You know alcohol's a better
friend to you than marijuana is.

179
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,280
And I like marijuana, no,
it is. It is, it's a better friend

180
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
because you blackout.

181
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,560
That's important. Everybody in
here thinks they drink too much.

182
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,320
Everybody in here said to
themselves, "You know, I, I, I"

183
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,240
"I should drink less."
Every single person.

184
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,080
But no one in here has ever been like,
"You know what..."

185
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,560
"I should drink more.
I mean..."

186
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,240
"I'm, I'm, I'm having
a half a glass of wine"

187
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,040
"every night that I go out to party."

188
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,200
"I should try this four, five, six,"

189
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,640
"forget to pick up your kids
at school of glasses of wine."

190
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,560
"What have I been doing?"

191
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,040
What a great friend, alcohol.
When you black out,

192
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,040
basically alcohol's going
"Hey,"

193
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,480
"it's about to get pretty
messy here in a second,"

194
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,680
"you can go ahead and take off."

195
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,800
"We'll take it from here, we've
got it from here on out."

196
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,640
But when you smoke too much,
marijuana is not a good friend.

197
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,680
Instead of turning your mind off,
like when you blackout,

198
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,160
it turns your mind all
the way up completely.

199
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
You're using your mind way
too much and become paranoid,

200
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,920
you know what I mean? You're
in a room with your good friends

201
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,560
and you're like every time I look away
they keep glancing at each other like...

202
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,200
"This fucking guy."

203
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,640
And they create a sort of,
some sort of and language

204
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,360
where they are like, "The party would
be more fun if he wasn't here."

205
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,320
"If we could
get him out of here,"

206
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,240
"the party would be more fun."

207
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
"Uh, nothing, ha ha ha ha ha."

208
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
But, when you smoke just
the right amount of marijuana

209
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,080
it can be the greatest
thing in the world.

210
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,680
I had smoked a lot of marijuana,
a lot, okay?

211
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,280
And I was having trouble getting
the movie to work, uh,

212
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,080
in the motor hotel that I was
staying in, which is a motel.

213
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,600
And uh, when I am very very high
I speak very formally

214
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,320
so as if to appear not to be high.

215
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,640
But I speak so formally that no
one would ever talk like that

216
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,760
unless they were very, very high.

217
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,960
So, I called the front desk
and I go, "Excuse me,"

218
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,200
"I would like to speak with
the proprietor of this establishment.

219
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,440
"The inhabitant of room 113
is having difficulties"

220
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,440
"with the entertainment center."

221
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,120
"He would like this remedied
immediately, and when I say he,"

222
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,560
"I speak of myself in the third
person, for it is I"

223
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,000
"the man who is having difficulties
with the entertainment center."

224
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
And then I was on
hold for a very long time

225
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,280
and I kind of drifted off, but
then I realized suddenly

226
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,120
that I had forgotten

227
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,440
if I had told him to hold on...

228
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,680
Or if he had told me to hold on.

229
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,760
I go, you know, I figure
make it ambiguous.

230
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
So I go, "Hello?"

231
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,920
A little bit of angry,
a little bit of a quandary,

232
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,520
but he was good, because he
came right back and he goes,

233
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,360
"Hello?"

234
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,240
I mean now, now I'm like,
"What's the move?"

235
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,760
Do you know what I mean?
It's my move, okay?

236
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,360
It's my move. But I don't know,
I'm pretty good so I go,

237
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,800
"Are you there?"

238
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,400
But he was good and he just goes,
"Yeah. Are you?"

239
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,360
Checkmate.

240
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,320
That did it for me, I was like,
"I don't know if I'm here."

241
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,040
"I'm high, I'm in room 113,
call the police."

242
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,160
"I don't know if I was supposed to
work today, you call the police!"

243
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,680
I was like "Only if we can
ride together." He said yes,

244
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,120
friends ever since. Yes.

245
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,200
That's how remarkable marijuana is.

246
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,400
There are approximately
5 reasons I don't give a fuck.

247
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,440
One, Parsley's not
a garnish for me.

248
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,680
When the plate hits the table that's
the first fucking thing I eat.

249
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,000
Two, there is no stem to a strawberry,
that's just the green part,

250
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,960
and when I
eat a strawberry Sir,

251
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,800
I eat the whole fucking thing.

252
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,520
And when shrimp is fried I eat the tail.

253
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,360
Oh dear,
what did I just say?

254
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,200
Three, I always choose
the Spanish option at the ATM.

255
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,880
What's the worst that can happen?

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,200
I can always cancellar.

257
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,040
Four, I don't put toilet paper
down on public toilet seats.

258
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't do that. Sorry you had
to hear it from me but

259
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,760
that's what butts are for. Yeah.

260
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,360
That's what butts are for,

261
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,800
and no one's ever
gotten sick through their butt.

262
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,440
I mean except for AIDS and syphilis.
A lot of sexually transmitted diseases

263
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,960
that, a lot of them,
most of them are f-,

264
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,160
uh fatal, so...

265
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,400
The number five reason
I don't give a fuck,

266
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,400
sorry I'm taken,
but I fuck 'til I truck.

267
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,200
Do you know that means,
you know what that means?

268
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,680
That means I fuck and I fuck
and I fuck and I fuck

269
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
and I fuck and I fuck and I fuck

270
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,920
until I get a CDL, that's
a commercial drivers license.

271
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,440
I started
with short hauls in state,

272
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,480
then I started doing the tristate
hauls, then I do the longer hauls.

273
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,760
Pac Northwest down to San Diego,
then I do the transcontinental hauls

274
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,160
between San Diego to
Pennsylvania down to Florida.

275
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,080
Then I truck and I truck
and I truck and I truck...

276
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,160
until I fuck.

277
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,720
And I gotta be honest,
I try not to fuck too much.

278
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
It's completely disproportionate
to the amount of

279
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,080
trucking that you have to do
to get back to the fucking,

280
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,320
and so it's a lot of trucking and it's,
I don't know if you know any truckers

281
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,320
or you've ever trucked before,

282
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,600
but it's a lonely road.
It's just an open road

283
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,000
and all you have is your,
your CB and your,

284
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,760
your handle. It's the type of life, huh,

285
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,480
type of life where you get
a French manicure

286
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,280
just so it looks like you're
getting a hand job

287
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,960
when you jack off.

288
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,440
Who's your favorite American
historical figure, hmm?

289
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,800
Who is it?
Who is your favorite...

290
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,240
Who's your favorite American
historical figure? Hmm? What?

291
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,520
Roosevelt, that's a good one.

292
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Get her the fuck out of here.
Get her out of here.

293
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,320
Get her out of here.

294
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,360
My favorite, my favorite
American historical figure

295
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,960
is George Washington Carver.

296
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,160
Geor- yes. Yes. Yes.

297
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,680
A much,
the greatest American inventor.

298
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,120
A much better
inventor than Eli Whitney

299
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,040
who invented the cotton gin.

300
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,360
Something that
we all know exists,

301
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,160
but none of us could imagine
what it looks like at all.

302
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Watch, right now
everybody, everybody

303
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,840
think of a cotton gin. Go, imagine it.

304
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,520
I propose you're merely
thinking of some kind of a loom.

305
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,160
And that's the only
loom joke you'll ever hear.

306
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,880
George Washington Carver, right?

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,120
I mean peanut, yes, peanut butter,
exactly. Peanut butter.

308
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,000
He invented over 100 things with
peanuts, but peanut butter.

309
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,520
Can you imagine
if you invented peanut butter?

310
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,760
Would you keep it a secret just for
a little while, for like a week or two?

311
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,400
You wouldn't tell your wife
or any of your friends?

312
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,800
You just show up, your friend's like,
"Why are you so happy?" You're like,

313
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,400
"No reason."

314
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,800
"But if you have some celery
and some raisins,"

315
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,720
"shit's about to go down."

316
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,240
"Oh thank you. I'll be in the
bathroom, don't come in."

317
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
"I'll call it ants on a log, yeah."

318
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,920
Right, but George Washington
Carver, great man, right.

319
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,680
I like to think he had
a great relationship.

320
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,280
But any great relationship requires
transparency, okay?

321
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,560
So that transparency is essential,
right, in a great relationship.

322
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,840
So I figure like, she would
kind of start to know

323
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,680
that something was up, you know
she's like, "George,"

324
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,720
"you want me to bring
the jelly sandwiches"

325
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,920
"down to your invent workshop?"
And he's like, "No, no Martha'"

326
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,520
And I don't know if her name
was Martha, but neither do you.

327
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,800
"No no Martha, that's okay, uh"

328
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,720
"just leave the
jelly sandwiches outside"

329
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,840
"and I'll eat them without adding
anything to them at all."

330
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,560
"Certainly nothing that
would antiquate the idea"

331
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,760
"of jelly sandwiches altogether."

332
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,760
So eventually she's got to come
to him and go, "George,"

333
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,320
"you got a secret, I can see it, there's
a secret behind those eyes"

334
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,120
"George. I try to create
an environment for transparency,"

335
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,640
"George, what is
the secret, George?"

336
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,920
And he doesn't have to say anything
because fellas, isn't, is not

337
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,040
the best get out of jail
free card, she's angry,

338
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,600
but he just invented peanut butter.
All he has to do

339
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,720
as she's yelling,
you know he's just slowly,

340
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,200
pushes a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich into her mouth.

341
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,800
That fluffy white bread,
he's cut the crust off

342
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,760
and she bites down. Ladies
it's the first time a woman

343
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,360
has ever had a peanut
butter and jelly s-,

344
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,000
you gotta know she just came.
I mean she is,

345
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,960
she just had the most
violent orgasm of her life.

346
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,560
And he gets, he gets on her,
guys you gotta know,

347
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,880
he gets on her and he fucks her.
I mean he does.

348
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,920
He fucks, he f-, he,
there's no other way to say it,

349
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,640
he fucks her like the guy who
just invented peanut butter. Alright?

350
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,920
And I'll tell you what,
if you go home tonight

351
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,440
and you have excellent
intercourse, you know,

352
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,680
which I can see cool teachers gonna...

353
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,880
You're going to do a little role-
playing. Somebody's going to get

354
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,400
their diploma tonight.

355
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,240
She's in a graduation cap, look,

356
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,440
I can do the whole thing alright, I-.

357
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,200
But if you go home and you have
excellent intercourse tonight,

358
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,000
this is really important, okay,

359
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,840
I want you to take a beat after
you've both climaxed, just...

360
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,560
take a breath and then turn
to the person that you're with,

361
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,840
you know, turn to the person
next to you and just say,

362
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,000
"That was like you just
invented peanut butter."

363
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,720
Because it's either the greatest
compliment they've ever had or

364
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,120
a lot of people are going to blackout
and not remember the show,

365
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,840
and then it's the strangest
ending to sex ever.

366
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,200
So look, I was in Yogi Bear
so I made a lot of money

367
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,720
and uh... I want to talk, listen,

368
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,400
I want to talk to you guys
about something, and that is

369
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,840
when you make a lot of money
don't spend it, okay? Save it.

370
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,040
All right, don't spend it like
more is coming. All right?

371
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,000
I mean you saw my wife Kate
and she puts up-,

372
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,720
I don't know if you can tell
from my performance tonight

373
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,040
but I'm a handful,
I'm a bit of a handful.

374
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,360
And she puts up with a l- I,

375
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,400
I lost $73,000 last year
on Carnival games alone.

376
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,120
Oh, ha ha ha laugh it up,
it's a disease. All right?

377
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,040
It's a disease.

378
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,880
But she's with me. I mean,
yeah, 'cause you know...

379
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,400
bitches be crazy. Am I right?

380
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,520
Am I right?
Bitches be crazy.

381
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,920
I mean, bitches be crazy.

382
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,840
Bitches be crazy.

383
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,080
Bitches be crazy.

384
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
That's real though, bitches be crazy,

385
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,160
I mean they do live in
a society that expects them

386
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,880
to have both family and a career,

387
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,720
because if they only have a career
and they don't have a family,

388
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,440
and then just a lonely careerist woman
and they only have a family

389
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,440
they're considered a housewife
which is some sort of failure

390
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,360
because they
don't have a career.

391
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,880
Shit, if that was my situation
I'd be crazy too, alright?

392
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,280
Yeah. Bitches be crazy.

393
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,840
Ever sneard of it? Hmm?
Ever sneard of it?

394
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,480
Do you know what that is?
Ever sneard of it?

395
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,400
That's when you smell
something a nerd heard.

396
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,960
Ever sneard of it.

397
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Like if you're in your
living room, you know,

398
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,600
and uh you're with your friend and
he does computer programming

399
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,600
but it's kind of as a hobby,
so that's pretty nerdy

400
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,680
and he's just like, "Wait a second,
I heard a crash in the kitchen."

401
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,400
And you're like...

402
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,160
smells like chrysanthemums.
Must have been the flower vase.

403
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,280
"I sneard of it."

404
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,760
I wish I hadn't done that joke.

405
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,640
Not pleased.

406
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,960
Well, that's the real litmus test

407
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,880
for how the more
absurd stuff is going to go

408
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,080
and I'll tell you,
I am not confident.

409
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,840
I'll stop wasting your time
with that sneard of it stuff.

410
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,000
Time again being a very
important commodity,

411
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,960
incredibly important.
I mentioned that earlier.

412
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,280
Time in a post religious,
post meaning society,

413
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,880
it's the closest thing
we have to a deity.

414
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,360
That's true because it's
the only thing that's omniscient,

415
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,440
omnipresent and omnipotent.

416
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,160
It's omniscient because everything
that happens, happens within time,

417
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,120
so it must know about it. Also
that expression "Only time will tell",

418
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
that means that time
knows something and it's

419
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,160
not telling you until later.

420
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,840
It's omnipresent because sooner
or later you realize that

421
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,160
the very infrastructure of our language
is infected with temporal terms,

422
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,200
even right now I'm talking
in terms of time

423
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,360
so we can't even communicate
without, you won't,

424
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,560
you may not realize it now,
but years from now

425
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,040
you're going to look back and be like,
"I didn't realize it at the time but"

426
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,240
"he was right
about the time thing."

427
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,920
And then it's omnipotent because
eventually it will vanquish us all,

428
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,840
but that brings us back to death.

429
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,840
We don't talk about,
we don't talk about death

430
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,080
in our society
because it's morbid, right?

431
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,920
That's the only adjective we have for
talking about death. Morbid.

432
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,760
That's never
a positive adjective, right?

433
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,920
It's a negative connotation we have
talking about death.

434
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,360
You know, you never compliment
somebody with the word morbid.

435
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,320
You'll never be like,
"Hey, Steve, sorry,"

436
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,400
"I know you're going home for the
weekend, I just want to tell you,"

437
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,120
"you were
super morbid all week."

438
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,600
"Thank you so much.
Always talking about death,"

439
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,040
"the ephemeral nature of your existence,
we have to reevaluate our values,"

440
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,320
"look, I, just do
me a favor, next week"

441
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,160
"keep it morbid. Alright?"

442
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,320
"Have fun with your family, I hope
they don't die. Just kidding,"

443
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,520
"but think about it, you piece of shit."

444
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,920
Talk about death with
our friends or our family.

445
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Uh, we should. We don't talk
it about with strangers.

446
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,240
We'll talk about weather
with strangers.

447
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,800
That's always interesting to me. We
have nothing to do with the weather,

448
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,640
and people always talking about it.
"Summer's coming up. Yeah?"

449
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,840
"It's going to be pretty hot
next month I heard. You know?"

450
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,960
"Win- winter's coming up.
Ooh, fall's right around the corner."

451
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,520
"Summer vacation's coming up.
Hey, guess what else?"

452
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,760
"Death is, death's coming up."

453
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,880
Yeah, death.
But you could never.

454
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Can't talk to somebody
you don't know about it.

455
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,120
You never get, you couldn't
get on an elevator. I've tried,

456
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,320
you know what I mean? Just...

457
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,920
"Hot one, huh? Yeah."

458
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,120
"Not as hot as last week
though, huh? No."

459
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,960
"Tell you if I had to go, I'd
rather go this week, you know."

460
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
"No, not go anywhere,
not go somewhere,"

461
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,480
"go like,
go no go nowhere."

462
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,640
"You see, on that one
I took the sleeping pills"

463
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,760
"and then I decomposed?
I died and then decomposed."

464
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,920
"Oh, no, you don't have
to press a button for me, I'm"

465
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,840
"just along for the ride."

466
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,400
Talk briefly about, suicide.

467
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,200
Suicide, also, we don't talk
about it. Negative connotations.

468
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,880
People who are suicidal
feel ashamed.

469
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,720
They feel like
they shouldn't talk about,

470
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,320
it's, they feel vulnerable,
they're at the end of their line.

471
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,200
And I had a great friend
who died a year ago today.

472
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,040
And I like to talk about him
on stage, his name was

473
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Gleep Glarp the Gobblesnarf.

474
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,760
And... You know what? Hey,

475
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,760
it's suicide, it's an uncomfortable
subject, we can laugh, alright?

476
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,360
Gleep and I went to college and,

477
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,520
you know, obviously Gleep
Glarp the Gobblesnarf,

478
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,760
he came from a wealthy family,
the Gobblesnarfs.

479
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,080
Who made
a fortune gobbling snarf.

480
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
We all know what snarfing is,
it's when you sneeze and barf

481
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,440
at the same time.

482
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,520
So they made
a living gobbling that.

483
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,600
I mean, that is disgusting.
It's like the Koch brothers,

484
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,600
it's just deplorable.
It's disgusting.

485
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,920
It's despicable.
Right? It's despicable.

486
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,240
It is despicable!

487
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,000
But, you know, Gleep didn't want to
follow in the footsteps of his family.

488
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,440
So, after college, and he
was always a bit depressive.

489
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,520
After college he
started his own business,

490
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,040
and he tried to switch it up
he started snarfing gobbles.

491
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,000
You know, which is
much less disgusting,

492
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,640
you just have to go in the little turkey
fields and wait near their beaks

493
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,840
and when they... you
just snarf it up, you know.

494
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,560
Much less disgusting.
It's basically inhaling audio.

495
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,280
It's not gross at all.

496
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,440
But, you know, that didn't work out.
This economy. This fucking city.

497
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,600
And he got depressed,

498
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,520
and he started
getting sick on purpose,

499
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,960
drinking all the time.
And I said to him,

500
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,920
"Gleep, reach out to me, you
know, you're depressed,"

501
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,520
"talk to me, call me. You're
getting sick all the time."

502
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
"Use me as a resource."

503
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,520
During flu season he touched
his tongue to a toilet seat.

504
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,880
Yeah, that's what butts are for,
you know what I mean?

505
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,560
I don't think that's...

506
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,280
But sure enough, he got
really really sick one night

507
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,800
and he got so drunk, he passed out,

508
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,200
on his back, on purpose,
face up. And,

509
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,000
he, sure enough he,

510
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,080
he snarfed in his sleep.

511
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,640
And because no one was there
and he was face up, he,

512
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
well, he gobbled his own snarf.

513
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,120
So he choked on his own sneeze barf.

514
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,720
And I want to tell you something,
some of you laughed

515
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,720
at his, at his last name,
at what his family did.

516
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,880
That was the thing about Gleep,
he would never

517
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,920
ever make fun of you because of
your family, where you're from,

518
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,840
who you are. Because
I come from a family

519
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,840
of burp farmers. You know that?

520
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,600
I come from a family of burp farmers,

521
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,480
and I think that farming is the backbone

522
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,200
of this United States of America.
Alright?

523
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,400
And I'm proud to be from
a family of burp farmers.

524
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,640
I even keep a little burp farm
in our backyard.

525
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,080
Kate and I, and how do I put this?

526
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,040
This year's harvest
came in pretty good.

527
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,880
And here's a little burp
I like to call beeps.

528
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,520
Beeps.

529
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,160
We got to talk about
yet another reason

530
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,000
that I do not give a fuck.

531
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,960
And that is,
that morality is relative,

532
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,000
is what I'm going to tell you
right now. Your values,

533
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,640
what you think is good
and bad depends wholly on

534
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,400
where you were born,
where you're from,

535
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,640
what time period you were born in.
Two thousand years ago,

536
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,000
you know, people would come
up to each other and be like,

537
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,960
"Hey, I just wanted to tell you,
when the eclipse happened yesterday"

538
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,880
"during the day
and dark eye covered the sun,"

539
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,840
"thank you for sacrificing"

540
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,880
"and, you know, killing your
entire family and eating them."

541
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
"That was really good of you.
You're a good person,"

542
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,160
"and we baked this,
we made this,"

543
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,080
"this just a rock that we found,
we want to give it to you."

544
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,040
"We thought it looked cool.
We want to give it to you."

545
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,200
Thousands of years from
now people will look back,

546
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,840
they won't even be able
to believe our values.

547
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,160
Barely a hundred years ago,

548
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,880
you know,
or two hundred years ago,

549
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,040
slavery was A okay.

550
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,120
Somebody would be like, "I'm doing
pretty good. Business is good,"

551
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,320
"I think I'm going to buy
a couple more people."

552
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,440
Doesn't that sound crazy now?

553
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,280
Thousands of years from now,
people will look back they'll be like,

554
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,200
"I can't believe they ate animals
when they didn't need to."

555
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,360
They just sent them to
concentration camps

556
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,760
and, I mean, don't get me wrong,
I had a bacon cheeseburger

557
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,920
earlier today
and then, later on,

558
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,120
another bacon cheeseburger.

559
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,480
Because the piggy taste good
on the cow cow, alright?

560
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,120
You can quote me on that.

561
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,720
Also, something
that you take for granted,

562
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,480
but if you think of it this way.

563
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,240
Pets are actually friend slaves.

564
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,080
That's a hard one to hear,
isn't it? You know, there's...

565
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,040
It's a tough one. Because
there's a lot of people in here

566
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,720
that don't want to hear that.

567
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,920
I mean, they're going
to go home after the show

568
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,960
and, you know, they're going
to greet their dog, he's like...

569
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,080
And you're going to be like,
"See TJ was wrong. Look at you,"

570
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,000
you love me." But you
can't communicate with that dog,

571
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,720
they might be like...
"Is this the day that I'm free?"

572
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,880
"Sometimes I shit and you
pick it up with your hands,"

573
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,400
"other times you yell at me!"

574
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,400
Friend slaves. Man, I was walking,
I was on the phone with Kate,

575
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,160
and I was walking
alongside a graveyard ironically.

576
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,320
And, there was this little doggy,
this little Chihuahua,

577
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,680
that was running away from
me, but it had a tag on.

578
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,520
So, it looked like a lost dog,
wasn't an owner.

579
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,160
Sorry, a master.
There wasn't a master around.

580
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,080
And, I told Kate and Kate's
like, "You got to go get it,"

581
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,520
"go get the dog."
So I go after it, it's like...

582
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,320
So I don't know what's going
with that dog. It might be like,

583
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,240
"Get away from me, I finally
escaped from the prison."

584
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,080
He was talking to its dog
friends earlier and was like,

585
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,280
"I found a weak, I found
a weak spot in the fence."

586
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,200
"I dug a bunch of dirt over there,
I'm going to jump the fence."

587
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,760
"Tomorrow during the day
once they go away"

588
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,160
"to wherever it is
they're gone for eight hours"

589
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
"and then we're just
in the prison being like,"

590
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,800
"are they coming back or is this
the day that I starve to death here?"

591
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,520
"If I reach freedom, I'll
come back for each of you."

592
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,600
"Triffany, wait for me."
Triffany's a poodle.

593
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,280
"Triffany, will you wait for me?"

594
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,920
And then Kate goes, "Alright,
you got to bend down, okay?"

595
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,920
"And pretend
like you have food."

596
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,320
How fucked up is that?

597
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,440
This poor dog is like,
"I'm so hungry."

598
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,880
I'm like, "Hey I have food. Hey,"

599
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,680
"here you go, food. Food."

600
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,080
And the dog's like, "Are you one of
the good ones? I'm so hungry."

601
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,720
And then it comes back,
and I'm like, "Yeah!"

602
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,040
Back to prison we go.

603
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,640
And I return it to its master,
and the master is like,

604
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,600
"You know, I'd love to offer you
a reward." And I'm like, "No, no."

605
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,240
"I just ask if
one of my slaves escaped,"

606
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,480
"that you'd do the same."

607
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,120
The number six reason
I don't give a fuck,

608
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
I won't even inherit it
to my American list.

609
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
The number seven reason...

610
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,480
I don't give a fuck is I will buy
a battle axe in Philadelphia,

611
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,800
at an establishment called
Asian Treasures.

612
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,920
Hello! You think I'm fucking?

613
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,280
You see that?

614
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,840
That's a... You want to hold this?
Come on, get up here.

615
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,880
You got to take it, thought, and then
you got to turn to the audience

616
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,880
and just scream your
biggest battle cry, okay?

617
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,280
And... What do you think?
That's a real balance.

618
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,960
Yeah!

619
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,560
Wow!

620
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,000
It's got some weight
to it, right? Yeah.

621
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,840
Wow, that was... You went
above and beyond.

622
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,400
That was, that was fantastic.

623
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,320
I mean, he really made an effort
to cover the entire room.

624
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,960
That was important.

625
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,920
That was an important and wonderful
thing that he did, he was like...

626
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,520
"Yeah! Yeah!"

627
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,480
"Yeah!"

628
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,080
"Yeah!"

629
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,280
I bought this in a place
called Asian Treasures.

630
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,040
When Kate and I went in there,
we thought it was going to be

631
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,040
a very different type of establishment.

632
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,920
So, you go in there, it sells kimonos
and like travel chess

633
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,680
and swords, it sells swords,
I don't know if you've

634
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,440
ever been to a place, and

635
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,960
she immediately thought
I wanted a sword, I guess I

636
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,040
looked at the swords for too long,
and she started trying to sell me,

637
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,960
she's like, "Oh, no, this for
a good price. Very good price."

638
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,240
"Blue steel, carbon fiber, handle,
very good price."

639
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,000
"Good price. You like scabbard?
Good price."

640
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,200
"You like a battle axe?
Good price, this good price."

641
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,320
"Battle axe, good price."
And I was like,

642
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,640
"Compared to what?"

643
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,000
I wasn't price checking
on Amazon before I came.

644
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,880
And I'm like, "A hundred dollars for
a battle axe? I don't know,

645
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,840
"that's a little steep." So
I talked her down to ninety five.

646
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Because it does, it has a skull
in the middle and its hand painted.

647
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,640
But, you know, I had to ask Kate
if I could buy the battle axe.

648
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,000
So I said, "Kate, can I please have
this battle axe for the bus?"

649
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,640
"I mean, it'll be so awesome
if I have a battle axe."

650
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,360
The bus battle axe. We'll get off
at each city and I'll be like,

651
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,200
"Ah!" Now
I'm going to be like, "Ah, ah,"

652
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,680
"ah, ah, ah..."

653
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,360
Then I go, and she goes, "You want
to buy a battle axe for the bus?"

654
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,520
"That's what you want to do?
You want to have a double headed"

655
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,280
- "axe on a moving vehicle."
- Hell, yeah!

656
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,600
That's what I said, "Hell, yeah."

657
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,680
And she said, "No. You can't
have a battle axe on the bus,"

658
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,800
"you're going to cut yourself."
And I was like, "Please."

659
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,720
But then I saw it, see it has these sort
of plastic sheaths on either side.

660
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,400
Can you guys see that?

661
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,640
And so I said, "Well, what if I
keep the sheaths on?"

662
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,160
"Then it won't
hurt anybody, right?"

663
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,160
She was like, "Are you going
to super glue them on?"

664
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,880
And I was like, "Uh. hmm."

665
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Well, fellas,
guess what I didn't do.

666
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,280
So, I took them off
and I was practicing

667
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,280
in my room, on the bus.

668
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,920
And I cut myself.

669
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,040
And who walks in immediately?
She walks in,

670
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,800
she sees me holding a battle axe,
blood coming down my other hand.

671
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,520
This is not a knife,
this is a,

672
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,560
this is a battle axe.

673
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,360
This is an axe specifically designed,

674
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,040
to cut and to kill.

675
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,240
So, I'm bleeding, it's dripping
down my hand. She goes,

676
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,560
"What's happening?
What just happened? Did you,"

677
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,400
"did you cut yourself with
the battle axe?"

678
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,520
I was like, "Mm mm."

679
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,640
And she was like, "Give me the
battle axe." And I was like,

680
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,320
"Mm mm."

681
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,080
She's like, "TJ, give me
the battle axe now,"

682
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,320
"you did not superglue
those things on."

683
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,680
"Give it to me and I'm
going to super glue them on,"

684
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,000
"and then you can have
your battle axe back."

685
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,560
And I went...

686
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,360
And so she
super glued them on.

687
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,800
I took it to a Subway,
"Can I have banana peppers?"

688
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,760
"Banana peppers.
Provolone, provolone. Prop,"

689
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,720
"the provolone."

690
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,640
"Yeah, I'll have jalapenos,
can I also have jalapenos?"

691
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
"No, no, not olives, not olives. Jala,"

692
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,280
"no, in the front.
The front most bin,"

693
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,280
"no, jalapeno, not, not olives!"

694
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,880
So I'm going to tell this
story really quickly.

695
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,280
Kate and I were working
at the Mall of America,

696
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,480
which is a gigantic mall in Minnesota.

697
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
We were both walking,

698
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,680
because we couldn't get through
the Mall of America,

699
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,280
it was too late, we
were partying on the bus,

700
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,920
it was like
three thirty in the morning.

701
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,080
And we couldn't through the mall
to the hotel, so I was like,

702
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,360
"Let's just walk around it."
And, Kate was really cold

703
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,120
because she was
wearing spaghetti straps.

704
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,200
Mama mia, these spaghetti
straps make you so cold.

705
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,400
They make you so cold.

706
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,160
So I said, "Look, you're
cold, you should,"

707
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,240
"why don't you take my shirt?"
Because I wasn't wearing this,

708
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,280
I just had a shirt. And she's like,
"No, then you're going to be cold."

709
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,800
I was like, "Hey hey hey,
chivalry isn't dead, alright?"

710
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,600
"Will you take my shirt?"
And she goes, "Okay."

711
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,720
So she puts on my shirt and
we keep walking. And now,

712
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,280
I'm shirtless with a battle axe.

713
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,800
So we got this
little girl kind of walking

714
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,560
with a shirt over her
and a shirtless man

715
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,600
with a toddler body,

716
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,840
just walking with a battle axe.

717
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,920
And I swear to God
I turned to her, I'm like,

718
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,120
"I mean,
how funny must we look?"

719
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,760
"Woop! woop!"

720
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,000
We turn around,

721
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,720
there's a cop,
there's a police officer

722
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,400
standing outside his car,
he's like,

723
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,400
"Sir, drop the battle axe
and approach the vehicle."

724
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,920
He called it a battle axe.

725
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,320
So I drop the battle axe.

726
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,800
Because I'm not afraid of
anything. And I walk over to him.

727
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,120
He goes, "You want to explain
what's happening here?" I was like,

728
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,960
"I'm a comedian, the battle axe
is a prop in my act"

729
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:33,280
"and I took off my shirt to give to my
wife because she was cold."

730
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,920
And he says, "Kate,
can you come over here?"

731
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,400
And she goes, "Alright." He goes,
"You want to explain"

732
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,280
"what's going on here?" I love that.
That he thought I might be lying,

733
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,880
like this is the strangest
hostage situation that's ever been.

734
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,440
I just found her
at a club and I was like,

735
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,920
"You're coming with me!"

736
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,360
"To the funeral pyre!"

737
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,120
And so she said, "You know,
this is my husband, he,"

738
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,000
"you know, he gave me,
he's a comedian,"

739
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,840
"he's kind of a prop comic, it's
really embarrassing actually."

740
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,600
"But he's a real gentleman, he gave me
his shirt so that I wouldn't be cold."

741
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,640
"So, he's a great husband."

742
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,000
And, the guys goes,
"Okay, I need to see ID."

743
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,120
And then he went and he ran
our ID's, I don't know what for,

744
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,720
perhaps to see
if I had any previous

745
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,320
medieval armor offenses.

746
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,440
"So I understand you got caught with a,"

747
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,680
"a jousting lance in Michigan,
is that true?"

748
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,120
"In Lansing, no less?
That's ironic."

749
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,560
And I, he gives us our ID's
back and he goes,

750
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,880
"So, this gentleman
is in fact your husband?"

751
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,560
And I laughed out loud.

752
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,880
Guys, I laughed right
in his face and he's like,

753
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,800
"What's so funny?" I was like,
"Do realize what you just asked?"

754
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,920
"Okay, you literally were
just like, so,"

755
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,640
"you did in fact, this was, this
was the decision right here."

756
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,800
Shirtless with a battle axe, this is
till death do you part? Death?

757
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,040
So the police officer says, "Alright,
well, where you guys headed?"

758
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,640
I was like, "We're going back
to the hotel." And he said,

759
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,600
"Listen, I'll give you
a ride back to the Radisson."

760
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,800
Which is the definition
of white privilege.

761
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,120
So he gives us a ride
back to the Radisson,

762
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,920
and the battle axe is the, the trunk,

763
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,440
because I guess he thought if he gave it
to me in the back seat I would be like,

764
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,240
And, so we get
to the hotel and I'm like,

765
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,960
"Oh, no, he's going to
confiscate the battle axe."

766
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,520
"Right? He's going to take it."
So, I run back to the trunk,

767
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,040
I go, "So, can I have the battle
axe back?" And he goes,

768
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,400
"You know, you're walking around
with a battle axe that was"

769
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,600
"you know, that was the
first problem, and then"

770
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,440
"you were shirtless, I just.
You know,"

771
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,440
"it's a double headed battle axe. I
just, I think we got to confiscate it."

772
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,320
I was like, "No no, but here's
the thing. It's just a prop"

773
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,640
"and you can tell because, see
the sides are these plastic sheaths,"

774
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,680
"on either side. So you can't
hurt anybody with it. See?"

775
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,840
And he goes, "Okay."

776
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,800
How cool are the Minnesota police?

777
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,200
So I was so excited.

778
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,960
So I run back in to the lobby

779
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,560
to tell Kate, you know,
and Kate goes,

780
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,400
"Did they let you keep the
battle axe?" I was like, "Mm hmm."

781
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
And she goes, "Why?"

782
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,240
And I just go...

783
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,360
The number eight reason
I don't give a fuck.

784
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,480
I'll tell a Derek's parents
to go fuck themselves.

785
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,400
We got any Dereks here tonight?

786
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,680
We got any Dereks here? Hmm?

787
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,840
- Derek!
- You're Derek?

788
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,920
Well, howdy do.

789
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,200
Looky what we got here.

790
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,600
It's just like a Derek's friend
to out him for being a Derek.

791
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,120
This guy
immediately was like...

792
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,600
Come on stage.

793
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,720
Come on up here. Come on, Derek.

794
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,600
Yeah!

795
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,160
Yes!

796
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,960
These fucking Dereks.

797
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,040
That's a tough thing to try
and get you up here. Whoa!

798
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,240
You're awful
quick for a Derek.

799
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,840
Alright, show me your papers.

800
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,440
- Show me your ID.
- ID?

801
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
Show me your,
yeah, show me some ID.

802
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,400
What is that?
A Qdoba card?

803
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,320
I mean,
that is so Derek of you.

804
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,120
- How much is on it?
- Zero.

805
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,960
Look at Derek
getting those deals.

806
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,600
Oh, we do.
We got a Derek.

807
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,600
D-E-R-E-K.

808
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,600
You're not fucking around
with that I-C-K stuff, huh?

809
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,960
No double R's for this Derek.

810
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,720
Alright, let me see your phone.

811
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,760
Call your...

812
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,400
look at this Derek at night
in open toe footwear, I mean.

813
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,720
What the fuck is going on balcony?
You see what I'm talking about exactly.

814
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,080
I mean, these fucking Dereks.

815
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,400
I swear to God,
some of these fucking Dereks.

816
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,840
They're ruining the country,
these Derek's are.

817
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,480
Not you, you've
been great sport so far.

818
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,200
Go ahead and call your parents
and put it on speaker phone.

819
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,720
"Hello."

820
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,760
- Hello.
- "Hello?"

821
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,880
Hi, is... are are you
the mother of a Derek?

822
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,120
- "Yes."
- Yes.

823
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,400
So that that's the
name you went with, Derek?

824
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,840
My name is TJ Miller,
I'm the star of Yogi Bear 3D.

825
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,760
Thank you.

826
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,480
And, as you can tell,

827
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,120
we are here at a live show
at The Paramount Theater.

828
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,000
- Your Derek...
- "Okay."

829
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,920
- What's that?
- "What did you say?"

830
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,200
I said, I said, we're at a live show
here at The Paramount Theater.

831
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,040
- And,
- "Yes."

832
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,000
And, and, your Derek was
brave enough to come on stage

833
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,920
and people really appreciate that.
I think, let's give him

834
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,760
another round of applause.

835
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,040
So as you can see
your Derek is one of the

836
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,880
most well liked Derek's
I've ever come across.

837
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,560
But, Miss, unfortunately now
I'm going to have to tell you,

838
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,440
to go fuck yourself.

839
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,520
Thank you.
Give it up for Derek!

840
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,240
So I had an AVM in 2010,

841
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,560
that's an arteriovenous malformation.
It's a congenital disorder,

842
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,120
that is a malformed area in your
brain which you don't use,

843
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:06,920
but it's subject to hemorrhaging.
And, that indeed occurred,

844
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,680
during Yogi Bear 3D in fact.

845
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,160
My brain hemorrhaged and
I started literally going crazy,

846
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,720
because there was more blood
in that area of my brain.

847
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,680
I started narrating my own
behavior, I was obsessed

848
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,640
with entanglement puzzles,
it was a bad scene.

849
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,640
I'm going to talk
to these fake bears

850
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,000
in the forest in New Zealand.
They're not even there,

851
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,200
it's just Booboo's two
ping pong balls on a stick.

852
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,960
And there's this weird guy like,
"Alright, talk to the fake bear."

853
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,280
And I am going insane.

854
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,400
Literally. And,

855
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,840
so I have a neurologist. His,

856
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,560
yeah, hey, neurology.

857
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,520
Yeah. So I have
a neurologist, Dr. Stokel.

858
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,880
He's a very famous
neurologist internationally.

859
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,560
He works at
Cedars-Sinai in California.

860
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,400
And he's, he's the greatest.

861
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,280
He's pretty cut and dry,
but he's a great neurologist.

862
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,480
And he called me and said,

863
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,760
"Would you..." Yeah,
hey. You know what,

864
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,600
he calls me, didn't
call me that often, so.

865
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,600
You're right. Ow! That's what I said
when I saw his name on the

866
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,000
the phone. I was like, "Whoo whoo!"

867
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,600
So Dr. Stokel says, "You
should come down to the office"

868
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,120
"so we can talk."

869
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,960
Now, I don't know
if you have a neurologist,

870
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,480
that's never a good thing.

871
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,000
You never get down
to the office and he's like,

872
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,120
"Hey, I just wanted to tell you in
person, you have thirty percent"

873
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,320
"more brain capacity
than all other human beings."

874
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,240
"Let's go take shots of tequila. Yeah!"

875
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,600
That doesn't happen.

876
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,440
But I went down there, and he,

877
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,600
he just looked at me
and said, "Hey, TJ,"

878
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,680
"in my experience there's
no easy way to say this"

879
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,400
"so I'm just going to, you know,
cut to the chase and say it."

880
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,080
- "You're going to die."
- No!

881
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,360
And, yeah, that's what
I felt inside, right there.

882
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,200
No!

883
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,200
But I looked in to the eyes
of this man

884
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,600
who's had to say this a lot. He's
probably had to tell a lot of people,

885
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,720
you know, that they're going to die.
And I just felt so bad for him

886
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,920
strangely in that moment,
maybe that's why I'm a comedian.

887
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,680
So I looked back
in to his eyes and I said,

888
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,160
"In my experience
there's no easy way to say this,

889
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,160
"so I'll just cut to the chase."

890
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,560
"You're going to die."

891
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,760
And he goes, "No, I'm not."
And I was like,

892
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,960
"Denial. That's the first stage."

893
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,400
He's like, "No, but I'm saying
you're going to die before me."

894
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,680
"I know I'm, but you're going
to die before me." I was like,

895
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,320
"Bargaining. Second stage.
He was like,

896
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,360
"Stop talking about my death.
We're here to talk about"

897
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,760
"your impending death." And
I was like, "Okay,"

898
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,880
"Anger, third stage."

899
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,520
And I got him through all the stages
until we got to the last stage,

900
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,240
Acceptance. And then after,
you know, I got him to, really,

901
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,280
that stage of acceptance,

902
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,040
I stole his plant.

903
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,760
Now let me explain. I saw,

904
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,120
he had a fern and
I always wanted a fern.

905
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,440
And so, I stole it.
And as I was leaving the room,

906
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,120
and it was too tall
to get through the doorway,

907
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,760
so I had to
kind of bend it down.

908
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,680
Which is an awful thing
to show a man

909
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,080
is to take his plant
and bend it in half,

910
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,320
so that you can get
out the door. And he said,

911
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,960
"What are you doing?" I was like,
"I'm stealing this plant."

912
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,720
And he's like, "Why?" And I was like,
"In lieu of our recent conversation,"

913
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,480
"you tell me."

914
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,480
But I used to love the idea
that one day he'll be like

915
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,760
at a dinner party or something
and someone will say,

916
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,280
"So, you're a neurologist,
you probably have to deliver"

917
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,160
"bad news, you know, sometimes."
He's like, "Yeah,"

918
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,080
"sometimes I have to tell people
they're going to die, yeah."

919
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,680
"Hey, I don't want
to be morbid, but what's the,"

920
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,160
"you know, what's the worst
reaction you've ever had"

921
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,360
"when you had to deliver that
news?" And he's just like,

922
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,000
"One guy took my plant."

923
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,920
Oh, oh. This?

924
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,720
This is Evian facial spray.

925
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,680
You know that? You
ever heard of this? Huh?

926
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,160
Cool teacher,
you ever heard of this?

927
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,000
- You ever seen this?
- Yes.

928
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,840
Yeah, you have? Here,
you sir, come here.

929
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,200
Come on. It's okay.

930
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,200
You know what, actually
now that I see you.

931
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,920
Can you come?

932
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,080
Come on.
Come on up. It's okay.

933
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,640
What I want to do is, listen.
This moisturizes,

934
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,560
refreshes and tones.
It moisturizes because

935
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,040
it's water.
And it refreshes because

936
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,800
it's water.
And, so what I want to do

937
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,680
is I want to spray this on you
and just tell me the first thing

938
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,360
that comes to mind.
Because it feels really great.

939
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,040
And don't try and be funny, just
say the first feeling that you have.

940
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,960
Okay, ready?
Here you go. Come a little closer.

941
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,280
- For real?
- For real. Come closer.

942
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,440
- Refreshing?
- Yeah!

943
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,920
Give it up for her.

944
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,120
She said one of the words
that I said. Give it up for her.

945
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,760
So this is ironically the most
American product on the market.

946
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,360
I know that seems strange,
it's imported water from France

947
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,600
in an aerosol bottle.

948
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,440
Is there anything more
American than that? I mean,

949
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,400
people are dying
in other parts of the world

950
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,240
because they can't get
a cleanly source of drinking water,

951
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,880
and in the
United States we're like,

952
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,320
"Sometimes I like it
on the outside."

953
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,760
"Oh, sure, when I'm thirsty
or parched I'll put it inside."

954
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,400
"But other times it's
like safari jungle day. Yeah!"

955
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,400
But I bought this for that joke,
but then like many things in my life

956
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,040
the comedy began
to bleed in to the reality,

957
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,680
and the reality began
to bleed in to the comedy,

958
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,400
and vice versa,
and also the inverse.

959
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,000
And I started using it in real life.

960
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,240
But I found
one incredible use for it.

961
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,400
Have you ever talked to
someone who's on their phone

962
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,480
the entire conversation?
Do you ever do that?

963
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,600
They just have chosen not to be
connected to the individual

964
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,320
with which they
are physically present.

965
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,960
They're just making you feel
so absolutely unimportant.

966
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,280
She's pointing to this guy.

967
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,560
But here's what you do.
Because you can do this.

968
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,320
These are thirteen dollars
at Sephora.

969
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,160
As soon as he goes into his phone,

970
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,360
as soon as that person goes in
their phone, you just pull this out

971
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,000
and you go...

972
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,440
And then when they look
up from their phone just go...

973
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,960
"We got to get out of here."

974
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,480
"We got to get out of here!"
And we do.

975
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,880
Thank you. Good evening.

976
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,280
