00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,235
Being a teenager,
it can be rough,

I'm not gonna
lie to you.

7
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,590
But if you're a teenager,
and the world doesn't
fit you,

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,914
you're totally hosed!

being a big, awkward teenager

This little Padawan here

Come on, buddy.
I can't see!

Yeah, I'm pretty busy myself.
I'll catch you later.

you throw and I catch.

Not like that.

She slips me a steak here,
some turkey there.

she doesn't even care
when I help myself.

How cute is she?
And she's my biggest fan.

57
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,349
You know, it's important
for them to get exercise
at this age,

58
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,271

for a walk every day.

Then there's
my owner, Phil.

He's a marketing guy for
a local pet food company.

I call him
Doctor No sometimes,

but rules with him.

No barking.
No tackling the mailman.

Look, everybody's
got a weakness.
Sit.

It's my kryptonite.

Hey, Sarah,
where you going?

83
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,155
Stay.

about getting a bath,
except for this!

Come on, Phil!
Not again.

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,671
I like to give Phil
a little exercise, too.

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,752
He's cooped up in
the office all day.
Come on, Phil.

00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,673
That's the spirit!
PHIL: Get back here!

92

Would it kill them to
install a new dog door?

106
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,833
I was two months old
when they got this.

107
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,196

But when you grow up
into this, I get it.
Not pretty.

113

I'd ignore me, too.

Anyway, I try not to
hold things against Phil.

116

After all,
he's only human.

117

That's why I make it
a point to never go
to bed hungry.

This is our shot.

In the big leagues,
they take steroids and
cheat with supermodels.

It's a marketing job
with an organic
pet food company.

Phil's loafer?
No, I'll save it
for dessert.

127
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,199
And that,
I have no idea
what that is.

Aren't we okay
in Kansas?

Well, if this is our shot,
then we should take it.

tell the kids.

all I've learned about
The O. C. is that

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,995
no one has a pet
and Seth, here, is
a total drama queen.

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,516
Absolutely not a purebred.

314
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,794
Really?

315
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,635
I'm sensing a little
English Mastiff.

316

(MUFFLED)
Hey, watch it!

317
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,959
Your guess is
as good as mine.

318
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,031
You don't know your own
best friend, Phil?

319
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,713
Sure. Uh...

320
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,192
I love dogs.

321
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,272
I can tell a lot
about a man by the way
he treats his dog.

322
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,112
That's why I like
working out here.

323
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,953
I can measure, first-hand,
who I'm dealing with.

00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,158
Watch it, Phil.
He can smell your fear.

326
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,869
Plus, you get all this
fresh air for
out-of-the-box thinking.

327
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,278
And, most importantly,
I get to spend time
with my little girl.

328
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,034
Jezebel.

329

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,756
Hello, Cali!

331
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,591
Look at that fur!

332
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,440
Right. Take off your
shoes and let's walk.

333
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,953
You don't wear
shoes out here?

334
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,429
Come on, Phil.
Channel your inner canine.

335
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,558
Get some earth
between your toes.

336
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,748
It's not the earth
I'm worried about.

337
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,039
Stay out of trouble.
Good luck, Phil.

338
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,109
You're gonna need it.

He's definitely Midwest.

I'm gonna say Kansas.

MARMADUKE:
How did you know?

346
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,718
It's a gift.
What's your handle, newbie?

347
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,949
My name's Marmaduke.

348
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,713
Yikes!
Immediately moving on.

Meet the gang.

350

The egghead, here,
is Raisin.

(BRITISH ACCENT)
Marmaduke.

352
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,831
A unique synthesis
of "marma",

353
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,633
the scientific name for
the jumping spider family...

354
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,551
Oh! Oh!
I hate spiders.

355
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,198
...and the Duke
of Marlborough,

And the ultra-confident
Chinese Crested over here
is Giuseppe.

358

Before you ask,
yes, I'm a real dog.
No, I'm not a chew toy.

359
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,755
And I just get a little
nervous sometimes because
we live in California.

360
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,558
This is the land
of the puma!

361
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,790
There are no pumas
in Southern California.

Good to meet you guys.
Hey, you come here a lot?

365
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,636
It's the dog park, man.
It's like high school
for dogs,

366
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,870
which means
there's a few packs
to know about.

367
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,196
First,
you got your jocks.

FEMALE DOG:
Nice catch, Brad.

369
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,836
The only muscle
they don't use
is their brain.

370
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,558
O-M-G, Brad is H-O-T!

371
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,108
MAZIE: They mostly date
Afghans. Who actually
have no brain.

372
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,599
Oh! Frisbee!

373
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,312
Then you got
your drama geeks.

Somebody stop
this thing, man.
I got to get off, bro!

Word to the wise,
avoid the water bowls here.

Oh, come on! Again?

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,112
MARMADUKE: (SIGHS) So far,
I'm not seeing anyone I'd
really fit in with.

383
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,237
Well, if you think you
got the game, you could
roll with our crew.

They're rich,
and they're spoiled

391
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,795
and they act like
their fleas don't bite.
It's ridiculous!

The little land shrimps
are Thunder and Lightning.

393

Dog Vader over there
is the man himself, Bosco.

He doesn't look
that tough.

is Miss Perfect, Jezebel.

And he's super-jealous,

or he'll turn you into...

Well, well. My little

salivating on my girlfriend.

No, no. I remember,
somebody walked by
eating beef jerky.

This is my park,
and these are my rules.

You look at my
girlfriend again,

talking about?

Oh! (LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

777
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,555
Right, right, okay.
No one specific.
That's good.

778
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,472
(SIGHS SADLY) Okay...

779
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,437
Listen up, Barkanova.

780
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,229
If it were me,
I'd want him to take me
to the junkyard.

781
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,956
It's really
romantic there at night.

782
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,153
There'd be a blanket
with some treats spread out,

784
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,592
Yeah, and lots of
great old stuff
to pee on, right?

785
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,600
Oh! You've got
so much to learn.

786
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,116
Here's the deal.
Girls want romance.

You know? Mystery.

788
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,914
Wow.

789
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,395
What?

790
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,630
You know, I never
really noticed before,
but you have really pretty...

Where were we?

have really pretty...

Work to do.

No! Wait, Phil,
no, not now!

Phil, I need this.

Carlos, let me
ask you something.

805
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,671
Is my breath
really that bad?

806
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,239
CARLOS: A tube
of toothpaste
is a good start,

807
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,878
but you're gonna
need more than that.

(EXCLAIMS)
Dude, watch it!

809

a tongue-bath.

Minty breath,
better posture.

never gonna work.

I'm a dog

we get along great.

That's because
you're my hermano.

smell that?

no cat here.

Is this a dog park?
I must be horribly lost.

Oh, yeah,
you must be lost, cat,

is for dogs only.

only be a few dogs.

want me to do?

hurt me, Mister.

be the large nostrils.
