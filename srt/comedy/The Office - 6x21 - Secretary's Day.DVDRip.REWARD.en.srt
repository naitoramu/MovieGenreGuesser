Hey!

166
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,230
(LAUGHS)
Easy.

167
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,002
It's not a birthday,
it's not a goodbye party.

168
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,134
Hey, Pam and I
are gonna go play pool

169
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,678
with one of her friends,
and we need a fourth.

170
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,338
Sucks to be you.

171
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,315
Would you like
to be our fourth?

172
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,215
That would be sublime.

173
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,449
All right.

174
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,720
So, the guy shows me
the deck he's built,

175
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,786
and I'm like, "I'll call this
a deck if it'll make you happy,

176
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,297
"but this is just
a porch without a roof."

DARRYL: It was
ridiculous, man.

179
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,669
It was, like, you could maybe
get two chairs on the thing.

180
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,298
Two lawn chairs.

181
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,801
Hey, Michael.
Yes?

182
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,866
This is my friend Julie.

MICHAEL: Hello. How are you?
Hi.

184
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,511
What is a nice girl like you
hanging out with these bums for?

185
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,607
There you go.

186
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,016
Julie laughs
at everything.

187
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,587
So you work
with Pam and Jim?

188
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,420
Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me,

189
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,120
and if they win,
they are fired.

190
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,992
(CHUCKLING)
I should hope not.

191
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:48,397
(CHUCKLES) No. No. Not really. Not
really. But they better not win.

192
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,863
Hey.
PAM: Hey, Isabel, you made it.

193
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,063
Oh, my goodness!
Of course.

194
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,833
You want to play pool?

195
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,773
I'm gonna do a lap, see
if I know anyone. Okay.

196
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,677
And then they said the most
ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper,

197
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,271
which I do not have
the decency to repeat,

198
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,941
but trust me when
I tell you that it...

199
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,678
Hold that thought.

200
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,380
Well, well, well.

If it isn't Isabel.
Mmm-hmm.

What's a girl like you
doing in a place like this?

204
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,029
A girl like me is why a guy like
you comes to a place like this.

205

Ooh. I love repartee.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

209
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,760
So what do you do?

210
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,397
I am an ESL teacher.

211
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,498
Really?
Yeah.

212
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,338
See, I didn't think
you could teach that.

213
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,878
I thought that was
something you were born with.

214
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,174
What am I thinking
right now?

215
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,409
Are you thinking
that I said ESP?

216
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:42,051
Yes. I feel like
an idiot. Awesome.

217
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,885
I was a little nervous when
Pam told me he was her boss,

218
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,859
but he doesn't act
like a boss at all.

219
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,328
If I had a boss like that,
we'd never get anything done.

220
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,824
So what do you think?

221
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,094
About what?

222
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,464
About Julie?

223
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,764
She seems nice.

224
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,895
Yeah?
Yeah.

225
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,337
So you like her?
Uh, yeah, sure.

226
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,601
So Pam was right.

227
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,699
About what?

Scott is on a date,

friend, changes everything.

you wearing a hat now?

your eggs in the morning?

00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:04,896
Do you want to
just make a run for it?

245
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,131

please. Okay.

Only three tickets.

If we save them up, we can get
more than a sticker this time.

to spend my tickets.

No.

You're off the hook.

But we signed the contract.

327
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,068
It's dissolved.
Don't worry. You're free.

328
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,125
Okay? Okay.
We'll see you later.

329

Wow! Maybe we should tell her
he's not normally like this.

332
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,305
Maybe it should
come from a man.

333
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,782
Maybe it should
come from a note.

334
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,779

You want to pay 400 bucks
to re-felt this table?

00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,325
Yeah! Why don't
you send the bill

don't you just get down?

I'm on a date, right?

Right? We're just having fun.

That's lame.

Yes. Homelessness.

around. I'm sorry.

She can't talk
to us that way.

You guys are stripes,
I think.

You let somebody
talk to you like that,

where does it stop?

359
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,203
It stopped.

Well, I am starting it again!

You embarrassed my friends in

to go back over to the table
and apologize.

Then I am sorry that
I didn't kick you out.

Well, I'm the
manager here, sir.

Well, it just so happens
that I'm a manager, too,

372
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:28,823
and the way I manage people is
that I touch their hearts and souls

with humor, with love and
maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle,

Yes, it is.
I'm writing a book about it.

Really? How much
have you written?

378
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,368
I've written all of it.

Go, go. Just sit down
next to a beautiful woman

to confuse other people.

like it when I do that?

00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,339
(CRYING)

482
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,208
And I spilled my drink and
they wouldn't give me a refill.

483
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,082
Oh, my gosh. Okay, yeah,
we have to get home.

484
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,382
Okay.
Yes!

485
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,650
Halperts, wait up!
What a great night!

486
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,316
Got to hang out
with my peeps.

487
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,917
Sort of did okay
with a new young lady.

488
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,155
Actually you didn't.
Not at all.

489
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,790
I think I did, but I
can't take all the credit.

490
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,824
Some of the credit is due, in
fact, to my good friend Date Mike.

491
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,429
Nice to meet me.

492
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,242
Tell me your story, Hide.

493
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,280
(SPEAKING)
