1
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,063
Be careful. Someone might see.

2
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,922
Be careful. Someone might see.

3
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,648
I'll go see who it is.

4
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm so sorry.

5
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,150
I'm so sorry.

6
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,670
And the other matter?

7
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,006
I mean Della Togashi.

8
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,342
Didn't find him Yet.

9
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,402
No easy task.
After all... it's Della Togashi.

10
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,403
No easy task.
After all... it's Della Togashi.

11
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,030
No easy task.
After all... it's Della Togashi.

12
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,031
The boss said find him,
so find him.

13
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,806
The boss said find him,
so find him.

14
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:24,477
We're after Della Togashi.

15
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:26,520

Please. I'll never do this again.
I promise.

18
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,338
Please. I'll never do this again.
I promise.

19
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,339
Please. I'll never do this again.
I promise.

20
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,365
Please. I'll never do this again.
I promise.

21
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:42,679
He dragged me
kicking and screaming.

22
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:43,680
He dragged me
kicking and screaming.

23
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:45,015
He dragged me
kicking and screaming.

24
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,016
But I didn't dare resist too hard...

25
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,917
But I didn't dare resist too hard...

26
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,107
Can You say this to his face?

27
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,108
Can You say this to his face?

28
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:56,676
Can You say this to his face?

29
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,844
Kurokawa...

30
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,494
Boss...

31
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,560
Boss...

32
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,980
Please accept my sincere apology.

33
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,041
It seems you made the first move.

34
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,042
It seems you made the first move.

35
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,386
It seems you made the first move.

36
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,238
In which case...

37
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,323
You're a dead man.

38
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,491
Just a minute!

39
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:21,867
Whatever...

40
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,388
Things between Mari and I
are not what you think.

41
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,389
Things between Mari and I
are not what you think.

42
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,682
Things between Mari and I
are not what you think.

43
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,082
How long's it been?

44
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,334
How long? Well...

45
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:32,752
How many times?

46
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,047
Please...

47
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,108

50
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,774
Give me a straight answer.
How many times?

51
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:40,946
Or too many to count?

52
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,263
Or too many to count?

53
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:44,574
This was the first time.

54
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:45,808
This was the first time.

55
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:48,769
This week.

56
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:49,996
You wanna know so bad, I'll tell you.

57
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,856
You wanna know so bad, I'll tell you.

58
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:52,916
We did it a bunch.
At his place... at my place...

59
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,917
We did it a bunch.
At his place... at my place...

60
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:54,918
We did it a bunch.
At his place... at my place...

61
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:56,420
We did it a bunch.
At his place... at my place...

62
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,421
In your car, too...

63
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,946
In your car, too...

64
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:02,616
Boss, that's not true.

65
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,094
It was just to get your attention.

66
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,387
It was just to get your attention.

67
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,388
She felt ignored. She still loves you.

68
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,389
She felt ignored. She still loves you.

69
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,933
She felt ignored. She still loves you.

70
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:11,876
You're joking, right?

71
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:12,710
Mari-san.

72
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:13,770
I was fed up of being with him.

73
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:14,771
I was fed up of being with him.

74
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,035
I was fed up of being with him.

75
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:17,339
Watch your words!

76
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,442
I don't care.
If you're Killing us, get on with it.

77
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,443
I don't care.
If you're Killing us, get on with it.

78
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,444
I don't care.
If you're Killing us, get on with it.

79
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,468
I don't care.
If you're Killing us, get on with it.

80
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,596
It's cold.

81
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,656
- It's really damn cold.
- No, it ain't.

82
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,474
- It's really damn cold.
- No, it ain't.

83
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,743
Kurokawa-san, please...
We were buddies, right?

84
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,744
Kurokawa-san, please...
We were buddies, right?

85
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,608
Kurokawa-san, please...
We were buddies, right?

86
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:32,188
Shut the hell up.

87
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,290
Excuse me.
Feet a little lower please.

88
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,291
Excuse me.
Feet a little lower please.

89
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,709
Excuse me.
Feet a little lower please.

90
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,276
I just had my nails done.

91
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:37,985
Please.

92
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:39,068
It took ages.

93
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,172
- But normally...
- “Normally”?

94
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,489
- But normally...
- “Normally”?

95
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,783
Call me when it's set.

96
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:49,514
Damn... if only Della Togashi
were by my side...

97
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:50,515
Damn... if only Della Togashi
were by my side...

98
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,419
Damn... if only Della Togashi
were by my side...

99
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,311
Good old Della would help me.

100
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,836
Good old Della would help me.

101
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,507
You know him?

102
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:02,676
An acquaintance
more than a friend.

103
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,969
For real?

104
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,159
Is this Della Togashi in the photo?

105
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,160
Is this Della Togashi in the photo?

106
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,186
Is this Della Togashi in the photo?

107
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:21,004
Probably... but the focus is awful.

108
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:22,655
Probably... but the focus is awful.

109
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,217
Can you bring him here?

110
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,700
Can you bring him here?

111
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:28,702
Della Togashi?

112
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,222
I'm a big fan.
I've always wanted to meet him.

113
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,223
I'm a big fan.
I've always wanted to meet him.

114
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,224
I'm a big fan.
I've always wanted to meet him.

115
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,225
I'm a big fan.
I've always wanted to meet him.

116
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,125
I'm a big fan.
I've always wanted to meet him.

117
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,687
If you bring him to me,
I'll let you off the hook.

118
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:38,688
If you bring him to me,
I'll let you off the hook.

119
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:39,689
If you bring him to me,
I'll let you off the hook.

120
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:41,673
If you bring him to me,
I'll let you off the hook.

121
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:44,385
No problem, right?

122
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,719
Understood.

123
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,888
You've got 5 days.

124
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:50,575
He's probably busy...
could I have a week?

125
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:51,576
He's probably busy...
could I have a week?

126
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,240
He's probably busy...
could I have a week?

127
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,038
If the boss says 5 days
then 5 days it is.

128
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:56,814
If the boss says 5 days
then 5 days it is.

129
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,400
5 days, then...

130
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:05,739
God, that was scary...

131
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,676
My feet are filthy...

132
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,826
My feet are filthy...

133
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,914
Are you angry?

134
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:14,975
Damn right... after all those lies.

135
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,750
Damn right... after all those lies.

136
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,410
How lucky that you're friends with Della.

137
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,411
How lucky that you're friends with Della.

138
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,412
How lucky that you're friends with Della.

139
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,076
How lucky that you're friends with Della.

140
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,290
Once we hook 'em up,
let's quit this town forever.

141
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,291
Once we hook 'em up,
let's quit this town forever.

142
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,292
Once we hook 'em up,
let's quit this town forever.

143
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,276
Once we hook 'em up,
let's quit this town forever.

144
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:48,782
Who is he, though?

145
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:51,785
Della Togashi...

146
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:54,455
Where do I find him?

147
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,415
I thought he was a friend?

148
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:58,083
Never even met him.

149
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,128
Wait a damn second.

150
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:02,188
If I hadn't said that
we'd be fish food...

151
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:03,964
If I hadn't said that
we'd be fish food...

152
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,591
I don't believe it.

153
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,694
I'll look for him.
Who is he? Some fashion designer?

154
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,695
I'll look for him.
Who is he? Some fashion designer?

155
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,759
I'll look for him.
Who is he? Some fashion designer?

156
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,890
A hit man.

157
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:15,643
A hit man?

158
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,287
The best sniper ever.

159
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,288
The best sniper ever.

160
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,438
The best sniper ever.

161
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,193
I'm okay, everyone.

162
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,027
Mr. Manager...

163
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:26,152
Not a word.

164
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,864
Let me use your shower.

165
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,574
My feet are crispy.

166
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,786
The boss did this?

167
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:34,846
And he threw Mari out.
Get her a hotel room.

168
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,847
And he threw Mari out.
Get her a hotel room.

169
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:36,848
And he threw Mari out.
Get her a hotel room.

170
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:37,849
And he threw Mari out.
Get her a hotel room.

171
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,593
And he threw Mari out.
Get her a hotel room.

172
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,794
A stiff drink for me.

173
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,021
You're lucky to get out alive.

174
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,838
You're lucky to get out alive.

175
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:47,967
It depends on this guy.

176
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,027
I'll be swimming with the fishes
unless I find him in 5 days.

177
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,028
I'll be swimming with the fishes
unless I find him in 5 days.

178
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,029
I'll be swimming with the fishes
unless I find him in 5 days.

179
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,156
I'll be swimming with the fishes
unless I find him in 5 days.

180
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,515
Who is it?

181
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:56,058
Della Togashi.

182
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,060
The hit man?

183
00:07:58,185 --> 00:07:59,353
Is he that famous?

184
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,063
I've heard of him.

185
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,207
I'm the only one who hasn't.
Where's he live?

186
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,208
I'm the only one who hasn't.
Where's he live?

187
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,209
I'm the only one who hasn't.
Where's he live?

188
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,835
I'm the only one who hasn't.
Where's he live?

189
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:06,836
Nobody knows his true identity.
He works alone.

190
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,837
Nobody knows his true identity.
He works alone.

191
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,506
Nobody knows his true identity.
He works alone.

192
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,507
Hence, “The Phantom Assassin”.

193
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,508
Hence, “The Phantom Assassin”.

194
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,242
Hence, “The Phantom Assassin”.

195
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,868
So how do I find him?

196
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,514
If you found him
he'd stop being a phantom.

197
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,515
If you found him
he'd stop being a phantom.

198
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,219
If you found him
he'd stop being a phantom.

199
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,167
It's hopeless.

200
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,567
This was taken in town.

201
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:30,568
This was taken in town.

202
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:31,844
This was taken in town.

203
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,697
That's on this street.

204
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,514
That's on this street.

205
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,937
Go check all the hotels.

206
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,432
You promised to find him, right?
Didn't you?

207
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,433
You promised to find him, right?
Didn't you?

208
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,434
You promised to find him, right?
Didn't you?

209
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,178
You promised to find him, right?
Didn't you?

210
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,271
What the hell do we do?
I'm not going in the damn sea.

211
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,272
What the hell do we do?
I'm not going in the damn sea.

212
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,273
What the hell do we do?
I'm not going in the damn sea.

213
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,899
What the hell do we do?
I'm not going in the damn sea.

214
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,633
I'm in the same boat.

215
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,198
I knew something
like this would happen.

216
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,891
I knew something
like this would happen.

217
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:23,103
I've been so worried.

218
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,414
That Mari is trouble.
Everyone says so.

219
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,273
That Mari is trouble.
Everyone says so.

220
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,358
You should feel sorry for her.

221
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,004
Why her of all people?

222
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,112
Why her of all people?

223
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,051
We've known each other for ages.

224
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,951
We've known each other for ages.

225
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,138
When [ first started working here
she was in the chorus line.

226
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,139
When [ first started working here
she was in the chorus line.

227
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,140
When [ first started working here
she was in the chorus line.

228
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,564
When [ first started working here
she was in the chorus line.

229
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,602
We kept each other's spirits up.

230
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,169
We kept each other's spirits up.

231
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,271
! worked like a madman
and became manager.

232
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:49,856
! worked like a madman
and became manager.

233
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,857
She became the boss's girlfriend.

234
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,633
She became the boss's girlfriend.

235
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,154
I'd rather you didn't
speak unkindly of her.

236
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,155
I'd rather you didn't
speak unkindly of her.

237
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,899
I'd rather you didn't
speak unkindly of her.

238
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,936
It's like something out of a movie.

239
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,872
This place is always like that.

240
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,314
This place is always like that.

241
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:09,441
This view...

242
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,461
That building, the hotel...

243
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,462
That building, the hotel...

244
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,695
That building, the hotel...

245
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,090
doesn't it remind you of a film set?

246
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,554
Doesn't it remind you of a film set?

247
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,967
Now you mention it, yes.

248
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,201
Now you mention it, yes.

249
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:21,304
I feel like I'm in a movie.

250
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:22,996
I feel like I'm in a movie.

251
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:25,600
Gangs, a hit man, cement shoes.

252
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:26,601
Gangs, a hit man, cement shoes.

253
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,865
Gangs, a hit man, cement shoes.

254
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,104
It hardly seems real.

255
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,546
It hardly seems real.

256
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,815
Life in this town is so dramatic.

257
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,816
Life in this town is so dramatic.

258
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,675
Life in this town is so dramatic.

259
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:38,303
If only it were a movie.

260
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:48,706
They're filming a commercial.

261
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,890
They're filming a commercial.

262
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,525
It's common these days.

263
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,212
Not many towns preserve this old look.

264
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,213
Not many towns preserve this old look.

265
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,757
Not many towns preserve this old look.

266
00:10:58,198 --> 00:10:59,616
That's it.

267
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:03,287
You got it, Nat-chan.

268
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,371
What did I get?

269
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:05,431
A movie. That's our salvation.

270
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:06,655
A movie. That's our salvation.

271
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,374
I don't understand.

272
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:08,959
We're saved!

273
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:10,854
A body double is out of the question.

274
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,358
A body double is out of the question.

275
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:13,439
Della Togashi is a matchless Killer.

276
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:14,903
Della Togashi is a matchless Killer.

277
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,942
Nobody has seen his face...
boss included.

278
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,943
Nobody has seen his face...
boss included.

279
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,194
Nobody has seen his face...
boss included.

280
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:19,195
But how to explain
to any actor taking his place?

281
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:20,196
But how to explain
to any actor taking his place?

282
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,698
But how to explain
to any actor taking his place?

283
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,699
I make him think it's a movie.

284
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,700
I make him think it's a movie.

285
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,924
I make him think it's a movie.

286
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,143
What?

287
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,145
From tomorrow, I'm a film director.

288
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,563
Interesting idea.

289
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,733
There's no way it'll work.

290
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:33,793
I once had a part-time job
in a studio.

291
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:35,652
I once had a part-time job
in a studio.

292
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,713
And if the boss knows the guy?
He must watch films occasionally.

293
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,714
And if the boss knows the guy?
He must watch films occasionally.

294
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,507
And if the boss knows the guy?
He must watch films occasionally.

295
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:40,508
I use a lethal-looking
totally disregarded actor.

296
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:41,509
I use a lethal-looking
totally disregarded actor.

297
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,886
I use a lethal-looking
totally disregarded actor.

298
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,161
IF you can find one.

299
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:45,787
As a matter of fact
I already have.

300
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,643
I'm betting everything
on this guy.

301
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,027
I'm betting everything
on this guy.

302
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,898
Picture the twilight
at the end of a clear day.

303
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,899
Picture the twilight
at the end of a clear day.

304
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,763
Picture the twilight
at the end of a clear day.

305
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,027
The sun inches its way down.

306
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,260
The sun inches its way down.

307
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,321
It descends but its dying rays
still illuminate our world.

308
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,322
It descends but its dying rays
still illuminate our world.

309
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,323
It descends but its dying rays
still illuminate our world.

310
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,616
It descends but its dying rays
still illuminate our world.

311
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,433
It sinks further

312
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,577
half hidden by yonder mountains
yet still casting light.

313
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,578
Half hidden by yonder mountains
yet still casting light.

314
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,579
Half hidden by yonder mountains
yet still casting light.

315
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,803
Half hidden by yonder mountains
yet still casting light.

316
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:12,999
At last it is gone from sight

317
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,000
At last it is gone from sight

318
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,001
At last it is gone from sight

319
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,401
At last it is gone from sight

320
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,921
but dark is yet to be upon us.

321
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,321
But dark is yet to be upon us.

I'm sure it is.

476
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:19,746

He used to be with this agency.

482
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,064
Long time no see, buddy.
Come, take a seat.

483
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,065
Long time no see, buddy.
Come, take a seat.

484
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,066

Come, take a seat.

487
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,676
Hello there.

488
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:42,119
Kanto Killer Team, huh?

489
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,895
Kanto Killer Team, huh?

490
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,081
If I'm not mistaken, you played
a hit man, correct?

491
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,105
If I'm not mistaken, you played
a hit man, correct?

492
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,417
The character Della Togashi
is modeled on him.

493
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:49,418

is modeled on him.

494
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:50,836

495
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,153
There's a hit man in it?

496
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:53,881
Legendary assassin Della Togashi,
is the lead role.

497
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:54,882

498

499
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
And the script?

500
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,369
We don't have one.

501
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,579
None?

502
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:01,764
The world-acclaimed Kitano
works like this, too.

503
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,432
The world-acclaimed Kitano
works like this, too.

504
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:04,433
May I ask how many films
you've made?

505
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:06,167
May I ask how many films
you've made?

506
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:07,627
This is my first.

507
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:14,301
Murata-san.

508
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,653
I'm sorry but my client
is incredibly busy.

509
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,554
I'm sorry but my client
is incredibly busy.

510
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:18,614
Won't you just hear me out?

511
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:20,348
Won't you just hear me out?

512
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,934
Hurry.

513
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,477
Get aboard.

514
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,187
Come with me.

515
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,189
I can't do that.

516
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,482
Please.

517
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:31,860
Don't worry about me.

518
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,988
I'm not afraid to die.

519
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,048
What I fear
is living on without honor.

520
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:37,049
What I fear
is living on without honor.

521
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:38,950

522
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,637
We'll be together
next time around.

523
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:42,638
We'll be together
next time around.

524
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:44,022

525
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,540
Nico...

526
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,310
Wanchai... look after Sayoko.

527
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,169
Wanchai... look after Sayoko.

528
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,672
We must hurry.

529
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,657
Quick, the boat's leaving.

530
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:02,849
Quick, the boat's leaving.

531
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:05,685
Sayoko-san...

532
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,793
Farewell.

533
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,034
Nico.

534
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:19,735
Where the hell are you?

535
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,469
Where the hell are you?

536
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:23,430
Makoto Takase is the best.

537
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:25,223
Not that old movie again?

538
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,283
<i>In “Underworld Sidekick”
he's just superb.</i>

539
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:27,910
<i>In “Underworld Sidekick”
he's just superb.</i>

540
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,269
And was never seen again.

541
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,146
Goodbye.

542
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,248
Get your ass back here.

543
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,523
Get your ass back here.

544
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:34,606
Why?

545
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:35,626
There's a new scene in Yubeshi's
latest. They need an actor A.S.A.P.

546
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,627
There's a new scene in Yubeshi's

latest. They need an actor A.S.A.P.

549
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:41,590
It's a no-brainer. Big names...
the kind of mafia story you wanted...

550
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:42,591
It's a no-brainer. Big names...

552
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:45,261
It's a no-brainer. Big names...
the kind of mafia story you wanted...

553
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,327
This is picture.

554
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,430
And... action!

555
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,788
And... action!

556
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,063
I track you down at last.

557
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,064
I track you down at last.

558
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,090
I track you down at last.

559
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,010
Sorry.

560
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,388
Hold the rain.

561
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,765
Get the director.

562
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:23,382
Your performance was fine.
Don't worry.

563
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:25,366
Your performance was fine.
Don't worry.

564
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:30,514
Could you be a little quicker?

565
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:31,831
Could you be a little quicker?

566
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:32,957
I was slow?

567
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,584
Just whip it out.

568
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,376
Understood.

569
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,711
Thank you.

570
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:41,382
Candy.

571
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,778
You're hamming it up.

572
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,844
You're hamming it up.

573
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:46,387
Let me do it my way.

574
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:48,365
Get in with this star
and it's a chance for lots of work.

575
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:49,366
Get in with this star

577
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,631
Get in with this star
and it's a chance for lots of work.

578
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:01,253
Sorry about that.
I'll try it a different way.

579
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:02,963
Sorry about that.
I'll try it a different way.

580
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:04,489
Stick with your instinct.

581
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:05,949
Thank you for that.

582
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,804
Been back to that restaurant?

583
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,496
Been back to that restaurant?

584
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:12,872
Where?

585
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:13,933
Remember... we met once.
I was at the bar...?

586
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:14,934
Remember... we met once.
I was at the bar...?

587
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,718
Remember... we met once.
I was at the bar...?

588
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:18,020
Hey kid, what's the wait?

589
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:19,087
Hey kid, what's the wait?

590
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,338
A quick re-light.

591
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:21,840
Let's get on with it.

592
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,059
Okay, here we do.

593
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,854
Cue the rain.

594
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,856
Cue the rain.

595
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:41,442
All set...

596
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,571
Roll camera, take 2...

597
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,673
And... action!

598
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,781
And... action!

599
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,639
I track you down at last.

600
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,640
I track you down at last.

601
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,748
I track you down at last.

602
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,253
Get the director.

603
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:02,439
Hold the rain.

604
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:03,673
Hold the rain.

605
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,592
He's one of those...

606
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,036
Just wait over here.
I'll call you.

607
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,037
Just wait over here.
I'll call you.

608
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:18,038

609
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:19,772
Just wait over here.
I'll call you.

610
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:23,860
What the hell's up?

611
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:25,236
No idea...

612
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,256
Seems he doesn't like my acting.

613
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,157
Seems he doesn't like my acting.

614
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,491
You try.

615
00:23:31,826 --> 00:23:32,952
Go on.

616
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:36,831
I track you down at last.

617
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,626
Pretty good.

618
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,171
A star is born.

619
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,694
Give me a damn break.

620
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,178
Give me a damn break.

621
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,731
Everything's ready.
A cargo ship is waiting in the harbor.

622
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,732
Everything's ready.
A cargo ship is waiting in the harbor.

623
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,733
Everything's ready.
A cargo ship is waiting in the harbor.

624
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:28,734

625
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,039
Everything's ready.
A cargo ship is waiting in the harbor.

626
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:32,553
Hurry.

627
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,180
Get aboard.

628
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,848
Come with me.

629
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:37,892
I can't do that.

630
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,310
Please.

631
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:41,729
Don't worry about me.

632
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:44,399
I'm not afraid to die.

633
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,085
What I fear
is living on without honor.

634
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,086
What I fear
is living on without honor.

635
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,028
What I fear
is living on without honor.

636
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:51,173
We'll be together
next time around.

637
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:52,991
We'll be together
next time around.

638
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,243
Nico...

639
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,221
Wanchai... look after Sayoko.

640
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,222
Wanchai... look after Sayoko.

641
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,406
Wanchai... look after Sayoko.

642
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,038
You seem miserable.

643
00:25:40,913 --> 00:25:41,890
Naturally, I'm concerned.
He hasn't shot a single movie.

644
00:25:41,914 --> 00:25:42,891
Naturally, I'm concerned.
He hasn't shot a single movie.

645
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:43,892
Naturally, I'm concerned.
He hasn't shot a single movie.

646
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,686
Naturally, I'm concerned.
He hasn't shot a single movie.

647
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,687
Murata-san, you've never
seen my work.

648
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,688
Murata-san, you've never
seen my work.

649
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,148
Murata-san, you've never
seen my work.

650
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,149
But I've seen all of yours.
Doesn't that count for something?

651
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,150
But I've seen all of yours.
Doesn't that count for something?

652
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,818
But I've seen all of yours.
Doesn't that count for something?

653
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,594
Won over by that?

654
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:56,196
He needs me. That's the kind
of job I wanted.

655
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,197
He needs me. That's the kind
of job I wanted.

656
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:58,981
He needs me. That's the kind
of job I wanted.

657
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:00,075
Here's tomorrow's script.

658
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:01,642
Here's tomorrow's script.

659
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:03,370
Della Togashi meets the boss.

660
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:04,771
Della Togashi meets the boss.

661
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,230
And the boss is...?

662
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,541
The gangster who rules the town.

663
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,845
The gangster who rules the town.

664
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:10,777
It's a vital part of the set-up.

665
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,902
Who plays the boss?

666
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:13,505
You won't have heard of him.
He's a new talent.

667
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,257
You won't have heard of him.
He's a new talent.

668
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,258
This is just an outline.

669
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:17,450
This is just an outline.

670
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,785
When do we get the lines?

671
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,620
We create the lines on set.

672
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:23,122
All ad-libbed?

673
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,166
No place for parroted
lines in my movie.

674
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,977
Something's fishy.
It shouldn't be this haphazard.

675
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:27,978
Something's fishy.
It shouldn't be this haphazard.

676
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:29,605
Something's fishy.
It shouldn't be this haphazard.

677
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,606
My mind's made up.
I stake everything on this film.

678
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,630
My mind's made up.
I stake everything on this film.

679
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,959
What's that?

680
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,646
My crew... they're getting ready.

681
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,171
My crew... they're getting ready.

682
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:14,924
Hey, guys!

683
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:26,978
Miki-chan.

684
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,540
Let's get ready. Call the actors.

685
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,541
Let's get ready. Call the actors.

686
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,885
Let's get ready. Call the actors.

687
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,671
Murakoshi-san, Takase-san, this way.

688
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,363
Murakoshi-san, Takase-san, this way.

689
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,409
Makoto Takase-san?

690
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,933
Look what you did!

691
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,000
Look what you did!

692
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,960
It's just a scratch.

693
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:52,020
You weren't looking.

694
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:53,713
You weren't looking.

695
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,521
Here's your key.

696
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,565
And yours...

697
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:13,625
May I have a word?

698
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:15,067
May I have a word?

699
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,111
Sure, this way.

700
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:18,404
I'll just be a second.

701
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:19,464
Show him to his room.

702
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:20,531
Show him to his room.

703
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,458
Hey, buddy.

704
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:32,394
We're short-staffed.
Can you carry your own bag??

705
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:33,395
We're short-staffed.
Can you carry your own bag??

706
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,421
We're short-staffed.
Can you carry your own bag??

707
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,442
Sorry about that.
You're on the 2nd floor.

708
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,106
Sorry about that.
You're on the 2nd floor.

709
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,325
It's not that I'm doubting you...

710
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,576
It's not that I'm doubting you...

711
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,101
Excuse us.

712
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,749
Thanks, my dear.

713
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,024
Thanks, my dear.

714
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:56,543
Take 'em to the sink, Doc'.

715
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:57,544
Take 'em to the sink, Doc'.

716
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:58,778
Take 'em to the sink, Doc'.

717
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,493
Sorry about that.

718
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,349
Being a guest here is hard work.

719
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,653
Being a guest here is hard work.

720
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:27,449
Listen, you've no plot nor script.

721
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:28,450
Listen, you've no plot nor script.

722
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:30,101
Listen, you've no plot nor script.

723
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:31,161
I need something
to put my mind at rest.

724
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:32,162
I need something
to put my mind at rest.

725
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:33,664
I need something
to put my mind at rest.

726
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,665
I'm afraid, you'll have to have faith.

727
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,209
I'm afraid, you'll have to have faith.

728
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:38,126
Murata fully intends to do it.
He's on fire, in fact.

729
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,127
Murata fully intends to do it.
He's on fire, in fact.

730
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:41,231
Murata fully intends to do it.
He's on fire, in fact.

731
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,215
But I'm not like him.

732
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,199
But I'm not like him.

733
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,326
What would you like me to do?

734
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,537
Show me the camera.

735
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,997
The camera?

736
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:56,311
Don't tell me
you don't have one.

737
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:57,670
Don't tell me
you don't have one.

738
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,147
You can make a movie
with no script...

739
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:00,651
You can make a movie
with no script...

740
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:02,550
but without a camera,
it's impossible.

741
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:03,986
Such is my experience.

742
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,678
Such is my experience.

743
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,239
Of course we have a camera.

744
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,597
Of course we have a camera.

745
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,224
Damn, we need a camera.

746
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,267
What are you going to do?

747
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,227
We've no choice.
He demanded to see it.

748
00:30:13,352 --> 00:30:14,329
- Where would one be?
- Let me think.

749
00:30:14,353 --> 00:30:15,855
- Where would one be?
- Let me think.

750
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:18,816
It gets shakier by the minute.

751
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,467
Excuse me. I'm with the gas company.

752
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:28,468
Excuse me. I'm with the gas company.

753
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:29,952
Excuse me. I'm with the gas company.

754
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,013
Who is in charge here?

755
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,538
Who is in charge here?

756
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,208
What is it?

757
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:38,544
Sorry to interrupt your work.

758
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:39,855
But we've had a report
of a gas leak nearby.

759
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,856
But we've had a report
of a gas leak nearby.

760
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,882
But we've had a report
of a gas leak nearby.

761
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:44,008
A gas leak?

762
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:45,968
We're verifying right now.

763
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:49,764
Does it smell?

764
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,891
That would be too late!

765
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:53,869
Move away from the danger.
No-one within 100 feet.

766
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:54,870
Move away from the danger.
No-one within 100 feet.

767
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,871
Move away from the danger.
No-one within 100 feet.

768
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,456
Move away from the danger.
No-one within 100 feet.

769
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,457
Please flee to the nearby park.

770
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,024
Please flee to the nearby park.

771
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:02,234
Hurry, everyone.

772
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,162
It's very last-minute.

773
00:31:13,245 --> 00:31:14,222
Weather's good, so I thought
we'd get Della's arrival in the can.

774
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:15,223
Weather's good, so I thought
we'd get Della's arrival in the can.

775
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:16,975
Weather's good, so I thought
we'd get Della's arrival in the can.

776
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:18,359
- No-one told us.
- I just decided.

777
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:19,085
Here's your wardrobe.

778
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,128
- Make-up?
- No make-up.

779
00:31:21,253 --> 00:31:22,230
I want it as real as possible.

780
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:23,547
I want it as real as possible.

781
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,608
No time to get a location permit,
so we shoot guerilla style.

782
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,609
No time to get a location permit,
so we shoot guerilla style.

783
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,735
No time to get a location permit,
so we shoot guerilla style.

784
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,736
Minimum crew. The bus leaves
in 5 minutes. Thanks.

785
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,737
Minimum crew. The bus leaves
in 5 minutes. Thanks.

786
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,572
Minimum crew. The bus leaves
in 5 minutes. Thanks.

787
00:31:30,596 --> 00:31:32,515
This is too sudden.

788
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:33,575
He needs time mentally
to prepare.

789
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,184
He needs time mentally
to prepare.

790
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:36,602
That's all very well but...

791
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:37,662
I am a professional.
I do what needs to be done.

792
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:39,081
I am a professional.
I do what needs to be done.

793
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,231
Don't say that...

794
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,084
It's a vital scene.
He meets the heroine.

795
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,085
It's a vital scene.
He meets the heroine.

796
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,709
It's a vital scene.
He meets the heroine.

797
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:46,028
Heroine?

798
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:47,130
Mari Takachiho, the boss's gal.

799
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:49,031
Mari Takachiho, the boss's gal.

800
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,342
Eventually, she falls
in love with you.

801
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,886
Eventually, she falls
in love with you.

802
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,201
Is that right?

803
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:54,262
She's ready on set.

804
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:56,038
She's ready on set.

805
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,935
How dare you!
Making an actress wait...

806
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,585
How dare you!
Making an actress wait...

807
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:03,730
Let me change. I'll be right there.

808
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:05,154
Let me change. I'll be right there.

809
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,109
Wait! He's not the real Togashi?

810
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,110
Wait! He's not the real Togashi?

811
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,277
Wait! He's not the real Togashi?

812
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:10,052
Of course not.

813
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,113
The boss will kill you.

814
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,638
The boss will kill you.

815
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,015
I've no choice but to deceive him.

816
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,118
It's never going to work.

817
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,268
It's never going to work.

818
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,520
It's all over.

819
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:21,439
This is where I need your help.

820
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,648
I can't do it.

821
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:23,708
Don't you get it? Our very lives
depend on that actor.

822
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:24,709
Don't you get it? Our very lives
depend on that actor.

823
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:25,710
Don't you get it? Our very lives
depend on that actor.

824
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:27,045
Don't you get it? Our very lives
depend on that actor.

825
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:28,046
If he leaves, it's curtains for us.

826
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,047
If he leaves, it's curtains for us.

827
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:30,471
If he leaves, it's curtains for us.

828
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:34,201
They're here.

829
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,500
'Morning, sir.

830
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,947
Let me put a mic on you.

831
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,431
Let me put a mic on you.

832
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,852
Why the tuxedo?

833
00:33:00,102 --> 00:33:01,079
They always wear tuxedo's, right?
Think of 007.

834
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:03,063
They always wear tuxedo's, right?
Think of 007.

835
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,166
007 is a spy.

836
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,649
007 is a spy.

837
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,461
I stick out like a sore thumb.
An assassin, right?

838
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,462
I stick out like a sore thumb.
An assassin, right?

839
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,713
I stick out like a sore thumb.
An assassin, right?

840
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,714
I've no idea what he's going for.

841
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,058
I've no idea what he's going for.

842
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,844
See? Nice gear we've got, huh?

843
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,703
See? Nice gear we've got, huh?

844
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:20,915
Okay, let's get on with it.

845
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,417
Mari-san, when you're ready.

846
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,131
Is she okay?

847
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,257
Who knows...

848
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,930
Sir, camera's ready.

849
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,157
Murata-san, you walk this way

850
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,183
Murata-san, you walk this way

851
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,243
pass in front of the camera
heading there.

852
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:41,620
Pass in front of the camera
heading there.

853
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,621
Mari-san, you walk up,

854
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,647
Mari-san, you walk up,

855
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,707
then you bump into one another,
drawn by fate.

856
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:47,531
Then you bump into one another,
drawn by fate.

857
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,318
We bump?

858
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:50,694
Sir, we should hurry.

859
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,363
Okay, please try it.

860
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:53,697
Here we go.

861
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,217
Sir, my motivation as I approach?

862
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,426
Sir, my motivation as I approach?

863
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,201
Your what?

864
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:58,702
My circumstance?

865
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,763
Newly arrived in town.
What do you do?

866
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,764
Newly arrived in town.
What do you do?

867
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,268
Newly arrived in town.
What do you do?

868
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,374
Look for a place to stay.

869
00:34:03,457 --> 00:34:04,750
Do that then.

870
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,252
Is that okay?

871
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,920
Whatever. Roll camera.

872
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,838
Let's try it. Relax.

873
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,066
This is picture. Scene 1, take 1.

874
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,591
This is picture. Scene 1, take 1.

875
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,301
What about lighting?

876
00:34:14,426 --> 00:34:15,928
Natural light is best.

877
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,388
Scene 1, take 1.

878
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:19,431
And... action!

879
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:44,957
Excuse me.

880
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:46,309
Is there a hotel near here?

881
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,002
Is there a hotel near here?

882
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:53,316
As I'm new in town.

883
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,317
As I'm new in town.

884
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:55,426
As I'm new in town.

885
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:02,075
Would you show me...

886
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,142
Would you show me...

887
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,769
Perfect. We got it.

888
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,314
Now do you believe me?

889
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,483
Sir, could I try another take?

890
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,527
Why? That was perfect.

891
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:14,987
Sir...

892
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,298
Happy with her performance?

893
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,489
Happy with her performance?

894
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,573
Why not?

895
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:19,634
She seemed kinda awkward to me.

896
00:35:19,658 --> 00:35:21,118
She seemed kinda awkward to me.

897
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:22,828
That's her individuality.

898
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:24,663
Okay, back to the hotel.

899
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,789
On the move!

900
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,850
Back in the bus, everyone.

901
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:27,916
Back in the bus, everyone.

902
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,977
What about my mic?

903
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,252
What about my mic?

904
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:42,473
A gimlet, please.

905
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:50,832
Well done, today. May 1?

906
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:52,524
Well done, today. May 1?

907
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,045
I didn't introduce myself.
I'm Taiki Murata.

908
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,046
I didn't introduce myself.
I'm Taiki Murata.

909
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,047
I didn't introduce myself.
I'm Taiki Murata.

910
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,791
I didn't introduce myself.
I'm Taiki Murata.

911
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,033
I'm Mari Takachiho.

912
00:36:01,867 --> 00:36:03,035
Mari?

913
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,138
Isn't that your character's name?

914
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:06,482
Isn't that your character's name?

915
00:36:07,873 --> 00:36:09,625
Oh, I see...

916
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:10,685
Taking your stage name
from your character.

917
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:11,686
Taking your stage name
from your character.

918
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,687
Taking your stage name
from your character.

919
00:36:12,711 --> 00:36:14,391
Taking your stage name
from your character.

920
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,442
Were you nervous today?

921
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,967
Were you nervous today?

922
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,517
Everyone is, at first.

923
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,161
Best not to worry
about your performance.

924
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,162
Best not to worry
about your performance.

925
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,854
Best not to worry
about your performance.

926
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,915
Just be yourself. Reveal
the real you.

927
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,916
Just be yourself. Reveal
the real you.

928
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,858
Just be yourself. Reveal
the real you.

929
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:36,878
Does that help at all?

930
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:37,879
Does that help at all?

931
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:39,738
Does that help at all?

932
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:41,448
Completely.

933
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,219
Sometimes I think about

934
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,220
Sometimes I think about

935
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,578
Sometimes I think about

936
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,181
how a film set draws
so many people together.

937
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,182
How a film set draws
so many people together.

938
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:50,725
How a film set draws
so many people together.

939
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:51,726
Folk of all ages,
some with money, some without.

940
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,727
Folk of all ages,
some with money, some without.

941
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:53,728
Folk of all ages,
some with money, some without.

942
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:55,632
Folk of all ages,
some with money, some without.

943
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,232
With one goal, pooling talent
sharing the same food...

944
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,233
With one goal, pooling talent
sharing the same food...

945
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,234
With one goal, pooling talent
sharing the same food...

946
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,235
With one goal, pooling talent
sharing the same food...

947
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,379
With one goal, pooling talent
sharing the same food...

948
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:03,446
There's nothing like it.

949
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,013
There's nothing like it.

950
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:06,449
In the end, it's the process I like
more than film itself.

951
00:37:06,473 --> 00:37:07,450
In the end, it's the process I like
more than film itself.

952
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:08,451
In the end, it's the process I like
more than film itself.

953
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:09,577
In the end, it's the process I like
more than film itself.

954
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:11,562
Eisenstein once said...

955
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,747
Tell me next time. Good night.

956
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:14,106
Tell me next time. Good night.

957
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:38,481
The action takes place over there but
the camera's here on the 3rd floor.

958
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:39,482
The action takes place over there but
the camera's here on the 3rd floor.

959
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:40,483
The action takes place over there but
the camera's here on the 3rd floor.

960
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:41,735
The action takes place over there but
the camera's here on the 3rd floor.

961
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,736
So we shoot across the street
through the window.

962
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,737
So we shoot across the street
through the window.

963
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,447
So we shoot across the street
through the window.

964
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,972
All on a long lens?

965
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:48,032
I want the actors to forget the camera.

966
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:49,975
I want the actors to forget the camera.

967
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,077
No crew in the room
so the cast can really focus.

968
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:52,078
No crew in the room
so the cast can really focus.

969
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:54,104
No crew in the room
so the cast can really focus.

970
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,981
Our focus would be fine anyway.

971
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:57,083
I don't want “fine”...
I want your very best.

972
00:37:57,107 --> 00:37:58,084
I don't want “fine”...

I don't want “fine”...
I want your very best.

974
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:03,631
Where will you be?

975
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:04,948
Where will you be?

976
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,009
Next to Murata-san, playing
Della's minder.

977
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,010
Next to Murata-san, playing
Della's minder.

978
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,636
Next to Murata-san, playing
Della's minder.

979
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,661
You act as well?

980
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,764
Murata-san, I remind you again
do not call me “Sir”.

981
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,765
Murata-san, I remind you again
do not call me “Sir”.

982
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,766
Murata-san, I remind you again

983
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,830
Murata-san, I remind you again
do not call me “Sir”.

984
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:17,753
I'm counting on Your best performance.

985
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:18,813
I'll give it a shot.

986
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:20,088
I'll give it a shot.

987
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:23,842
Sir...

988
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,570
I've been on many sets in my time

989
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,914
I've been on many sets in my time

990
00:38:28,263 --> 00:38:29,240
but this is the most thrilling.

991
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:30,241
But this is the most thrilling.

992
00:38:30,265 --> 00:38:31,642
But this is the most thrilling.

993
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,560
Same here.

994
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,360
Don't do anything stupid.

995
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,342
I can see You're risking Your life.

996
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,243
I can see You're risking Your life.

997
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:53,121
I've got no other choice.

998
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:57,018
I'll miss you.

999
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,126
I'll miss you.

1000
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,063
Did you have to say that?

1001
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,338
Did you have to say that?

1002
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,539
Sir, if I could make a suggestion...

1003
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,748
Sir, if I could make a suggestion...

1004
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:19,749

1008
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:24,903
Do nothing unnecessary.

1009
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,090
Like the special way I handle this...

1010
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,949
Like the special way I handle this...

1011
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:32,870
Out of the question!

1012
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,930
I always prepare my own hand props.

1013
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,265
I always prepare my own hand props.

1014

00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,490
This is the last thing I need.

1016
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:41,980

Murata-san, is that make-up
by any chance?

1026
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,481
It's just a little foundation.

1027
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,584
I said not to, didn't I?
Eyeliner, too? Good grief...

Whaddya need with me?

1046
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,127
For starters...

1047
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,354
Do you mind getting off my desk?

1048

Do you mind getting off my desk?

1049
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:02,870

1055
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,088

We know everything.

1062
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,919
You're making no sense.

1063
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,022

1100
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,753

1109
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:50,853
Put the guns down. Quick.

1110
00:43:50,877 --> 00:43:52,337
Put the guns down. Quick.

1111

When did you set this up?

1115
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,123
You didn't tell your director?

1116
00:44:28,206 --> 00:44:29,183
I wanted to show you
what I can do.

1117
00:44:29,207 --> 00:44:30,184
I wanted to show you
what I can do.

1118
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,210
I wanted to show you
what I can do.

1119
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:38,484
Murata-san, that's a wrap for today.
Let's go.

1120
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:39,694
Murata-san, that's a wrap for today.
Let's go.

1121
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,427
Is it my fault?

1122
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,345
Not exactly.

1123
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,347
Wait here.

1124
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:47,017
Boss wants to see him.

1125
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:53,273
Filming restarts.

1126
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:54,500
I'll get it right this time.

1127
00:44:54,524 --> 00:44:55,644
I'll get it right this time.

1128
00:44:58,486 --> 00:44:59,738
Not you.

1129
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:00,947
- But...
- Scram.

1130
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,639
Is it that tasty?

1131
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,325
Indeed, I am Della Togashi.

1132
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,326
Indeed, I am Della Togashi.

1133
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,268
Indeed, I am Della Togashi.

1134
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,771
Whaddya need with me?

1135
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,749
Is it me or did we
just go through this?

1136
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,750
Is it me or did we
just go through this?

1137
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,751
Is it me or did we
just go through this?

1138
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,752
Is it me or did we
just go through this?

1139
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,336
Is it me or did we
just go through this?

1140
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,615
Hand me the gun.

1141
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:55,293
Well spotted.

1142
00:46:01,132 --> 00:46:02,509
It's made of rubber.

1143
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,177
We're going in that direction?

1144
00:46:09,307 --> 00:46:10,284
Young Mr. Togashi...
I want to ask you something.

1145
00:46:10,308 --> 00:46:11,285
Young Mr. Togashi...
I want to ask you something.

1146
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:12,286
Young Mr. Togashi...
I want to ask you something.

1147
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,230
Young Mr. Togashi...
I want to ask you something.

1148
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:15,438
What about?

1149
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:21,128
I'm greatly impressed
by your boundless courage

1150
00:46:21,152 --> 00:46:22,129
I'm greatly impressed
by your boundless courage

1151
00:46:22,153 --> 00:46:23,993
I'm greatly impressed
by your boundless courage

1152
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:25,967
and your varied sense of humor.

1153
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:26,968
And your varied sense of humor.

1154
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:27,969
And your varied sense of humor.

1155
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,286
And your varied sense of humor.

1156
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,638
I like you. Would you join me?

1157
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,639
I like you. Would you join me?

1158
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,956
I like you. Would you join me?

1159
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,280
As my guest,
it would be worth your while.

1160
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,281
As my guest,
it would be worth your while.

1161
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,282
As my guest,
it would be worth your while.

1162
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,283
As my guest,
it would be worth your while.

1163
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,947
As my guest,
it would be worth your while.

1164
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:54,185
Not a bad proposition, I think.

1165
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,856
I must refuse.

1166
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,775
Let me hear why.

1167
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,005
I cannot betray a client.

1168
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,655
I cannot betray a client.

1169
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,550
Trust is everything
in my line of work.

1170
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,094
Trust is everything
in my line of work.

1171
00:47:09,534 --> 00:47:10,511
It would be bad
for future business.

1172
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:11,512
It would be bad
for future business.

1173
00:47:11,536 --> 00:47:12,513
It would be bad
for future business.

1174
00:47:12,537 --> 00:47:13,937
It would be bad
for future business.

1175
00:47:16,624 --> 00:47:18,251
That's a shame.

1176
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:32,891
Come here.

1177
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,684
I'll be right back.

1178
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:40,666
For christ sakes, at that point
you've got to agree to join.

1179
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,126
For christ sakes, at that point
you've got to agree to join.

1180
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,942
But...

1181
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,045
If Della dies, the movie's over.
Surely you get that?

1182
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,046
If Della dies, the movie's over.
Surely you get that?

1183
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,047
If Della dies, the movie's over.
Surely you get that?

1184
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,151
If Della dies, the movie's over.
Surely you get that?

1185
00:47:48,406 --> 00:47:49,383
I didn't think that far ahead.

1186
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:50,384
I didn't think that far ahead.

1187
00:47:50,408 --> 00:47:51,659
I didn't think that far ahead.

1188
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,744
Why does he do that?

1189
00:47:52,827 --> 00:47:53,804
Why? To get in with them.

1190
00:47:53,828 --> 00:47:54,805
Why? To get in with them.

1191
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:56,289
Why? To get in with them.

1192
00:47:56,414 --> 00:47:58,166
Shut up and get on with it.

1193
00:48:01,002 --> 00:48:02,754
Explain something to me.

1194
00:48:03,588 --> 00:48:04,631
What?

1195
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:06,275
This “Cut” business.

1196
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:08,051
This “Cut” business.

1197
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,030
You just yelled “Cut, Cut”.

1198
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,514
You just yelled “Cut, Cut”.

1199
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:14,742
That's Della Togashi's nickname.

1200
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,434
That's Della Togashi's nickname.

1201
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,436
Nickname?

1202
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:19,789
His close friends all call him “Cut”.

1203
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,773
His close friends all call him “Cut”.

1204
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:22,875
After his special throat-slashing
technique.

1205
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:23,876
After his special throat-slashing
technique.

1206
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,620
After his special throat-slashing
technique.

1207
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,171
Boss, you'll be pleased to hear, Cut...

1208
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,172
Boss, you'll be pleased to hear, Cut...

1209
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,756
Boss, you'll be pleased to hear, Cut...

1210
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:31,842
I mean Della Togashi and I
just spoke and he agreed.

1211
00:48:31,866 --> 00:48:32,843
I mean Della Togashi and I
just spoke and he agreed.

1212
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:33,844
I mean Della Togashi and I
just spoke and he agreed.

1213
00:48:33,868 --> 00:48:35,908
I mean Della Togashi and I
just spoke and he agreed.

1214
00:48:37,288 --> 00:48:39,082
How did you persuade him?

1215
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,518
He does whatever I say.

1216
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,918
He does whatever I say.

1217
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:42,836
Why?

1218
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,462
He's like my kid brother.

1219
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,131
Get in here.

1220
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:53,781
Sorry about that.
I hadn't thought it through.

1221
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,782
Sorry about that.
I hadn't thought it through.

1222
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,450
Sorry about that.
I hadn't thought it through.

1223
00:48:56,474 --> 00:48:58,435
Forget about that.

1224
00:48:58,977 --> 00:48:59,811
I'll get it right now.

1225
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,438
Camera's rolling.

1226
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,772
Young Mr. Togashi...

1227
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,105
If you like it that much,
take it.

1228
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,106
If you like it that much,
take it.

1229
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,450
If you like it that much,
take it.

1230
00:49:29,215 --> 00:49:30,192
Indeed, I am Della Togashi.

1231
00:49:30,216 --> 00:49:31,193
Indeed, I am Della Togashi.

1232
00:49:31,217 --> 00:49:32,510

00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:35,847
Back there, are we?

1235
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,515
Go on ahead.

1236
00:49:39,934 --> 00:49:40,911
You'll join forces with me, right?

1237
00:49:40,935 --> 00:49:41,912
You'll join forces with me, right?

1238
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:42,913
You'll join forces with me, right?

1239
00:49:42,937 --> 00:49:44,814
You'll join forces with me, right?

1240
00:49:55,241 --> 00:49:56,218
From this day forth

1244
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:01,974
Kurokawa, drinks...

1245
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,166
Kurokawa, drinks...

1246
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,293
Kiddo...

1247
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,730
You're his minder.

1248
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,297
You're his minder.

1249
00:50:09,714 --> 00:50:11,049
Understood.

1250
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,527

Let's drink an oath, Cut.

1257
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:25,188
Let's drink an oath, Cut.

1258
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,526
Who the hell said “Cut”?

1259
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:34,906
Who was it?

1260
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,054
Who the hell are you

Who the hell are you

1262
00:50:43,122 --> 00:50:43,915

00:50:43,998 --> 00:50:45,583
Whaddya think?

1264
00:50:47,126 --> 00:50:48,103
Goddamn amateur.

1270
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,933
When do we see the footage?

00:51:04,018 --> 00:51:05,418
No rushes. Wait 'til it's finished.

1274
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,645
Tomorrow's scenes?

1275
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:07,665
I'll let you know. Wait in the hotel.

1276
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,666
I'll let you know. Wait in the hotel.

1277
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,170
I'll let you know. Wait in the hotel.

1278
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:17,615
It's terrible.

1279
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,783
You were found out?

1280
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:19,908
The opposite.

1281
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:20,928
Opposite? What on earth's that?

1282
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,137
Opposite? What on earth's that?

1283
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:23,955
We were hired.

1284
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:26,725
But I've got to hand it to the actor.

1285
00:51:26,749 --> 00:51:27,726
But I've got to hand it to the actor.

1286
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,727
But I've got to hand it to the actor.

1287
00:51:28,751 --> 00:51:30,336
But I've got to hand it to the actor.

1288
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,648
When he plays Togashi,
he really becomes a killer.

1289
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,649
When he plays Togashi,
he really becomes a killer.

1290
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:34,650
When he plays Togashi,
he really becomes a killer.

1291
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,634
When he plays Togashi,
he really becomes a killer.

1292
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:37,778
I almost believe it myself.

1293
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:38,886
I almost believe it myself.

1294
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:49,665
Marching in here
with a toy like this...

1295
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,666
Marching in here
with a toy like this...

1296
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,442
Marching in here
with a toy like this...

1297
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,128
That took balls of steel.

1298
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,236
That took balls of steel.

1299
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,552
Hey, it's me. Long time, no see.

1300
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,553
Hey, it's me. Long time, no see.

1301
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:03,554
Hey, it's me. Long time, no see.

1302
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:04,996
Hey, it's me. Long time, no see.

1303
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,307
That Della Togashi of yours
came gunning for me.

1304
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,308
That Della Togashi of yours
came gunning for me.

1305
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,309
That Della Togashi of yours
came gunning for me.

1306
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,310
That Della Togashi of yours
came gunning for me.

1307
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,186
That Della Togashi of yours
came gunning for me.

1308
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:12,187
He's one tough cookie.

1309
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:13,188
He's one tough cookie.

1310
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:15,006
He's one tough cookie.

1311
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,153
So I decided to hire him.

1312
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,154
So I decided to hire him.

1313
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,155
So I decided to hire him.

1314
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,156
So I decided to hire him.

1315
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,723
So I decided to hire him.

1316
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:24,825
From today, I'm telling you
he's with Tessio & Co.

1317
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:25,826
From today, I'm telling you

1320
00:52:27,852 --> 00:52:29,812
From today, I'm telling you
he's with Tessio & Co.

1321
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:43,844
They hired Della Togashi
to their side.

1322
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:44,845
They hired Della Togashi
to their side.

1323

1324
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,390
They hired Della Togashi
to their side.

1325
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:49,892
Seems someone's going around
impersonating you.

1326
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:50,893
Seems someone's going around
impersonating you.

1327
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:51,894

1328
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:52,895

1329
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,837
Seems someone's going around
impersonating you.

1330
00:53:22,573 --> 00:53:23,550
If I have a nightmare,
may it soon pass.

1331
00:53:23,574 --> 00:53:24,551
If I have a nightmare,
may it soon pass.

1332
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:25,552
If I have a nightmare,

1333
00:53:25,576 --> 00:53:26,553
If I have a nightmare,
may it soon pass.

1334
00:53:26,577 --> 00:53:27,554
If I have a nightmare,
may it soon pass.

1335
00:53:27,578 --> 00:53:28,555
If I have a nightmare,
may it soon pass.

1336
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:29,556
If I have a nightmare,
may it soon pass.

1337
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,557
If I have a nightmare,
may it soon pass.

1338
00:53:30,581 --> 00:53:32,141
If I have a nightmare,
may it soon pass.

1339
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,185
If I have a dream,
may I never wake.

1340
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,186
If I have a dream,
may I never wake.

1341
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,187
If I have a dream,
may I never wake.

1342
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,313
If I have a dream,
may I never wake.

1343
00:53:36,337 --> 00:53:37,314
Hey, come back!

1344
00:53:37,338 --> 00:53:38,798
Hey, come back!

1345
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,403
How grand to have men
risk their lives for your sake.

1346
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,404
How grand to have men
risk their lives for your sake.

1347
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,197
How grand to have men
risk their lives for your sake.

1348
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,764
Not just for my sake.

1349
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,825
Why don't you just
stick with the boss?

1350
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,369
Why don't you just
stick with the boss?

1351
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,269
It's complicated.

1352
00:53:57,942 --> 00:53:59,777
Can you lend me some money”?

1353
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:01,821
You're broke?

1354
00:54:04,615 --> 00:54:05,592
Sorry. My policy is not to lend
to those who won't repay.

1355
00:54:05,616 --> 00:54:06,593
Sorry. My policy is not to lend
to those who won't repay.

1356
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:08,857
Sorry. My policy is not to lend
to those who won't repay.

1357
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,040
Ask the boss for some.

1358
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,387
A call from the hotel.

1359
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:30,451
Kurokawa from the boss's office

1360
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,452
Kurokawa from the boss's office

1361
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,727
Kurokawa from the boss's office

1362
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,163
came and took your assassin away.

1363
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,507
Came and took your assassin away.

1364
00:54:44,071 --> 00:54:45,048
It's very sudden.
I was told it's tomorrow.

1365
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:46,049
It's very sudden.
I was told it's tomorrow.

1366
00:54:46,073 --> 00:54:47,909
It's very sudden.
I was told it's tomorrow.

1367
00:54:47,992 --> 00:54:49,035
What?

1368
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,870
The next scene.

1369
00:54:51,078 --> 00:54:52,163
Scene?

1370
00:54:52,246 --> 00:54:53,748
Whatever...

1371
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:55,601
So what's the story?

1372
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,959
So what's the story?

1373
00:54:57,668 --> 00:54:59,170
Come on...

1374
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:01,398
We got this hi-tech weapon
from the Hong Kong mafia.

1375
00:55:01,422 --> 00:55:03,462
We got this hi-tech weapon
from the Hong Kong mafia.

1376
00:55:03,674 --> 00:55:04,651
We're selling it to some guerillas
from Southeast Asia.

1377
00:55:04,675 --> 00:55:05,652
We're selling it to some guerillas
from Southeast Asia.

1378
00:55:05,676 --> 00:55:07,404
We're selling it to some guerillas
from Southeast Asia.

1379
00:55:07,428 --> 00:55:08,405
I see. A common-enough
scenario.

1380
00:55:08,429 --> 00:55:10,306
I see. A common-enough
scenario.

1381
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,352
A state-of-the-art rifle.

1382
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,497
Is it okay for me to be there?
I've only just been hired.

1383
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,498
Is it okay for me to be there?
I've only just been hired.

1384
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,499
Is it okay for me to be there?
I've only just been hired.

1385
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,000
Is it okay for me to be there?
I've only just been hired.

1386
00:55:20,024 --> 00:55:21,567
It's what I wanted.

1387
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:23,295
You? How come?

1388
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:24,296
You? How come?

1389
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,322
You? How come?

1390
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,175
I want to see what you can do.

1391
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,534
I want to see what you can do.

1392
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,513
Is that any business of yours?

1393
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,247
Is that any business of yours?

1394
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,349
Just when I'd turned in for the night.

1395
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,375
Just when I'd turned in for the night.

1396
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:38,435
Not that I mind more chances to act.

1397
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:40,336
Not that I mind more chances to act.

1398
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,350
Sorry.

1399
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:56,787
Move your leg.

1400
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,688
Move your leg.

1401
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:18,498
Want some?

1402
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,419
One's appearance is important.

1403
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,754
If you don't mind...

1404
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,651
Get out.

1405
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:47,838
My agent's on his way with hair tongs.
For my bed-head.

1406
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,839
My agent's on his way with hair tongs.
For my bed-head.

1407
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,840
My agent's on his way with hair tongs.
For my bed-head.

1408
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,592
My agent's on his way with hair tongs.
For my bed-head.

1409
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,593
They'll be here soon.

1410
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,659
They'll be here soon.

1411
00:56:54,118 --> 00:56:55,453
Have them wait.

1412
00:57:03,252 --> 00:57:04,670
Why bring him?

1413
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:06,797
I'm slow to trust anyone.

1414
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:09,300
Is it okay to give him a gun?

1415
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,219
I've taken precautions.

1416
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,140
If he puts a foot wrong

1417
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:19,226
he'll be dead before he knows it.

1418
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:23,123
Did you color your eyebrows?

1419
00:57:23,147 --> 00:57:24,649
Did you color your eyebrows?

1420
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,160
This is damn heavy.

1421
00:57:44,543 --> 00:57:45,520
I don't need this to act
like a suitcase is heavy.

1422
00:57:45,544 --> 00:57:46,521
I don't need this to act
like a suitcase is heavy.

1423
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:48,505
I don't need this to act
like a suitcase is heavy.

1424
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,317
Who do they think I am?

1425
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,676
Who do they think I am?

1426
00:57:55,262 --> 00:57:56,262
Kurokawa-san...

1427
00:58:05,189 --> 00:58:06,190
Get out.

1428
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:07,459
Can we go ahead by ourselves?
Is everyone ready?

1429
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:08,460
Can we go ahead by ourselves?
Is everyone ready?

1430
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:09,670
Can we go ahead by ourselves?
Is everyone ready?

1431
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,195
The key actors are all here.

1432
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:12,697
Not just actors...

1433
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,757
I'm entrusted with this matter.

1434
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,616
I'm entrusted with this matter.

1435
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,743
You are?

1436
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,055
You're higher up than I thought.

1437
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,539
You're higher up than I thought.

1438
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:24,041
Whatever...

1439
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,050
What's the set up?

1440
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:34,152
I'll do the talking.
Stick by my side.

1441
00:58:34,176 --> 00:58:35,886
I'll do the talking.
Stick by my side.

1442
00:58:36,762 --> 00:58:37,739
Where are you shooting from?

1443
00:58:37,763 --> 00:58:38,883
Where are you shooting from?

1444
00:58:41,183 --> 00:58:42,268
What do you mean?

1445
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:43,495
Are you dumb? Which direction
will you shoot me from?

1446
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:44,496
Are you dumb? Which direction
will you shoot me from?

1447
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,497
Are you dumb? Which direction
will you shoot me from?

1448
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:47,457
Are you dumb? Which direction
will you shoot me from?

1449
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:48,458
If I don't know,
I won't know how to move.

1450
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:50,192
If I don't know,
I won't know how to move.

1451
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,422
I can pretty much guess.

1452
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,530
I can pretty much guess.

1453
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:56,865
Over there, right?

1454
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,203
How did you know?

1455
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:02,764
Jerk. I've been
in the biz a long time.

1456
00:59:02,788 --> 00:59:03,765
Jerk. I've been
in the biz a long time.

1457
00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:05,416
Jerk. I've been
in the biz a long time.

1458
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:06,518
If you shoot from over there,
he's in the way.

1459
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,311
If you shoot from over there,
he's in the way.

1460
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:09,879
That'd ruin the mood.

1461
00:59:17,803 --> 00:59:18,803
Let's go.

1462
00:59:37,948 --> 00:59:39,909
Hand over the cash, first.

1463
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,911
Do you have to open it?

1464
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,311
Do you have to open it?

1465
01:00:12,316 --> 01:00:13,651
Listen... I thought...

1466
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:14,776
Wait a second.

1467
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,543
They've started, huh?

1468
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,336
Can I get a receipt?

1469
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:38,968
Watch out.

1470
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,178
How did you know?

1471
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,489
That they weren't going to pay?

1472
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,973
That they weren't going to pay?

1473
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,577
Seems I owe you big-time.

1474
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:49,311
Seems I owe you big-time.

1475
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,355
Ain't no big deal.

1476
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,108
Let's hit 'em where it hurts.

1477
01:01:18,048 --> 01:01:19,550
Impressive stuff, eh?

1478
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,052
I'm after realism.

1479
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,743
I said stop, okay?

1480
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:54,919
How was it?

1481
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,313
Pretty good. But don't over-do it.

1482
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,314
Pretty good. But don't over-do it.

1483
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:58,698
Pretty good. But don't over-do it.

1484
01:01:58,756 --> 01:01:59,733
I get carried away. Bad habit.

1485
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,091
I get carried away. Bad habit.

1486
01:02:01,258 --> 01:02:02,968
Too late now.

1487
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:06,889
It was a hell of a fight, eh?

1488
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:07,949
It's the first time for me.

1489
01:02:07,973 --> 01:02:09,058
It's the first time for me.

1490
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:10,911
Tell'em to show their faces.
It's a great chance for screen time.

1491
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:11,912
Tell'em to show their faces.
It's a great chance for screen time.

1492
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:12,913
Tell'em to show their faces.
It's a great chance for screen time.

1493
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,497
Tell'em to show their faces.
It's a great chance for screen time.

1494
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:17,125
What are they doing?

1495
01:02:17,149 --> 01:02:18,609
What are they doing?

1496
01:02:18,692 --> 01:02:19,669
It's over. Stop it.

1497
01:02:19,693 --> 01:02:21,111
It's over. Stop it.

1498
01:02:21,862 --> 01:02:22,839
They're not Japanese.
Do you understand?

1499
01:02:22,863 --> 01:02:24,573
They're not Japanese.
Do you understand?

1500
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:25,759
We're taking a break.

1501
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:26,760
We're taking a break.

1502
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,327
We're taking a break.

1503
01:02:32,164 --> 01:02:33,141
I told you to stop!

1504
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:34,142
I told you to stop!

1505
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:35,542
I told you to stop!

1506
01:02:36,168 --> 01:02:37,145
You're with which casting company?
Who's your agent?

1507
01:02:37,169 --> 01:02:38,146
You're with which casting company?
Who's your agent?

1508
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,147
You're with which casting company?
Who's your agent?

1509
01:02:39,171 --> 01:02:41,211
You're with which casting company?
Who's your agent?

1510
01:02:44,718 --> 01:02:45,695
Nothing that needs hospital.
Just a slight concussion.

1511
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:46,696
Nothing that needs hospital.
Just a slight concussion.

1512
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,697
Nothing that needs hospital.
Just a slight concussion.

1513
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:49,282
Nothing that needs hospital.
Just a slight concussion.

1514
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:50,557
Thank you very much.

1515
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,476
Look after yourself.

1516
01:02:55,145 --> 01:02:56,480
So he's a doctor?

1517
01:02:56,605 --> 01:02:57,582
Used to be on a deep-sea
fishing boat.

1518
01:02:57,606 --> 01:02:58,583
Used to be on a deep-sea
fishing boat.

1519
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:00,087
Used to be on a deep-sea
fishing boat.

1520
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,485
A ship's doctor?

1521
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:03,487
When do I see today's footage?

1522
01:03:03,612 --> 01:03:05,614
I said we're not developing rushes.

1523
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:07,801
So I was tricked.

1524
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,159
So I was tricked.

1525
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:10,887
Since they didn't get the goods,
I'll let it go.

1526
01:03:10,911 --> 01:03:11,888
Since they didn't get the goods,
I'll let it go.

1527
01:03:11,912 --> 01:03:12,889
Since they didn't get the goods,
I'll let it go.

1528
01:03:12,913 --> 01:03:14,793
Since they didn't get the goods,
I'll let it go.

1529
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,333
How was Della?

1530
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:18,252
That guy's the real deal.

1531
01:03:18,502 --> 01:03:19,479
Laughing in the face
of their bullets.

1532
01:03:19,503 --> 01:03:20,480
Laughing in the face
of their bullets.

1533
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:22,006
Laughing in the face
of their bullets.

1534
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,235
Mr. President, if you'll excuse me.

1535
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,236
Mr. President, if you'll excuse me.

1536
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,660
Mr. President, if you'll excuse me.

1537
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,054
You know what to do next?

1538
01:03:29,179 --> 01:03:30,514
I've been told.

1539
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,057
Take care.

1540
01:03:36,478 --> 01:03:38,230
I want to have dinner with Della.

1541
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,000
Understood. We'll be waiting.

1542
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,692
Understood. We'll be waiting.

1543
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,277
What now?

1544
01:03:44,194 --> 01:03:45,171
Boss wants to have dinner with Della
tomorrow.

1545
01:03:45,195 --> 01:03:47,197
Boss wants to have dinner with Della
tomorrow.

1546
01:03:50,534 --> 01:03:51,511
He's earning the boss's trust.

1547
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:53,287
He's earning the boss's trust.

1548
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:56,641
How long can you continue this?

1549
01:03:56,665 --> 01:03:57,905
How long can you continue this?

1550
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,227
Think you'll keep
the wool over his eyes?

1551
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:00,851
Think you'll keep
the wool over his eyes?

1552
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:01,855
All I know is, if we don't
our lives are over.

1553
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:02,856
All I know is, if we don't
our lives are over.

1554
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,857
All I know is, if we don't
our lives are over.

1555
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,681
All I know is, if we don't
our lives are over.

1556
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:11,865
The boss wants to hear you sing.

1557
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,515
The boss wants to hear you sing.

1558
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:20,105
A rehearsal?

1559
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,207
Before we shoot. An important
heart-to-heart with the boss.

1560
01:04:21,231 --> 01:04:22,208
Before we shoot. An important
heart-to-heart with the boss.

1561
01:04:22,232 --> 01:04:23,209
Before we shoot. An important
heart-to-heart with the boss.

1562
01:04:23,233 --> 01:04:24,210
Before we shoot. An important
heart-to-heart with the boss.

1563
01:04:24,234 --> 01:04:25,545
Before we shoot. An important
heart-to-heart with the boss.

1564
01:04:25,569 --> 01:04:26,546
No camera but I want you to act
as if it were live.

1565
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:27,547
No camera but I want you to act
as if it were live.

1566
01:04:27,571 --> 01:04:28,548
No camera but I want you to act
as if it were live.

1567
01:04:28,572 --> 01:04:30,572
No camera but I want you to act
as if it were live.

1568
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:53,722
Which agency are you with?

1569
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:54,908
Who's your agent? Are you freelance?

1570
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,372
Who's your agent? Are you freelance?

1571
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,269
Are you really actors?

1572
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:01,897
You come across so natural.

1573
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:10,447
How is the food, Boss?

1574
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:11,448
It's fine.

1575
01:05:11,573 --> 01:05:13,033
Thank you very much.

1576
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:16,471
Seems you were in the thick of it.

1577
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,247
Seems you were in the thick of it.

1578
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,707
Don't mention it.

1579
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,102
I heard it was like watching
something from a movie.

1580
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,103
I heard it was like watching
something from a movie.

1581
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:24,104
I heard it was like watching
something from a movie.

1582
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,168
I heard it was like watching
something from a movie.

1583
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:32,219
How's everything?

1584
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,479
On a diet?

1585
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:43,938
Why?

1586
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:45,816
It's okay to eat.

1587
01:05:45,899 --> 01:05:46,650
But...

1588
01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:48,610
Consider it a take.

1589
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,737
Kurosawa-style, huh?

1590
01:05:52,364 --> 01:05:53,824
She'll begin shortly.

1591
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:58,954
What style?

1592
01:05:59,496 --> 01:06:00,831
What did you say?

1593
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,710
Come in.

1594
01:07:45,894 --> 01:07:46,871
I asked around the agencies
who hire foreigners...

1595
01:07:46,895 --> 01:07:47,872
I asked around the agencies
who hire foreigners...

1596
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:48,873
I asked around the agencies

1597
01:07:48,897 --> 01:07:50,083
I asked around the agencies
who hire foreigners...

1598
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:51,084
No-one had any jobs like that
last night.

1599
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:52,776
No-one had any jobs like that
last night.

1600
01:07:52,859 --> 01:07:53,836
There must be other casting companies.

1601
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,404
There must be other casting companies.

1602
01:07:55,737 --> 01:07:56,714
In any case. Let's go back to Tokyo.

1603
01:07:56,738 --> 01:07:58,178
In any case. Let's go back to Tokyo.

1604
01:07:58,490 --> 01:07:59,467
And I got this thump in my chest.
I'm worried.

1605
01:07:59,491 --> 01:08:00,468
And I got this thump in my chest.
I'm worried.

1606
01:08:00,492 --> 01:08:01,469
And I got this thump in my chest.
I'm worried.

1607
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:03,453
And I got this thump in my chest.
I'm worried.

1608
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,556
My dad died young of a heart attack.

1609
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,557
My dad died young of a heart attack.

1610
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:06,933
My dad died young of a heart attack.

1611
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:07,934
If you don't feel well, head home.

1612
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:09,459
If you don't feel well, head home.

1613
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:11,563
You guys haven't quite got it right.

1614
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,297
You guys haven't quite got it right.

1615
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,651
If you ask me,
you're not real enough.

1616
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,155
If you ask me,
you're not real enough.

1617
01:08:18,635 --> 01:08:19,612
Your boss has the town
in the palm of his hand, right?

1618
01:08:19,636 --> 01:08:21,489
Your boss has the town
in the palm of his hand, right?

1619
01:08:21,513 --> 01:08:23,181
You just look like street punks.

1620
01:08:25,642 --> 01:08:26,642
Sorry...

1621
01:08:27,769 --> 01:08:28,746
Let's re-do your walk.

1622
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:29,980
Let's re-do your walk.

1623
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:32,542
Up on stage, you're divine.

1624
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:33,543
Up on stage, you're divine.

1629
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,157
Thanks.

1630
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,262
I've been thinking.

1631
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,454
I've been thinking.

1632
01:08:46,371 --> 01:08:47,348

1640
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,657

Don't assume you'll always
get your way.

1647
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,417
Hold it, hold it...

1648
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:36,213
Like you've eyes in your chin...

1649
01:09:36,296 --> 01:09:38,173
And again, slowly...

1650
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,737
Getting better... once more...

Hold it...

1655
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:52,562
Point with the chin...

1656
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:53,665
That's great. Once more...

1657
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,399
That's great. Once more...

1658
01:09:57,317 --> 01:09:58,902
We're in for some trouble.

1659
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,967

Your illicit trading and such.

1674
01:10:25,303 --> 01:10:26,280

You were about to say something?

1732
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:53,135
Go easy on the make-up.

1733

Go easy on the make-up.

1734

Hey, over here.

1736

Mind if I sit here?

01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:20,705
It's a crappy map.

1740
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:21,980
It's a crappy map.

1741
01:13:24,524 --> 01:13:25,775
I drew it myself.

1742
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,612
Get one of the crew to do it.

1743
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:29,672
I don't trust anyone.

1744
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:30,673
I don't trust anyone.

1745
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:31,781
I don't trust anyone.

1746
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:34,844
Where did they find
a weird bastard like you?

1747
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:35,845
Where did they find
a weird bastard like you?

1748
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:37,871
Where did they find
a weird bastard like you?

1749
01:13:47,213 --> 01:13:48,465
It's Ebora.

1750
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:52,677
If it ain't Kurokawa-sensei.

1751
01:13:52,802 --> 01:13:53,887
Hey, kid.

1752
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,138
Hello.

1753
01:13:56,139 --> 01:13:57,432
Who's this?

1754
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:01,645
As if you don't know...

1755
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:09,110
I don't.

1756
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:13,215
Head of the Ebora gang
says he doesn't know you.

1757
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:14,216
Head of the Ebora gang
says he doesn't know you.

1758
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,217
Head of the Ebora gang
says he doesn't know you.

1759
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:16,802
Head of the Ebora gang
says he doesn't know you.

1760
01:14:16,826 --> 01:14:18,119
What the hell does that mean?

1761
01:14:18,411 --> 01:14:19,663
Excuse us a moment.

1762
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:24,644
What's the Ebora gang?

1763
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:26,503
What's the Ebora gang?

1764
01:14:27,253 --> 01:14:28,230
That guy's famous for rehearsing
anytime, anywhere. Humor him.

1765
01:14:28,254 --> 01:14:29,231
That guy's famous for rehearsing
anytime, anywhere. Humor him.

1766
01:14:29,255 --> 01:14:30,232
That guy's famous for rehearsing
anytime, anywhere. Humor him.

1767
01:14:30,256 --> 01:14:31,233
That guy's famous for rehearsing
anytime, anywhere. Humor him.

1768
01:14:31,257 --> 01:14:33,697
That guy's famous for rehearsing
anytime, anywhere. Humor him.

1769
01:14:40,308 --> 01:14:41,851
Long time, no see.

1770
01:14:42,435 --> 01:14:43,412
I said I don't know You.

1771
01:14:43,436 --> 01:14:44,854
I said I don't know You.

1772
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:46,439
It's me.

1773
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,500
Even so, you wouldn't know him
with this face.

1774
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:48,501
Even so, you wouldn't know him
with this face.

1775
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:50,325
Even so, you wouldn't know him
with this face.

1776
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:51,379
They call him “The Man
of a Thousand Faces”...

1777
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:52,380
They call him “The Man
of a Thousand Faces”...

1778
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:54,244
They call him “The Man
of a Thousand Faces”...

1779
01:14:54,322 --> 01:14:55,615
Disguises?

1780
01:14:56,199 --> 01:14:57,176
Show him your real face.

1781
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,952
Show him your real face.

1782
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,080
Look the other way.

1783
01:15:12,924 --> 01:15:14,843
You recognize that.

1784
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:17,113
Della Togashi, the assassin
you hired.

1785
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:18,114
Della Togashi, the assassin
you hired.

1786
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:19,365
Della Togashi, the assassin
you hired.

1787
01:15:19,389 --> 01:15:20,890
Long time, no see.

1788
01:15:26,646 --> 01:15:27,772
It's okay.

1789
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:31,234
You remember now?

1790
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:38,867
Of course...

1791
01:15:39,617 --> 01:15:40,594
Della. Whenever you're ready
come back to us.

1792
01:15:40,618 --> 01:15:41,595
Della. Whenever you're ready
come back to us.

1793
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:42,596
Della. Whenever you're ready
come back to us.

1794
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:44,414
Della. Whenever you're ready
come back to us.

1795
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:47,810
Your courage is legendary.

1796
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,335
Your courage is legendary.

1797
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:55,258
Hey, you...

1798
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,928
I made up my mind.

1799
01:16:00,555 --> 01:16:02,348
Let's leave this place.

1800
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,809
That's impossible.

1801
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:06,853
It's a matter of time
before we're discovered.

1802
01:16:06,936 --> 01:16:07,913
Let's get far away now
while we can.

1803
01:16:07,937 --> 01:16:09,939
Let's get far away now
while we can.

1804
01:16:10,565 --> 01:16:11,816
What about Murata-san?

1805
01:16:11,941 --> 01:16:12,918
Just leave him be.

1806
01:16:12,942 --> 01:16:14,486
Just leave him be.

1807
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:15,755
There are lots of better actors
throughout Japan.

1808
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:16,756
There are lots of better actors
throughout Japan.

1809
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,700
There are lots of better actors
throughout Japan.

1810
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:22,887
Why did you turn down
the boss's offer?

1811
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,913
Why did you turn down
the boss's offer?

1812
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:30,102
He just wants me on his arm.

1813
01:16:30,126 --> 01:16:32,128
He just wants me on his arm.

1814
01:16:32,962 --> 01:16:34,964
But I'm not some doll.

1815
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,195
For all his fine words,
he's just a provincial hoodlum.

1816
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:40,196
For all his fine words,
he's just a provincial hoodlum.

1817
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,156
For all his fine words,
he's just a provincial hoodlum.

1818
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,098
Mari-san.

1819
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:44,158
He talks of money
but there's a limit to it.

1820
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:45,451
He talks of money
but there's a limit to it.

1821
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:47,477
Worse still, he's on the way out.

1822
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:52,666
Soon enough, the Ebora gang
will take over the town.

1823
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:53,667
Soon enough, the Ebora gang
will take over the town.

1824
01:16:53,691 --> 01:16:55,731
Soon enough, the Ebora gang
will take over the town.

1825
01:16:58,446 --> 01:16:59,423
I don't want a man
whose days are numbered.

1826
01:16:59,447 --> 01:17:01,127
I don't want a man
whose days are numbered.

1827
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,749
But you've got a future.

1828
01:17:11,334 --> 01:17:12,311
Let's flee together.

1829
01:17:12,335 --> 01:17:14,337
Let's flee together.

1830
01:17:14,462 --> 01:17:15,439
Live together some other place.

1831
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:17,423
Live together some other place.

1832
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:18,883
The two of us?

1833
01:17:19,008 --> 01:17:19,985
Start a new life... you and me.

1834
01:17:20,009 --> 01:17:20,986
Start a new life... you and me.

1835
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:21,987
Start a new life... you and me.

1836
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:23,763
Start a new life... you and me.

1837
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:33,815
Can we go ahead?

1838
01:17:33,898 --> 01:17:35,358
Whenever you like.

1839
01:17:36,317 --> 01:17:37,193
And the director?

1840
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:39,237
Watching a monitor over there.

1841
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:42,574
Okay... stay close.

1842
01:17:43,908 --> 01:17:44,908
Where is he?

1843
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:46,536
I'll try calling again.

1844
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:55,128
You don't have to answer.

1845
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:57,380
It's probably Nat-chan...

1846
01:17:57,463 --> 01:17:59,257
You don't have to answer.

1847
01:18:01,509 --> 01:18:03,011
I said, don't answer.

1848
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:06,014
Where on earth are you?

1849
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:10,602
I understand.

1850
01:18:14,397 --> 01:18:15,374
Please. Don't tell me
we're going back.

1851
01:18:15,398 --> 01:18:16,375
Please. Don't tell me
we're going back.

1852
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:18,151
Please. Don't tell me
we're going back.

1853
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,237
Mari-san...

1854
01:18:21,362 --> 01:18:22,947
I beg you...

1855
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:24,425
I can't leave Murata-san.

1856
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:25,825
I can't leave Murata-san.

1857
01:18:26,784 --> 01:18:28,411
He's nobody to you.

1858
01:18:29,412 --> 01:18:30,389
I know he's a nobody
but he's a fine actor.

1859
01:18:30,413 --> 01:18:31,390
I know he's a nobody
but he's a fine actor.

1860
01:18:31,414 --> 01:18:32,558
I know he's a nobody
but he's a fine actor.

1861
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:34,292
So what?

1862
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,585
So...

1863
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,857
No matter how good he is,
we can't get away with this forever.

1864
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:40,858
No matter how good he is,
we can't get away with this forever.

1865
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:41,859
No matter how good he is,
we can't get away with this forever.

1866
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,111
No matter how good he is,
we can't get away with this forever.

1867
01:18:44,135 --> 01:18:45,845
We'll be found out.

1868
01:18:46,095 --> 01:18:47,072
Then what'll happen?
Think about that!

1869
01:18:47,096 --> 01:18:48,073
Then what'll happen?
Think about that!

1870
01:18:48,097 --> 01:18:49,074
Then what'll happen?
Think about that!

1871
01:18:49,098 --> 01:18:51,100
Then what'll happen?
Think about that!

1872
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:14,600
Rest assured there's nothing wrong
with your heart.

1873
01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:15,601
Rest assured there's nothing wrong
with your heart.

1874
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,625
Rest assured there's nothing wrong
with your heart.

1875
01:19:18,002 --> 01:19:19,128
That's good.

1876
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,231
However I am worried

1877
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,232
However I am worried

1878
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:22,840
However I am worried

1879
01:19:23,007 --> 01:19:24,926
about the bullet hole.

1880
01:19:51,911 --> 01:19:52,996
What are you doing?

1881
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,497
Go on ahead.

1882
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,960
What's going on here?

1883
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:02,005
What's happening?

1884
01:20:03,339 --> 01:20:04,316
Isn't it obvious. We're filming.

1885
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,758
Isn't it obvious. We're filming.

1886
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:06,819
Filming? Nobody told me.

1887
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:08,511
Filming? Nobody told me.

1888
01:20:08,636 --> 01:20:10,138
Perfect timing. Take over.

1889
01:20:10,221 --> 01:20:11,931
What's up? No permit again?

1890
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:12,992
Please delay them.

1891
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:13,993
Please delay them.

1892
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,184
Please delay them.

1893
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:17,079
Wait please, they're filming...

1894
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:18,080
Wait please, they're filming...

1895
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:19,344
Wait please, they're filming...

1896
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:21,399
Sorry, you mustn't.

1897
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:24,975
A representative is on his way.

1898
01:20:35,204 --> 01:20:36,414
Where is he?

1899
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:50,762
Stop him.

1900
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:52,031
It'll be valuable footage.

1901
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:53,097
It'll be valuable footage.

1902
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,115
Mr. Director...

1903
01:21:13,993 --> 01:21:15,328
Great performance.

1904
01:21:17,705 --> 01:21:18,915
You were good, too.

1905
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:20,917
So true to life.

1906
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,210
And that...?

1907
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:23,836
From the same crew.

1908
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,796
Don't tell me...

1909
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:26,923
Another gas leak.

1910
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:35,014
Sorry to make you worry.

1911
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:40,079
On the move!

1912
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:41,604
On the move!

1913
01:21:43,689 --> 01:21:44,666
When do we see rushes?

1914
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:45,817
When do we see rushes?

1915
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:46,919
How many times do I tell you
there aren't any?

1916
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:47,920
How many times do I tell you
there aren't any?

1917
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:49,744
How many times do I tell you
there aren't any?

1918
01:21:54,617 --> 01:21:55,594
Why is that man with us?

1919
01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:56,595
Why is that man with us?

1920
01:21:56,619 --> 01:21:58,371
Why is that man with us?

1921
01:22:01,582 --> 01:22:02,559
I asked him along. No point
him staying. Was it bad?

1922
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:03,560
I asked him along. No point
him staying. Was it bad?

1923
01:22:03,584 --> 01:22:04,561
I asked him along. No point
him staying. Was it bad?

1924
01:22:04,585 --> 01:22:06,438
I asked him along. No point
him staying. Was it bad?

1925
01:22:06,462 --> 01:22:07,797
There's no room.

1926
01:22:09,924 --> 01:22:10,901
What will become of me now?

1927
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:11,902
What will become of me now?

1928
01:22:11,926 --> 01:22:13,386
What will become of me now?

1929
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:32,405
Good evening...

1930
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:55,946
Murata-san, which agent are you with?

1931
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:56,947
Murata-san, which agent are you with?

1932
01:22:56,971 --> 01:22:58,514
Murata-san, which agent are you with?

1933
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:00,993
I'd like to join, too.

1934
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:02,185
I'd like to join, too.

1935
01:23:02,518 --> 01:23:03,686
Are you freelance now?

1936
01:23:03,769 --> 01:23:05,188
Something like that.

1937
01:23:05,688 --> 01:23:06,665
You really want to be an actress?
It's tough.

1938
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:07,666
You really want to be an actress?
It's tough.

1939
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:09,168
You really want to be an actress?
It's tough.

1940
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:10,169
I want to quit this town...
sing on a bigger stage.

1941
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:11,170
I want to quit this town...
sing on a bigger stage.

1942
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:12,171
I want to quit this town...
sing on a bigger stage.

1943
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:14,197
I want to quit this town...
sing on a bigger stage.

1944
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:15,299
My dream is to end up
at the Budokan.

1945
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:16,300
My dream is to end up
at the Budokan.

1946
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:17,301
My dream is to end up
at the Budokan.

1947
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:18,868
My dream is to end up
at the Budokan.

1948
01:23:20,369 --> 01:23:21,370
What is it?

1949
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:25,374
Do you know this movie?

1950
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:28,794
The first film I ever saw.

1951
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:30,713
Is that right?

1952
01:23:31,047 --> 01:23:32,024
My dad took me to a cinema
when I was little.

1953
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:33,025
My dad took me to a cinema
when I was little.

1954
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:34,809
My dad took me to a cinema
when I was little.

1955
01:23:35,676 --> 01:23:36,653
Makoto Takase is superb
as the assassin.

1956
01:23:36,677 --> 01:23:37,654
Makoto Takase is superb
as the assassin.

1957
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:39,114
Makoto Takase is superb
as the assassin.

1958
01:23:39,138 --> 01:23:40,115
Cool, kind. Yet solitary.

1959
01:23:40,139 --> 01:23:41,349
Cool, kind. Yet solitary.

1960
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:43,452
My hero...

1961
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:44,727
My hero...

1962
01:23:46,437 --> 01:23:47,414
This movie made me decide
on this career.

1963
01:23:47,438 --> 01:23:48,415
This movie made me decide
on this career.

1964
01:23:48,439 --> 01:23:49,416
This movie made me decide
on this career.

1965
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,067
This movie made me decide
on this career.

1966
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,367
I'm not afraid to die.

1967
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:01,637
What I fear
is living on without honor.

1968
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:02,638
What I fear
is living on without honor.

1969
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:03,639
What I fear
is living on without honor.

1970
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:05,183
What I fear
is living on without honor.

1971
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:08,393
Dialog from the film. I memorized it.

1972
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:09,961
Dialog from the film. I memorized it.

1973
01:24:14,048 --> 01:24:15,258
2 adults, please.

1974
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:24,433
Now, the boss is history.

1975
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:28,956
What the hell's going on?
I had a terrible time.

1976
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:29,957
What the hell's going on?
I had a terrible time.

1977
01:24:29,981 --> 01:24:31,542
What the hell's going on?
I had a terrible time.

1978
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:32,543
You didn't have a permit.
I was put through the wringer.

1979
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:33,544
You didn't have a permit.
I was put through the wringer.

1980
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:35,546
You didn't have a permit.
I was put through the wringer.

1981
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,071
Wait!

1982
01:24:37,196 --> 01:24:38,948
I said wait!

1983
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:41,200
What's wrong.

1984
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:42,344
Something terrible happened.
Togashi messed up.

1985
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,345
Something terrible happened.
Togashi messed up.

1986
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:44,846
Something terrible happened.
Togashi messed up.

1987
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:45,955
And Sugawara?

1988
01:24:46,122 --> 01:24:47,957
He escaped by a whisker.

1989
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:50,668
That's bad.

1990
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,937
The cops have got him.
What shall we do?

1991
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:52,938
The cops have got him.
What shall we do?

1992
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:54,522
The cops have got him.
What shall we do?

1993
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:55,983
I'll let the boss know.
Stand by for now.

1994
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,633
I'll let the boss know.
Stand by for now.

1995
01:24:58,134 --> 01:24:59,552
I understand.

1996
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:05,867
I joined the industry at 18...

1997
01:25:05,891 --> 01:25:06,868
I joined the industry at 18...

1998
01:25:06,892 --> 01:25:08,102
I joined the industry at 18...

1999
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:10,581
Dreaming of sitting with an audience

2000
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:11,582
Dreaming of sitting with an audience

2001
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,041
Dreaming of sitting with an audience

2002
01:25:13,065 --> 01:25:14,042
and seeing my own face on the big screen.

2003
01:25:14,066 --> 01:25:15,043
And seeing my own face on the big screen.

2004
01:25:15,067 --> 01:25:16,044
And seeing my own face on the big screen.

2005
01:25:16,068 --> 01:25:17,708
And seeing my own face on the big screen.

2006
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:20,299
No matter how long it would take.

2007
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:21,643
No matter how long it would take.

2008
01:25:24,744 --> 01:25:26,037
I'll show you something special.

2009
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:33,687
It stinks.

2010
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:34,920
It stinks.

2011
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,316
I found an old blanket
in the corner of a stage.

2012
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,317
I found an old blanket
in the corner of a stage.

2013
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:39,318
I found an old blanket
in the corner of a stage.

2014
01:25:39,342 --> 01:25:40,819
I found an old blanket
in the corner of a stage.

2015
01:25:40,843 --> 01:25:41,820
Some crew member said
it'd been there 30 years or so.

2016
01:25:41,844 --> 01:25:42,821
Some crew member said
it'd been there 30 years or so.

2017
01:25:42,845 --> 01:25:43,822
Some crew member said
it'd been there 30 years or so.

2018
01:25:43,846 --> 01:25:45,926
Some crew member said
it'd been there 30 years or so.

2019
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:46,992
Maybe it once warmed
Toshiro Mifune.

2020
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:47,993
Maybe it once warmed
Toshiro Mifune.

2021
01:25:48,017 --> 01:25:49,852
Maybe it once warmed
Toshiro Mifune.

2022
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:50,996
During “Underworld Sidekick”
maybe even Makoto Takase

2023
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:52,664
During “Underworld Sidekick”
maybe even Makoto Takase

2024
01:25:52,688 --> 01:25:53,665
lay down on it for a nap.

2025
01:25:53,689 --> 01:25:55,358
Lay down on it for a nap.

2026
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:57,461
This is a piece of that blanket.

2027
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:58,462
This is a piece of that blanket.

2028
01:25:58,486 --> 01:25:59,766
This is a piece of that blanket.

2029
01:26:01,697 --> 01:26:02,674
In other words, it's steeped in the sweat

2030
01:26:02,698 --> 01:26:03,675
In other words, it's steeped in the sweat

2031
01:26:03,699 --> 01:26:04,926
In other words, it's steeped in the sweat

2032
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:05,927
of those actors and the crew
who stood by them.

2033
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:07,791
Of those actors and the crew
who stood by them.

2034
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:09,622
It's my lucky charm.

2035
01:26:10,873 --> 01:26:11,850
Wanna skip town with me?

2036
01:26:11,874 --> 01:26:12,851
Wanna skip town with me?

2037
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:14,502
Wanna skip town with me?

2038
01:26:14,585 --> 01:26:15,503
Me?

2039
01:26:15,586 --> 01:26:16,563
Take me away from here.

2040
01:26:16,587 --> 01:26:17,838
Take me away from here.

2041
01:26:18,005 --> 01:26:18,982
Now? We're still filming.
I can't.

2042
01:26:19,006 --> 01:26:19,983
Now? We're still filming.
I can't.

2043
01:26:20,007 --> 01:26:20,984
Now? We're still filming.
I can't.

2044
01:26:21,008 --> 01:26:22,328
Now? We're still filming.
I can't.

2045
01:26:22,843 --> 01:26:24,053
When we wrap, eh?

2046
01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:27,640
You're a simple soul.

2047
01:26:32,978 --> 01:26:34,230
It's starting...

2048
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:45,634
I'm so sorry it turned out like this.

2049
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:46,635
I'm so sorry it turned out like this.

2050
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:48,139
I'm so sorry it turned out like this.

2051
01:26:48,994 --> 01:26:49,971
Togashi messing up like that.

2052
01:26:49,995 --> 01:26:51,455
Togashi messing up like that.

2053
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:52,641
No problem. Nobody's perfect.

2054
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:53,642
No problem. Nobody's perfect.

2055
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:54,643
No problem. Nobody's perfect.

2056
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:55,827
No problem. Nobody's perfect.

2057
01:26:57,503 --> 01:26:59,130
What do you intend to do?

2058
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:00,673
Nothing, really.

2059
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:02,550
But...

2060
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:04,069
You're worried my accountant
is in police hands?

2061
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:05,070
You're worried my accountant
is in police hands?

2062
01:27:05,094 --> 01:27:06,071
You're worried my accountant
is in police hands?

2063
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:07,072
You're worried my accountant
is in police hands?

2064
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:08,976
You're worried my accountant
is in police hands?

2065
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:13,102
That's no big deal.

2066
01:27:14,019 --> 01:27:14,996
I'm more worried about
betrayal from within.

2067
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:15,997
I'm more worried about
betrayal from within.

2068
01:27:16,021 --> 01:27:16,998
I'm more worried about
betrayal from within.

2069
01:27:17,022 --> 01:27:18,774
I'm more worried about
betrayal from within.

2070
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:28,260
This is a nice town.

2071
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:29,368
This is a nice town.

2072
01:27:42,882 --> 01:27:43,859
You've gone pale, kiddo.

2073
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:45,176
You've gone pale, kiddo.

2074
01:27:51,348 --> 01:27:52,325
One piece of advice.

2075
01:27:52,349 --> 01:27:53,476
One piece of advice.

2076
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:55,746
When you stake everything,

2077
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:56,747
When you stake everything,

2078
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:57,813
When you stake everything,

2079
01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,124
be 100% sure of victory.

2080
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:00,125
Be 100% sure of victory.

2081
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:01,400
Be 100% sure of victory.

2082
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:02,943
Gambling's ironclad rule.

2083
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,004
No... life's ironclad rule.

2084
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:05,863
No... life's ironclad rule.

2085
01:28:06,655 --> 01:28:07,632
On this point, it can be said
you've been naive in the extreme.

2086
01:28:07,656 --> 01:28:08,633
On this point, it can be said
you've been naive in the extreme.

2087
01:28:08,657 --> 01:28:09,634
On this point, it can be said
you've been naive in the extreme.

2088
01:28:09,658 --> 01:28:10,635
On this point, it can be said
you've been naive in the extreme.

2089
01:28:10,659 --> 01:28:13,139
On this point, it can be said
you've been naive in the extreme.

2090
01:28:16,499 --> 01:28:17,476
It's like a scene in a movie.

2091
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,834
It's like a scene in a movie.

2092
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:22,147
What kind of a movie, eh? Kid?

2093
01:28:22,171 --> 01:28:23,964
What kind of a movie, eh? Kid?

2094
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:27,343
Sorry to say but...

2095
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:30,554
this is a comedy.

2096
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:34,743
A comedy pure and simple.

2097
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:35,744
A comedy pure and simple.

2098
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:37,102
A comedy pure and simple.

2099
01:28:53,702 --> 01:28:54,679
A big shoot-out at the docks
yet no police show up?

2100
01:28:54,703 --> 01:28:55,680
A big shoot-out at the docks
yet no police show up?

2101
01:28:55,704 --> 01:28:56,681
A big shoot-out at the docks
yet no police show up?

2102
01:28:56,705 --> 01:28:58,350
A big shoot-out at the docks
yet no police show up?

2103
01:28:58,374 --> 01:28:59,351
You should've asked yourself why.

2104
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:00,352
You should've asked yourself why.

2105
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:01,710
You should've asked yourself why.

2106
01:29:02,711 --> 01:29:03,688
The Police Chief and I
were at school together.

2107
01:29:03,712 --> 01:29:04,689
The Police Chief and I
were at school together.

2108
01:29:04,713 --> 01:29:05,690
The Police Chief and I
were at school together.

2109
01:29:05,714 --> 01:29:07,591
The Police Chief and I
were at school together.

2110
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:09,593
Ain't that right, old friend?

2111
01:29:13,722 --> 01:29:15,015
So...

2112
01:29:16,433 --> 01:29:17,410
What are we to do?

2113
01:29:17,434 --> 01:29:18,727
What are we to do?

2114
01:29:44,253 --> 01:29:45,230
It's terrible.
They've got the manager.

2115
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:46,922
It's terrible.
They've got the manager.

2116
01:29:48,507 --> 01:29:49,925
He's a fool.

2117
01:29:50,593 --> 01:29:51,570
But he was trying
to help you, too...

2118
01:29:51,594 --> 01:29:52,863
But he was trying
to help you, too...

2119
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:53,864
He should've escaped days ago.

2120
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,306
He should've escaped days ago.

2121
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:56,849
And Murata-san?

2122
01:29:57,099 --> 01:29:58,076
Watching a movie.
Some crap thing...

2123
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,768
Watching a movie.
Some crap thing...

2124
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:00,871
I left him to it and came home.

2125
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:02,479
I left him to it and came home.

2126
01:30:02,938 --> 01:30:03,915
You feel fine doing that?

2127
01:30:03,939 --> 01:30:05,274
You feel fine doing that?

2128
01:30:07,943 --> 01:30:09,528
She disgusts me.

2129
01:30:10,362 --> 01:30:11,339
Her parents died when she was little
and she was all alone.

2130
01:30:11,363 --> 01:30:12,340
Her parents died when she was little
and she was all alone.

2131
01:30:12,364 --> 01:30:13,341
Her parents died when she was little
and she was all alone.

2132
01:30:13,365 --> 01:30:14,342
Her parents died when she was little
and she was all alone.

2133
01:30:14,366 --> 01:30:16,686
Her parents died when she was little
and she was all alone.

2134
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:18,972
I guess she came through
some hard times.

2135
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:19,973
I guess she came through
some hard times.

2136
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:21,624
I guess she came through
some hard times.

2137
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:23,768
She relies on people
but doesn't trust 'em.

2138
01:30:23,792 --> 01:30:24,769
She relies on people
but doesn't trust 'em.

2139
01:30:24,793 --> 01:30:26,473
She relies on people
but doesn't trust 'em.

2140
01:30:26,545 --> 01:30:27,522
That's what life taught her.

2141
01:30:27,546 --> 01:30:29,214
That's what life taught her.

2142
01:30:33,636 --> 01:30:34,613
Okay then. I'll rescue him.

2143
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:35,614
Okay then. I'll rescue him.

2144
01:30:35,638 --> 01:30:37,556
Okay then. I'll rescue him.

2145
01:30:38,807 --> 01:30:40,517
A sudden change in schedule.

2146
01:30:40,643 --> 01:30:41,620
We've got to shoot
the boss's scene first.

2147
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:43,312
We've got to shoot
the boss's scene first.

2148
01:30:43,437 --> 01:30:44,414
At this time of night?

2149
01:30:44,438 --> 01:30:45,689
At this time of night?

2150
01:30:45,981 --> 01:30:46,958
The actor playing him
goes back to Tokyo tomorrow morning.

2151
01:30:46,982 --> 01:30:47,959
The actor playing him
goes back to Tokyo tomorrow morning.

2152
01:30:47,983 --> 01:30:50,211
The actor playing him
goes back to Tokyo tomorrow morning.

2153
01:30:50,235 --> 01:30:51,212
Get over there
and shoot him dead, please.

2154
01:30:51,236 --> 01:30:52,213
Get over there
and shoot him dead, please.

2155
01:30:52,237 --> 01:30:53,948
Get over there
and shoot him dead, please.

2156
01:30:55,699 --> 01:30:57,660
Why the need to kill him?

2157
01:30:58,202 --> 01:30:58,869
Lots of reasons.

2158
01:30:58,994 --> 01:31:00,871
This is all too random. I don't like it.

2159
01:31:00,996 --> 01:31:01,973
I demand to see my director!

2160
01:31:01,997 --> 01:31:02,974
I demand to see my director!

2161
01:31:02,998 --> 01:31:04,118
I demand to see my director!

2162
01:31:07,544 --> 01:31:08,521
The boss begins to despise Togashi.

2163
01:31:08,545 --> 01:31:09,522
The boss begins to despise Togashi.

2164
01:31:09,546 --> 01:31:11,507
The boss begins to despise Togashi.

2165
01:31:12,383 --> 01:31:13,360
He orders Kurokawa to lock him up
and work him over.

2166
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:14,361
He orders Kurokawa to lock him up
and work him over.

2167
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:15,362
He orders Kurokawa to lock him up
and work him over.

2168
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:17,030
He orders Kurokawa to lock him up
and work him over.

2169
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:18,031
Togashi realizes he's being used
by the boss.

2170
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:19,032
Togashi realizes he's being used
by the boss.

2171
01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:20,033
Togashi realizes he's being used
by the boss.

2172
01:31:20,057 --> 01:31:21,817
Togashi realizes he's being used
by the boss.

2173
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:23,370
He escapes their jail,
barges into the boss's office

2174
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:24,371
He escapes their jail,
barges into the boss's office

2175
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:25,789
He escapes their jail,
barges into the boss's office

2176
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:26,790
and draws his gun on the boss at last.

2177
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:28,334
And draws his gun on the boss at last.

2178
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:31,360
How about that?

2179
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:34,822
Could be a good scene...

2180
01:31:37,032 --> 01:31:38,784
How dare you trick me.

2181
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:40,869
What did you do to your face?

2182
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:43,330
You broke my heart.

2183
01:31:45,874 --> 01:31:46,851
You were like a father to me.

2184
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:47,852
You were like a father to me.

2185
01:31:47,876 --> 01:31:49,378
You were like a father to me.

2186
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:50,921
I had no idea.

2187
01:31:51,547 --> 01:31:52,715
I believed in you.

2188
01:31:56,218 --> 01:31:57,886
There's something in your mouth.

2189
01:31:58,512 --> 01:31:59,489
I never thought this day would come.

2190
01:31:59,513 --> 01:32:00,953
I never thought this day would come.

2191
01:32:02,766 --> 01:32:03,743
Togashi, my lad. Er... Mr. Togashi...
what's up?

2192
01:32:03,767 --> 01:32:04,744
Togashi, my lad. Er... Mr. Togashi...
what's up?

2193
01:32:04,768 --> 01:32:06,648
Togashi, my lad. Er... Mr. Togashi...
what's up?

2194
01:32:06,895 --> 01:32:07,872
At least die like a honorable man.

2195
01:32:07,896 --> 01:32:08,873
At least die like a honorable man.

2196
01:32:08,897 --> 01:32:09,874
At least die like a honorable man.

2197
01:32:09,898 --> 01:32:11,258
At least die like a honorable man.

2198
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:13,736
Farewell.

2199
01:32:15,112 --> 01:32:16,363
Father.

2200
01:32:17,364 --> 01:32:18,341
Drop the gun. Cut!

2201
01:32:18,365 --> 01:32:19,825
Drop the gun. Cut!

2202
01:32:31,336 --> 01:32:32,421
Are you trying to hurt me?

2203
01:32:32,546 --> 01:32:33,714
Maybe I am.

2204
01:32:34,214 --> 01:32:35,466
That's dangerous.

2205
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:37,176
Get me the director, now!

2206
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:39,761
Director, sir?

2207
01:32:42,097 --> 01:32:43,074
What's with the tying up?
I told 'em it hurts.

2208
01:32:43,098 --> 01:32:44,075
What's with the tying up?
I told 'em it hurts.

2209
01:32:44,099 --> 01:32:45,076
What's with the tying up?
I told 'em it hurts.

2210
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,900
What's with the tying up?
I told 'em it hurts.

2211
01:32:47,644 --> 01:32:48,621
Can you have a word with 'em?

2212
01:32:48,645 --> 01:32:49,938
Can you have a word with 'em?

2213
01:32:53,275 --> 01:32:54,610
What are you doing here?

2214
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:55,986
Murata-san...

2215
01:32:58,405 --> 01:33:00,282
I owe you an apology.

2216
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:02,785
How could you do that?

2217
01:33:02,951 --> 01:33:03,928
No point in asking me...

2218
01:33:03,952 --> 01:33:05,412
No point in asking me...

2219
01:33:05,829 --> 01:33:06,806
I was looking out for you.

2220
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:07,807
I was looking out for you.

2221
01:33:07,831 --> 01:33:08,808
I was looking out for you.

2222
01:33:08,832 --> 01:33:09,958
I was looking out for you.

2223
01:33:17,966 --> 01:33:18,943
I don't understand.
What are you doing?

2224
01:33:18,967 --> 01:33:20,487
I don't understand.
What are you doing?

2225
01:33:32,356 --> 01:33:33,333
Have him pay my room.

2226
01:33:33,357 --> 01:33:34,483
Have him pay my room.

2227
01:33:36,193 --> 01:33:38,112
They've got Murata-san.

2228
01:33:40,447 --> 01:33:41,424
Please help them both.

2229
01:33:41,448 --> 01:33:43,117
Please help them both.

2230
01:33:50,582 --> 01:33:51,559
I feel sorry for you, Mari-san.

2231
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:52,918
I feel sorry for you, Mari-san.

2232
01:33:55,671 --> 01:33:56,648
You're always alone because
you don't love anyone.

2233
01:33:56,672 --> 01:33:57,649
You're always alone because
you don't love anyone.

2234
01:33:57,673 --> 01:33:58,650
You're always alone because
you don't love anyone.

2235
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:00,634
You're always alone because
you don't love anyone.

2236
01:34:01,176 --> 01:34:02,153
Those that can't love
can never be loved.

2237
01:34:02,177 --> 01:34:03,154
Those that can't love
can never be loved.

2238
01:34:03,178 --> 01:34:04,489
Those that can't love
can never be loved.

2239
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:06,515
Are you my Mom?

2240
01:34:06,682 --> 01:34:07,659
Have you ever really cared
about anyone?

2241
01:34:07,683 --> 01:34:09,243
Have you ever really cared
about anyone?

2242
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:12,664
Go talk things over with the boss.

2243
01:34:12,688 --> 01:34:14,048
Go talk things over with the boss.

2244
01:34:14,356 --> 01:34:15,691
Why me?

2245
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:17,836
It's obvious.
You're the only one who can.

2246
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:18,837
It's obvious.
You're the only one who can.

2247
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:20,654
It's obvious.
You're the only one who can.

2248
01:34:26,493 --> 01:34:27,470
I'm so sorry I got you caught up
in all this.

2249
01:34:27,494 --> 01:34:28,471
I'm so sorry I got you caught up
in all this.

2250
01:34:28,495 --> 01:34:30,372
I'm so sorry I got you caught up
in all this.

2251
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:32,559
I can't apologize enough.

2252
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:33,560
I can't apologize enough.

2253
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:35,586
I can't apologize enough.

2254
01:34:38,881 --> 01:34:40,591
What the hell are you doing?

2255
01:34:41,049 --> 01:34:42,217
It's beginning to harden.

2256
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:45,179
This is real cement, Y'know?

2257
01:34:46,513 --> 01:34:47,490
We can't wait
or it'll never come off.

2258
01:34:47,514 --> 01:34:48,491
We can't wait
or it'll never come off.

2259
01:34:48,515 --> 01:34:49,995
We can't wait
or it'll never come off.

2260
01:34:51,685 --> 01:34:52,685
Put your feet back.

2261
01:34:52,728 --> 01:34:53,705
But it's about to set.

2262
01:34:53,729 --> 01:34:55,105
But it's about to set.

2263
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:56,230
Put 'em back!

2264
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,089
Director, sir...

2265
01:35:24,176 --> 01:35:25,153
It just occurred to me...
this isn't a movie.

2266
01:35:25,177 --> 01:35:26,154
It just occurred to me...
this isn't a movie.

2267
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:27,938
It just occurred to me...
this isn't a movie.

2268
01:35:53,747 --> 01:35:55,666
Everything we shot so far?

2269
01:35:58,543 --> 01:36:00,545
The big shoot-out?

2270
01:36:04,007 --> 01:36:04,984
No movie, after all that...

2271
01:36:05,008 --> 01:36:06,301
No movie, after all that...

2272
01:36:07,678 --> 01:36:08,655
My performance isn't on film.

2273
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:10,430
My performance isn't on film.

2274
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,141
I'll never give another like it.

2275
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:14,953
What are you talking about?
Just shut up.

2276
01:36:14,977 --> 01:36:15,954
What are you talking about?
Just shut up.

2277
01:36:15,978 --> 01:36:16,955
What are you talking about?
Just shut up.

2278
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,579
What are you talking about?
Just shut up.

2279
01:36:24,778 --> 01:36:25,654
Don't say a word.

2280
01:36:25,737 --> 01:36:26,839
- But...
- Forget it. Just run.

2281
01:36:26,863 --> 01:36:27,906
- But...
- Shut up.

2282
01:36:28,657 --> 01:36:30,659
Don't worry about me. Go.

2283
01:36:30,742 --> 01:36:31,410
What about me?

2284
01:36:31,493 --> 01:36:33,036
Okay, okay...

2285
01:36:37,332 --> 01:36:38,309
Might I trouble you, too?

2286
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:40,168
Might I trouble you, too?

2287
01:36:40,252 --> 01:36:41,920
Wait your turn.

2288
01:36:44,006 --> 01:36:45,048
Mari-san...

2289
01:36:48,593 --> 01:36:49,570
Save falling-out for later.

2290
01:36:49,594 --> 01:36:51,013
Save falling-out for later.

2291
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:52,597
No... I deserve it.

2292
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:53,765
Just get out of here.

2293
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:54,516
Come with us.

2294
01:36:54,599 --> 01:36:55,475
That's impossible.

2295
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:56,476
But if we leave you...

2296
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,537
I'll be okay. Don't worry.

2297
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,521
I'll be okay. Don't worry.

2298
01:37:06,528 --> 01:37:08,280
I'll take care of the rest.

2299
01:37:10,907 --> 01:37:11,884
Now I've paid you back.

2300
01:37:11,908 --> 01:37:12,885
Now I've paid you back.

2301
01:37:12,909 --> 01:37:14,161
Now I've paid you back.

2302
01:37:17,205 --> 01:37:18,832
If I see you again...

2303
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:20,876
I'll kill you.

2304
01:37:22,586 --> 01:37:23,563
Get a move on. Quick.

2305
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:24,564
Get a move on. Quick.

2306
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:25,630
Get a move on. Quick.

2307
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,050
I promise I'll rescue you.

2308
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:29,384
Piss off.

2309
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,178
Excuse me...

2310
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:33,156
I think it's set.

2311
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:34,306
I think it's set.

2312
01:37:47,069 --> 01:37:48,403
Murata-san...

2313
01:37:50,405 --> 01:37:51,573
Murata-san...

2314
01:37:51,656 --> 01:37:52,866
Wait a sec.

2315
01:38:01,666 --> 01:38:03,126
Sorry to bother you.

2316
01:38:04,586 --> 01:38:05,586
Excuse me.

2317
01:38:09,549 --> 01:38:11,093
By any chance...

2318
01:38:13,303 --> 01:38:14,280
are you Makoto Takase
of “Underworld Sidekick”?

2319
01:38:14,304 --> 01:38:15,281
Are you Makoto Takase
of “Underworld Sidekick”?

2320
01:38:15,305 --> 01:38:16,282
Are you Makoto Takase
of “Underworld Sidekick”?

2321
01:38:16,306 --> 01:38:18,146
Are you Makoto Takase
of “Underworld Sidekick”?

2322
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:23,772
I am he.

2323
01:38:31,196 --> 01:38:32,173
Everyone, it's HIM!

2324
01:38:32,197 --> 01:38:33,782
Everyone, it's HIM!

2325
01:38:34,324 --> 01:38:35,325
We should leave.

2326
01:38:35,951 --> 01:38:36,928
That last look you gave her
was sublime.

2327
01:38:36,952 --> 01:38:38,829
That last look you gave her
was sublime.

2328
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:40,163
Thank you.

2329
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:44,852
Sorry... but I'm in a rush.

2330
01:38:44,876 --> 01:38:46,128
Sorry... but I'm in a rush.

2331
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:48,255
I'm Taiki Murata.

2332
01:38:48,338 --> 01:38:48,964
Hurry.

2333
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:50,465
I'm an actor, too.

2334
01:38:54,886 --> 01:38:55,863
I had a change of heart.
I won't run off again.

2335
01:38:55,887 --> 01:38:56,864
I had a change of heart.
I won't run off again.

2336
01:38:56,888 --> 01:38:57,865
I had a change of heart.
I won't run off again.

2337
01:38:57,889 --> 01:38:59,729
I had a change of heart.
I won't run off again.

2338
01:39:02,894 --> 01:39:04,896
I'll stay right by your side.

2339
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:05,957
So please let the others go.

2340
01:39:05,981 --> 01:39:06,958
So please let the others go.

2341
01:39:06,982 --> 01:39:07,959
So please let the others go.

2342
01:39:07,983 --> 01:39:09,526
So please let the others go.

2343
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:12,821
For me.

2344
01:39:15,991 --> 01:39:16,968
Where have you been?
I'm leaving. This place is crap.

2345
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:17,969
Where have you been?
I'm leaving. This place is crap.

2346
01:39:17,993 --> 01:39:19,720
Where have you been?
I'm leaving. This place is crap.

2347
01:39:19,744 --> 01:39:20,721
Wait. I'll come with you.

2348
01:39:20,745 --> 01:39:22,414
Wait. I'll come with you.

2349
01:39:23,206 --> 01:39:24,624
Murata-san...

2350
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:26,293
One thing's for sure...

2351
01:39:27,502 --> 01:39:28,479
your performance was perfect.

2352
01:39:28,503 --> 01:39:30,172
Your performance was perfect.

2353
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:33,425
What would you know?

2354
01:39:38,763 --> 01:39:39,740
What do you get up to every day?

2355
01:39:39,764 --> 01:39:41,516
What do you get up to every day?

2356
01:39:41,641 --> 01:39:42,618
I'll charge his fee to your room.

2357
01:39:42,642 --> 01:39:44,186
I'll charge his fee to your room.

2358
01:39:44,561 --> 01:39:46,521
Take care.

2359
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:48,356
Thanks again, Doc'.

2360
01:39:58,825 --> 01:39:59,802
Just forget that woman.

2361
01:39:59,826 --> 01:40:01,036
Just forget that woman.

2362
01:40:03,121 --> 01:40:04,098
What's she going to do?

2363
01:40:04,122 --> 01:40:05,999
What's she going to do?

2364
01:40:10,462 --> 01:40:11,439
Listen, women are more ballsy
than guys think.

2365
01:40:11,463 --> 01:40:12,440
Listen, women are more ballsy
than guys think.

2366
01:40:12,464 --> 01:40:13,441
Listen, women are more ballsy
than guys think.

2367
01:40:13,465 --> 01:40:14,442
Listen, women are more ballsy
than guys think.

2368
01:40:14,466 --> 01:40:16,266

2443
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:09,891
It's not bad.

2444
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:19,859

An amazing feat of memory.

2523
01:47:16,679 --> 01:47:18,139
What are their demands?

2524
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:20,558
They want a hostage swap.

2525
01:47:21,309 --> 01:47:23,311
“Hand Mari over to us.”

2526
01:47:27,899 --> 01:47:29,442
He wants what?

2527
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:33,047
He was always such a foolish lad.

2528
01:47:33,071 --> 01:47:34,572
He was always such a foolish lad.

2529
01:47:38,576 --> 01:47:39,553
It means he must die.
You've no objection?

2533
01:47:46,668 --> 01:47:47,645
It's such a waste.

2534
01:47:47,669 --> 01:47:49,045
It's such a waste.

2535
01:47:49,837 --> 01:47:50,814

magic hour.

2627
01:51:13,708 --> 01:51:14,685
As long as the sun continues to rise.

2628
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:16,377
As long as the sun continues to rise.

2629
01:51:19,213 --> 01:51:20,190

2634
01:51:26,053 --> 01:51:27,030

2637
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:30,868
Don't be so sure.

2638
01:51:30,892 --> 01:51:32,560
Don't be so sure.

2639
01:51:33,769 --> 01:51:34,746

2648
01:51:46,365 --> 01:51:47,450
No way...

2649
01:51:48,534 --> 01:51:49,511
The reason I make it
up on the big screen

2650

2653
01:51:52,872 --> 01:51:53,849
is thanks to the crew's support.

2654
01:51:53,873 --> 01:51:55,153

It was perfect.

2664
01:52:13,309 --> 01:52:14,286
The location was freezing.

2665
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:15,287
The location was freezing.

2666
01:52:15,311 --> 01:52:16,938

not to let my nose run.

2670
01:52:20,358 --> 01:52:22,276
I was just struggling
not to let my nose run.

2671
01:52:26,781 --> 01:52:27,758
Isn't it too early to give up?

2672
01:52:27,782 --> 01:52:28,759
Isn't it too early to give up?

2673
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:29,760
Isn't it too early to give up?

2674
01:52:29,784 --> 01:52:31,077
Isn't it too early to give up?

2675
01:52:33,454 --> 01:52:34,431
You're young.

2676
01:52:34,455 --> 01:52:35,831
You're young.

2677
01:52:40,753 --> 01:52:42,296
Not to mention...

2678
01:52:43,464 --> 01:52:44,441
between you and me...
I'm still waiting myself

2679
01:52:44,465 --> 01:52:45,442
between you and me...
I'm still waiting myself

2680
01:52:45,466 --> 01:52:46,443
between you and me...
I'm still waiting myself

2681
01:52:46,467 --> 01:52:47,444
between you and me...
I'm still waiting myself

2682
01:52:47,468 --> 01:52:48,445
between you and me...
I'm still waiting myself

2683
01:52:48,469 --> 01:52:50,269
between you and me...
I'm still waiting myself

2684
01:52:50,805 --> 01:52:51,782
for the next magic hour.

2685
01:52:51,806 --> 01:52:53,391
For the next magic hour.

2686
01:52:57,019 --> 01:52:57,996
Even at this age, still holding on...

2687
01:52:58,020 --> 01:52:58,997
Even at this age, still holding on...

2688
01:52:59,021 --> 01:52:59,998
Even at this age, still holding on...

2689
01:53:00,022 --> 01:53:00,999
Even at this age, still holding on...

2690
01:53:01,023 --> 01:53:02,503
Even at this age, still holding on...

2691
01:53:07,863 --> 01:53:08,840
We're about ready for you, sir.

2692
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:10,491
We're about ready for you, sir.

2693
01:53:20,042 --> 01:53:21,019
No choice but to keep going.

2694
01:53:21,043 --> 01:53:22,962
No choice but to keep going.

2695
01:54:10,593 --> 01:54:11,570
More to the right, mate.

2696
01:54:11,594 --> 01:54:12,720
More to the right, mate.

2697
01:54:13,179 --> 01:54:14,388
Okay.

2698
01:54:40,164 --> 01:54:41,248
Take it.

2699
01:54:43,292 --> 01:54:44,269
There's a letter in the pocket.
Do what it says.

2700
01:54:44,293 --> 01:54:46,173
There's a letter in the pocket.
Do what it says.

2701
01:54:49,131 --> 01:54:50,466
Thank you.

2702
01:54:51,592 --> 01:54:52,569
You weren't an actress, then?

2703
01:54:52,593 --> 01:54:54,595
You weren't an actress, then?

2704
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:56,389
That's right.

2705
01:55:00,017 --> 01:55:00,994
I don't date non-actors.

2706
01:55:01,018 --> 01:55:02,144
I don't date non-actors.

2707
01:55:03,854 --> 01:55:04,831
Sorry. Got to go.

2708
01:55:04,855 --> 01:55:06,232
Sorry. Got to go.

2709
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:22,850
Wait a second.

2710
01:56:30,024 --> 01:56:31,108
Get going.

2711
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:37,257
I won't see you for a while.

2712
01:56:37,281 --> 01:56:38,449
I won't see you for a while.

2713
01:56:38,991 --> 01:56:39,968
I'm sure I won't forget you.

2714
01:56:39,992 --> 01:56:41,243
I'm sure I won't forget you.

2715
01:56:42,203 --> 01:56:43,180
I love this town.

2716
01:56:43,204 --> 01:56:44,788
I love this town.

2717
01:56:51,921 --> 01:56:52,898
What are those guys up to?

2718
01:56:52,922 --> 01:56:53,899
What are those guys up to?

2719
01:56:53,923 --> 01:56:55,049
What are those guys up to?

2720
01:56:55,299 --> 01:56:56,276
About to start
the performance of their lives.

2721
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:57,277
About to start
the performance of their lives.

2722
01:56:57,301 --> 01:56:58,945
About to start
the performance of their lives.

2723
01:56:58,969 --> 01:56:59,946
<i>Performance.. for who?</i>

2724
01:56:59,970 --> 01:57:01,347
<i>Performance.. for who?</i>

2725
01:57:01,847 --> 01:57:02,824
The town boss.

2726
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:04,350
The town boss.

2727
01:58:15,546 --> 01:58:17,298
It's all going to plan.

2728
01:58:34,773 --> 01:58:35,608
Stop!

2729
01:58:35,691 --> 01:58:36,817
Stop the car!

2730
01:58:48,454 --> 01:58:49,431
The authorities are waiting on the
main road. The boss is finished.

2731
01:58:49,455 --> 01:58:50,432
The authorities are waiting on the
main road. The boss is finished.

2732
01:58:50,456 --> 01:58:51,433
The authorities are waiting on the
main road. The boss is finished.

2733
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:52,434
The authorities are waiting on the
main road. The boss is finished.

2734
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:55,098
The authorities are waiting on the
main road. The boss is finished.

2735
01:59:00,007 --> 01:59:01,216
Let's go.

2736
01:59:01,925 --> 01:59:02,925
Wait right there!

2737
01:59:06,805 --> 01:59:07,782
Master Togashi...
sorry about the other night.

2738
01:59:07,806 --> 01:59:08,783
Master Togashi...
sorry about the other night.

2739
01:59:08,807 --> 01:59:10,607
Master Togashi...
sorry about the other night.

2740
01:59:10,768 --> 01:59:12,144
You clowns are back, huh?

2741
01:59:12,227 --> 01:59:13,204
Chief, ain't that the boss's girl?

2742
01:59:13,228 --> 01:59:14,813
Chief, ain't that the boss's girl?

2743
01:59:15,856 --> 01:59:16,833
Like the proverbial lamb
to the slaughter...

2744
01:59:16,857 --> 01:59:18,577
Like the proverbial lamb
to the slaughter...

2745
01:59:18,692 --> 01:59:19,669
Hand her over to us.

2746
01:59:19,693 --> 01:59:20,861
Hand her over to us.

2747
01:59:21,654 --> 01:59:22,696
Go on ahead.

2748
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:23,447
But...

2749
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:24,698
Don't worry about me.

2750
01:59:41,924 --> 01:59:43,842
Aren't you overdoing it a bit?

2751
01:59:49,473 --> 01:59:51,058
I'm not afraid to die.

2752
01:59:52,059 --> 01:59:53,036
What I fear
is living on without honor.

2753
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:54,037
What I fear
is living on without honor.

2754
01:59:54,061 --> 01:59:55,038
What I fear
is living on without honor.

2755
01:59:55,062 --> 01:59:56,582
What I fear
is living on without honor.

2756
01:59:59,983 --> 02:00:00,960
We'll be together
next time around.

2757
02:00:00,984 --> 02:00:01,961
We'll be together
next time around.

2758
02:00:01,985 --> 02:00:03,445
We'll be together
next time around.

2759
02:00:05,072 --> 02:00:06,049
Wanchai... look after Sayoko.

2760
02:00:06,073 --> 02:00:08,075
Wanchai... look after Sayoko.

2761
02:00:10,035 --> 02:00:11,578
Look after Mari.

2762
02:00:12,287 --> 02:00:13,287
Trust me.

2763
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:14,307
Quick, the boat's leaving.

2764
02:00:14,331 --> 02:00:15,308
Quick, the boat's leaving.

2765
02:00:15,332 --> 02:00:16,750
Quick, the boat's leaving.

2766
02:00:16,959 --> 02:00:17,959
The boat?

2767
02:00:18,043 --> 02:00:19,753
A car's waiting over there.

2768
02:00:20,254 --> 02:00:21,630
Hand over the woman.

2769
02:00:23,757 --> 02:00:24,757
Go, now.

2770
02:00:44,737 --> 02:00:45,714
Wait a goddamn minute!

2771
02:00:45,738 --> 02:00:46,715
Wait a goddamn minute!

2772
02:00:46,739 --> 02:00:48,323
Wait a goddamn minute!

2773
02:01:04,298 --> 02:01:05,275
If there's to be killing, then kill me.

2774
02:01:05,299 --> 02:01:06,859
If there's to be killing, then kill me.

2775
02:01:06,967 --> 02:01:08,260
- Step aside
- I won't...

2776
02:01:08,343 --> 02:01:10,137
This is my show.

2777
02:01:10,804 --> 02:01:11,781
I have no idea
who the hell you are.

2778
02:01:11,805 --> 02:01:12,782
I have no idea
who the hell you are.

2779
02:01:12,806 --> 02:01:14,206
I have no idea
who the hell you are.

2780
02:01:14,475 --> 02:01:16,477
Anyway... Mari, get away.

2781
02:01:18,103 --> 02:01:19,772
Just get out of here.

2782
02:01:22,149 --> 02:01:23,126
You're after me, right?

2783
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:24,693
You're after me, right?

2784
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:26,337
If you're going to shoot, shoot.

2785
02:01:26,361 --> 02:01:27,946
If you're going to shoot, shoot.

2786
02:01:29,490 --> 02:01:30,467
Shoot me. I dare you.

2787
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:32,117
Shoot me. I dare you.

2788
02:01:32,868 --> 02:01:33,845
You understand Japanese.
Shoot.

2789
02:01:33,869 --> 02:01:34,846
You understand Japanese.
Shoot.

2790
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:36,497
You understand Japanese.
Shoot.

2791
02:01:37,122 --> 02:01:38,099
Something strange is going on.

2792
02:01:38,123 --> 02:01:39,458
Something strange is going on.

2793
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:41,603
I've lost everything.

2794
02:01:41,627 --> 02:01:43,587
I've lost everything.

2795
02:01:45,130 --> 02:01:47,132
The Ebora gang took over my town.

2796
02:01:47,841 --> 02:01:48,818
If my accountant testifies,
I lose my company.

2797
02:01:48,842 --> 02:01:49,819
If my accountant testifies,
I lose my company.

2798
02:01:49,843 --> 02:01:51,804
If my accountant testifies,
I lose my company.

2799
02:01:53,222 --> 02:01:54,681
It's over.

2800
02:01:57,851 --> 02:01:58,828
If I can lay down my life
to save Mari, then so be it.

2801
02:01:58,852 --> 02:01:59,829
If I can lay down my life
to save Mari, then so be it.

2802
02:01:59,853 --> 02:02:00,830
If I can lay down my life
to save Mari, then so be it.

2803
02:02:00,854 --> 02:02:02,974
If I can lay down my life
to save Mari, then so be it.

2804
02:02:03,065 --> 02:02:04,149
You really mean it?

2805
02:02:04,233 --> 02:02:05,818
Of course I do.

2806
02:02:07,194 --> 02:02:08,194
Kid...

2807
02:02:09,863 --> 02:02:11,824
take care of Mari for me.

2808
02:02:15,619 --> 02:02:16,596
So... open fire.

2809
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:18,413
So... open fire.

2810
02:02:19,581 --> 02:02:20,581
Shoot.

2811
02:02:21,542 --> 02:02:22,876
Wait!

2812
02:02:24,336 --> 02:02:25,313
I'm sorry. I'm fine after all.

2813
02:02:25,337 --> 02:02:27,297
I'm sorry. I'm fine after all.

2814
02:02:32,886 --> 02:02:33,863
I'm not going anywhere.

2815
02:02:33,887 --> 02:02:35,055
I'm not going anywhere.

2816
02:02:36,765 --> 02:02:37,432
But...

2817
02:02:37,558 --> 02:02:38,851
It's fine.

2818
02:02:45,107 --> 02:02:46,084
Damn. Let's go, guys.

2819
02:02:46,108 --> 02:02:47,693
Damn. Let's go, guys.

2820
02:02:57,578 --> 02:02:58,555
Overawed by Your courage.

2821
02:02:58,579 --> 02:02:59,830
Overawed by Your courage.

2822
02:03:03,542 --> 02:03:04,585
Who...

2823
02:03:05,127 --> 02:03:06,104
Who the hell are you?

2824
02:03:06,128 --> 02:03:07,296
Who the hell are you?

2825
02:03:13,218 --> 02:03:14,195
I'll stay with you forever.

2826
02:03:14,219 --> 02:03:15,196
I'll stay with you forever.

2827
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:16,197
I'll stay with you forever.

2828
02:03:16,221 --> 02:03:17,431
I'll stay with you forever.

2829
02:03:20,267 --> 02:03:21,018
Excuse me...

2830
02:03:21,101 --> 02:03:22,477
Sorry about this.

2831
02:03:22,686 --> 02:03:23,770
That's not the point...

2832
02:03:23,896 --> 02:03:24,873
This man needs me.
I just realized that at last.

2833
02:03:24,897 --> 02:03:25,874
This man needs me.
I just realized that at last.

2834
02:03:25,898 --> 02:03:26,875
This man needs me.
I just realized that at last.

2835
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:28,779
This man needs me.
I just realized that at last.

2836
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:30,336
But I've lost everything.

2837
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:31,653
But I've lost everything.

2838
02:03:31,778 --> 02:03:33,363
You've got me.

2839
02:03:34,281 --> 02:03:35,949
It's going to be hell.

2840
02:03:36,783 --> 02:03:38,493
Just where I want to be.

2841
02:03:40,871 --> 02:03:41,848
That's the deal, I guess.

2842
02:03:41,872 --> 02:03:43,832
That's the deal, I guess.

2843
02:03:43,957 --> 02:03:44,957
My bad.

2844
02:03:46,168 --> 02:03:47,794
But...

2845
02:03:48,128 --> 02:03:49,105
If that's the way it is...
tough luck.

2846
02:03:49,129 --> 02:03:50,106
If that's the way it is...
tough luck.

2847
02:03:50,130 --> 02:03:51,610
If that's the way it is...
tough luck.

2848
02:03:57,262 --> 02:03:58,239
Damn, it sorted itself out.

2849
02:03:58,263 --> 02:03:59,240
Damn, it sorted itself out.

2850
02:03:59,264 --> 02:04:00,241
Damn, it sorted itself out.

2851
02:04:00,265 --> 02:04:01,683
Damn, it sorted itself out.

2852
02:04:02,267 --> 02:04:03,244
The manager must be in shock.

2853
02:04:03,268 --> 02:04:04,519
The manager must be in shock.

2854
02:04:04,645 --> 02:04:05,622
It'll take him a while to recover.

2855
02:04:05,646 --> 02:04:07,064
It'll take him a while to recover.

2856
02:04:09,983 --> 02:04:10,960
Mari, I'm going to look after you
properly from now on.

2857
02:04:10,984 --> 02:04:11,961
Mari, I'm going to look after you
properly from now on.

2858
02:04:11,985 --> 02:04:12,962
Mari, I'm going to look after you
properly from now on.

2859
02:04:12,986 --> 02:04:14,380
Mari, I'm going to look after you
properly from now on.

2860
02:04:14,404 --> 02:04:15,381
Don't hesitate to tell me
if I mess up.

2861
02:04:15,405 --> 02:04:17,074
Don't hesitate to tell me
if I mess up.

2862
02:04:18,116 --> 02:04:19,409
Let's go.

2863
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:21,137
Goodbye everyone. We're off.

2864
02:04:21,161 --> 02:04:22,996
Goodbye everyone. We're off.

2865
02:04:24,623 --> 02:04:25,623
Mari-san...

2866
02:04:28,085 --> 02:04:29,336
Good bye.

2867
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:30,647
Sorry it turned out like this, huh?

2868
02:04:30,671 --> 02:04:32,297
Sorry it turned out like this, huh?

2869
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:34,841
Let me drive.

2870
02:04:34,925 --> 02:04:36,051
Are you sure?

2871
02:04:37,052 --> 02:04:38,029
Let's go eat. Noodles, yeah?

2872
02:04:38,053 --> 02:04:39,513
Let's go eat. Noodles, yeah?

2873
02:04:56,697 --> 02:04:58,573
What was supposed to happen?

2874
02:04:59,491 --> 02:05:00,468
Murata-san gets shot
then Mari gets riddled with bullets.

2875
02:05:00,492 --> 02:05:02,387
Murata-san gets shot
then Mari gets riddled with bullets.

2876
02:05:02,411 --> 02:05:03,388
I drag the bodies over to that car

2877
02:05:03,412 --> 02:05:04,389
I drag the bodies over to that car

2878
02:05:04,413 --> 02:05:05,998
I drag the bodies over to that car

2879
02:05:06,081 --> 02:05:07,874
then we all go up in flames.

2880
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,042
It's too long.

2881
02:05:09,167 --> 02:05:10,144
But this ending was worse.

2882
02:05:10,168 --> 02:05:11,461
But this ending was worse.

2883
02:05:12,546 --> 02:05:13,523
You wanted her to be happy.
Well, now she is.

2884
02:05:13,547 --> 02:05:14,524
You wanted her to be happy.
Well, now she is.

2885
02:05:14,548 --> 02:05:15,525
You wanted her to be happy.
Well, now she is.

2886
02:05:15,549 --> 02:05:17,309
You wanted her to be happy.
Well, now she is.

2887
02:05:18,593 --> 02:05:19,928
Are you okay with this?

2888
02:05:22,389 --> 02:05:23,366
Of course not.

2889
02:05:23,390 --> 02:05:24,474
Of course not.

2890
02:05:24,891 --> 02:05:25,868
I've never seen such
a half-baked ending.

2891
02:05:25,892 --> 02:05:26,869
I've never seen such
a half-baked ending.

2892
02:05:26,893 --> 02:05:28,493
I've never seen such
a half-baked ending.

2893
02:05:30,397 --> 02:05:31,606
Terrible plotting.

2894
02:05:37,738 --> 02:05:38,715
Don't quit on this note.

2895
02:05:38,739 --> 02:05:40,449
Don't quit on this note.

2896
02:05:41,742 --> 02:05:42,826
Right.

2897
02:06:00,594 --> 02:06:02,387
What's with that sad look?

2898
02:06:03,597 --> 02:06:04,574
I can't bear to be here any longer.

2899
02:06:04,598 --> 02:06:06,058
I can't bear to be here any longer.

2900
02:06:06,933 --> 02:06:08,101
What'll you do?

2901
02:06:09,186 --> 02:06:10,163
Think things over slowly.

2902
02:06:10,187 --> 02:06:11,438
Think things over slowly.

2903
02:06:13,190 --> 02:06:14,167
You'll survive wherever you go.

2904
02:06:14,191 --> 02:06:15,168
You'll survive wherever you go.

2905
02:06:15,192 --> 02:06:17,152
You'll survive wherever you go.

2906
02:06:28,872 --> 02:06:30,290
Okay, then...

2907
02:06:32,334 --> 02:06:33,627
Let's get out of here.

2908
02:06:35,962 --> 02:06:36,939
Won't the crew feel bad
it's all over?

2909
02:06:36,963 --> 02:06:37,940
Won't the crew feel bad
it's all over?

2910
02:06:37,964 --> 02:06:39,444
Won't the crew feel bad
it's all over?

2911
02:06:40,008 --> 02:06:40,985
Shoots often get canceled.
I'll take them drinking.

2912
02:06:41,009 --> 02:06:41,986
Shoots often get canceled.
I'll take them drinking.

2913
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:44,010
Shoots often get canceled.
I'll take them drinking.

2914
02:06:45,305 --> 02:06:46,305
Murata-san.

2915
02:06:49,976 --> 02:06:51,561
Will we meet again?

2916
02:06:58,110 --> 02:06:59,087
If you want to see me
go watch movies.

2917
02:06:59,111 --> 02:07:00,088
If you want to see me
go watch movies.

2918
02:07:00,112 --> 02:07:01,592
If you want to see me
go watch movies.

2919
02:07:03,990 --> 02:07:05,158
I look forward to that.

2920
02:07:08,495 --> 02:07:09,704
Look.

2921
02:07:12,833 --> 02:07:14,126
It's the hotel doctor.

2922
02:07:32,727 --> 02:07:33,704
How dare you steal my identity.

2923
02:07:33,728 --> 02:07:35,188
How dare you steal my identity.

2924
02:07:36,565 --> 02:07:38,024
Della Togashi!

2925
02:07:42,904 --> 02:07:44,364
Put down the gun.

2926
02:08:03,133 --> 02:08:04,926
Actually Della Togashi

2927
02:08:06,636 --> 02:08:07,762
IS me.

2928
02:08:14,144 --> 02:08:15,121
Then naturally, one of us
must cease to exist.

2929
02:08:15,145 --> 02:08:16,122
Then naturally, one of us
must cease to exist.

2930
02:08:16,146 --> 02:08:17,123
Then naturally, one of us
must cease to exist.

2931
02:08:17,147 --> 02:08:19,107
Then naturally, one of us
must cease to exist.

2932
02:08:24,738 --> 02:08:25,715
Seems you don't know why Togashi
is such a legendary killer.

2933
02:08:25,739 --> 02:08:26,716
Seems you don't know why Togashi
is such a legendary killer.

2934
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:27,717
Seems you don't know why Togashi
is such a legendary killer.

2935
02:08:27,741 --> 02:08:29,468
Seems you don't know why Togashi
is such a legendary killer.

2936
02:08:29,492 --> 02:08:30,469
Because he never shows himself.

2937
02:08:30,493 --> 02:08:32,204
Because he never shows himself.

2938
02:08:33,205 --> 02:08:34,915
Which leads to imposters.

2939
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,458
That's not all.

2940
02:08:37,918 --> 02:08:38,895
When Della Kills,
he doesn't even need a weapon.

2941
02:08:38,919 --> 02:08:40,921
When Della Kills,
he doesn't even need a weapon.

2942
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:42,607
Because he's a natural-born assassin.

2943
02:08:42,631 --> 02:08:43,608
Because he's a natural-born assassin.

2944
02:08:43,632 --> 02:08:44,609
Because he's a natural-born assassin.

2945
02:08:44,633 --> 02:08:46,343
Because he's a natural-born assassin.

2946
02:08:55,602 --> 02:08:56,937
Here we go, boys!

2947
02:09:18,375 --> 02:09:19,626
Who wants to die?

2948
02:09:28,510 --> 02:09:29,510
What are you doing?

2949
02:09:34,474 --> 02:09:35,474
Natsuko...

2950
02:10:34,034 --> 02:10:35,011
Make me your apprentice.

2951
02:10:35,035 --> 02:10:36,244
Make me your apprentice.

2952
02:10:37,454 --> 02:10:38,496
It'll be tough going.

2953
02:10:38,580 --> 02:10:39,914
I'll do my best.

2954
02:10:44,127 --> 02:10:45,127
It's okay, guys.

2955
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:53,595
That was perfect, chief.

2956
02:10:57,724 --> 02:10:58,701
Wow, it was like a movie.

2957
02:10:58,725 --> 02:10:59,934
Wow, it was like a movie.

2958
02:11:00,602 --> 02:11:01,602
So?

2959
02:11:03,021 --> 02:11:03,998
When do I see rushes, sir?

2960
02:11:04,022 --> 02:11:05,190
When do I see rushes, sir?

2961
02:11:11,821 --> 02:11:13,615
Good work, everyone!

2962
02:11:14,407 --> 02:11:16,409
We're on the move!
