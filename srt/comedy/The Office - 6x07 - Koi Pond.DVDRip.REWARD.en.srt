00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:07,735
Oh, yeah!

4
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,207
Woo-hoo!
KEVIN: Jim and Pam!

5
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,574
How was Puerto Rico? Was
it so romantic? JIM: It was.

6
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:13,634
It really was.

7
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:14,805
Really was.

8
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,712
I'm so happy for you.

9
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,011
Puerto Rico
was awesome.

10
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,109
Oh, my gosh. The honeymoon was great.

11
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,586
We met this other couple at
the resort, Frank and Benny.

12
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,145
We hung out
with them a lot.

13

Beans. Always makes her laugh.

Frank and Beans.

15
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,322
Is there someone there?
Who's there?

16
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,925
I hear voices.
Is somebody there?

17
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,094
Yeah!

18
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,130
Is someone here? I can't
see you because I'm blind.

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,470
DWIGHT: It's Jim
and Pam, Michael.

20
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,033
MICHAEL: (GASPS) It is?
DWIGHT: Yeah.

21
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,442
They're back?

Pam.
Nope.

24
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,780
And, oh, Jim.

25
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,184
Hi, Michael.

26
00:00:55,255 --> 00:01:00,090
I haven't seen you since my
accident that I had when I fell...

27
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:04,525
I fell into the pool
of acid, eyes-first.

28

Blind guy.

29
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,869
Blind Guy McSqueezy.
How do I describe it?

30
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,030
It is a character
I've been workshopping,

31
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,633
whose lack of vision gets
him into all sorts of trouble.

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,507
The women in my improv
class absolutely hate him.

(EXCLAIMING)

34
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,808
So, what'd you
bring us?

35
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,147
Some candy.

36
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,278
What else?

37
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,343
That's it.

38
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,186
Oh, because you spent
so much on the wedding.

This conversation has
two items on the agenda.

43
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,716
Did we have a conversation scheduled?

44
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,758
Number one, do not leave
your things on my desk.

45
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,521
It's not some kind of personal
pen receptacle for you.

46
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,290
I don't care how high
they promote you.

47
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,093
Which brings me
to item number two.

48
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,498
I never formally congratulated
you on your promotion,

49
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,868
so I'd just like to
say congratulations.

50
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:25,038
Wow. That's really thoughtful
of you, Dwight. Thank you.

51
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,135
You're welcome.

<i>Only this time the mallard
skins the toad alive.</i>

And, of course,
in this version,

58
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,958
you lose the whole veiled
critique of the Kaiser thing.

59
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,991
I'm sorry to have been
bugging you all these years.

60
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,595
It's a real
handsome duck.

61
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,696
Mallard.

62
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,832
Okay, I'll get out
of your hair.

63
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,440
Hey.
Hey.

64
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,416
We brought back some
Puerto Rican candy.

65
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,578
Coco-Leche. That's
my favorite. Awesome.

66
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,383
I'll leave it up here
so everyone can enjoy it.

67
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,720
Oh, let me just check
with Michael first.

68
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,885
I think it'll be okay.

69
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,759
I think it will, too, but I'll
just check with him, though.

70
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,819
Great.

71
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,423
Oops. Sorry. Oops!

72
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,401
I have recently
taken a lover.

73
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,072
Well, that's great.
Congratulations.

74
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,944
Who's the lucky lady?

75
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,244
Pam's mom.

76
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,254
What?
Pam's mom, Helene.

77
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,550
Remember,
from your wedding?

78
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,058
You're messing with me.
About what?

79
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,854
You did not have
sex with Pam's mom.

80
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:48,951
Oh, big time.

81
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,017
What kind of car
does she drive?

82
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,654
She drives a green Camry, (BLEEP)

83
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,495
And the seats go
all the way down.

84
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,556
All the way down.

85
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,897
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,026
Oh, my God.

00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,732
(LAUGHS) What?

88
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,367
Okay, never tell Pam,
and then, secondly...

89
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,934
Good. A pact. A pact.

90
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,206

to break it tonight,

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,181
when Helene and I
tell Pam over dinner.

92
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,308
You all right?

93
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,408
Oh, my God.

94
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,510
Hey, Jim... Not now, Toby. My God!

95
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,521
Jesus. Get the hell out of here, idiot!

96
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,647
TOBY: What did I do?

97
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,249
Okay, as far as dinner
tonight, cancel that,

98
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,317
and please,
for both of our sakes,

99
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:26,195
never, ever,
ever see her again.

100
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,166
I think you're
underestimating Pam.

101
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,668
I think more than anything,
she wants me to be happy.

102
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,637
No. Not more
than anything.

103
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,967
Okay. I...

104
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,031
I have a good thing with the
mom. Don't call her "the mom."

105
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,440
She's right on my way
home from work.

106
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,875
Then take a different
way home, man!

107
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,278
All right,
I'll take surface streets.

108
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,240
The last thing in the world I
would want to do is upset Pam.

109
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,808
Okay. So, we're good.

110
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,978
Yeah.

111
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,852
Can you change my dinner
reservations from four people to two?

112
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,191
Sure. Is it okay
if I put out some candy

113
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,787
that Pam brought back
from Puerto Rico?

114
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,856
Sure.
Thanks for asking.

115
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,491
Pam, we're all set.

116
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,434

00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,846
So, what'd we decide
for Michael?

120
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,715
The bottle of rum or
the seashell alarm clock?

121
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,722
You know what, can I have
the weekend to decide?

122
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,553
Bottle of rum it is.

123
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,752
All right, shall we?
You know what?

124
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,626
I am really slammed trying to
catch up on everything here,

125
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,757
and I know that
Michael's slammed, too,

126
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,769
so maybe we should do this when
things are a little less crazy.

127
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,074
Come on, it'll take two seconds.

Because obviously he doesn't
want to talk about it.

I would look really cute in it.

It has to go with the
persona that you already have.

Well, I think
I have that persona.

get that mallard?

Oh, Professor Damon D. Duck.
Jim gave him to me.

331
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,946
Okay, I gave that to him as
a gift. I'm taking that back.

332

I'll scream.

00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,093
You're so cool.

338
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,289
This reminds me, you owe
me three bucks for gas.

339

Hey, Toby, can I talk
to you for a minute?

340
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:35,991
Yeah, sure.

341
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,933
What's up?
I just wanted to apologize

342
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,937
for taking that tone
with you earlier.

343
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,200
That was uncalled for.
I'm sorry.

344
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,005
Yeah. That means a lot.
Thank you for saying it.

345
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,067
Can I sit down
for a second?

346
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,135
Yeah,
or pull up a chair,

347
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,510
or you can sit
on the shredder.

(CLEARS THROAT)

349
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,780
This is going
to sound weird,

350
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,791
but I think I may be the victim
of a hostile work environment

351
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,655
with this whole
Pam situation.

352
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,457
You should probably deal with
that outside of the workplace.

353
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,088
She brought it
into the workplace,

354
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,463
so I feel like it has
to be dealt with here.

355
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,503
Yeah. Okay, well, I
mean, I could talk to her.

356
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,559
Really?
Yeah.

357
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,367
Would you do that?
Yeah.

358
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,704
That's why they
pay me the big bucks.

Okay.

362
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,119
You know, I always knew if Michael
just took the time to get to know me,

363
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,677
we'd become friends.

364
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,958
Hey, Pam, could I talk
to you for a sec?

365
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,429
Sure. What's up?

366
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,432
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light
of everything that's happened today,

367
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,094
it would be a good idea
if you and me and Michael

368
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,036
head into the conference room
for some conflict resolution.

369
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,573
What's the matter? Can't
fight your own battles?

370
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,200
No, that's...

371
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,506
Maybe you should just take the
rest of the day off, you know?

372
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,444
Oh, would that make
you feel better?

373
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,142
I don't... I can't hear
your conversation.

374
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,118
You can tell Michael
that I'm not leaving.

375
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,088
Buddy, I think that you
can't make her leave...

376
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,684
Yeah, yeah, okay,
you're a jackass.

377
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,391
Hey, hey, you know what? You're
just as stubborn as your mother.

378
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,092
When you don't want to do
something, you just don't do it.

Michael, you're just her rebound!

381
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,968
You were right, Jim, I
should have listened to you.

382
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,973
Should never
have told her.

Okay, do you want me
to stop dating your mom?

388
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,290
Is that how we're going to
get past this? Because I will.

389
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,725
Hmm. Yes.

390
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,194
Well, that is not
going to happen.

391
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,560
Then why did you
even offer?

392
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,498
Because I assumed that
you want me to be happy,

393
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,092
because I want
you to be happy.

394
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,900
Michael, let me make
this very easy for you.

395
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,965
I could give a (BLEEP) About your
happiness. Stop dating my mother!

396
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,840
You know what? I'm going to
start dating her even harder.

397
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
What's that
supposed to mean?

398

You know what it means.

Yep.

I don't need to be
friends with Pam.

Dwight, you brought
the mallard back.

406
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,050
Well, I had to.
I mean, Kelly was not...

<i>Hi, buddy.</i>

408
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,767
I'm sorry.
A wooden duck?

409
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:02,205
Mallard. I put it in your
office in order to surveil you.

410
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,037
I was jealous that you
got the promotion over me.

411
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,875
Okay, just to be clear,
you're terrible at this.

412
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,812
And you're not equipped for
espionage. I'm equipped...

413
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,145
Stop.

414
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,274
Don't tell Michael.

I won't.

But you will wash
and buff our car.

So, Dwight heard you were
having a really rough day,

so he generously
offered to wash our car.
