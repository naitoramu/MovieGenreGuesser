2x01 : The Dundies
by Belkiss, Occeanne et Unfold
http://pmag.f2o.org/theofficeus/
2
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:37,422
Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee
world's night here at Dunder Mifflin

3
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:42,880
and this is everybody's favorite day,
everybody looks forward to it.

4
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:47,893
Because, you know a lot of the people
here don't get trophies very often

5
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:51,624
like Meredith or Kevin. I mean, who's gonna
give Kevin an award ? Dunkin Donuts ?

6
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:54,453
Plus, bonus, it's really really funny.

7
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:58,070
So I..., you know an employee will go
home, and he'll tell his neighbor :

8
00:00:58,077 --> 00:01:00,644
"Hey, did you get an award ?"
And the neighbor will say :

9
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:04,413
"No man, I mean I slave all day,
nobody notices me."

10
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:09,640
Next thing you know, employee smells something
terrible coming from the neighbor’s house :

11
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:13,786
Neighbor’s hanged himself,
due to lack of recognition.

12
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:19,190
So you're ready for the Dundies ?

13
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:20,756
You know what they say about a car wreck
where it's so awful you can't look away ?

14
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:27,912
The Dundies are like a car wreck that
you want you have to stare at it,

15
00:01:27,928 --> 00:01:30,373
because your boss is making you.

16
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:35,543
It's fat Halpert

17
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:41,982
- What ?
- Fat Halpert, Jim Halpert.

18
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:46,710
So why don't I take you on a
tour of past Dundee winners ?

19
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:52,221
We got fat Jim Halpert here, Jim why don't
you show off your Dundies to the camera ?

20
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:56,302
Oh I can't, because I keep them hidden,
I don't wanna look at them and get cocky.

21
00:01:56,305 --> 00:02:01,002
- Oh, that's a good idea.
- And mine are at home,
in a display case about my bed.

22
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:03,601
TMI, TMI my friend.

23
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,022
TMI ? Too Much Information.

24
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:10,923
It's just easier to say TMI. I used to
say "Don't Go There" but that's lame.

25
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:15,893
And here we have Stanley the manly, now
Stanley is a Dundee Allstar, aren’t you
Stan ?

26
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:18,432
Why don't you show them some of your bling ?

27
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,731
I don't know where they are,
I think I threw them out.

28
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:24,983
- Oh, no you didn't.
- I think I did.

29
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,990
Why did...?

30
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:29,862
Say, we gotta order some
more appetizers this time.

31
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,763
- We ran out last year, remember ?
- Yes we should, you know what ?

32
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,543
I wanted one of those skillets of cheese,

33
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:41,262
but when I got on stage,
someone had eaten all of them.

34
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:45,853
<i>To Oscar Martinez,
It's the "Show Me The Money" award !</i>

35
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:50,041
Michael has tapped every Dundies Awards,

36
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:55,192
and now he's making me look through
hours of footage to find highlights.

37
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:57,961
<i>That's the type of song
we're gonna play to the ladies,
Hit it Dwight !</i>

38
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:07,440
<i>A little bit of Pam, all night long.
A little bit of Angela, on the sing.</i>

39
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:09,200
<i>A little bit of...</i>

40
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:13,793
This is the part where Kevin stands in front
of the camcorder all night. It's great.

41
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:23,350
- It was you.
- It wasn't lme, I swear.

42
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,603
So what's the joke ?
You're not perfect either !

43
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:30,032
- We're not laughing at you Dwight !
- So who are you laughing at ?

44
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:34,260
- Just something somebody wrote.
- Who ? Dave Barry ?

45
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,170
No, no. That was just something that
was written on the ladies room wall.

46
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:39,653
What is it ? Who wrote it ?

47
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:43,962
- It's kind of private,
- It's about Michael !

48
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:47,572
That is defacement of company
property, so you'd better tell me.

49
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:50,462
Kelly, if you tell me, 
you'll be punished less.

50
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,641
- Ok, now I'm laughing at you !

51
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:59,413
Will her highness Jan Levinson Gould be

52
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:04,113
descending from her corporate throne
this evening to visit us lowly serfs here,

53
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:05,572
Dunder Mifflin Scranton ?

54
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,033
<i>- It's a two and a half hour drive
from New York Michael.</i>

55
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:12,920
- Well, you could take the bus, you could
work on the way here, sleep on the way home.

56
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:13,891
<i>- No.</i>

57
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:16,761
Come on Jan this is important, I mean,

58
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:21,321
this is validation to my employees here
that you and corporate approved of this.

59
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,570
<i>We don't approve of this Michael.</i>

60
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:27,852
<i>You only have the budget for
one office party a year so,</i>

61
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,963
<i>we're not paying for this.</i>

62
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:37,231
<i>- Are you here ?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to

63
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:39,981
talk to you for a second about that.

64
00:04:40,218 --> 00:04:46,662
What..., what is..., I mean, come on Jan !
You're dropping a A-bomb on me here !

65
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:51,911
<i>- Really ? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you.</i>
- Well, yeah, what is... no you can't !

66
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,500
<i>- You allready had a party
on May 5th for no reasons ?</i>

67
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:57,181
No reasons ? It was the 05-05-05 party !

68
00:04:57,188 --> 00:05:00,130
<i>- And you also had a...</i>
- It happens once every billion years !

69
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,682
<i>- And the tsunami relief fund raiser
with somehow lost a lot of money</i>

70
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:09,523
Ok, no that was a fun raiser, I think I made
that very clear on the flyers. Fun, F-U-N.

71
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,890
<i>... don't have a tsunami Fun raiser, Michael.
- Well...</i>

72
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:15,650
I think a lot of people were
very affected by the footage.

73
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:22,460
It's a little character I like to do.
It is loosely based on Karnack,

74
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:25,842
one  of Carson's classic characters.

75
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:33,362
We got... the PLO, the IRA and the
hot-dogs stand behind the warehouse.

76
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:43,793
Name 3 businesses that have better
healthcare plans than Dunder Mifflin.

77
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:49,740
Here's the problem : There is
no open bar because of Jan,

78
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:55,800
and it's the reason why comedy
clubs have a 2-drink minimum.

79
00:05:56,775 --> 00:06:02,751
We'll be fine. I just wish
people gonna be drunk.

80
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:17,660
- Dwight get out of here what are
you doing into ladies room...?
- No no no, it's not what you're...

81
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:20,060
- Why were you in there ?
- You are a pervert !
- What were you doing in there ?

82
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:20,993
- You are a pervert !
- I am not !

83
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:29,210
<i>The Dundee award, for longest engagement,
goes to Pam Beesly, Pam everybody !</i>

84
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:34,090
<i>When will that girl gonna be
married ? That’s what I have to say</i>

85
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:35,330
<i>- Oh Roy's accepting ?
- Yes.</i>

86
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:38,433
<i>Thank you, you have any words you'd
like to say, at Pam's behalf ?</i>

87
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:43,711
<i>- We'll see you next year !
- Yeah ! Oh nuts ! Oh gosh !</i>

88
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,863
- I'm not changing that, that's the best one.
- No it's clear it is, you're right.

89
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:53,323
I just think, world's on disengagement,
we're all expecting it you know ?

90
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:58,712
That's why it's funny, every year that Roy
and Pam don't get married it gets funnier !

91
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:02,922
Well I think if you use the same jokes
it just comes across as lazy.

92
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,003
- Ow, lazy !

93
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:11,151
Excuse me, everyone, can I
have your attention please ?

94
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:15,171
I just wanted to say that the
women in this office are terrible.

95
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:19,710
Especially the ones who wrote that stuff
about Michael on the bathroom wall.

96
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:24,430
Having a bathroom is a privilege,
it is called a ladies-room for a reason,

97
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:30,170
and if you cannot behave like ladies, well
then you are not going to have a bathroom.

98
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:34,643
- You're taking away our bathroom ?
- We are going to have 2 men rooms.

99
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:39,660
- But where would we go ?
- Be prepared to hold it folks, from 9 AM...

100
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:40,791
- Michael ?
- Yes ?

101
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:43,113
Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.

102
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:46,470
- Ok, well that's ridiculous, just don't...
I don't have time for this right now.

103
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:52,031
- There needs to be repercussions
to people's behavior...
- Don't don't talk don't touch stop it oddment !

104
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:56,593
- Ok, look I know there have been a lot of rumors
flying around about the Dundies this year,

105
00:07:56,607 --> 00:08:02,763
how there is no money, and how there is
no food, and how the jokes are really bad.

106
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:05,612
But what the hell everybody ?

107
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:12,673
I mean, god the Dundies are about
the best, in every one of us.

108
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,001
Can't you see that ? I mean...

109
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:21,970
ok, we can do better, so,
tonight, for the first time,

110
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:28,272
We  are inviting all of your friends and
family to attend the awards with us.

111
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,350
- Yes !
- Yeah, not bad right ?

112
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:32,543
So let's make this best Dundies ever !

113
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:35,552
Best Dundies ever !

114
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:48,410
Welcome to eighth annual Dundies awards !
Before we get started, a few announcements :

115
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,783
Keep your acceptance speeches shorts,

116
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:55,320
I have wrap it up music and I'm
not afraid to use it, Devin.

117
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,171
<i>The Dundies, how can I explain it ?
A word to auto mated,</i>

118
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:11,960
<i>You've all made it
You had a was, you work so hard</i>

119
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:13,800
<i>You fell a no, no
This isn't just a name</i>

120
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:15,610
<i> And now the N-O
And he's been says Hello</i>

121
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:18,053
<i>Cut, come on !</i>

122
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:22,841
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's
birthday party, and you go,

123
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:28,173
and there's really nothing for you to do there,
but the kid's having a really good time, so,

124
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,853
you're kind of there.
That's kind of what it's like.

125
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:35,610
<i>... Dundee, you wanted that Dundee...</i>

126
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:41,642
- The waitress tripped on the cord. 
- All right, joke'o'landed, so we are here,

127
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:46,561
Thank you all for coming,
to the 2005 Dundee Awards,

128
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:51,503
I am your host, Michael Scott,
and I just want to tell you

129
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:58,022
please, please, do not drink and drive, because
you may hit a bump, and spill the drink.

130
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,973
All the flotties on the group tab.

131
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:05,500
No, actually this year no group tab
we're gonna be doing separate checks !

132
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:14,140
- You said we could bring our families.
- I did, and why didn't you Stanley ?

133
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:19,002
- I did, my wife's name is Terry.
- Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terry.

134
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:22,351
It's this person whose hand
I'm holding Michael.

135
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,430
<i>Oh yeah !
- Shut it !</i>

136
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:31,842
Good,  speaking of relationships,
of all way shapes and forms,

137
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:37,781
I was out on a very very hot date
last night with a girl from HR Dwight.

138
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:43,542
- Really ? We don't have any girls from HR.
- Know that, for the sake of the story.

139
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:48,170
And things were getting hot and heavy,
and I was about to take her bra off,

140
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:45,823
<i>Yeah ! </i>

141
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,313
When she had me fill out
six hours worth of paper work.

142
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:48,921
<i>Yeah ! </i>

143
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:55,670
- Like an AIDS test ?
- No... god.

144
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,496
- All right. So let's get this party started !
- Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.

145
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:07,680
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
- Guys, where are you going ?

146
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:11,786
- Just... Pam shows is getting started.
- Sorry.

147
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:19,310
- You're staying ?
- Yeah. I have to eat somewhere.

148
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:30,123
- The Busiest Beaver award goes to Phyllis Lapin !
Way to go Phyllis ! Nice work ! Per usual !

149
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:35,132
- This says bushiest beaver.
- What ? I told them busiest... idiots !

150
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:37,860
- It's fine,
- Well we can fix it, we'll fix it up !

151
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:39,021
You don't have to display that.

152
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,830
- Because that's what happen every time !
- He's a jackass, every year !

153
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:45,141
- Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
- No, I don't want go I don't want to !

154
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:45,663
Pam !

155
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:47,953
If you would have asked me
that then you would know !

156
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:50,532
Herro everybodeeee.

157
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:55,463
Hey ! How are you ? I thought you'd left.

158
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:59,421
No, I decided to stay. I'll just
get a ride home from Angela.

159
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:03,690
<i>Jan Levinson Gould !</i>

160
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:05,932
- Good I'm just in time for Ping !
- Yeah

161
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:12,171
You know what I'm talking about !

162
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:13,263
Can I get a drink ?

163
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:23,062
This next award goes to somebody
who really lights up the office.

164
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:28,620
Somebody who I think a lot of
us cannot keep from checking out.

165
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:32,920
The hottest, in the office award goes to...

166
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,952
Ryan the temp !

167
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:43,971
Here you go !

168
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,272
What am I going to do with the award ?

169
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:01,583
Nothing, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

170
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:05,031
That's the least of my concerns right now.

171
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:10,122
And the Tight Ass award goes to Angela,

172
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:16,473
not only because she is everybody's favorite
stickler, but because she has a great caboose !

173
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:22,013
- So come on down !
- No.

174
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,160
I think those might be empty.

175
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:34,773
No, no ‘cause the ice melts,
and then it's like second drink !

176
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:37,340
Second drink ?

177
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:43,003
The spicy curry award goes to our
very own Kelly Kapoor !

178
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:44,700
Get on up here !

179
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,750
There you go !

180
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:49,331
- Spicy curry, what's that mean ?

181
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:51,401
- Not everything means something,
this is a joke.

182
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:54,321
- Yeah, but why did you give it to me ?
- I don't know, I'd just...

183
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:57,443
- This is a bowler !
- I know ! They didn't have
any businessmen so...

184
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:59,861
- Yeah but everyone else...
- Just sit down Kelly.

185
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:05,550
It's so freakin' hot in there.

186
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:09,103
ow I know what Bob Hope was going
through when he performed in Saudi Arabia

187
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:12,563
I got Dwight, sucking the
funny out of room, but,

188
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:16,541
you know, you do what you can do...
here we go, he's early with the cue !

189
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:17,991
Got to go !

190
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,202
("Tiny Dancer" - Elton John)

191
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:22,000
"You have won a tiny Dundie."

192
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,990
- Sing it Elton !
- Hey thanks guys !

193
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:30,062
- Hey where you guys from ?
- We has came from your mama's house.

194
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:31,341
Hey guys can I finish that ?

195
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:34,843
Sing on a song dude !

196
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:38,771
You know what guys we're just having
a little office party so if you wanna...

197
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:46,480
- Hey ! You know cool it guys !
- You suck man ! You suck !

198
00:14:49,795 --> 00:14:52,780
Let's cut it !

199
00:14:55,436 --> 00:15:02,572
I've a few more Dundies to give out tonight,
but I'm just gonna cut it short, and rapid up.

200
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:05,791
So everybody can enjoy their food.

201
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:09,330
Thanks for listening,
those of you who listened.

202
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:11,551
This last Dundee is for Kevin,

203
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:15,190
this is the "don't go in there after me"
award, it's for the time that

204
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:21,012
I went to the bathroom after him and
it was really, really smelly, so.

205
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,971
Here you go.

206
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:38,220
Yeah Kevin, for Kevin,
for stinking up the bathroom !

207
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:45,141
- Hey I haven't gotten one yet !
- Yes, I have not gotten one either !

208
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:47,363
So keep going !
- More Dundies !

209
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:52,720
Dundies ! - Dundies !

210
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:56,022
All right, we'll keep 'em rolling.

211
00:15:56,027 --> 00:16:01,931
This is the fine work award, this goes to
Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.

212
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:03,913
You know you did !

213
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:08,763
Speech-speech-speech-speech

214
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:14,052
Well, last year I got great
work, so I don't know...

215
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,842
I don't know what to think about this award,

216
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:21,301
but at least I didn't get smelliest
bow movement like Kevin !

217
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:28,771
And this next award is going
out to our own little Pam Beesly,

218
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:32,091
I think we all know what award
Pam is gonna be getting this year,

219
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:39,061
It is the whitest sneakers award, because
she always has the whitest tennis shoes on !

220
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:45,530
Get on down here ! Pam Beesly
ladies and gentlemen ! Here we go !

221
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:51,500
I have so many people
to thank for this award !

222
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:59,352
Ok, first off, my Keds, because I couldn't
have done it without them, thank you.

223
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:05,852
Let's give Michael a round of applause for
MC-ing tonight because this is a lot harder than it looks,

224
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:09,272
and also because of Dwight too.

225
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,300
Finally I want to thank God,

226
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:18,251
because God gave me this Dundee,

227
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:22,322
and I feel God in this Chili's tonight.

228
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:29,510
Pam Beesly ladies and
gentlemen ! Ow, thank you !

229
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:43,292
What a great year for the Dundies !

230
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:48,723
We got to see Ping, and we learned Michael's
true feelings for Ryan, which was touching.

231
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:54,481
And we heard Michael change the lyrics to a
number of classic songs, which for me,

232
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,632
has ruined them for life !

233
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:00,672
- What ?
- Nothing.

234
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:04,260
-  Okay.
- What ?

235
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:06,292
I don't know, what ?

236
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:12,510
Oh my god ! You are so
drunk ! Did you get that ?

237
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:15,411
Please tell me that you got,
this is all gonna be on.

238
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,152
- It's ok I'm a sheriff's deputy.
- Well, he's volunteer !

239
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:20,342
Don't get into that now. 

240
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:23,873
We need something
to caution her head, throw a pillow, a cush ?

241
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,170
- Dwight come on !
- I'm gonna use my shirt.

242
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:26,882
- Get off of me !
- No !

243
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:30,481
- I'm sorry, sir, you gotta have to put
your clothes back. We're trying to eat...

244
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:33,512
Was this year's Dundies a
success ? Well, let me see :

245
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:37,422
I made Pam laugh so hard that she fell out
of her chair and she almost broke her neck.

246
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:40,020
So I killed, almost !

247
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:46,350
Oh my god ! I just wanna say that
this was the best Dundies ever !

248
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:52,691
We have a strict policy here, not oversunk.

249
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:56,670
Apparently this young woman was
sneaking drinks off other people's tables.

250
00:18:56,727 --> 00:19:02,121
Eyes at her officer driver's license and she is
not welcome at this restaurant chains ever again !

251
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,730
- Great work tonight !
- Watch your step !

252
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:05,742
Excellent.

253
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:10,403
Thanks, I do check her pupils to
make sure that wasn't a concoction.

254
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:15,063
Yes that too but I mean
with the audio, great work !

255
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:21,340
I feel bad about what I wrote
on the bathroom wall.

256
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,821
No you don't.

257
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:33,792
Oh, here she is. Careful.
All right, easy. Almost there.

258
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:40,653
- Hey hum, can I ask you a question ?
- Shoot.

259
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:52,053
- I just wanted to say thanks.
- That's not really a question.

260
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,740
Ok let's get you home, come.

261
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,823
- Good bye.
- Good night, have a good night.

262
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,292
Thank you Angela !
