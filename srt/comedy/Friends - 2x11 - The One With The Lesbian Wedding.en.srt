00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,253
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:05,339
Okay, here's his diaper bag...

4
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,509
...and his Mr. Winky.

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,303
And...

6
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,389
...him. Hi!

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,724
- How did everything go?
- Great!

8
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,393
There was a projectile...

9
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:22,064
...throwing up incident,
but he started it.

10
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,108
We've gotta go.

11
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,819
Oh, right.

12
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,405
I've got some news.
It's about us.

13
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,447
You and me?

14
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,699
No. Susan and me.

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,203
The other "us".

16
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:42,209
We're getting married.

17
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:50,676
As in, "I now pronounce you
wife and wife" married?

18
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:54,471
We'd like you to come.
We understand if you don't want to.

19
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,809
Why wouldn't I want to come?
I had fun at the first wedding.

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,311
I just thought that...

21
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,025
Why shouldn't I be happy for you?
What would it say about me...

22
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,278
...if I couldn't revel
in your joy?

23
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,239
And I'm reveling, baby!
Believe me!

24
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,243
Is your finger caught in that chair?

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,955
Want us to go?

26
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,125
The One With the Lesbian Wedding

27
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,962
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

28
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,883
This is cool.
You're actually on television.

29
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,344
I know.
It really hit me last night.

30
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:19,098
I'm on "Days of our Lives".

31
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:25,687
Then I started thinking about us,
and how these are the days of our lives.

32
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,606
Yes!

33
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,690
What?

34
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,944
Carol and Susan's caterer
had a bike accident...

35
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,864
...and she's in a
full-body cast.

36
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,036
They asked me, which is cool
since I've never catered...

37
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,705
...and I need the money.
Is this a problem?

38
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,000
- Would it matter?
- You're so great!

39
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,460
Thank you!

40
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,212
- You're really not going?
- I'm really not.

41
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,257
They already live together.
Why do they need to get married?

42
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,968
They love each other.

43
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:00,222
They wanna celebrate that love
with the people close to them.

44
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,558
If you wanna call
that a reason.

45
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:07,646
<i>Who's the bitterest</i>
<i>man in the living room?</i>

46
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,775
<i>The bitterest man</i>
<i>in the living room?</i>

47
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,319
Hi, neighbor.

48
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:19,366
- I thought you were over this.
- That has nothing to do with it.

49
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,203
If she were marrying a guy,
you wouldn't expect me to go.

50
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:28,792
If she were marrying a guy,
she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

51
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,587
Did I miss it?

52
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:35,758
No, I'm on right after this guy
shoots himself.

53
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,885
She's pretty.

54
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,511
And she's really nice.

55
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,639
She taught me about
how to work with the cameras...

56
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,310
...and smell-the-fart acting.

57
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,188
- I'm sorry, what?
- Excuse me?

58
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,609
You got so many lines
to learn so fast that sometimes...

59
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,695
...you need a minute
to remember your next one.

60
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,613
So while you're thinking...

61
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,284
...you take this big pause
where you look all intense.

62
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,120
Like this...

63
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:14,088
Here's my scene!
Here's my scene!

64
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,048
<i>Mrs. Wallace?</i>

65
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,635
<i>Dr. Drake Ramoray,</i>
<i>your sister's neurosurgeon.</i>

66
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,970
<i>Is she going to be all right?</i>

67
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:26,058
<i>I'm afraid the situation</i>
<i>is much more dire than we'd expected.</i>

68
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:30,145
<i>Your sister's suffering from a...</i>

69
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:38,070
<i>... subcranial hematoma.</i>

70
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:43,825
<i>Perhaps we can</i>
<i>discuss this further over coffee.</i>

71
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,041
Nice!

72
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:56,213
For a minute, I thought you were
actually smelling something.

73
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,840
- Do it again!
- All right!

74
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,011
- That was so good!
- Do it again.

75
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:06,640
"Damn it, Braverman!
It's right there on the chart!"

76
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,644
I gotta get to work.
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

77
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,895
No, that's me.

78
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,981
Oh, right.

79
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,154
Oh, thanks. Couldn't...

80
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,698
Is everything okay?

81
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,618
No.

82
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,415
One of my clients died
on the massage table today.

83
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,292
Oh, my God!

84
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:38,130
That's a little more relaxed
than you want them to get.

85
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,925
She was, you know,
82 years old...

86
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,304
...and her name was
Mrs. Adelman.

87
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,346
Oh, honey.

88
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,141
It's just so strange. You know...

89
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,060
...she probably woke up
this morning and thought...

90
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:56,023
...I'll have some breakfast,
take a walk, then have my massage.

91
00:05:56,273 --> 00:06:00,986
Little did she know God thought,
"Okay, but that's it."

92
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,908
Oh, but the weirdest things was...

93
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,328
...I was cleansing her aura
when it happened.

94
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,247
And when her spirit
left her body...

95
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,542
...I don't think it went very far.

96
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,502
What do you mean?

97
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:21,632
I think it went into me.

98
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,099
This is so hard.

99
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,393
I can't decide
between lamb or duck.

100
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,270
Well, lambs are scarier.

101
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,442
Or the movie would've been called
<i>Silence of the Ducks.</i>

102
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,068
Okay, who ordered what?

103
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,948
I had the half-drunk cappuccino
with the lipstick on the rim.

104
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:49,451
And this with the cigarette
butt in it, is that decaf?

105
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,286
Oh, God.

106
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,622
You're so uptight
about your mom coming.

107
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,125
I know. I just don't want
her to think that because...

108
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,879
...I didn't marry Barry
my life is crap.

109
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,922
Talk about crap, just
listen to Stella Neidman...

110
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:08,011
...tell her story about Rod Steiger
for the hundredth time.

111
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:14,852
Pheebs? How long do you think
this lady will be with us?

112
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,522
I don't know. She obviously
has some unfinished business.

113
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,358
Sit up!

114
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,319
There she is!

115
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,907
- Mom!
- Hey, sweetie!

116
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,164
So this is where you work!

117
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,583
Oh, it's wonderful!

118
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:42,087
Is it a living room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

119
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,005
I guess that's the fun.

120
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,258
Pretty much.
Here, meet my friends.

121
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,344
Monica! You look gorgeous!

122
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:54,475
Oh, my! The last time I saw you,
it was eat or be eaten.

123
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,268
This is Joey.

124
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,602
This is Phoebe.

125
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,063
This is Chandler.

126
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,356
You remember Ross?

127
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,732
Oh, hello, Ross.

128
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,359
Mrs. Greene.

129
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,446
What do you think of my
daughter, in the apron...

130
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,990
...with the big job!

131
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,617
Oh, Mom!

132
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:17,790
If you didn't pour the coffee,
no one would have anything to drink.

133
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,044
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

134
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,964
This is just so exciting!
You know, I never worked.

135
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,427
I went from my father's house
to the sorority house...

136
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,346
...to my husband's house.
I am just so proud of you!

137
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,474
Really?

138
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,018
I know who you remind me of.

139
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,311
Evelyn Durmer.

140
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:46,026
That's before the lousy face-lift.
Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

141
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,573
Pheebs? Who's Evelyn Durmer?

142
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,827
I don't know.
Who's Soupy Sales?

143
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,289
Oh, my God!

144
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:03,002
There's an unattractive
nude man playing the cello.

145
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:07,840
Just be glad he's not playing
a smaller instrument.

146
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,594
You have some life here, sweetie!

147
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:16,307
Mom, I realize you were upset
when I didn't marry Barry...

148
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:20,102
...and get the house in the suburbs
with all the security.

149
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,437
This is just
so much better for me.

150
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:26,567
I know.
You didn't love Barry, honey.

151
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,320
And I've never seen you this happy.

152
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,658
I look at you and I think,
"This is what I want."

153
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,619
For me.

154
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,289
Well, not just for you.

155
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,499
What do you mean?

156
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:48,380
I'm considering
leaving your father.

157
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,092
All right, tell me
if this is too cute.

158
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,721
Lesbian wedding...
chicken breasts.

159
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,310
Oh, God.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

160
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:07,566
What? It's not like I'm putting
little nipples on them.

161
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,446
- You had no idea?
- None.

162
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,072
They didn't fight?

163
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,992
No, they didn't even
talk to each other.

164
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:21,329
How was I suppose to know
they were having problems?

165
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,918
You know, in my day,
divorce was not an option.

166
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:29,004
Hey, look who's up!

167
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,883
I just can't believe
this is happening!

168
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,802
When I was little,
all parents got divorced.

169
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,139
I figured as an adult,
I wouldn't have to worry about it.

170
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,267
Can't you look at this
as flattering?

171
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,520
She just wants to be like you.

172
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,024
Well, couldn't she have just
copied my haircut?

173
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,110
When my parents divorced,
they sent me to a shrink...

174
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,406
...and she told me
that kids blame themselves.

175
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:59,118
But in your case,
it's actually kind of true.

176
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,203
Oh, that's him.

177
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:05,624
Damn! My mail-order
grandfather hasn't come yet.

178
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,584
- Phoebe?
- Hi, Mr. Adelman.

179
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,712
- Nice to see you.
- Thanks for coming.

180
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:15,134
That's okay. Although you did
cut into my busy day of sitting.

181
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,344
Do you wanna sit?

182
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:22,015
No, I spent most of my morning
trying to stand up.

183
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,851
What can I do
for you, my dear?

184
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:28,188
Okay, I don't know how
to say this, but...

185
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,149
I think when your wife's spirit
left her body...

186
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,861
...it kind of stuck around...

187
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,613
...in me.

188
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,990
You're saying
my wife is in you?

189
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,285
Yeah. You don't have to
believe me, but...

190
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,788
...can you think of
any unfinished business she had?

191
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,998
Any reason to hang around?

192
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,876
I don't know what to say.

193
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,337
All I can think of is that...

194
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:55,966
...she used to say that before she died,
she wanted to see everything.

195
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,552
- Everything?
- Everything.

196
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,304
That's a lot of stuff.

197
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,638
Oh, wait, I...

198
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:07,395
I remember she also said she wanted
to sleep with me one last time.

199
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:19,573
I'm sorry.
There's laughing in my head.

200
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,535
Worth a shot, huh?

201
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,624
Look at this!

202
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,795
These are all Halloween,
three years ago.

203
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,964
Oh, and look, here's Barry.

204
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,216
He came straight
from the office?

205
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,136
Oh, no.
That was his costume.

206
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:46,641
See, he's actually an orthodontist,
but he came as a regular dentist.

207
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:47,976
You guys?

208
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,272
Remember when I said
that I don't need your help?

209
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:52,982
Actually, I think you said...

210
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,318
..."Don't touch that
and get out of my kitchen."

211
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,863
Really? Weird.
Anyway...

212
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,033
I planned really well.
I planned and planned.

213
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,036
I just didn't plan
enough time to do it.

214
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:10,415
- You want some help?
- Lf you want.

215
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,004
What a day!

216
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:18,466
I took her everywhere.

217
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,886
The Museum of Modern Art,
Rockefeller Center...

218
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,596
...the Statue of Liberty.

219
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,098
She's still with you?

220
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:30,936
Yes. I guess she hasn't
seen everything yet.

221
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:35,691
Be right back. She has to go
to the bathroom again.

222
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,279
Such a pretty face!

223
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,784
Oh, this is so much fun!
Just the girls!

224
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,829
Do you know what we should do?
Does anybody have any marijuana?

225
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,457
God!

226
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,296
Look, no one's smoking pot
around all this food.

227
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,381
Well, that's fine.

228
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:04,052
I never did it.
I just thought I might.

229
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,347
What's new in sex?

230
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,475
What's new in sex?

231
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,187
The only man I've been with
is your father.

232
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,607
I'm dicing. I'm dicing.
I don't hear anything.

233
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,194
This is no offense to your dad,
but I was thinking...

234
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:21,695
...there might be more.

235
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,240
You know what? I cannot
have this conversation with you.

236
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,408
All right.

237
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:30,704
You come here and drop this bomb on me
before you even tell Daddy.

238
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,499
Do you want my blessing?
Want me to talk you out of it?

239
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,126
Then what do you want?

240
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,670
I guess I figured
you would understand.

241
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:42,508
Why on earth
would I understand this?

242
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,261
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

243
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,973
But I married mine.

244
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,815
We're in trouble. We've only got
12 hours and 36 minutes left.

245
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,025
Move, move, move!

246
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:04,696
I feel like you should
have German subtitles.

247
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,782
Joey, speed it up!

248
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:11,995
I'm sorry! It's the pigs!
They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

249
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,833
How did this happen?
I thought you had this planned out.

250
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,669
Do you want me to cry?

251
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,796
Is that what you want?

252
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,423
Do you wanna see me cry?

253
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:26,093
Sir, no, sir!

254
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,304
All right, you!

255
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:33,225
No. Look, I told you,
I am not a part of this thing.

256
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:37,813
Look, Ross. I know you have issues with
Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.

257
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:41,108
But if you don't help,
I'm gonna take those hot dogs...

258
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:45,195
...and create an appetizer
called "Pigs In Ross".

259
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,821
All right, ball a melon!

260
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:51,743
How come I'm stuck dicing
when he gets to ball a melon?

261
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,292
- How's it going?
- Great! Right on schedule.

262
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,296
Got my little happy helpers.

263
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,798
That's fine. Whatever.

264
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,007
What's wrong?

265
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,677
Nothing.

266
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:13,224
Okay, everything.
I think we're calling off the wedding.

267
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,310
You're still gonna pay me, right?

268
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,230
Or something a little less selfish.

269
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,399
What's the matter?
What happened?

270
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,944
My parents called to say
they weren't coming.

271
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:29,532
I knew they were
having trouble with this, but...

272
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:34,077
...they're my parents.
They're supposed to give me away.

273
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:38,123
Susan and I fought because
I said maybe we should call it off.

274
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,293
She said, "This isn't for them.
It's for us."

275
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,921
And if I couldn't see that,
we should cancel the wedding.

276
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,676
I don't know what to do.

277
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:53,764
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I think Susan's right.

278
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,557
You do?

279
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,396
Do you love her? And don't be
too emphatic about this.

280
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,106
Of course I do.

281
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,900
Well then, that's it.

282
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,822
If George and Adelaide can't
accept that, then the hell with them.

283
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,575
If my parents didn't want me
to marry you...

284
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:17,329
...no way that would've
stopped me.

285
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,832
Look, this is your wedding.

286
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,668
Do it.

287
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,588
You're right.
Of course you're right.

288
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,382
So we're back on?

289
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:29,800
We're back on.

290
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,471
You heard the woman!
Peel! Chop! Devil!

291
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,850
Can't believe
I lost two minutes!

292
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,653
It just seems so futile.

293
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:55,117
You know?
All these women, and nothing!

294
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,163
I feel like Superman
without my powers, you know?

295
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:05,544
I have the cape,
and yet I cannot fly.

296
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:10,883
Well, now you understand
how I feel every single day.

297
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:15,638
The world is my lesbian wedding.

298
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,691
Butterscotch?

299
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,234
No one?

300
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:33,697
All right,
you'll be sorry later.

301
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:10,192
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

302
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,863
Ross.

303
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,119
Nothing makes God happier...

304
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:24,665
...than when two people, any two people,
come together in love.

305
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,751
Friends, family,
we're gathered here today...

306
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,587
...to join Carol and Susan
in holy matrimony.

307
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,256
Oh, my God!

308
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:36,260
Now I've seen everything!

309
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,512
She's gone!

310
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:40,764
She's gone!

311
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:41,932
She's gone.

312
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:46,269
Go ahead, get married.
Go, go!

313
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:49,523
<i>Strangers in the night</i>

314
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,984
<i>Exchanging glances</i>

315
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,902
<i>Wondering in the night</i>

316
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,528
Would you look at them?

317
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:59,700
Yeah. Can't help but.

318
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:07,415
How's that pig-in-the-blanket
working out for you?

319
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,295
I wrapped those bad boys.

320
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,587
I miss Rose.

321
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:13,672
Oh, yeah?

322
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:18,760
I know it's kind of weird, but
she was a big part of my life...

323
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,263
I don't know, I feel alone.

324
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:27,019
You know, I couldn't help
overhearing what you just said.

325
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,690
I think it's time you forget about Rose,
move on with your life.

326
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,525
How about we get you a drink?

327
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:37,070
Okay. So nice!

328
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:48,207
I shouldn't even bother
coming up with a line, right?

329
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,293
Hey, Mom, having fun?

330
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:56,882
Am I! I just danced
with a wonderfully large woman.

331
00:20:57,132 --> 00:21:00,552
And three other girls
made eyes at me over at the buffet.

332
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,388
I'm not saying
it's something I wanna pursue...

333
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:07,393
...but it's nice to know
I have options.

334
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:12,398
There's more alcohol, right?

335
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,654
How you doing?

336
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:24,493
You did a good thing today.

337
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,247
You wanna dance?

338
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,834
No, that's fine.

339
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,544
Come on.

340
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:37,214
I'll let you lead.

341
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,941
Look, penis, schmenis!

342
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,528
Okay? We're all people.

343
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:12,541
Which one of us is gonna be
the first one to get married?

00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,376
Mon, I was married.

345
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:17,462
- Yeah, me too, technically.
- I had a wedding.

346
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:20,674
Just trying to
start a discussion.

347
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:26,096
Which one do you think
will be the last to get married?

348
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,392
Isn't Ben in this?

349
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:31,434
Of course!

350
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,062
Absolutely.
