1
00:00:03,998 --> 00:00:05,258
This is ridiculous.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,686
Do you have any idea
what time we get out of here?

3
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:10,847
Nobody likes to work late.
Least of all, me.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,134
- You have plans tonight?
- No, I don't.

5
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:17,798
Remember when you told us not to make
plans 'cause we were working?

6
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,305
Yes, I remember.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,151
This is B.S.
This is B.S.

8
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:24,444
Why are we here?

9
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:26,112
I am gonna call corporate.

10
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:27,948
Enough is enough. I'm...

11
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:29,783
God, I'm so mad!

12
00:00:29,943 --> 00:00:32,308
This is Michael Scott, Scranton.

13
00:00:32,428 --> 00:00:33,578
We don't wanna work.

14
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:35,143
No, we don't!

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,415
It's not fair to these people!

16
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:41,337
These people are my friends,
and I care about them!

17
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:43,416
We're not gonna do it!

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,680
Everybody,
I just got off the horn with corporate,

19
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:52,639
and basically I told them where they
could stick their overtime assignment.

20
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:55,377
- Go enjoy your friday.
- Thank you, Michael.

21
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,063
- I think we dodged a bullet there.
- I think you did.

22
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:00,597
I think we should celebrate.

23
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:03,844
How about you, Pam, <i>mi casa</i>...
A little dinner, dancing, drinks?

24
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,819
- Oh, I...
- You said you didn't have plans.

25
00:01:08,673 --> 00:01:10,139
That's what you said.

26
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:14,515
Michael has asked Pam and me
to dinner at least nine times.

27
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:17,181
An every time,
we've been able to get out of it.

28
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,471
But I've got to give him credit.

29
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,030
He got me.

30
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,673
Because I'm starting to suspect

31
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,172
that there was no assignment
from corporate.

32
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:28,299
Michael, what time
should I be arriving?

33
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:30,522
Dwight, it's couples only.

34
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:32,980
And besides,
I only have six wine glasses.

35
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,476
So it will be me and Jan,
and Pam and Jim.

36
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:38,143
And Angela and Andy.

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,191
Does it bother me that I wasn't invited
to Michael's dinner party?

72
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,840
- Hi.
- Hello.

73
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:28,007
- How are you?
- Come on in.

74
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,284
- Good to see you.
- Chilly, huh?

75
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:32,193
I'm so glad we finally...

76
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:34,131
Finally got to do this
with you guys.

77
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:35,497
This is great.

78
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:36,995
You want to...

79
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,835
- take their coats, babe?
- Yes, I would.

80
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:42,458
So what have you been doing?

81
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,768
Let's see, since I saw you
an hour ago?

82
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:47,470
I have been getting ready,
and then driving over here.

83
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,673
Well, we've been doing
pretty much the same thing.

84
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:51,532
- Really?
- Except driving.

85
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:52,798
We...

86
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:54,843
We got you this.

87
00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:56,903
Thank you.

88
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,849
This will be great
to cook with... really.

89
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,810
Well, have a seat,
or come on in or...

90
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,522
I don't know, make yourself to home.
This is our <i>casa</i>.

91
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,801
Really nice.

92
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,901
So what you guys think? Should we do
the tour first or have appetizers first?

93
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:11,586
Tour.
Let's do the tour first.

94
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:14,030
You've a preference, babe?
Upstairs first?

95
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,806
- Totally your call, babe.
- All right, well, let's go then.

96
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:18,232
I say upstairs.

97
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:21,487
You guys doing a little construction?

98
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:23,727
Oh, just redoing
the sliding glass door.

99
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:26,736
Yeah, so sorry
about this god-awful carpet.

100
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:29,074
We are still a work
in progress here.

101
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:32,102
This is my office.

102
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:34,009
Yep. Never been used.

103
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,593
- Not super-exciting.
- No.

104
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:38,036
- And this is my work space.
- This is it.

105
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:39,556
Check that out.
You smell it?

106
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,977
As you can smell, there's a lot
of different odors going on in here.

107
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,020
So you have an office
and a work space.

108
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:49,543
I do, you know. I just...
I cannot create in the same space

109
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,790
that I conduct business. I'm sure
that you're the same with your odles.

110
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,927
Smell.

111
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:56,322
It's fire.

112
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:57,858
- Bonfire.
- Bond!

113
00:03:57,978 --> 00:04:00,065
- Men love this one.
- James bond fire!

114
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:03,062
I am Bond fire...
James Bond fire.

115
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,227
Michael Scott!

116
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:08,675
When I get frustrated,
or irritated or...

117
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:12,420
angry, I come up here
and I just smell all my candles!

118
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,007
And it just goes away.

119
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:15,925
- Just like that.
- Yeah.

120
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:18,641
So this is the master bedroom.

121
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,752
And these walls, they used to be,
like white, like an asylum.

122
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:24,649
So I wanted it to be softer
so I had it painted in eggshell white.

123
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:28,446
Guess what. White and eggshell white
are exactly the same color.

124
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:30,397
- Babe...
- Exactly.

125
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:32,641
I thought you said that
you were gonna tidy things up.

126
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:34,068
Well, I...

127
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,461
Shame on you.

128
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:41,073
- What a cute bench.
- Thanks. That's my bed.

129
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:44,954
Jan has, uh, some space issues,
so I curl up on that puppy.

130
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:46,441
Really?
'Cause...

131
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:49,352
It seems pretty narrow...
and short.

132
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:51,955
It's actually a lot bigger
than it seems. Look at that!

133
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,894
See?
It fits perfectly.

134
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:00,094
I finally

135
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:02,401
broke down and bought myself

136
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,319
a plasma TV.

137
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:07,226
Check it out.

138
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:09,520
I actually hung this
on the wall myself.

139
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,518
- That's good.
- I wanna show you something.

140
00:05:11,638 --> 00:05:13,984
A lot of people in the room,
you need more space...

141
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:16,277
<i>voila</i>.
Right into the wall.

142
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:18,821
Sometimes, I will just

143
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:22,044
stand here
and watch television for hours.

144
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:23,177
I love it.

145
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,119
I love this TV.

146
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,162
And I also built this table.

147
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,939
- What is that, chestnut?
- No, it's either pine of nordic cherry.

148
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:33,127
It's pine. Yeah.

149
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,213
I'm just terrible at this stuff,
so that's cool.

150
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,881
- Really?
- Yeah.

151
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,064
Yeah, he tried to set up
my Tivo for me,

152
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:41,094
but then I didn't have audio
for a week.

153
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:44,541
If you ever need any help,
I'm just a phone call away.

154
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:46,144
I bet you are.

155
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,212
Well, I saw...

156
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,436
Oh, your dundies.

157
00:05:50,556 --> 00:05:53,398
I'm surprised they're not out
on a coffee table for everybody to see.

158
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:55,242
They was between...

159
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:58,361
the neon bier sign
and the dundies.

160
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,621
So I said,
"Honey, keep the trophies."

161
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:04,719
Oh, honey,
I have the best trophy right here.

162
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,399
Aside from my dundies.

163
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,449
- Oh, excuse us just a second.
- I'll get it.

164
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,074
So glad we were finally
able to do this.

165
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:14,855
- So glad we...
- No. No.

166
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,642
- Okay.
- Tuna!

167
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:19,774
What's up, Tuna?
We gonna have some tuna for dinner?

168
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:22,552
I bet you're sick of tuna.
You've probably tuna every night.

169
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:24,376
All right. Tuna.

170
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,222
These are for you.

171
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:28,308
- Oh, how thoughtful.
- Very nice.

172
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:31,236
Except for one flower,
which is for...

173
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:32,795
my flower.

174
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,134
What am I supposed to do with this?

175
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,110
How'bout we do the short tour,
and then I'll start dinner?

176
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:42,655
Oh, I can help starting dinner,
if you need it.

177
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:46,284
The osso buco needs to braise for about
three hours. Everything else's done.

178
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:50,538
Three hours from now,
or three hours from earlier, like 4:00?

179
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:55,271
You know, Pam, in Spain, they often
don't even start eating until midnight.

180
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:56,711
When in Rome.

181
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:59,283
You have a preference?
Upstairs first?

182
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,464
- Whatever you say, babe.
- Follow me.

183
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:02,680
All right.

184
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,271
How'bout a toast?
Shall I?

185
00:07:07,764 --> 00:07:09,494
Here's to good friends.

186
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,555
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

187
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,441
Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.

188
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:21,673
What was that?

189
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:24,105
So music?
Should we turn some music...

190
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:25,616
That sounds good.

191
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,618
Do you guys remember
my old assistant, Hunter?

192
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:31,162
He is an excellent song writer.

193
00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:32,631
Wait to hear this.

194
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:34,419
Okay, here we go.

195
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:40,287
<i>You took me by the hand</i>

196
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:44,077
<i>Just made me a man</i>

197
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:46,230
<i>That one night</i>

198
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:50,971
<i>You made everything all right</i>

199
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,560
<i>So raw,</i>

200
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:58,189
<i>So right
All night, all right</i>

201
00:07:58,349 --> 00:07:59,796
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

202
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:04,654
<i>So raw, so right,</i>

203
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:08,329
<i>All night, all right
Oh yeah!</i>

204
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:13,920
You know what?
Hunter was a terrible assistant.

205
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,263
- That's why Ryan fired him.
- He's probably just as reliable as Pam,

206
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:19,669
because it usually takes you
an afternoon to get back to me.

207
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:22,695
Sometimes I think
she olds on to faxes.

208
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:28,516
I don't care what they say about me.
I just want to eat.

209
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:31,155
Which I realize is a lot
to ask for.

210
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:33,429
At a dinner party.

211
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:35,868
- Cow.
- No, it's a... hump.

212
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:37,416
There's a hump.

213
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,773
- Joe Camel.
- Yes!

214
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,315
Okay, yes.
First name of that animal,

215
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:44,777
and the second name is the state
where Helena is the capital.

216
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:45,946
Montana.

217
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:48,281
- Joe Montana?
- Yes! Yes!

218
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,366
- Time's up!
- All right, two pieces!

219
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,160
Why don't say 49ers quarterbacks?

220
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,578
All right, my... my...

221
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:54,671
My... my turn!

222
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,747
My... my... my... my turn!

223
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,541
My... my... my... my turn!

224
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,890
Babe, can you just, like, really...

225
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:03,445
- You're just, like, really...
- What?

226
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:05,173
- What?
- Could you just simmer down?

227
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,500
- I'm just making people laugh.
- No.

228
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:10,496
- Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
- I was watching Jim.

229
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,148
And he was laughing.

230
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,890
No smile.

231
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,954
Look at him.
He's laughing.

232
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,238
Michael and Jan seem to be playing
their own separate game.

233
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:24,044
And it's called, "Let's see how
incomfortable we can make our guests."

234
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,446
And they're both winning.

235
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,149
So I am going to make a run for it.

236
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:33,325
I just got a message from my landlord.
Apparently, my apartment flooded.

237
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:35,328
- Something with the sprinkler.
- Oh, no!

238
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:38,142
Pam, we should probably get going
to see the damage.

239
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:40,625
- Okay.
- You don't need two of you to do that.

240
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:45,833
That's true...

241
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:50,509
Dinner sounded delicious. Pam,
I'll see you at home. Thank you so much.

242
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:54,013
Oh, Jim, I don't think you're going to
abandon this party here all by itself.

243
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,932
I don't know,
everything I own is there.

244
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:59,060
You can buy new stuff,
but you can't buy a new party.

245
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,604
That's true.
That is a great point.

246
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:02,855
Come on down here.

247
00:10:04,685 --> 00:10:08,653
Sit down on that couch
and be amongst friends,

248
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:12,428
and we're not gonna think about all
your stuff being destroyed. All right?

249
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:15,076
- Michael, you're up.
- Here we go. This is gonna be fun.

250
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:16,484
- Ready...
- Go!

251
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,913
All right.
First name is Tom.

252
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:21,749
No, no, no. No names.
No names, no rhyme no soundalikes.

253
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:24,295
All right, okay.
You're getting into my head!

254
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,466
First name is blank,
and he goes on a cruise.

255
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,297
He goes on a caribbean cruise.

256
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:29,905
- I don't know.
- Katie Holmes.

257
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:32,843
- No, but he's married to her!
- Oh, Dawson's Creek.

258
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:35,921
No, it has to be a real person Jim.
Come on!

259
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,554
No, no, I'm gonna pass.
I'm gonna pass.

260
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:43,896
- Rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
- No rhyming!

261
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:45,408
Not really a rhyme.

262
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,816
Another clue!

263
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:49,149
Okay, he's the governor
of California.

264
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,456
- He is the terminator.
- Those aren't helpful.

265
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:53,281
- Tom Cruise!
- Time!

266
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:56,214
God!
Does anybody read the paper?!

267
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:06,002
Here you go.

268
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:08,208
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

269
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:22,607
I'm so, so sorry
for the temperature in here.

270
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:27,189
The, um...
sliding glass door shattered.

271
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:28,810
- So...
- It's okay.

272
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,744
It's actually a really cute story.

273
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:34,780
Do you wanna tell it, babe
or should I tell it?

274
00:11:34,942 --> 00:11:36,949
- I don't like that story, babe.
- Come on!

275
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:41,151
It's a cute stor... Michael
ran through the sliding glass door

276
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:44,415
because he thought he heard
the ice cream truck.

277
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:45,901
Stop. Stop it!

278
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:49,098
I mean, I like ice cream, okay?
Sue me.

279
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:51,356
Oh, no, don't.

280
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:54,216
I shouldn't say that jokingly
because she will sue me.

281
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:56,429
She loves to sue.

282
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:59,096
She loves lawsuits.
You know, honey,

283
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,267
that door was extremely clean
and it looked invisible.

284
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,212
You are so right.
You are so right!

285
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:08,189
Because before I lived here,
the glass was always covered in smudges.

286
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:11,942
And I moved in and I cleaned it,
so I guess that makes me the devil.

287
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:14,945
You are!
She is!

288
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:17,490
She is the devil!
I'm in hell!

289
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:21,202
- I'm burning. Help me.
- You shouldn't joke about that.

290
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:23,886
- Is there more wine in the kitchen?
- I will get it. I will get it.

291
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:26,068
What kind of hostess
would I be if...

292
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:28,230
- It's okay...
- No, no. In fact, you know what?

293
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,210
Girls' trip.
Angela, come on.

294
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:31,555
Girls' trip.

295
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,633
Oh, not even close.

296
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:38,386
So you keep a very tidy house.

297
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:41,097
You should see our bathroom
after Michael takes a bath.

298
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,909
- But I don't need to tell you, Pam.
- Oh, yeah...

299
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:48,020
What?

300
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:51,107
Oh, don't tell me that he's really
changed since you guys dated.

301
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:53,025
Oh, are you joking?

302
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:56,821
Michael told me a little bit about it,
but I see the way you look at him.

303
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,506
I have never, ever dated

304
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:04,245
or wanted to do anything resembling
dating Michael, ever.

305
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:08,457
Not ever, not now, not then,
not now, not ever, ever.

306
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:11,082
I've noticed how you look at him
at the office.

307
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:18,801
So I spend most of my time
right here.

308
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:20,072
Have a hand.

309
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,725
So, Jim, I noticed you
checking out Jan's candles.

310
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,849
Oh, no, she just put it
in front of my face.

311
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:27,617
Yeah...
Did you know that candles

312
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:31,647
are the number one fastest-growing
product in the scent aroma market?

313
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,940
$2 billion a year industry.

314
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,120
And for only $10,000,

315
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,571
you could become a co-owner
of "Serenity by Jan."

316
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:42,676
- What do you think about that?
- Thought about it. I'm in.

317
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:45,828
I'm sorry, are you really trying
to get us to invest in Jan's company?

318
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:48,873
I'm sorry.

319
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:52,176
What now?

320
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:54,601
Coming.

321
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,516
Hello.

322
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:58,255
What are you doing here?

323
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,593
We came here to eat dinner and to party.
This is a dinner party, right?

324
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,013
- Awesome!
- What is he doing here?

325
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:07,057
- Yes, what are you doing here?
- Dwight is friend.

326
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:09,384
We weren't invited?

327
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,366
You said that
I could not invite Dwight

328
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,440
because he was not
part of a couple,

329
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:17,657
and because we didn't have
enough wine glasses.

330
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:20,905
Dwight brought glasses
and a person.

331
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:22,406
Fine.
Whatever you want.

332
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:24,283
Just like always.
Whatever you want.

333
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:27,015
Whatever I want?
It's never whatever I want.

334
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:30,100
- It's fine, Michael.
- When I wanted to see <i>Stop</i>

335
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,124
and you wanted to see <i>Wicked</i>,
what did we see?

336
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:33,294
We saw <i>Wic</i>...

337
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,034
When I said
that I wanted to have kids,

338
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:39,089
and you said that you wanted me
to have a vasectomy, what did I do?

339
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:41,425
And then, when you said

340
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:43,669
that you might wanna have kids,
and I wasn't so sure,

341
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:45,221
who had the vasectomy reversed?

342
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:47,264
And when you said
you definitely didn't want?

343
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:48,761
Who had it reversed back?

344
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:50,559
Snip, snap!
Snip, snap! Snip, snap!

345
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:52,061
- I did!
- Okay...

346
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:53,521
You have no idea

347
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:57,524
the physical toll that three vasectomies
have on a person!

348
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:00,277
And I bought this condo

349
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:03,765
- to fill with children.
- I am so sorry

350
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:06,951
that I don't want to bring kids
into this screwed-up world.

351
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:08,593
- Okay? But look...
- Sorry too.

352
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:11,261
If you want to have kids,
then fine, you win.

353
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:13,499
Let's have a fuckin' kid!

354
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,169
You mean it?
You wanna have a kid?

355
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:21,121
I hate my life.

356
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,003
So can we come in?

357
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,251
Great turkey leg.

358
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:39,193
Okay, I'm just gonna check
on dinner.

359
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:45,239
Angela, would you like
some of my beet salad?

360
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:46,945
I hate beet salad.

361
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,742
It's actually really good.

362
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:53,519
I know you love beet salad.
I've seen you eat it many times.

363
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,418
The thought of popping one of your beets
into my mouth makes me want to vomit.

364
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,060
Pam...

365
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:04,091
I hope she didn't do
anything to the food.

366
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:06,760
Like what?

367
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:08,192
I can't prove it,

368
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,931
but I think she might be
trying to poison me.

369
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:19,106
- Hey, looks great, babe.
- Yeah, it really does.

370
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:22,527
I know Jan didn't poison the food.
I know that.

371
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:25,972
But if she was going to poison
the food of someone at that table,

372
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:27,524
wouldn't it be me?

373
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:29,762
Michael's former lover.

374
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:39,627
Can you not do that?
It's disgusting.

375
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,256
You know I have soft teeth.
How could you say that?

376
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:50,045
Excuse me for a second.

377
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:56,109
So...

378
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,312
How do you guys know each other?

379
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,315
I was his babysitter.

380
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,379
And now you guys are dating?

381
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:07,154
It's purely carnal,
that's all you need to know.

382
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,094
Would you write down your email?
Because I have just...

383
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:11,659
so many questions.

384
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:12,951
Email?

385
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:15,287
Never mind.

386
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,912
All right.

387
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,577
There we go.

388
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:29,524
There.

389
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:36,684
- That's nice.
- Everybody enjoy their meal.

390
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,121
Hey, babe. How'bout we take
the beer sign down

391
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:44,233
until our guests leave,
and then we can discuss it?

392
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,985
No...
I'm gonna leave it up.

393
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:49,524
I think it ties
the whole room together.

394
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,291
Okay.

395
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,665
Jan thinks Hunter is very talented.

396
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:03,502
You know what?
I don't think he's that good.

397
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:05,337
At least he's an artist.

398
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:07,615
B.F.D., I'm a screenwriter.

399
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:09,174
And I'm a candle maker,

400
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:11,301
but you don't hear me
braggin'about it!

401
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:15,639
No, all you do is you get me
to try to work on my rich friends.

402
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:17,867
For an investment opportunity!

403
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:20,352
Man, I would love
to burn your candles!

404
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:22,187
You burn it, you buy it!

405
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:24,773
Oh, good, I'll be
your first customer!

406
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,275
You're hardly my first.

407
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,610
That's what she said!

408
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,733
That is a $200 plasma screen TV
that you just killed!

409
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,415
Good luck paying me back

410
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:49,882
on your zero dollars a year salary
plus benefits, babe!

411
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,495
- I'm gonna get going.
- Fine, get out of here.

412
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:00,657
It's getting late.

413
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:02,936
You know what,
she'll be out of the bathroom soon.

414
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,807
Of course.

415
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:08,466
Get out of my way.
I'll take care of this.

416
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:10,611
Okay, what seems to be
the problem, officers?

417
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:13,067
Not now, Dwight.
We got a call about a disturbance?

418
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:15,626
No. Nope.
Nothing disturbing here.

419
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:18,660
Just a couple of friends
having an awesome dinner party.

420
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:20,204
Your neighbors heard shouting.

421
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:23,027
Yes, there was screaming, but...

422
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:28,492
My girlfriend threw a dundie at my TV.
A plasma.

423
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:31,673
- You want to press charges?
- Would she get into trouble?

424
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,425
Yeah, she'd be charged.

425
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:35,950
I will take the fall.

426
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:39,241
- I did it.
- You don't have to press charges.

427
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,183
You could just try to be more quiet.

428
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:43,058
- Michael!
- Yes.

429
00:19:43,873 --> 00:19:45,447
What...
what are you doing to him?

430
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:48,850
Sir, do you have any other place
you could stay? Maybe with...

431
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:51,067
one of your friends here?

432
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:53,614
Michael can come home with me.

433
00:19:55,473 --> 00:19:56,475
Jim, Pam?

434
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,076
- Oh, my apartment's on fire.
- Flooded.

435
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:00,395
You people!

436
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,234
- Come on, you're sleeping with me.
- No.

437
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:04,215
- I'm gonna take you home, Michael.
- No.

438
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:05,544
Come with me.

439
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:06,981
All right.

440
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,919
Bye, babe!

441
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,505
This is the best burger
I've ever had, babe.

442
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:12,668
Babe,

443
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,386
I should have told you, but...

444
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:17,523
I did something bad.

445
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:21,689
I stole this.

446
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:23,699
For you, babe.

447
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:43,016
I love that.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
