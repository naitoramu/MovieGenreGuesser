00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,159
Hey, Jim.
Jim! Come here.

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,761
Do you know who that is?

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,864
No.

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,067
Look at him.
Look at him.

5
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,166
T-shirt, jeans.

6
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,677
Is it you?
(LAUGHS) I am flattered.

7
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,073
That's Johnny Depp.

8
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,878
Where'd you take that?
In my condo complex.

9
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,249
<i>Oh, my God, that's right!
I read in People magazine</i>

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,447
that he was looking for a
two-bedroom condo in Scranton.

11
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,955
I'm flipping out, man.

12
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,787
<i>Well, you remember my idea
for the fourth Pirates movie.</i>

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,053
Sure. That they should do one.

14
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:31,655
<i>Hey, Jim, Jim, where do
I find the Black Pearl?</i>

15
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,824
Who's that?
Captain Jack Sparrow.

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,697
Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.

17
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,293
John Dillinger.

18
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,067
No, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,607
Cap'n Crunch.

20
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,606
Okay. Okay.

21
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,708
Screw you, Halpert.

22
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:49,078
You know, it's not easy
getting excited about stuff.

23
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,477
Remember how you felt when you
thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?

24
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,540
At the Yankees game.

25
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,847
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,354
I had a little better
reason to believe that...

27
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,949
You're right.
You're right.

28
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,523
Well, you're not right,
because Johnny Depp...

29
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,721
I know. I know!
...in your condo complex?

30
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,597
It also explains why the name
on his mailbox was M. Schulman.

31
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,864
M. Night Schulman?

32
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,260
First up,

33
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,060
the Lost and Found has
gone missing.

34
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,896
It itself is lost,

35
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,869
so please try not to lose
anything until we find it.

have a pet please don't feel like...

37
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,872
When are we
getting to sales topics?

38
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,411
Yeah. What about those leads? Did
you hear anything from corporate?

39
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,413
Ah, yes, the leads.

40
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,745
The leads that
Sabre has spent $50,000

PHYLLIS: Man.
MICHAEL: But will be...

43
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,546
DWIGHT: Damn it! No, no,
no. No. Meeting's not over.

44
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,990
But is there anything relevant
to the sales staff here?

45
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,857
No sales topic, per se.

46
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,829
Well, then
no Andy Bernard, per se.

47
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,297
PHYLLIS: I agree.

48
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,493
Dwight? Sorry. Michael,
I got calls to make.

49
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,536
I would like your
undivided attention, please.

50
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,038
You couldn't handle
my undivided attention.

51
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,874
Over the last few weeks,
things have been changing here.

52
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:29,545
Sabre says it is our duty
to support the sales team,

53
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,210
<i>and the salesmen are
letting it go to their heads.</i>

54
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,946
<i>I think it's kind of
screwed up,</i>

55
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,681
<i>because the way
this place used to work</i>

56
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,952

59
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,463
Listen, Michael,

60
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,634
about what
happened earlier.

61
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,930
MICHAEL: Yeah?

62
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,699
When I was asking about
the leads.

63
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,932
Mmm-hmm.

64
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,634
Is there any news
on the leads?

65
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:57,901
Is that all you have to say to me?

66
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,639
Yeah. You got any
news on the leads?

67
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,370
Okay, I tell you what.

68
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,609
I'm going out on a very
important sales call.

69
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,050
You get any news about
the leads, you try me.

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,680
All of my numbers.
All six of my numbers, okay?

is King of Kings?</i>

answer emails anymore?

Because I have emailed you four
times asking you to come to my desk.

time to answer an email,

congratulate you.

This is actually a big
potential sale, so...

memoirs over there?

name over there?

It's good, you know,
with the kid.

Okay. Don't gloat.
Here's the thing.

93

can corrupt people.

Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

108
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,424
Look at that. That's...

109
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,686
I know who did that.

110
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,661
(EXHALES) You saw who did
this and you didn't stop them?

111
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,254
Didn't have to see.
It was sales, I can feel it.

112

They are out of control.

113
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,765

smashed my sandwich.

Yes. All of them.

Together.
It's a conspiracy.

Listen to me, Mike.

117
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,835
You gotta do
something about them.

You don't get it.

119
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,537
You need to get back on top.

That's what she said.
That's what she said.

121
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,917
Yeah.
Yeah.

122
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,853
Something came
for you, Michael.

123
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,049
Thank you very much.

124
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,523
What'd you get?

125
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,457
Uh, it's just the stupid
leads. JIM: All right!

126
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,428
About time.
Yeah! Me likey!

127
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,363
Yeah, finally, Michael.
Hand them over, numbnuts.

128
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,700
But seriously, I mean, it's
your job to give us those leads.

129
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,101
All right.

130
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,507
Then I guess I should
give them out. Hold on.

131
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,142
You know what I'm thinking?

132
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,612
I'm thinking that I have
something that you want.

133
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,979
You guys are acting
like you own this place,

134
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,244
and you don't.

135
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,185
Not even Sabre owns
this place. It's a rental.

136
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,017
I'm kind of sick of
the attitude around here.

137
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,955
I'm sick of
the cocky walk.

138
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,927
I am sick of you throwing
your paycheck in my face.

139
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,925
I am sick of your
uppity attitude, Jim.

140
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,300
I think I am not going
to give these to you.

141
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,668
KEVIN: Yes!
MEREDITH: Yeah!

142
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,366
We need those leads, Michael.

143
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,170
That's our job,
Michael. Michael!

144

a lot of money on those leads.</i>

give them out.</i>

146
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,241
Then we are just rewarding
their bad behavior.

147
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,186
Okay, just imagine

148
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,452
that instead of going to
jail for murdering someone,

149
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,827
you got an ice cream cone.

150
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,590
If that were the case,
then in the summertime,

151
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:41,326
everyone would go
around killing people

152
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,632
for the pleasure
of an ice cream cone.

153
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,764
<i>Michael, I don't want
to incentivize murder,</i>

154
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,569
<i>but we've tried
to make it clear</i>

155
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,974
<i>that our policy
emphasizes sales staff.</i>

156

I have no power.

You are in charge...</i>

supporting the sales staff.</i>

<i>You are required to hand
out those leads, Michael.</i>

160
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,112
Mmm-hmm.

161
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:05,021
Well, if that is what I am required
to do, I will do exactly that.

162
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,786
<i>Okay, good.
Exactly that.</i>

163
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,622
<i>Good.
Exactly that.</i>

164
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,093
<i>Why do you
keep repeating...</i>

165
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,425
Hello. May I have
everyone's attention, please?

166
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,760
Gabe has instructed me
to hand out the leads,

167
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,466
so I am going to give
the leads to King Creed.

168
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,732
What?
What are you...

169
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,744
And to King Meredith!

170
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,109
They aren't
sales people.

171
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,341
And to King Angela.

172
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,782
Because today we are
all kings and queens.

173
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,876
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

174
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,445
I am giving them
the leads, Phyllis.

175
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,124
Hey.
Hey.

176
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,492
So I'm gonna go ahead
and save you some time,

177
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,592
and tell you that no one's
gonna go along with this.

178
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,795
But you knew that, right?

179
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,894
Mmm-hmm.

180
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,930
All right. So, why don't you just
give me my share of the leads,

181
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,300
and I'll start
making some calls?

182
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,469
Okay.

183
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,973
Hey, all right.
All right.

184
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,546
(GROANS)

185
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,951
These aren't leads.
What are they?

186
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,513
(CLICKS TONGUE) Oh, right.
Those are clues,

187
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,492
and within each clue
is a lesson.

188
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,051
You learn a lesson,
and then you find a lead.

189
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,621
The leads are scattered
all over the industrial park.

190
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,692
I'm trying to make
your kids respect you,

191
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,102
because a father needs
to respect his boss,

192
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,506
and kids don't respect the father
who doesn't respect the boss.

193
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,043
Do you understand
that line of logic?

194
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,339
I don't even think
you understand it.

195
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,141
I do understand it.

196
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,449
This one's a map.

197
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,506
Or is it?

198
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,047
(EXHALES)

199
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,953
How the tables have turned!
I see you got my email.

200
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,760
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?

201
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,320
I'll give you the leads.
But you know what?

202
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,800
It's gonna cost you
some clerical work.

203
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,995
What are these for?
It doesn't matter.

204
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,628
Fill them out.
All of them.

205
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,071
And when you're done, you
can watch me shred them.

206
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,540
Right.

207
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,543
<i>I want to watch
The Kardashians, okay?</i>

208
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,272
<i>I don't want to watch Bored
To Death. It's mindless!</i>

209

<i>Kardashians is a good show.
It is...</i>

210

Thank you, Stanley!
No, you don't even know!

<i>How would he even
know The Kardashians?</i>

212
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,515
It's about a family, a real-life
family. No, Stanley, do you...

<i>PAM: Hey, baby, what's up?</i>

214
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,185
I am currently reading
incoherent riddles

215
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,124
on blue index cards
to find vital information

216
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,890

over the office. How are you?

Oh, my God.
I couldn't envy you more.

219
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,299
Having a baby is as
exhausting as they say it is.

220
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,507
Having two babies,
that's just unfair.

221
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,542
How about this one?

222
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,273
"When arrogant salesmen

we all go to the dump?

Why? Because I am
not going to call Sabre

then we'll all go
out and get pizza,

maybe catch a movie,

Does it have to be pizza?
Could we go for a falafel?

Really?

310

I'm not going.
You did this, not us.

311

Okay, no. You encouraged it.
You were complicit. Complicit.

You were all successories.

That sounds fun, mucking
around in the dump.

You can.

I can't.
You know that.

00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,127
Okay, fine, I get it.
I'll just go by myself.

317
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,895
I'll go, Michael.

318
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,262
'Cause you'll just
screw it up.

319
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,869
(EXHALES)

320
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,710
This place has gone to hell.

321
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,882
You know, Dwight, there was a
time you'd be pinching yourself

322
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,859
to have the opportunity to
look through a dump with me.

323
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,952
Yeah, well,
the acorn becomes the oak.

324
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,760
Yeah. Well, sometimes the
acorn just stays an acorn.

325
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,460
If you don't believe me,
look in my gutters.

326
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,365
You're adorable.
You need to go for it.

327
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,635
I'm gonna be, like, mad at you
if you don't... Yeah, whatever.

328
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,844
(EXCLAIMS) Can't wait
for this day to be over.

329
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,847
Why?
Just all the drama.

330
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,280
What drama?

331
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,840
Between the...

332
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,177
Us and you guys.

333
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,579
It's unnecessary, right?

334
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:51,680
So unnecessary.

335
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,987
Good. Thank God you said that.

336
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,757
You know,
maybe if the salesmen

337
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,659
weren't acting like such
a bunch of stuck-up losers,

338
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,131
then this day wouldn't be so
bad. Did you ever think of that?

339
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,993
I have new
baby pictures.

340
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,162
Jim.

341
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,227
(SCOFFS)

342
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,241
Don't use your cute
baby to make us like you.

343
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,776
She's wearing a Onesie.

344
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,839
Stop it.

345
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,014
If we act nice now,

346
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,483
then we're rewarding them
for treating us poorly.

347
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,610
Didn't we kind of start it?

348
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,484
Mmm. I think you're
remembering that wrong.

349
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,715
ANDY: Yeah. PHYLLIS: I
don't know about this.

350
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,519
I mean, I think we
should hold our ground.

351
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,186
The company's changed, and if
they don't like it, they can leave.

352
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,526
I mean, a lot of their
work can be done from India.

353
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,997
Can we at least all agree
that this is uncomfortable,

354
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,592
and maybe heading
for something bad?

355
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,502
All those who agree
say "aye."

356
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,629
ALL: Aye.

357
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,571
All those opposed? I don't
think we need opposed.

358
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,372
You've changed, man.

359
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,609
Oh, why, 'cause I have a
shot at a 100K commission?

360
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,149
Since when do you
care about money?

361
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,241
When I first met you,
you were a wide-eyed innocent.

362
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,549
Hey, there is nothing I can
do about my wide-set eyes.

363
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,885
No, no, no, I'm talking about
your personality, Dwight!

364
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,393
Okay, when I first met you,
I had a lot of job offers.

365
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,926
And I had an offer
from lvan Schotsky.

366
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,727
The lvan Schotsky. If I
had assistant managed him...

367
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,824
Assistant to
the managed him.

368
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,630
Oh, that's low!

369
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,194
I would be number two
right now at a Home Depot!

370
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,261
Yeah.
Okay?

371
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,967
'Cause they promote
from within!

372
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,441
Instead I had to follow you.
You're going nowhere.

373
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,206
You think you would have done
better without me. Really?

374
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,942
I hitched my wagon
to a horse with no legs.

375
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:28,146
Wow! Okay! Man!

376
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,781
When I think
about all the time

377
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,348
that I wasted
being your friend!

378
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,688
I shouldn't have
been hanging out

379
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,194
watching karate
movies with you!

380
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,524
Kung fu movies!

381
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,723
You know what I should have been doing?

382
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,494
I should have been out at
bars finding my soul mate,

383
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,229
finding my wife,
making babies.

384
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,295
Nice babies you're making
with the floozies at the bars!

385
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,238
That's my wife you're
talking about, man!

386
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,209
Your made-up wife
who doesn't exist?

387
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:54,970
You watch it!

388
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,541
If I'd wanted to hit you, I would
have hit you. Don't do it! No, no.

389
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,114
You just made an enemy
with the wrong guy, Dwight.

390
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,826
Wait. Timeout,
timeout, timeout!

391
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,500
Time-in.
No!

392
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,763
Don't... Don't even
think about that.

393
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,505
Stop it!

394
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,172
Give me that.
That's my spool!

395
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,782
What's the least we can do
to make this okay?

396
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,648
I'll text Pam. She's
really good at this stuff.

397
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,780
Yeah. I'll text Erin. She's
really good at this stuff, too.

398
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,682
I mean, I guess we could give
them some of our new commissions.

399
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,819
That is
a dangerous precedent.

400
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,194
Pam texted back saying we
could give them all iPods.

401
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,393
If they don't have an iPod by
now, they really don't want one.

402
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,993
All right. Then we're back to cash.

403
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,629
And I gotta say,

404
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,605
if giving a small
percentage of our commissions

405
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,665
is gonna smooth all
this over, I'm for it.

406
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,643
Okay, fine,
cash it is.

407
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,269
Erin just texted me back.

408
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,837
"People love shells
from faraway beaches."

All right, Dwight.

could do this.

But not like this.

421
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,330
So, how about, guys, 1%
commission a month instead of 2%?

What do you think...
No.

423
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,506
No, we agreed 2% for the quarter. Yes.

424
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,940
Okay. Hey, everybody.

425

and how we feel
is really sorry.

Yeah. We wanted to bring you
in and make a peace offering.

do the right thing, so...

to tell you to go to hell.
