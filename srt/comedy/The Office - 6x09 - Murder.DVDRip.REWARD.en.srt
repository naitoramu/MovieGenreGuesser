1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,697
Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,206
Who would like an authentic
New York bagel, hmm?

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,604
Stanley?
Thank you.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,202
Oh, no, no, no. I got a
pumpernickel just for you.

5
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,644
Wow, H&H.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,774
You went all the way to New
York City to get us bagels?

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,479
Why? Is there a place
closer that sells them?

8
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,077
This is really nice, Dwight.
Thanks.

9
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,179
Thanks.

10
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,553
Oh, don't mention it.

11
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,559
You owe me one.
You all owe me one.

12
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,561
Good morning, Michael.
Morning, Dwight.

13
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:30,618
Hungry?

14
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,631
No, I had
a fish stick sandwich.

15
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,394
Actually, I had two
fish stick sandwiches.

16
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,230
My girlfriend
didn't want hers,

17
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,862
because I guess I'm the
only aphrodisiac she needs.

18
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,496
Fish sticks are not
an aphrodisiac. Yeah.

19
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,370
You're thinking of deer penis.
It worked.

20
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,774
Regardless, that was over
two hours ago,

21
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,574
and it is now a scientific
fact that you are hungry.

22
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,046
Bagel?

23
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,480
I don't mind if I do.

24
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,245
Okay, I brought cheese, too.

25
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,512
I'm taking one
for my lady friend.

26
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,644
Excellent.

27
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,382
Brain food.
Thank you very much.

28
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,445
Okay.

29
00:00:58,925 --> 00:00:59,983
You owe me.

30
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,392
Can't a guy just buy
some bagels for his friends,

31
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,327
so they'll owe him
a favor which he can use

32
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:09,232
to get someone fired who stole a
co-manager position from him anymore?

33
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:13,329
Jeez, when did everyone
get so cynical?

34
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,460
Pam, would you
care for a bagel?

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,554
Oh, no, thank you.

36
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,862
Oh, that's right, you're a woman and
you need to refuse food the first time.

37
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,903
I'll try again.

38
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,200
Please, Pam, reconsider
and have a bagel.

39
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,103
I have an early lunch.

40
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,169
<i>PAM: Michael's been trying
to get Jim and me to hang out</i>

41
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,269
ever since he started
dating my mom.

42
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,179
I don't know. I really hoped
this thing would just die out,

43
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,343
but today he's planning a
birthday lunch for my mom.

44
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,080
And we have to go.

45
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,153
No way out.

46
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,122
No way out.

47
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,120
These are amazing.
You took all these?

48
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,289
I've always found beauty
in uncommon places.

49
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,663
Homeless people, graffiti.

50
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,998
Photography lets
me capture all that.

51
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,662
Have you ever been
photographed before?

52
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:19,966
Oh, just by,
like, friends.

53
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,167
Well, here's what I've
been doing around here.

54
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,041
It's for a series on
exposure in the workplace.

55
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,205
Pammy?
Hey!

56
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,674
Hey!

57
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,274
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

58
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,946
Girls, there they are.

59
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,352
Birthday lunch.
Birthday lunch.

60
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:40,290
There's no better medicine
than birthday lunch.

61
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,851
It'll cure all of your,

62
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,864
"Gee, I don't know if Michael
should be dating my mother."

63
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,958
And fixes all
occurrences of,

64
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,367
"I don't really
see them together."

65
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,961
So, open wide, Pam,

66
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,065
and take a big old spoonful
of birthday lunch medicine.

67
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,473
Take with food.

68
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,374
Pam, aren't you going to introduce
us to Michael's girlfriend?

69
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,439
I think you guys all remember
my mom from the wedding.

70
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,314
Yeah, I think everyone's met Helene. Hi.

71
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,375
MICHAEL: Shall we?
Wait a minute,

72
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,250
is that another
birthday present for me?

73
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,552
'Cause you already
gave me a necklace.

74
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,613
Oh, my God, I love it.

75
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,683
Tell her how you gave it to
me. No, that wouldn't be...

76
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,162
He put it around my neck while
I was still asleep this morning.

77
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,459
Nice way to wake up.
MICHAEL: Yeah.

78
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,468
The rest of the story has been
censored due to inappropriocity.

79
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,333
Because of sex?
Kevin!

80
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,703
Hey, please, Kevin.
You're fired.

81
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,075
Sorry, sorry, work with a
bunch of idiots. Shall we go?

82
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,509
HELENE: Yes, let's go.

83
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,576
Oh, wait.

84
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,844
Swartz Lumber's on the phone for
you, Pam. And they say it's urgent.

85
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,181
Oh, you guys,
just one second.

86
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,621
Oh, my gosh.

87
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,884
Are you serious?

88
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,719
Shipping emergency.

89
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,056
I don't think
I can go to lunch.

90
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,461
Oh, man, that's crazy. Right
as we were on our way out, too.

91
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,500
I know. Isn't that
always how it goes?

92
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,831
Rarely, if ever.

93
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,131
Let me give it a whirl,
I'll talk to them.

94
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,432
I will handle it.
That's okay.

95
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,268
I feel like it's...
It's my pleasure.

96
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,502
Hello? Well, that's great.

97
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,567
Turns out, the paper
was there all along.

98
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,135
Oh, thank God.

99
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,411
Something's up. That paper
was never supposed to arrive.

100
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,376
So, Pammy, are you
still liking sales?

101
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,081
Yeah, it's exciting.

102
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,991
You know, Michael
and I were talking,

103
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,187
and maybe, if you
put in a little more

104
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,029
face-to-face time with your clients,
you could improve your sales.

105
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,567
Pam's sales
are fine, actually.

106
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,069
Just want you
to succeed, Pammy.

107
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,503
You know what, we shouldn't even
be talking about business today.

108
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,562
Thank you.

109
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,472
Today's about family.

110
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,636
Why did I get in the
car? I could've struggled.

111
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,306
I have a whistle in my
purse, I didn't even blow it.

112
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,708
Oh, Dwight, I have a
little surprise for you.

113
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,721
Let me guess, you ate the
bagel I gave you and loved it.

114
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,983
Yes.

115
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,825
And I wanted to
return the favor.

116
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,123
I was polishing my loafers
and I happened to look over

117
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:59,221
and notice that your briefcase
was a little worse for the wear,

118
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,994
so a little elbow grease,

119
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,525
and she's polished right
up, back to her former glory.

120
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,038
Well.
Feel it against your cheek.

121
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:08,898
I will.

122
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,943
You give me a gift,
bam, thank you note.

123
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,444
You invite me somewhere,
pow, RSVP.

124
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,241
You do me a favor,
wham, favor returned.

125
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,448
Do not test my politeness.

126
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,182
Let me get that door
for you. There we go.

127
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,951
Thank you very much,
and I got it for you.

128
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,857
Oh! Goodness. Thanks.

129
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,157
You know, here's
a healthy fitness tip,

130
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,924
if you clench your buttocks
together while walking,

131
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,693
you can really take the
pressure off your knees.

132
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,393
ANDY: Is that right?
DWIGHT: Observe.

133
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,893
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

134
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,994
Right?
That really works.

135
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,165
Yeah. Feel free to use that.
Anytime, okay.

136
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,935
Hey, hold on a second.

137
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,274
Do not walk around with
your jacket catawampus.

138
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,177
And that needs to be
straight as an arrow.

139
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,442
Thank you very much.

140
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,513
Oh, boy. Hey, thank
you very much for that.

141
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,350
You are welcome.
Have a seat. Allow me.

142
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,322
Have a seat yourself.

143
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,291
You know what? I am
going to preemptively

144
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,329
change the batteries
in your wireless mouse.

145
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,488
Not necessary.
No, no, no!

146
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,930
You didn't have to do that.

147
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,694
Andy is complicating things.

148
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,396
But I'm not worried.
This will only up my game.

149
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,166
Hello. Scott.
Table for four.

150
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,733
Welcome, Scott family.
It'll be just a moment.

151
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,837
I used to love coming here.
The chicken parm is good.

152
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:26,476
Big part of my childhood. Maybe
Michael will start dating that, too.

153
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,521
What table should we take?
So many to choose from.

154
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,285
Wow.
Oh, my God.

155
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:37,762
What? All I see are boring old
tables with no birthday decorations.

156
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,425
Oh, wait a second,
you mean this one? Wow!

157
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,468
Michael, you did all this?

158
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,731
It's not about taking credit.
Let's just say we all did it.

159
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,796
Well, thank you,
all of you.

160
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,105
Well, it was actually
me alone, so...

161
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,576
Wow, look at this place.

162
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,510
It really makes me want
to go to Italy someday.

163
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,481
Oh, you'll love it.
You can have my guidebooks.

164
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,415
I think I'm done with those
really long plane rides.

165
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,316
Thank you for...

166
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,082
Thanks for
lending me the books.

167
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,647
So, Mom, which birthday
are we celebrating this year?

168
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,852
Sticking with 49.

169
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,258
Forty-nine again?

170
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,388
That's nine years in a row. This
is now our longest family tradition.

171
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,194
That's funny.

172
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,064
Well, as long as
we're running numbers, Pam,

173
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,363
help me out with this one.

174
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,871
Let's see, honey,
you're six months pregnant,

175
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,500
but you've only been married for 30
days, so what does that add up to?

176
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:27,512
Ooh, burn, burn on you.
And a little bit on me, too.

177
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,639
You're 54 years old.

178
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,580
No, I'm 58.

179
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,214
You're 58 years old?

180
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,447
Uh-huh.

181
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,649
Congratulations.

182
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,283
The only time you should
care about a woman's age

183
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,883
is if she is
too young for you.

184
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,021
And I am not
robbing the cradle.

185

If anything,
I am robbing the grave.

186
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,464
Mom, have you decided
what you want to be called?

187
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:55,473
I mean, I like Nana, but I
also like the classic Grandma.

188
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,566
Please be Grandma. I want you to
be Grandma. Definitely a Grandma.

Uh-huh.

191
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,448
Yay! Grandma.

192
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,880
Hey, would you guys ever
do a triathlon, you think?

193
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,084
Maybe.

194
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,251
Helene?

195
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,885
No. I don't think so.

196
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,226
I am. I'm definitely going to do it.

197
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,629
I've already got the run
and the bike thing down,

198
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,635
just need to learn how
to swim. Come on, you in?

199
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:27,434
No, no. I think a triathlon is
pretty much something I can rule out.

200
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,668
I don't know, it just
doesn't interest me.

201
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,506
So, it's a matter of
interest. Good. Okay.

202
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,547
It's not anything you
would have ever done?

203
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,014
I might have done it
when I was younger,

204
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,074
but now there are just other
things I'd rather be doing

205
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,618
than running and jumping
and swimming...

206
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,120
Well, there's no jumping
in a triathlon. Oh!

207
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,588
You're thinking
the broad jump.

208
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,683
Would you try bungee jumping?
No.

209
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,921
Snowboarding? No, no, you
want to go snowboarding?

210
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,691
I might, I might.

Oh, no, really?

Yep, yep.

Took a page right out of the
old Schrute book of niceness.

There is no book,
there's only a survival guide.

You bought
breakfast for everyone,

so I got
lunch for everyone.

Okay, well, allow me.
You know what?

00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,237
Gosh, these tacos are

I literally... I put no thought
into the wrapping at all.

have been toilet paper.

later, waded in, and I found it.

That's amazing.

I thought I was going
to grow old with Holly.

282
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,902
And then I met Helene,
and she is great,

283
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,567
and she already knows
and has done everything

284
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:55,410
that I have ever wanted to
do and can tell me about it.

00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,912
But I think I want to
do those things myself.

Cake's really good.

use butter-cream frosting.

I want you to
enjoy that cake

terrible I need to tell you.

to enjoy your cake

292

terrible, terrible thing.

and being your
boyfriend so much,

296

but I have to consider Pam's
feelings as a friend and a coworker.

I cannot, in good conscience,
continue to date you,

this is doing to her.

No, it's not.

301
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,300
I know that it took me a
little while to come around,

302
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,360
and it's still a little
weird to get used to,

303
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,505
but you obviously
make my mom very happy.

304
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,177
And that makes me happy.

305
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,775
Wow, that just...
You've really grown.

306
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,410
Well...
Oh, thank you, Pam.

307
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,785
And I hope you are as
gracious during this next part.

308
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,551
Helene, once again,
you are a wonderful person,

309

and you have
lived a great life,

and I envy it, and I want it
someday, but just in the future.

00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,731
I've never...
I don't know him.

314
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,774
There's another woman,
and her name is Italy,

315
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,143
and skydiving,
and bungee jumping.

316
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,641
Okay, so...

317
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,080
And I want kids.

318
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,051
And you, unfortunately,
have already completed

319
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,951
that part of your journey
down there. Michael.

320
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,047
It's not my decision,
it's Mother Nature.

321
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,922
And Mother has very
strict rules about

322
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,502
fertility.

323
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,765
(STUTTERS) I got it.

324
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,731
I'm 58. What am I
supposed to do now?

325
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,708
Well, hobbies.
Stop.

326
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,173
(GROANS)

327
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,477
What's going on?
Stupid thing wedged up there.

328
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,745
No one in this
office will help me.

329
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,252
Yeah, move it.

330
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,789
What if Dwight dies and
I still owe him something?

331
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,791
That is a recipe
for a ghost.

332
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,759
Oh, yeah, you're gonna owe me big time.

333
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,158
Looks like a little
envelope, there you go.

334
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,197
Yup. Got it.
"To Dwight"?

335
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,327
Starbucks gift card.

336
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,960
Surprise!

337
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,807
It's from everybody.
$15 value.

338
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,539
Damn it! I am no closer
to taking Jim down.

339
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,676
(EXCLAIMS)
What a waste of a day.

340
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,582
I could've grown poison mushrooms
that'd be this high by now!

341
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,683
They're mushrooms,
they don't get that high.

342
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,717
Pamela Beesly-Halpert.
What?

343
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,383
May I have a word with
you in my office, please?

344
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,449
I am working.

345
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,519
Well, this is
a work-related matter.

346
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,064
Really?
Yes.

347
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,264
Really?
Yes.

348
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,995
Join me, please,
won't you?

349
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,935
I'm going to give you
a raise, Pam.

350
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,067
Why?

351
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,304
Because of all the
good work you've done.

352
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,347
I have the lowest sales
record of anyone here.

353
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,575
Don't, no.
It's not about numbers Pam,

354
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,981
it's about attitude.

355
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,884
I have the worst attitude
of any person here.

356
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,514
Do you want
the raise or what?

357
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,648
Yeah, I'll take it.

358
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,749
Okay, hey. Pam, Pam.

359
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,420
With this raise,
there are strings attached.

360
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:36,264
And that string is attached from
my heart to your mean attitude.

361
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,597
You're bribing me?

362
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,833
No, no. No, I am not.
Unless you want me to.

363
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,032
Do you want me to?

364
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,371
Because I will,
I will bribe you.

365
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:50,848
No, your face is saying don't,
unless I haven't offered you enough.

366
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,676
Your face isn't changing.

367
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,617
What is it?
Talk to me, face.

368
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,590
Tell me what
Pam's brain is thinking.

369
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,559
Come on, what do you
want? What do you want?

370
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,120
Do you want a million
dollars? Do you want to hit me?

371
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,825
Do you want me to get down
on one knee and beg you?

372
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,925
I want to hit you.
What?

373
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,697
I want to hit you.
I'll do that.

374
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,634
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

375
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,005
What? I don't...
Are you kidding?

376
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,168
No, are you kidding?

377
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,438
No, I don't...

378
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,412
All right. Come on,
I'll take off my jacket

379
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,915
and tense my stomach
and you just...

380
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,750
No, I don't think I can
hit you in the office.

381
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,288
Okay.

382
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,824
So, we'll do it after work.
Hmm.

383
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,519
In the parking lot,
in front of everyone.

384
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,759
I'm going to hit you
as hard as I can.

385
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,593
Okay.

386
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,689
Okay.
Okay.

387
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,700
See you then.
See you.

388
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,260
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

389
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,664
RYAN: Hey.
Hi.

390
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,605
Quick question.
Yeah.

391
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,070
Are you scared?

392
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,509
Never.

393
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,706
About what? A little.
What are you talking about?

394
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,715
We heard about the punch.
What punch?

395
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,650
Pam. She's going to punch the
crap out of your face after work.

396
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,687
I'm pretty sure we said slap.

397
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,656
No, it's a punch and Pam has
that crazy pregnancy strength now.

398
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,750
I'm getting concerned that
you don't seem to understand

399
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,193
what's going to happen.
Do you?

400
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,327
(EXCLAIMS) I'm good.

401
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,389
RYAN: All right. See you there.

402
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,527
Hey.
Hey.

403
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,868
Do you and Pam ever get
frisky? Inappropriate.

404
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,772
I mean, do you ever
wrestle with each other?

405
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,070
All the time.
Really?

406
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,168
Yeah.
She's strong?

407
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,269
She wants it bad, Michael.

408
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,540
Can you stop this?

409
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,548
I can.
Okay.

410
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,550
And I don't support
her choice to hit you.

411
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,778
I don't, either.

412
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,184
But at the same time,
she goes crazy,

413
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,689
and I do
understand her reasoning.

414
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,884
Mmm-hmm. I know.

415
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,950
I just need some time. I need
some time to think about it.

416
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,757
You got to do... Give me
some time to make a decision.

417
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,390
How much time do you need? No
more than a week, maybe two weeks.

418
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,455
Come on, man.

419
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,962
Pam, can I talk
to you for a second?

420
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,300
I heard about the hit. Just to be sure,

421
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,964
it's off company property, right? Right.

422
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,440
Yeah, okay, I think we
should probably be okay.

423
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,942
Okay.
Okay.

424
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:04,508
(WHISPERS) And the power
comes from the back foot.

425
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,444
So, it's all one motion
through the body.

426
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,252
So, there's... You stay a
little low and there's a twist,

427
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,656
and you keep
your shoulder down.

428
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,956
And you kind of
throw out the arm.

429
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,018
(EXCLAIMS)

430
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,359
Okay, wait, you're saying
it comes from the foot?

431
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,423
Yes.

432
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,526
Okay.

433
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,096
Yeah. Okay.

434
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,231
Hey, everybody.

435
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,902
He's not in the men's room,
although the seat was warm,

436
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,410
so we may have
just missed him.

437
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,741
My money's on Pam.

438
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,577
It's not a fight. What
other outcome could there be?

439
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,707
Michael could win.

440
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,615
How? He can't hit back.

441
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,712
Why can't you just
agree with me sometimes?

442
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,155
Am I scared of getting
hit in the face? No.

443
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,251
Every day, weirdos pay
dominatrixes hundreds of dollars

444
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,023
for that very privilege.

445
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,793
I'm scared I'm going
to love it. Let's do this.

446
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,726
It's okay, guys. I can handle
this. Everybody can go home.

447
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,772
We're here for
the show, Michael.

448
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,932
You're just
a bunch of voyeurs.

449
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,100
Are you eating popcorn?

450
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,473
It has almost no calories.

451
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,875
You ready?

452
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,138
Yes.

453
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,045
You have to keep your
hands down. I know.

454
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,013
(EXHALES)
Okay. All right.

455
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,446
Oh, God!

456
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,821
Michael, you have to
keep your hands down.

457
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,189
Put your hands
in your pockets.

458
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,557
Okay!

459
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,231
Pam, Pam.

460
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,138
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.

461
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,071
What are you sorry for?
So many things.

462
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,608
I don't know,
it's hard to choose.

463
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,768
How about for dating my mom?

464
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,902
Maybe that's it.

465
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,309
And dumping her
on her birthday?

466
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,608
Yes.

467
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:52,222
Okay, just don't ever date
a member of my family again.

468
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,653
Okay, I promise.

469
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,592
For the record,
your mom came on to me.

470
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,564
Holy crap!

471
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,197
Are you okay?
No!

472
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,671
You're okay.

473
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,066
Feel better?

474
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,542
No, you were right.

475
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,639
Wait, why are you limping?

476
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,046
I don't know.

477
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,879
Let's get some
raw meat on that face.

478
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,977
I've got a chicken
in the freezer upstairs.

479
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,514
As I watched Pam's big, strong
hand coming toward my face,

480
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,686
I saw my entire life
flash before my eyes.

481
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,229
And guess what?
I have four kids.

482
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,157
And I have a hover car
and a hover house.

483
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,137
And my wife is a runner,
and it shows.

484
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:45,701
And Pam and Jim are my best
friends, and our kids play together.

485
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,974
And I'm happy.

486
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,538
And I am rich
and I never die.

487
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,184
It doesn't sound like much,
but it's enough for me.

488
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,781
Good, good, just keep it on
there for another five minutes.

489
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,760
It's cold, Dwight.
Let the swelling go down.

490
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,287
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
I owe you one, Dwight.

491
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,094
Fire Jim.

492
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,636
No.

493
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,433
I'm cashing in
the favor, fire him.

494
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,564
What are you talking...
Do it.

495
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,370
Promote me.
Tri-managers.

496
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,500
Forget that.

497
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,635
Can I have an office?
No.

498
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,440
You know what, you can
keep your stupid favor.

499
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,844
It's worthless.

500
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:26,179
And this is my dinner on
your face, I'm keeping it.

501
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,850
Oh, that feels better.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
