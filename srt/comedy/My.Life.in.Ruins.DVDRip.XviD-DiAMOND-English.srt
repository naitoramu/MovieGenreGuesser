It's very Greek.

You know, relax. Open up.

You pour it on the stain.

Actually, it's been about a year.

Hey! Who's seen the Olympics on TV?

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,816
Well, we're going to Olympia,
the site of the very first Olympics.

662
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,679
The ancient games began in 776 B.C.

Now, all through
the era of the Pisatans...

every five years.

Here's something interesting.

00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,362
Until they were abolished
from 393 until 426 A.D.

668
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,199
And then in 1896...

669
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:52,066
Well, that's about the year
I started to stink.

00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,523
I know every fact and every figure
about this place.

I mean, I love it here.
And they just want to have fun.

672
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,599
And I get it,
but I don't know how to make this job fun.

673
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,564
Well, if you call it a job, it ain't fun.

674
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:24,074
I mean, look at porn stars. They get to
schtup all day. They should be happy.

675
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,843
You never hear about a happy porn star.

- No, really, were you?
- I was an ice-cream taster.

680
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:43,960
- Get out.
- Thirty-five years.

681
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:48,292
- I wish I had that job.
- That's what my friends used to say.

But then Elinor got sick.

684

She always wanted to come to Greece.

So you work at an IHOP?

777
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,632
Yeah, well, I mean, that makes it sound
like I'm a waiter, you know.

778
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:59,135
I'm the number one
corporate representative for IHOP.

779
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,771
I sold 100 franchises last year.

780
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,408
We're expanding Ohio,
if you're looking for an investment.

781
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,668
How do we say, "Cheers"?

782
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,037
<i>We say, "ya mas, to our health".</i>

783

(TOASTS IN GREEK)

784
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,487

785
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,083
For fun?

786
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:23,852
Syrup.

787
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:28,292
I collect vintage syrups.

788
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:33,669
Yeah. Some people are
into art or wines, you know.

789
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,906
I'm into vintage syrups.
Not too old. When you say "vintage",

790
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:39,942
you think, "Oh, my God,
the guy's drinking syrup from 1912".

791
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,578
No. The oldest I have is 1948.

792
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,882
So it's post-war,
but it's still really special.

793
00:49:45,883 --> 00:49:47,662
I mean, it's still edible.
You can pote it.

794
00:49:47,663 --> 00:49:49,619
It's potent, potable? Potable?

<i>I never watch Jeopardy!</i>

796
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,523
Anyway, so the thing that
I like about syrup is it's sweet,

797
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,057
no matter how bad your day is.

798
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:58,394
...a German waffle,
but there's also a French crepe.

799
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,163
I mean, we had to have
a whole meeting in Iowa,

800
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,431
because the waitresses
were calling them "craps".

801
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:05,902
And no one wants to eat crap
so much anymore.

802
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,170
Sometimes in Mississippi.

803
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,338
But usually you find that
people don't want to have

804
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,875
a food that's not appetizingly named,
you know.

805
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:16,512
That's why I love any kind
of an international flair.

806
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:20,550
Swedish crepes. It just automatically
sounds better. It's exotic.

807
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:24,587
My favorite, though, natural.
Pecans, coconut, which is so, so good.

808
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:28,724
It's very, very fattening, and... Not that
I have anything against fat people.

809
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,726
Fat people are our biggest demographic.

810

You can actually feel the energy
coming from the ground.

954
00:59:32,222 --> 00:59:35,653
Do you feel it?
This is the temple of Apollo

was hidden from everyone

And she would crouch behind him,

959

she was hidden,
and she would answer questions.

960

It wasn't you he cheated.

Some men cheat themselves out of
living a life with a woman they love.
