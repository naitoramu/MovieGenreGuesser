1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,500
So what happened?
Did a forest tick you off?

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,620
We always say
we need a place for the mail.

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,020
I started building one. But then
I decided to take it to the next step.

4
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,090
You' re building a post office?

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,340
No, an entertainment unit,
with a built-in mail cubby.

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,010
It's a one-day job, max.

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,170
My word, those are snug!

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,220
These are my old work pants.

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,580
Sergio valente.

10
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,220
Power saw kind of got away
from me there.

11
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,890
The One With Frank Jr.

12
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,170
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

13
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,210
Hey, Pheebs.
Any sign of your brother?

14
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,330
No, but he's always late.

15
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,860
-I thought you only met him once.
-I did.

16
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,770
I think it sounds big sister-y,
"Frank's always late. "

17
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,820
Well, relax. He'll be here.

18
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,420
I know.
I' m just nervous.

19
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,060
It's just, Mom's dead,
don't talk to my sister. . .

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,820
. . .Grandma's been sleeping
a lot lately.

21
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,300
It's just the "Iast-desperate-
chance-to-have-a-family" kind of thing.

22
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,020
You' re sweet to wait with me.

23
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,020
Actually, Gunther sent me. You' re not
allowed to have cups out here.

24
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,370
Does anyone else think
David Copperfield's cute?

25
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
No. But he told me he thinks
you' re a fox.

26
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,820
All right. Janice likes him.

27
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,820
In fact, she likes him so much,
she put him on her "freebie" Iist.

28
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,130
Her what?

29
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,010
We have a deal where we each pick five
celebrities we could sleep with. . .

30
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,170
. . .and the other one can't get mad.

31
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,380
The heart of every
healthy relationship:

32
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,860
Honesty, respect
and sex with celebrities.

33
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,940
So who's on your list?

34
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,410
Kim Basinger. . .

35
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,020
. . .Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry. . .

36
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,660
. . .Yasmine Bleeth. . .

37
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,810
. . .and Jessica Rabbit.

38
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,620
You do realize that she is a cartoon,
and way out of your league?

39
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,820
I know. I just wonder if I could
get her eyes to pop out of her head.

40
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,860
Who would yours be?

41
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,700
First, I need a boyfriend.
Then I can have a list.

42
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,420
It's just a game, Mon.

43
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,660
Rach, how about you?

44
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,860
I don't know. I guess Chris
O' Donnell, John F. Kennedy Jr. . .

45
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,410
. . .Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting
and Parker Stevenson.

46
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,860
Spiderman?

47
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,300
Hardy Boy.

48
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,500
-Peter Parker.
-Thank you.

49
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,100
What about you, honey?
Who'd be on your list?

50
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,380
That kind of thing
requires some serious thought.

51
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,130
First, I'd divide my prospective
candidates into categories.

52
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,770
What a geek!

53
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,460
Everybody, this is Frank!
My half brother, Frank!

54
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,020
This is everybody.

55
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,900
-This is Ross.
-How are you?

56
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,770
This is Monica.

57
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,020
And this is Rachel.

58
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,140
I' m gonna get coffee for us.

59
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,820
Hey, how do you guys get
anything done?

60
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,900
We don't, really.

61
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,260
Do you guys have big plans?

62
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,210
Oh, yeah. We' re gonna connect
and bond and everything.

63
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,940
I thought we could go down to Times
Square and pick up some ninja stars.

64
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,020
My friend, Larry, he wants me
to take a picture of a hooker.

65
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,420
We really don't take advantage
of living in the city.

66
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,210
Oh, sorry. Did I get you?

67
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,820
No, you didn't "get" me!

68
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,210
It's an electric drill!

69
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,220
You "get" me, you kill me!

70
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,450
Calm down!
Do you want this unit or not?

71
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,050
I do not want this unit!

72
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,180
You should've told me before.
I' m not a mind reader.

73
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,820
And we' re out of beer.
I' m going to Monica's.

74
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,450
Fine!

75
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,220
Where you heading in those pants?
1 982?

76
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,170
I saw down at the hardware store, they
got those designer tiles on sale. . .

77
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,610
. . .if you wanna redo
your bathroom floor.

78
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,020
What's wrong with my bathroom floor?

79
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,980
Nothing. It's just old and dingy,
that's all.

80
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,340
I highly doubt that.

81
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,660
If you move your hamper. . .

82
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,700
. . .you see how
the tile used to be.

83
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,860
I can't live like this!
What are we gonna do?

84
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,460
Relax. Here, hold this.

85
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,420
This old stuff comes right up.
I'll show you.

86
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,020
A little more than I wanted to see.

87
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,820
Look at that!
Every inch of this is glued down!

88
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,410
It'd take forever to pry this up.
You should just leave it.

89
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,620
I can't leave it! You gouged
a hole in my dingy floor!

90
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,620
There. There you go.

91
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,860
Yeah, that's nice.

92
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,620
We can put it back there after the
surgeons remove it from your colon!

93
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,220
I know what I wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?

94
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,740
Because I can and my mom couldn't.

95
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,500
And I figured that was
something I got from our dad.

96
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,020
Well, wait, you mean like this?

97
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,210
Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

98
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,610
You' re not doing it.

99
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,210
Oh, right. Okay.
Yeah, my mom could and I can't.

100
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,340
We don't have that.

101
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,020
When's your birthday?

102
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,580
February 1 6th.

103
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,090
I know a guy who's the 1 8th.

104
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,340
That's close.

105
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,090
When's yours?

106
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,980
October 25th.

107
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,620
That's the same month as Halloween.

108
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,740
So what kind of things
do you like to do at home?

109
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,930
Melt stuff.

110
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,700
-Okay, I've got three of my five.
-Three of your five what?

111
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,650
Celebrities I' m allowed to sleep with.

112
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,250
God, you' re giving this
a lot of thought.

113
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,020
Hey, it's hard, okay?
I only have two spots left.

114
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,260
All right. Who you got it
narrowed down to?

115
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,370
Elizabeth Hurley.

116
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,460
very attractive.

117
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,850
Forgiving.

118
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,020
Susan Sarandon.

119
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,610
You know what? She's too political.

120
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,100
She'd probably make you donate
four cans of food first.

121
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,220
And lsabella Rossellini.

122
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,620
very hot. very sexy.

123
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,410
But she's too international.
She's never gonna be around.

124
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,050
-So?
-So you gotta play the odds.

125
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,420
Pick somebody who's gonna be
in the country all the time.

126
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,530
Yeah. Because that's why you won't
get lsabella Rossellini. Geography.

127
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,740
Okay. So by "melting"
you meant melting.

128
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,500
So is it, like, art?

129
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,340
Yeah, you can melt art.

130
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,100
Hey, can I use your phone?

131
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,780
-Sure. You want to call your mom?
-No, I want to melt it.

132
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,420
Oh. Well, not right now.

133
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,100
I' m gonna go to bed. The fumes
are giving me a headache. So. . . .

134
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,850
Good night, "bro. "

135
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,530
Good night.

136
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,890
Here.

137
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,860
Just in case.

138
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,220
Oh, excellent!

139
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,580
-What kind of karate is that?
-No kind.

140
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,060
He just makes it up.

141
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,340
-How's it going with you guys?
-So far it kind of blows.

142
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,620
I don't know, I just thought
he'd feel more like a brother.

143
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,050
Like you and Ross.
Close and connected and. . . .

144
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,740
We' re close now.
You wouldn't believe the years. . .

145
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,580
. . .of noogies, and wedgies, and flying
wedgies, and atomic wedgies and. . . .

146
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,620
That's when the waistband
goes over your head.

147
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,690
We drove each other crazy
playing the shadow game.

148
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,660
-How do you play the shadow game?
-How do you play the shadow game?

149
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,940
-I just asked you.
-I just asked you.

150
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,010
I don't have time for this.

151
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,810
-That is what the game is.
-You just gave up really quickly.

152
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,020
-Seen Joey?
-What's the matter?

153
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,130
Oh, just this!

154
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,620
It's my fault, really, because the
couch is where we keep the varnish.

155
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,780
Somebody wanna hand me
one of those tiles?

156
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,740
-What's going on?
-He's retiling my floor.

157
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,180
Spackle boy!

158
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,380
-Get up!
-You started this, you'll finish it!

159
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,260
He started mine first!

160
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,260
Build the unit, Cinderellie
Lay the tile, Cinderellie

161
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,060
Big octopus.

162
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,740
Oh, my God! I totally forgot!

163
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,290
Well, can't someone else do it?

164
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,340
But I have company.

165
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,220
Look, that's all right.
I'll come in.

166
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,820
I' m sorry,
but I have to go into work.

167
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,410
It's one of my regulars who's
insisting that I do him, so. . . .

168
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,890
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

169
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,450
I' m a masseuse.

170
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,660
I give people massages and stuff.

171
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,500
You work at one of
those massage parlors?

172
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,730
Well, you know, we don't call it that.
But, yeah.

173
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,860
That's wild.

174
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,930
No, I had no idea.

175
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,330
Alrighty.

176
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,420
I'll be back in a little bit.

177
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,420
Unless you want to come with me.

178
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,460
You mean, like, watch?

179
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,340
No. No, you can get one yourself.
It'll be on the house.

180
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,490
What are big sisters for?

181
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,620
Well, I don't think this. You know?

182
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,010
No. No, no.
I wouldn't do you myself.

183
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,940
I mean, that would be weird.

184
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,580
I'll get one of the
other girls to do it.

185
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,340
This is so much fun!

186
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,620
Are you excited?

187
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,500
Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?

188
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,620
It's beautiful!

189
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,820
It's like the first bathroom
floor there ever was!

190
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,220
What are you going in there for?

191
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,370
You want, like, a number?

192
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,020
Hi. Bye.

193
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,020
Okay. I' m done with my choices.

194
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,820
These are final.

195
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,260
-Well, it's about time.
-Yeah. very official.

196
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,620
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, Chandler
printed it up on his computer.

197
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,140
And who laminated it?

198
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,460
That was me.

199
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,490
All right, let me see.

200
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,050
"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurley. . .

201
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,580
. . .Michelle Pfeiffer. . .

202
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,300
. . .Dorothy Hamill"?

203
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,140
Hey, it's my list!

204
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,810
You do realize she only spins
like that on ice?

205
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,060
-What's going on?
-She broke my arm!

206
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,820
-He touched my fanny.
-She touched mine first!

207
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,460
That's my job!

208
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,140
So what's the deal? I can have sex
with you but I can't touch you?

209
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,090
-You can't have sex with her!
-Did you think I was a hooker?

210
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,650
No, okay. I know. You' re a masseuse.
It's cool. I' m not a cop!

211
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,820
Ask Mr. Wiffler if he
can wait for five minutes.

212
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,420
Fine.

213
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,980
I don't like you.

214
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,900
So that's what you thought I did?
God!

215
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,660
That's not what I do!

216
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,940
Wait, that's not what you do?

217
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,330
No!

218
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,700
Why would you think that?

219
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,100
I don't know. This is the city,
you know? I just. . . .

220
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,540
I mean. . .

221
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,100
. . .I don't know.

222
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,330
Whatever. It's the perfect end
to the perfect weekend anyway.

223
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,730
Oh, wait.

224
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,620
No, you' re right.
No, it was perfect.

225
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,090
I can't believe
I screwed it up so bad.

226
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,340
You thought it was perfect?

227
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,650
Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect. . .

228
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,260
. . .but you know, it was pretty cool,
you know?

229
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,020
Because we had all those
great talks, you know?

230
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,340
Which ones in particular
were great for you?

231
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,820
Well, you know, about
the tongue thing, you know?

232
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,490
And how I told you about
my likes and my dislikes.

233
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,700
How I like to melt stuff, and how
I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

234
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,340
Right. Okay.

235
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,220
I feel like I can really talk to you
because you' re my sister, you know?

236
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,100
Yeah. I guess I do.

237
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,980
And then I go feel your friend up
and make you mad at me.

238
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,140
Well, I wasn't hopping mad,
you know?

239
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,780
You hopped a little bit.

240
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,180
Yeah, I' m really sorry.
You know, I' m really. . . .

241
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,220
Okay.

242
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,020
Well, this is my favorite part
of the weekend. Right now. This.

243
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,290
This?

244
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,410
Oh, come on. We went to Times Square.

245
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,620
We found ninja stars. I almost
get my arm broken by a hooker--

246
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,220
She's not a hooker.

247
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,900
When I tell my friends about her,
she will be.

248
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,890
On 3!

249
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,900
1 , 2--

250
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,700
Why don't we just go on 2?

251
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,810
Why 2?

252
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,420
Because it's faster.

253
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,770
I could've counted to 3 four times
without all the "2" talk.

254
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,460
-All right, but in the future--
-Heavy thing! Not getting lighter!

255
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,780
1 , 2--

256
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,020
So we are going with two?

257
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,380
A good job, Joe.

258
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,580
Wow.

259
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,260
It's big.

260
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,820
So big it actually makes
our doors look smaller.

261
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,020
Maybe my ruler's wrong.

262
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,610
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

263
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,620
It's not that bad. So it blocks a
little of your door, a little of mine.

264
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,810
I got a better idea.

265
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,450
How about it blocks none of my door,
and a lot of your door?

266
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,730
Listen, before I forget,
that side is still wet.

267
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,050
Let me just see
if I've got this right.

268
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,610
So this is a half-caf, double-tall,
easy hazelnut. . .

269
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,580
. . .nonfat, no foam, with whip,
extra-hot latte, right?

270
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,180
Okay. Great.

271
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,460
You freak.

272
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,180
Thank you.

273
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,060
A coffee to go, please.

274
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,420
Isabella Rossellini!

275
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,180
Are you serious? Oh, my God!

276
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,690
Damn! I cannot believe
I took her off my list!

277
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,780
Why? Because otherwise
you'd go for it?

278
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,380
Yeah, maybe.

279
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,140
You lie.

280
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,660
You don't think I'd go up to her?

281
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,450
It took you 1 0 years to finally admit
you liked me.

282
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,340
Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad
that list is laminated.

283
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,900
You know what, honey? You go ahead.
We'll call her an alternate.

284
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,050
Hold my cruller.

285
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,290
Are you really gonna
let him do this?

286
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,610
He's about to go hit
on lsabella Rossellini.

287
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,170
I' m just sorry we don't got popcorn.

288
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,940
I' m Ross.

289
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,700
You don't know me,
but I' m a big, big fan of yours.

290
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,980
I mean. . .

291
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,540
...Blue Velvet.

292
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,420
I was wondering if I could maybe
buy you a cup of coffee.

293
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,050
Or reimburse you for that one.

294
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,140
Aren't you with that girl over there?

295
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,020
Well, yeah, kind of.

296
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,210
But that's okay.
We have an understanding.

297
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,660
We each have this list of five famous
people, and you were one of mine.

298
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,020
So I' m allowed to sleep with you.

299
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,900
It's flattering.

300
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,620
I don't know--

301
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,090
Wait. Wait, lsabella.

302
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,220
Don't dismiss this so fast. This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

303
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,380
Yeah, for you.

304
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,820
Is that the list?

305
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,460
-Yes.
-Can I see it?

306
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,130
-Come on.
-But-- Okay.

307
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,340
I' m not on the list!

308
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,020
But that's not the final draft.

309
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,940
It's laminated.

310
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,820
Okay, see, you were on my list.

311
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,700
But then my friend, Chandler. . .

312
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,020
. . .brought up the point
that you are international.

313
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,060
So I bumped you for Winona Ryder.
Local.

314
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,130
You know, it's ironic,
because I have a list. . .

315
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,060
. . .of five goofy coffeehouse guys.

316
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,900
And yesterday, I just bumped you
for that guy over there.

317
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,540
We' re just gonna be friends.

318
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,290
You know what?

319
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,860
Bet you I could fit in there.

320
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,540
I got five bucks says you can't.

321
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,940
Get out your checkbook, mister.

322
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,050
Oh, I think I have the cash.

323
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,340
You are dog, man!

324
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,380
I totally fit!

325
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,980
Yeah. You got me.

326
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,890
I' m out five big ones.

327
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,380
There you go.

328
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,260
Thank you.

329
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,380
Oh, well, hello, Mr. Lincoln!

330
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,610
Better luck next time, buddy!

331
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,780
And the drinks are on me!
