1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,838
I'm getting my nails done!

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,841
You said it was going to be fun.

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,052
Which it kind of is.

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:14,348
You said there would be guys.
There are no guys.

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,558
There's one right over there.

6
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,935
That's a mailman!

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,815
That's our mailman!

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:32,074
Don't worry. This doesn't
make you any less of a guy.

9
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,452
That does.

10
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:39,248
What am I sitting on?

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,669
What was this woman scratching
when this broke off?

12
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,838
You know who had nails like that?

13
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,089
Oh...

14
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,423
...my...

15
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,719
...God!

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,348
The One with All the Rugby

17
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,604
Joey, let me ask you a question.

18
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,232
What does this light switch do?

19
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,817
Nothing.

20
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,361
Did it drive you crazy
to not know?

21
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,199
I know what it did.
Nothing.

22
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:59,119
They put it there for something.
How can you not care?

23
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,289
Like this.

24
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,501
Here's another question.

25
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,712
What does the silver
knob on the toilet do?

26
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,213
It flushes it.

27
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:16,095
Since you know, when you come over,
would you use it?

28
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,397
Guess who we saw today?

29
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,525
- Janice!
- Is this amazing?

30
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:34,530
- How have you been?
- Well, I'm divorced.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,534
I'm riding the alimony pony.

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,497
And there it is.

33
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,459
I just came up to say "hi".

34
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,252
Sweetie, I'll see you later.

35
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,673
I'll see you tonight.

36
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,637
I can't stand the woman!

37
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,932
What?
I thought you were crazy about her!

38
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,811
But you know all those annoying
things she did before?

39
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,855
Her voice, her laugh
and her personality?

40
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,734
They're all back!

41
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,611
And she's picked up, like,
nine new ones!

42
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:19,325
Why'd you bring her here?
There's people here!

43
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,244
Don't worry.
I'm taking care of it.

44
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,539
You are not!
You never break up with her.

45
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,332
I don't have to break up.

46
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,377
We're not involved.
I'll do a preemptive strike.

47
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,505
I'll end it with her
before it starts.

48
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,509
My ass is, like, frozen!

49
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:42,514
Try sticking it in the freezer
for 20 minutes.

50
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,936
I'm telling you!

51
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,819
I can't believe
you walk alone here at night.

52
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,990
- You hear such stories about New York.
- It's not that bad.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,661
I mean, I, for one,
feel perfectly safe.

54
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,456
Help! Help!

55
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,666
No, no, Ross!

56
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,836
These are friends from home.

57
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,963
Liam, Devon, this is Ross.

58
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,675
- Hi, mate.
- How are you, man?

59
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,846
That was a good one, huh?
"Help! Help!"

60
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,013
How are you?

61
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,516
I've been meaning to ring you
ever since I arrived...

62
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,435
...but I've been rather busy.

63
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,272
We have not seen each other
since that U2 concert.

64
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,358
Oh, my God. You're right.

65
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,904
Actually, the last time we saw
each other was the next morning.

66
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,281
Oh, Liam!

67
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,660
Oh, Liam.

68
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,078
So were you guys playing soccer?

69
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:51,208
Or should I call it "football"?

70
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,168
We were playing rugby.

71
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,713
In fact, we're playing tomorrow.
You're welcome to play.

72
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:01,343
Ross play rugby?
I don't think so.

73
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,138
What's so funny?

74
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:09,643
Well, you're American, to start with.
You don't have rugby here.

75
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:14,606
Well, we didn't have freedom
here until 1776 either, so...

76
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,568
So, good!
We'll see you at the park at two.

77
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,738
Cheers!

78
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:32,082
Oh, boy! I just love to sing.

79
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,750
Yes, I know you do.

80
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,669
The reason people complained...

81
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,757
...was because they paid to hear
the actor sing "Old Man River".

82
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:41,967
Look at us!

83
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:47,973
Who would've thought Cupid had
a station at 14th Street Nails?

84
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,601
Okay, we have to talk.

85
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,522
I'm just getting out of
a very serious relationship.

86
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,817
I know. And I'm just
getting out of a marriage.

87
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,737
Talk about "meant to be".

88
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,283
Right. But I think this
is happening too soon.

89
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,619
Oh, too soon, too schmoon!

90
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,832
Face it, I'm not letting you
get away this time.

91
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,210
I hear you!

92
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:19,880
But...

93
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,381
...unfortunately...

94
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,175
...my company...

95
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,304
...is transferring me overseas.

96
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,848
Oh, no!

97
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,100
Where to?

98
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,894
To Paris?

99
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,646
No, not Paris.

100
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,649
To London? Rome? Vienna?

101
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:39,733
Barcelona?

102
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:44,196
Could you just stop talking
for a second?

103
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,325
Yemen.

104
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,662
That's right. Yes!
I'm being transferred to Yemen!

105
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,914
When?

106
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,750
I don't know exactly.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,213
Well, I will just have to
soak up every ounce...

108
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:07,135
...of Chandler Bing until
that moment comes.

109
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:11,473
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.

110
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,646
- Done?
- Yep!

111
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,230
What's up?

112
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,233
This switch is
driving me crazy.

113
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,986
I turned it off
and checked every outlet.

114
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:28,198
Four don't work, which means
one is controlled by the switch.

115
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,993
So I plugged things in the outlets
that make noise.

116
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:37,416
That way, when I turn it on,
I just follow the noise.

117
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,628
Bet I stopped listening first.

118
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:44,131
You know, you also could
have used lamps...

119
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,425
...and followed the light.

120
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,679
Yeah, well, I'm using noise.

121
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,931
So, everybody ready?

122
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,559
Here we go!

123
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:02,233
Something. I hear something.
Where is it?

124
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,287
It's coming from Joey!

125
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:20,166
Oh, my God! That's so freaky!
Turn him off!

126
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,386
Could we put on the news?
It might be raining.

127
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:35,432
Hold on. I'm watching
this rugby thing on ESPN.

128
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,518
I'm man enough to play this sport!

129
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:44,108
You're not even man enough to
get the channel that carries the sport.

130
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,152
Hey there, Ross!

131
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,782
Janice.

132
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:56,328
You know, you really didn't
have to help me pack.

133
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:00,665
When you said all you'd be doing
before you leave is packing...

134
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,293
...you really didn't
leave me much choice.

135
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,673
I thought I did,
but I guess I did not.

136
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,800
What's going on?

137
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,097
I'm packing, you know,
because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

138
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,475
Thanks for telling me!

139
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:24,564
I'm going to be pretend-moving
to Yemen. To get rid of her.

140
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,359
Good one!

141
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,363
Yemen! That actually sounds
like a real country!

142
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:36,076
I'll show you how to roll your
underwear and stuff it in your shoes.

143
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,619
It's a space-saver.

144
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,208
I do that because
it makes me look taller.

145
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,545
Come on!

146
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:50,591
- Joey, trade lives with me.
- Nope.

147
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,677
Ross, I can't believe
you said you'd play.

148
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,011
This is brutal!

149
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,764
I can handle it.

150
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:02,311
Please, Ross. You got hurt
playing badminton with my dad.

151
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:07,566
That's because your mom's dog
kept looking at me.

152
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,861
Look! Right here,
it's called a "scrum".

153
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,529
It's like a huddle.

154
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,408
And is a hum like a scruddle?

155
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,662
Ross, they're going kill you!

156
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,665
Why are you doing this, anyway?

157
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,585
You should've seen the guy
she used to date.

158
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,920
He's like "Joe Rugby"!

159
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:33,884
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?
That's funny!

160
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,054
Oh, I see. You did that.

161
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:42,476
She thought the very idea of me
playing rugby was hilarious.

162
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:46,772
So I'll show her
how tough I really am.

163
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,026
I'm sorry.
You are a tough guy.

164
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,780
The toughest paleontologist I know.

165
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,742
Ross can take care of himself.
It's not like he's Chandler.

166
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,161
Thanks.

167
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,704
Don't worry about me.

168
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:06,375
I'll just look energetic
and stay away from the ball.

169
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:11,088
I'll be that guy,
right outside the circle.

170
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,638
Maybe there was a dog
looking at him.

171
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,482
Stay away from that guy
and that guy...

172
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:35,111
...and that one.
Dude, they're all huge!

173
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,780
They're no bigger than me.

174
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,953
You're closer to you. So you look
bigger to you from where you are.

175
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,623
I'm going to go say "hello".

176
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:57,009
I kind of liked it.

177
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,511
I know what to do.

178
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,639
I've got to go Red Ross.

179
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,476
You know, Red Ross?

180
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,394
Totally don't know.

181
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,897
That time we were in line
for "Dances With Wolves"...

182
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,777
...and that guy cut in front of us
and I just lost it?

183
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,738
Screamed at him, turned all red!

184
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,991
Red Ross!

185
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,287
You'll see!

186
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,247
Liam, do me a favor.

187
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,251
Go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.

188
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:34,171
You don't say?

189
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,598
Good luck, babe.

190
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,976
Come on, get in here!

191
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,812
Come on!

192
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,697
Come on, get in the bloody scrum!

193
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,908
Ross, get in!

194
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,879
Joey!

195
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,969
You're not going to believe it!
Joshua came in today, and guess what?

196
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,470
He asked you out?

197
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,226
But I showed him some cuff links,
and I felt his pulse.

198
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,396
Saucy!

199
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:37,401
- What are these?
- Electrical plans for the building.

200
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,154
Okay, should I be scared?

201
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:44,241
I know that switch does something.
I got these from City Hall.

202
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:48,286
I just paid $25
and waited for three hours.

203
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:52,416
Wow! If only more people knew!

204
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,680
You really didn't have to
take me to the airport.

205
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,933
Oh, please.
Every moment is precious.

206
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,062
Besides, someone had to ride
with your luggage.

207
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:17,149
And your friends don't seem to care
that you're leaving.

208
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,611
We're not that close.

209
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,239
Okay. So I guess this is goodbye then.

210
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,824
Oh, no!

211
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:30,078
It's not goodbye. I'm not leaving
till you get on that plane.

212
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:35,292
Okay. Well, I guess
it's just "wait here" then.

213
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,131
I need a fake ticket to Yemen.

214
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,966
One ticket?

215
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,469
I just need a pretend ticket.

216
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,638
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

217
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,849
Okay, what would you give a kid
to play with?

218
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,853
Are you traveling with a child?

219
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,734
She'll think I'm
handing you a credit card.

220
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:05,947
But what I'll really hand you
is a library card.

221
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:11,286
A ticket to Yemen is $2100,
and we don't take library cards.

222
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:14,290
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

223
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,626
Do you have to stay?

224
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:21,130
American Express?

225
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:33,559
I can't believe they're doing that!
I told them to go easy on him!

226
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:39,982
No offense, but sometimes it's hard
to understand you, with the accent.

227
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:44,027
That's just halftime.
There's more.

228
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,321
Did you see me?

229
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:50,576
I was pretty good.
That is one fun game!

230
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,995
Do me a favor?
Grab me some water?

231
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,831
Thanks!

232
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,542
I think I'm dying.
I really do.

233
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,835
Poor baby!

234
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:03,380
Tell my son that I love him.

235
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:06,634
Excellent!
Got to have some more fun!

236
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:10,054
They are killing you.

237
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,305
That's not true.

238
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,307
She's right.
You have to stop!

239
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:16,560
No! I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross!

240
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,022
Dude, you go back out there,
you'll be Dead Ross.

241
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm not quitting.
I'm going to finish this game.

242
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,570
If you insist on it,
at least let me help you.

243
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,700
It's no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything!

244
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,663
That's not it. I just know a few things
that can help you inflict pain.

245
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,707
I like that.

246
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,125
Listen closely.

247
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,419
Devon has got a weak ankle.

248
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,671
One swift kick and he'll back off.

249
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,549
Bad ankle. Got it!

250
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:51,177
And that big bloke with the beard?
He's got a trick hip.

251
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,890
And David over there,
he doesn't wear a cup.

252
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,060
I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup. Okay!

253
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,065
And Liam's got bad knees. Hit him right
and he'll go down like a lamp.

254
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,025
But Liam's on my team.

255
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,820
- I don't care. Just get him!
- Go and get him!

256
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,575
I am going back in!

257
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:18,163
Red Ross! Yeah!

258
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,590
What are these?

259
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,093
Just some pictures
I made and hung up.

260
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:36,056
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
Don't they?

261
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:48,235
There's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.

262
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,697
Oh, my God! Look at this!

263
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:55,325
But there is a wire there!
It's connected to something!

264
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:59,580
I don't care! The wires have
come loose in your head!

265
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,916
If I could follow the wire,
I'd find out what it did.

266
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,085
And did you?

267
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,169
No.

268
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,756
It disappears behind there.

269
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:13,427
For a minute, I thought
it went downstairs.

270
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,974
But it didn't.

271
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,185
Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.

272
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,728
Oh, my God!

273
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:27,816
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.

274
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,613
Are you sure you
don't want a doctor?

275
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,909
No, that'll just bring me down!

276
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,246
This was great! I was great!
This was a great day!

277
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,790
I'm buying everyone coffee.

278
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,627
Just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.

279
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,421
No, not you.

280
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:53,300
Your eye's still popping out.
I'll go get some ice.

281
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,721
Ice, yeah!
I'm so in the mood for ice.

282
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,557
You were amazing out there.

283
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,350
I kind of was, wasn't I?

284
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,519
Oh, my God!

285
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,773
I made a man twice my size cry!

286
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:14,404
I haven't done that since I was four and
I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.

287
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,823
You really enjoyed yourself,
didn't you?

288
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,535
Are you kidding?
I hurt three huge men.

289
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,662
I gave a guy a bloody nose!

290
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,832
I'm not proud of it...

291
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,710
...but I really am!

292
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,962
And it's all because of you.

293
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:34,842
- Wonderful, amazing you.
- I think you've got a concussion.

294
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,637
No, I'm serious.
Thank you.

295
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:42,349
You're welcome.

296
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,809
I'm sorry.
Did that hurt you?

297
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,729
It's worth the pain.

298
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,608
You know what? It's not.

299
00:19:55,445 --> 00:20:00,992
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>
<i>for flight 664 to Yemen.</i>

300
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,122
Well, I guess I gotta go.

301
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,584
My Bing-a-ling.

302
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,794
I'll wait for you.

303
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,797
How long will you be gone?

304
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:20,470
Well, just until we find
an energy source to replace fuel.

305
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,807
I'll write you every day.

306
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:28,687
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

307
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:32,357
Okay. Goodbye.

308
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:52,794
Janice! There you are!
I had to have one last kiss.

309
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:57,049
And also, you said you'd leave
after I got on the plane!

310
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:01,428
No. I want to see you take off.

311
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:05,640
Well, then I guess
I'm going to Yemen.

312
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:09,060
I'm going to Yemen!

313
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:14,191
When we get to Yemen,
can I stay with you?

314
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,783
All right. The super couldn't
figure out what it did.

315
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:26,870
The $200-an-hour electrician
couldn't figure out what it did.

316
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,915
I've had seven
pretty serious shocks.

317
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,167
I give up.

318
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,961
Thank God.

319
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,589
I guess Joey was right.

320
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,093
It does nothing.

321
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:47,557
See?

322
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:54,982
I'm doing it!
I am totally doing it!

323
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,574
I lost it.
