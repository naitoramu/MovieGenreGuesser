1
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,428
Monica?
Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?

2
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,346
- Okay.
- All right!

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,890
But what is it not?

4
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,560
A place to entertain my lady friends.

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:23,607
- And what else is it not?
- A place to eat spaghetti.

6
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,401
Very good. What do you need
it for anyway?

7
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,071
The Powerball lottery
is up to 300 million...

8
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:33,784
...and they don't sell tickets here.
- So you're driving up to Connecticut?

9
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:37,121
Yeah, Connecticut.
Not West Virginia.

10
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,959
Maybe I'll drive you up there.
I'd like to buy some tickets myself.

11
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:46,589
Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid,
we could really use $300 million.

12
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:51,635
Yes, because if I was at my old job,
we'd say, "300 million? No, thank you."

13
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,556
- Will you get me tickets too?
- Yeah, me too.

14
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,474
- Sure.
- I have an idea.

15
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,894
Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks,
we'll pool our money together...

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,731
...and then if we win, we'll split it.
- That's a great idea!

17
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,609
No, thanks.

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,612
- You don't want to win the lottery?
- Sure I do.

19
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,823
I also want to be king
of my own country...

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,743
...and find out what happened
to Amelia Earhart.

21
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,496
- Still on Amelia Earhart?
- The woman just vanished!

22
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,041
Seriously, you don't want in on this?

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,170
No. Do you know what your odds
are of winning the lottery?

24
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,923
I mean, you have a better chance
of being struck by lightning 42 times.

25
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,344
But there's six of us, so we'd
only have to get struck 7 times.

26
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,679
I like those odds!

27
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,392
Seriously, you guys, I can't believe
you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.

28
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,854
I mean, that's such a bunch
of boo-hockey.

29
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,068
I'll ask.

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,320
"Boo-hockey"?

31
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,448
Oh, we think Emma's about
to start talking...

32
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,243
...so we're trying to be careful about
what words we use in front of her.

33
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,620
So get ready to hear a lot
of boo-hockey...

34
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,373
...gosh darn it
and brother pucker.

35
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,043
How do you know
she's gonna start talking?

36
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:11,089
When I talk to her, I almost feel
like she understands what I'm saying.

37
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,133
Kind of like Joey.

38
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,303
What's that now?

39
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,639
The One With the Lottery

42
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,985
God, look at all these tickets.
It's so exciting.

43
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,195
I haven't won anything
since sixth grade.

44
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,656
Pie-eating contest?

45
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,995
You assume because I was heavy that's
the only way I could win something?

46
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,248
No, I saw a picture
of you covered in blueberries.

47
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,292
- That was a good day.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:33,798
- They're towing your car!
- I'm parked in a garage on Morton.

49
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,217
They're towing a car.

50
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:41,096
And I am seeing spots.

51
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,015
Ross, you don't have Emma!
Rachel, you don't have Emma!

52
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,560
- Where's Emma? Who has Emma?
- Joey, relax.

53
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:51,064
My mother picked her up two hours ago.
You were there.

54
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,818
- I was?
- Yes, and you talked to her.

55
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,363
- I did?
- She dropped off a casserole.

56
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,492
Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.

57
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,077
Did you come by to watch
us win the big bucks?

58
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,873
Yeah. And then I figured after you win,
we can all go out to the balcony...

59
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,503
...and see a night rainbow
with gremlins dancing on top of it.

60
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,923
Don't touch the phone!
I'll get it!

61
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,009
- You think he washed his hands?
- Hello?

62
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,553
- Hey, Charlie, what do you know?
- What's going on?

63
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,015
Chandler's supposed to find out if he's
getting a job at his agency.

64
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,559
But out of 15 interns,
they're only hiring three.

65
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,602
- Tough odds.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,523
If only it were a sure thing
like your 24-state lottery.

67
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,362
Yeah, look who's coming around!

68
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,282
Damn it. All right, call me
when you know more.

69
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,495
- Did you get it?
- One of the slots got filled.

70
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:51,416
- By you?
- Sense the tone.

71
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,255
- No, that kid Nate got it.
- Oh, I hate that guy.

72
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,716
I mean, come on, kid,
pull up your pants!

73
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,718
Well, there's two spots left, right?

74
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,555
Yeah. I mean, I want this so much.
I want to get one.

75
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,932
I want my friend Charlie
to get one.

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,184
Except I don't care about Charlie.

77
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,146
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey!

78
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,107
You are not gonna believe this.
I just saw my psychic...

79
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:19,111
...and she said I was definitely
gonna win the lottery tonight!

80
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,573
I thought we could use
some extra luck...

81
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,783
...so I brought a wishbone home
from work.

82
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:31,456
A psychic and a wishbone?
Guys, give someone else a chance.

83
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,001
- All right, who wants to do it?
- Can I?

84
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,171
Vegetarians never get
to do the wishbone.

85
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,215
It's really not fair. Just because
we don't eat the meat...

86
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,468
...doesn't mean we don't like
to play with the carcasses.

87
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,804
All right. Rach?

88
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,349
I don't want that turkey smell
all over my hands.

89
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,103
I'll do it! Lt'll get the casserole
stink off of mine.

90
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,191
- I hope I win.
- Well, it doesn't really matter.

91
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,359
You're both wishing
for the same thing.

92
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:04,281
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for,
or else, you know, it won't come true.

93
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,576
Right. But we know
what you're wishing for.

94
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,704
- I can't really say.
- I understand.

95
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,416
But you're wishing
for what we think, aren't you?

96
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,418
I'm not really comfortable
with these questions!

97
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,629
- Please!
- Just do it!

98
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,798
Okay. One, two, three.

99
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,883
I won! Hey!

100
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,177
You know what? I'm sure your
wish is gonna come true.

101
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:31,224
But, you guys, just in case, maybe a
genie will come out if we rub this lamp.

102
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,561
That thing gets hot!

103
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,397
Ross, just keep making your jokes.

104
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,774
How are you gonna feel
if we actually do win?

105
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,152
- You're not gonna win.
- I know the odds are against us...

106
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:46,490
...but somebody has to win, and it could
be us. And then how you gonna feel?

107
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,410
We're gonna be like, "Everybody, let's
take our helicopters up to the Cape."

108
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,955
And you're gonna be all,
like, "Oh, I can't, guys.

109
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,333
I'll have to meet you up there.
I gotta gas up the Hyundai."

110
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:04,550
Okay, I've heard myself on tape,
and I sound nothing like that.

111
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,928
I can see the headline now:
"Lottery Winners' Friend...

112
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,472
...Filled With Regret,
Eats Own Arm."

113
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,683
Why would I eat my own arm?

114
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,436
Well, you wouldn't, but we own the
paper. We can print whatever we want.

115
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,231
You know what? I'm gonna
throw in 50 bucks for you.

116
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,859
- Why?
- Because I know that you think...

117
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,111
...that the lottery is boo-hockey...

118
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,991
...but we're all here, and we're gonna
watch the numbers and have fun.

119
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,161
And you're my brother,
and I want you to be a part of this.

120
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,582
You don't have to do that.
I mean, I'll pay for myself.

121
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,670
But just the fact that you want me to
have fun with you guys, that's so sweet.

122
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,464
Come here.

123
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,925
Get a room.

124
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,973
So now that you're in,
what are you gonna do if we win?

125
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:57,812
- I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.
- Calm down.

126
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,731
Seriously, that's your fantasy?
To invest it?

127
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:05,652
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, "invest it"?
I meant, "Be cool and piss it all away."

128
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,575
I know! We should pool all
our money and buy the Knicks!

129
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,827
I don't really care about the Knicks.

130
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,956
You will when I pick you
as starting forward.

131
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:21,334
You would do that?
I never get picked!

132
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,921
I'm not sure a sports team
is the way to go.

133
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,340
You won't let me buy the Knicks?
I can't believe you're taking this away.

134
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,637
You're right, it has been your dream
for over 15 seconds.

135
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:35,891
How long until they announce
the numbers, Mommy?

136
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:40,479
I'll take this one too.
"Mommy"?

137
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,649
Oh, I've gotten into the habit
of calling Rachel...

138
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,901
..."Mommy" when we're around Emma.

139
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,946
Which I now realize we are not.

140
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,492
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough,
it'll be her first word.

141
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,872
Although if we're gonna do that,
we should probably call me "Daddy" too.

142
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,875
I like that, Daddy.

143
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,465
I was just talking about Rachel.

144
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,551
Is Daddy getting angry?

145
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,139
Is Daddy gonna spank me?

146
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,269
Well, that depends.

147
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,230
Have you been a bad...?
No, I can't.

148
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:30,905
Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie.
Did anybody else hear?

149
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,408
What? Susan got it? How?

150
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,702
Oh, man, I would've slept with him!

151
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,497
All right, bye.

152
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,709
Dude, I'm sorry.
But hey, there's one spot left, right?

153
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,586
- Well, Charlie's gonna get that.
- Hey, don't say that.

154
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,464
You've got just as good a chance
of getting that job.

155
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,300
He is the boss' son.

156
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,387
- Come on, lottery!
- Yeah!

157
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,264
- It starts in, like, 20 minutes.
- Okay, here we go.

158
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,809
We need to sort through the tickets
quickly to see if we've won.

159
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,687
So does anybody have any ideas
how to organize this?

160
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,023
Okay, how about this:

161
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,859
We divide them
into six groups of 40.

162
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,070
The remaining 10 can be read
by whoever finishes first.

163
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,074
- I have another idea.
- I'm sorry, idea time is over.

164
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,578
- Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
- Yeah.

165
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,248
- What about the ones on the nightstand?
- There are no tickets there.

166
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,251
Yes, there are.
I just saw them a few minutes ago.

167
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,797
No, you didn't.
You must be mistaken.

168
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:33,759
- There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.
- Chandler, sense the tone.

169
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:39,682
Well, well, well.
Look what Mommy found.

170
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,978
Okay, fine. I bought 20 extra
tickets for me and Chandler.

171
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,939
The psychic also said that
I would be betrayed.

172
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,486
I can't believe this.
I thought we were all in this together.

173
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:56,073
- Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!
- Three minutes ago!

174
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,743
I don't know why that's important.

175
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:03,121
I was with you the whole time.
When did you even get those?

176
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,793
When you were reading the dirty
magazines without taking off the plastic.

177
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,878
I'll show you how.

178
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,132
Okay. Well, Monica, suppose one
of your special tickets wins?

179
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,177
How are you gonna feel when you win
and lose your friends?

180
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:21,140
Please. If I win the lottery,
you guys are not gonna leave me.

181
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,477
Someone gave me muffins last week, and
I couldn't get rid of you for three days!

182
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,773
Chandler, would you just tell her
what she did was wrong?

183
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,859
She's right. You shouldn't have
bought tickets just for us.

184
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,737
Let me finish.

185
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,572
However, it doesn't look like
I'm gonna get this job...

186
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:41,994
...so I can't afford to have principles.
So screw you! The tickets are ours!

187
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,539
There's the man I married.

188
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,083
All right. Believe me,
if you win the lottery...

189
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,252
...it's the last you're gonna hear
from us.

190
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:55,173
Fine. Don't be my friends.
I'll buy new friends.

191
00:11:55,465 --> 00:12:00,345
Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic
surgery so they look just like you!

192
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,223
You know what?
I want my share of the tickets.

193
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,809
I want my tickets too!
And I'm buying the Knicks!

194
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,437
And Steffi Graf!

195
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,981
Cool. Then I want mine too!
And if I win...

196
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,318
...I'm gonna put it all
into a very low-yield bond!

197
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:18,864
No. You guys, we gotta keep
all the tickets together.

198
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,074
No. No, we should divide them up...

199
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,660
...and I should get extra because
we used my car!

200
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,580
Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,
it should be me!

201
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:31,418
- This whole thing was my idea!
- Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!

202
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,922
Just give them to me,
and I'll split them up!

203
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,343
Hey, hey!

204
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:43,055
God, I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting an end to this!

205
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,600
- Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!
- Wait, no, no! Hey!

206
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,438
If we're not doing this together,
we're not doing it at all.

207
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,899
- Say goodbye to your tickets.
- No! No! No!

208
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,693
Do not come any closer!

209
00:12:56,902 --> 00:13:00,572
Can I come a little bit closer?
Valuable things are getting squished.

210
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,491
Now, what's more important,
your friends or money?

211
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,036
- Friends!
- Money!

212
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,957
Friends.

213
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,211
Hey, Monica,
what about your extra tickets?

214
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,421
They're all in there.

215
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,551
- Even these five that I hid in my bra.
- Monica!

216
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,553
Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.

217
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,556
There is no way I was
gonna dump this...

218
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,017
God! No!

219
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,689
I think I broke your bowl.

220
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,651
Go! Go! Go!

221
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:56,003
What a beautiful night to be running
around the street, looking for tickets.

222
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,964
And the wind sure made it fun.

223
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,217
- Phoebe, we lost half of them.
- So what?

224
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,553
Monica, we have the winning ticket.

225
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,181
My psychic said I was
gonna win, remember?

226
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,936
Weird your psychic didn't mention
anything about the scary pigeon.

227
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:17,232
As a matter of fact, she said
that's how I'm going to die.

228
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:21,737
So excuse me
for being a little skittish.

229
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,031
There's two messages.
This could be from work.

230
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,909
- Oh, play them.
- Okay. Here we go.

231
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:34,791
<i>Hello. This is the pigeon from</i>
<i>the balcony calling to apologize.</i>

232
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:40,714
<i>I shouldn't have knocked the tickets</i>
<i>out of the pretty lady's hand.</i>

233
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:45,969
<i>It was all my fault.</i>
<i>Not hers. Bye.</i>

234
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,937
Well, I bet that was very hard
for him to do.

235
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,691
"Hey", "Chandler", "it's Charlie."

236
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,734
This is it.

237
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:05,072
"Listen", "it turns"
<i>out I got the last spot.</i>

238
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,116
"I'm really sorry", "man."
<i>It was a lot of fun working with you.</i>

239
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,702
<i>Give me a call if you want.</i>

240
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,664
Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.

241
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,373
Sorry, Chandler.

242
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:20,421
It is so unfair. It's like that time they
promoted Saundra over me at work.

243
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,381
Was she related to Ralph Lauren?

244
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,218
No, she was just much better
at her job than me.

245
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,846
You guys, the drawing's
about to start.

246
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,473
We should call my mom's
and say good night to Emma...

247
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,642
...before she goes down.
- Good idea.

248
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,937
Honey, you're being really strong
about this.

249
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,648
I know how badly you wanted that job.

250
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,651
Yeah, you know, I really
thought I deserved it.

251
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:48,240
But let's go win the lottery. I mean, we
still have a 130 chances to win, right?

252
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,285
Hundred and thirty-one.

253
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,914
Yeah, good night, sweetheart.
I love you.

254
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,918
And remember,
you're Daddy's little girl.

255
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:03,130
Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.

256
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:07,885
Hi, Mom. Put her back on.

257
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,053
Rach, they're announcing
the numbers!

258
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:14,266
My God, I can already feel
myself changing.

259
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:18,562
<i>Here are your official Powerball</i>
<i>numbers. We have 53.</i>

260
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,273
- I've got that.
- We have one too!

261
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,234
We are on the road, people!

262
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,612
Come on!

263
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:32,284
Mom, please, I know you love your new
lips, but I can barely understand you.

264
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,578
Would you please just let me
say good night to my daughter?

265
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,165
<i>And here we go.</i>
<i>The Powerball is seven.</i>

266
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:42,085
All right, check your numbers!
Make me rich.

267
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,547
You guys,
you're not gonna believe this.

268
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,093
I was just saying good night
to Emma, and she said her first words.

269
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,428
- What?
- Well, what did she say?

270
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:54,473
She said, "Gleba"!

271
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,521
Make me rich!

272
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,525
- Isn't that amazing?
- Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that's great.

273
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,443
Why aren't you more excited?

274
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,864
Rach, gleba is not a word.

275
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:15,285
- Well, of course it is.
- Okay. What does it mean?

276
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:18,539
Well, I don't know all the words.

277
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:22,418
You know, I'm just glad I didn't
miss my daughter's first word.

278
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,922
- Yes you did! Gleba is a word!
- Okay. Use it in a sentence.

279
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,926
Okay. Emma just said, "Gleba."

280
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,974
- It's not a word.
- Okay, fine. I'm gonna look it up.

281
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,726
Okay, great.

282
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:43,021
While you're at it,
she said another word the other day.

283
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,190
Why don't you look up:

284
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:53,907
All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba.
Gleba. Gleba. Gleba!

285
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:59,455
Here it is! "The fleshy, spore-bearing
inner mass of a certain fungi."

286
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,797
She's gonna be a scientist.

287
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,598
- Damn it. Anybody got anything?
- No.

288
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,934
I'm still looking through mine.

289
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:23,354
Just double-checking.
No.

290
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,440
No. No.

291
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,280
No!

292
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,286
Hello? Hold on.

293
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,704
It's your boss.

294
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,457
The "I'm sorry I rejected you"
phone call.

295
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,251
I'm not used to getting these
from guys.

296
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,797
- Hey, Steve.
- Chandler, hi.

297
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,925
I'm sure you've heard
we filled the three positions.

298
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,385
We felt that with your
maturity and experience...

299
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:58,013
...you wouldn't be happy
being someone's assistant.

300
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,849
I'd love to be somebody's
assistant. Answering phones...

301
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,809
...getting coffee,
I live for that stuff.

302
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:07,898
And I'm not too mature.
Farts, boobies, butt cracks!

303
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:13,236
Chandler, you were the strongest
person in the program.

304
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,865
We're offering you the position
of junior copywriter.

305
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,370
Me? That guy
who just said, "butt cracks"?

306
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:22,705
"Yes", "that's right."

307
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,291
We're excited about the level
of sophistication...

308
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,751
...you'll be bringing to the job.

309
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:32,840
Okay. Well, thanks, you won't regret it.
I'll see you tomorrow.

310
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,979
What?

311
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,940
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna
be a junior copywriter!

312
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,153
Congratulations!
Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.

313
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,947
Thanks. Does that mean
I get the good loving tonight?

314
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,950
You bet. No TV or anything.

315
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,955
- Hey, that is so great about the job.
- Thanks, man.

316
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,290
I'd like to think I had
something to do with it.

317
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,711
- Really? Why?
- Well, before with the wishbone.

318
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,675
I didn't wish we would win the lottery.
I wished you'd get the job.

319
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,136
Oh, yeah?

320
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,973
Listen, don't tell Monica.
She'll rip your heart right out.

321
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,145
Well, you know what?
There was a little part of me...

322
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,397
...that really thought
we were gonna win.

323
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:37,070
Me too. So much for my
dinosaur/ Amelia Earhart theme park.

324
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,658
You guys? What was the Powerball
number again?

325
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:44,411
- Seven.
- We won.

326
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,538
- What?
- We won!

327
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,374
- Let me see! Let me see!
- Don't tear it!

328
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,545
Phoebe, you don't have any
of the first five numbers!

329
00:20:54,671 --> 00:21:00,886
I know that, but look, we got
the Powerball number. We won $3!

330
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:05,849
Wow, you think we should get that over
20 years or go for the big payout?

331
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:10,688
I don't care. I've never won
anything before. I can't believe this!

332
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,107
So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do
with your $3?

333
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:17,570
Well, it's not all mine.
We all get 50 cents.

334
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,113
You know what?
You can have mine.

335
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,532
- Me too.
- Me too.

336
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,951
Me too.

337
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,625
Well, I guess if everybody else is.

338
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,305
Hey, guys. So I just called
the Powerball hot line.

339
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,768
- Can you believe it? Nobody won.
- I beg to differ.

340
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:54,898
Maybe nobody won the jackpot,
but there was this guy in here earlier...

341
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:59,987
...and he found a ticket on the street
right outside and won $ 10,000.

342
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:14,626
Again, don't blame the pretty lady.

343
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:19,965
It was not her fault.
It was me, the pigeon.

344
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:26,805
Seriously, stop staring at her.

345
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,277
