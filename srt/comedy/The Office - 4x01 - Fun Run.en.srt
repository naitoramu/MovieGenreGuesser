1
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:06,581
Okay.

2
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:08,271
Well...

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,691
I did not get the job in New-York.

4
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:12,540
But I got the real prize...

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,910
domestic bliss.

6
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:17,223
Jan made me breakfast this morning.

7
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,319
Well, she bought the milk.

8
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:22,658
It's soy.

9
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:26,077
This is why I do it.

10
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,082
That's what I have to come home to.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,166
She probably won't be up
for a few hours.

12
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:38,475
This is going be a very good year.

13
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:39,753
Very good.

14
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:41,600
Jan is at home.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
Jim is back.

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,264
My protégé Ryan is at corporate.

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,913
Good stuff.

18
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,305
Andy and Dwight

19
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:52,498
are rocking the sales team.
I feel very blessed.

"FUN RUN"

55
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:37,467
Generally it's not a good idea
to click on any internet offers

56
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:40,606
that you haven't requested.
What was the exact offer?

57
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,351
It was for a...
video.

58
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,584
Yeah, well, what kind of video?

59
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,870
A cebrity sex tape.

60
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:51,772
Really?
What kind of celebrity?

61
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:54,335
- Not relevant.
- How much you paid for it?

62
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:57,096
- You paid for it?
- It all happened so fast!

63
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:59,814
I broke up with Karen
after the job interview.

64
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,410
And, uh...

65
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:04,880
It was a little awkward
when she came back from the city.

66
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:08,550
She told me very clearly that just
because we were broken up doesn't mean

67
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,573
that she was going anywhere, because...

68
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:12,429
she had worked
really hard for her career.

69
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,032
But the next day, her desk was empty.

70
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:19,591
And as for me
and my current romantic life...

71
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:21,456
I, uh...

72
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:23,349
I'm single now and looking.

73
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:26,446
So if you know anybody...

74
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:30,477
Jim and I went to dinner a few times
when he got back from New York.

75
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:32,552
I talked him through his breakup.

76
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,830
It's really nice
to be good friends again.

77
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:38,337
Are you kidding me?

78
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,744
Pam and Jim are totally hooking up.

79
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:43,665
All they do is smile.

80
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:45,726
They're just keeping it a secret.

81
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:46,664
Right?

82
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:49,546
I don't know.
There is no evidence of intimacy.

83
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:53,039
They've been in remarkably good moods.
Could other things.

84
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,256
Are you kidding me?

85
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:59,352
And sunday, I'm thinking of going
to that flea market at the drive-in.

86
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:00,664
Oh, that sounds fun.

87
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:02,477
I'm mountain biking on sunday in...

88
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:03,845
montage mountain.

89
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:04,978
- Cool.
- Yeah.

90
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:06,316
Well, have fun with that.

91
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,291
Ladies and gentlemen.

92
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:17,869
I have some bad news.

93
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,587
Meredith was hit by a car.

94
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:22,299
- What?
- Where?

95
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,459
It happened this morning
in the parking lot.

96
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:26,211
I took her to the hospital.

97
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:29,665
And the doctors tried to save her life.

98
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:31,341
They did the best that they could.

99
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,469
And she is going to be okay.

100
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:36,680
What is wrong with you?

101
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,893
Why did you have to phrase it like that?

102
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:42,965
- So she's really going to be fine?
- Yes. She has a slight...

103
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:45,197
pelvical fracture.

104
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:48,061
But people have survived far worse.

105
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:50,083
Thank God you were there.

106
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:52,412
Yeah.

107
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:54,190
Did you see who did it?

108
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:56,453
No need.
We can just check the security tapes.

109
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:58,450
Yeah,
kind of a good news/bad news there.

110
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,297
I was able to be on the scene so quickly
because I was in the car that hit her.

111
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,600
Who was driving?

112
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:12,841
Oh, Michael.

113
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:17,480
One day Michael came in complaining
about a speed bump on the highway.

114
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,690
I wonder who he ran over then.

115
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:25,479
- It's only Meredith.
- Yeah, it's only Meredith.

116
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,599
Thank God.

117
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:29,582
But did you see
the way they looked at me?

118
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,568
Like I was a murderer or something.

119
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:37,157
- Why did you it?
- It was an accident.

120
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,034
- Was she talking back?
- No.

121
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:41,102
Just got sick of that face?

122
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:42,480
Did she owe you money?

123
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:45,153
Is this downsizing?

124
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:47,410
Did she spurn your advances?

125
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:52,255
Hey, guys.
We're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch.

126
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:54,549
And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.

127
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,718
Who's we?
You and Jim?

128
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:58,845
No, me and Stanley and Phyllis so far.

129
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:02,182
I bet Jim goes too.

130
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:04,461
I haven't asked him yet.

131
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:07,354
- I bet you ask.
- I was planning on it.

132
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,604
I bet you were.

133
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:13,042
Angela?
Are you coming?

134
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:15,445
I can't.
Sprinkles is sick.

135
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:18,776
She's been sick for some time.
Thank you for asking.

136
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:21,259
No one asks about Sprinkles.

137
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:25,171
I have to give her her meds,
I have to pet her.

138
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,044
And who will she eat lunch with?

139
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:28,915
Can't your other cats keep her company?

140
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:30,373
There's bad blood.

141
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:32,028
Jealousies, cliques.

142
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,798
Angela, you're the chairman
of the party planning committee.

143
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:37,509
I shouldn't even be planning this.
It's your job.

144
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:40,762
All right!

145
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,558
- My lord, my lieg.
- <i>Yes, Michael?</i>

146
00:05:44,798 --> 00:05:48,958
So Ryan got promoted to corporate
where he is a little fish in a big pond.

147
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:53,515
Whereas back here in Scranton,
I'm still top dog

148
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:57,836
in a fairly large pond.

149
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:01,466
So whos the real boss?

150
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:06,176
The dog or a fish?

151
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:09,541
So I need a little treat for the gang.

152
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,700
Something to win their affections back.

153
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,316
<i>Back?
Why is that, Michael?</i>

154
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:17,112
Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.

155
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:21,072
- <i>Did you do this on purpose?</i>
- No, I was being negligent.

156
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:23,221
But she's in the hospital,
she's fine,

157
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,849
recovering nicely.
Tiny little crack in her pelvis.

158
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:28,666
- But she will...
- <i>It happened on company property?</i>

159
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,896
Yes.
It was on company property

160
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:33,483
with company property, so...

161
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:35,417
Double jeopardy, we are fine.

162
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:38,737
<i>I don't think you understand
how jeopardy works.</i>

163
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:40,978
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

164
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:42,748
What is "we're fine"?

165
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,999
People keep calling me a "wunderkind."

166
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,958
I don't even know what that means.

167
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:53,103
I mean, I know what it means.
It means very successful for your age.

168
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:55,134
So I guess it makes sense, but...

169
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:56,880
It's a weird word.

170
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,050
- Hey, D.
- Hey monkey, what's up?

171
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,400
Can you do me a favor?

172
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,671
Go to my place
and give Sprinkles her medicine?

173
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,607
Sure.

174
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,300
I have to visit the alkie.

175
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:08,448
Check to see if she's faking.

176
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:11,293
If a car hit me,
it wouldn't crack my pelvis.

177
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,830
You know what?
I bet she cracked it at home.

178
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,361
Jumped in front of the car
to get some worker's comp.

179
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:18,415
I wouldn't put it past her.

180
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:23,082
- So what do you need me to do?
- I wrote it out.

181
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:24,420
There's a diabetes shot.

182
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,855
Roll the insulin in your hands,
don't shake it.

183
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,794
She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal.

184
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:32,087
But put her right in front of the dish,
or her cataracts won't let her see it.

185
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,751
Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid

186
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:36,560
in with her kidney medicine.

187
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:40,507
And you wanna give that to her
15 minutes after she's eaten.

188
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:44,738
And there's a fungal cream, because
she has this infection under her tail.

189
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:48,306
So you're gonna have to lift her tail
and put the cream right at the base.

190
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,415
Okay, I have an announcement.

191
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:53,027
You pushed Darryl out the window?

192
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:55,419
- You shot Dwight?
- No. No, that is not funny.

193
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:57,089
I love my employees.

194
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:59,730
Even though
I hit one of you with my car.

195
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,070
For which I take full responsibility.

196
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,155
Look, I'm just trying to take

197
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:07,634
everybody's mind
off of this unavoidable tragedy

198
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,467
and on to more positive things.

199
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,071
So I thought we should plant a tree.

200
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,305
Oh, good.
That means we don't have to work.

201
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:18,207
We're leaving for the hospital at 1:00.

202
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:19,980
So, like, a freedom tree.

203
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,173
- I can take 3 people.
- I can also take 3 people.

204
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:23,577
- Separate cars.
- Pam?

205
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:26,607
We'll get a card at the hospital,
and we'll sign it outside her room.

206
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:30,046
Sales people can go later in the day.
Hourly workers can go at lunch.

207
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,272
Okay, good, good. So we'll just
all go down there together at lunch.

208
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:34,743
- Excellent.
- I was thin...

209
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,727
- Good work, Pam.
- But if you...

210
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:42,692
All right, since im the boss,
I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?

211
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:45,530
You can't be serious.
You ran a woman over this morning.

212
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,451
Everybody inside the car
was fine, Stanley!

213
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:51,963
Guess what?
I have flaws.

214
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:53,664
What are they?

215
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,047
Oh, I don't know.
I sing in the shower.

216
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,223
Sometimes,
I spend too much time volunteering.

217
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,963
Occasionally,
I'll hit somebody with my car.

218
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:03,477
So sue me.

219
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:05,831
No, don't sue me.

220
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:08,777
That's the opposite of the point
that I am trying to make.

221
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,062
I hate hospitals.

222
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:19,065
In my mind, they are...

223
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,274
associated with sickness.

224
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:25,987
She looks like an angel.

225
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:27,462
She looks awful.

226
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:30,200
No... okay. She always looks
like that, it was not my fault.

227
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:31,785
I think she's awake.

228
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:35,074
She's in the coma.

229
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:49,094
I brought all your friends
from the office.

230
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:51,137
- At the same time.
- Yep.

231
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:53,682
- Hello, Meredith.
- This is weird.

232
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,507
Brought you some balloons.

233
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,710
Why don't we...
Here you go.

234
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,543
Tie these up, cheer up your tubes.

235
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,932
Oh, for God's sake.

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:06,653
- Nurse!
- No, don't bother the nurse.

237
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:08,227
Just put it back in.

238
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:11,950
I am going to be sick.
I'm going to puke.

239
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,033
I wouldn't...
I wouldn't worry about it.

240
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:17,170
- Don't touch it.
- What are you doing? Just gimme that.

241
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:21,328
Thanks.

242
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:24,963
Does it hurt terribly?

243
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:27,924
No, it's not too bad.
They have me on a lot of painkillers.

244
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:30,034
Really?
What kind, codeine?

245
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:31,761
Vicodin?
Percocet?

246
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:33,471
Fentanyl?
Oxycontin?

247
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,849
- Palladone?
- I have no idea.

248
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:43,314
Well, it was really great of all of you
to come and visit me at the same time.

249
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:45,516
I'll see you guys at the office.

250
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:49,401
Okay, wait up, wait up, guys.
Guys, guys, hold on a sec.

251
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:52,340
You know what I was thinking
might be sort of fun?

252
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,618
Is if you forgave me...
in front of everybody.

253
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:57,133
I'm not gonna do that.

254
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,210
'Cause you know what they say
in the bible about forgiveness?

255
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:03,003
Forgiveness...

256
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,377
is next to godliness.

257
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:06,585
No, that's not...

258
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:10,175
- You cracked my pelvis.
- Look, I jus...

259
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,763
I don't understand
what is preventing you

260
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,888
from laughing this off
and giving me a big hug.

261
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:16,306
You're not forgiven.

262
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,149
Come on.

263
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,199
Do I need to be liked?

264
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,591
Absolutely not.

265
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:26,261
I like to be liked.

266
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:27,905
I enjoy being liked.

267
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,770
I have to be liked.

268
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:32,039
But it's not, like, this...

269
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,701
compulsive need to be liked.

270
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,286
Like my need to be praised.

271
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:43,151
Hey.

272
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:44,709
hey, monkey.

273
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:46,094
Any problems?

274
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:47,855
Well, you left the TV on.

275
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:49,551
And your cat is dead.

276
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,267
- What?!
- Sparkles, the white one, is dead.

277
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:53,584
Sprinkles.

278
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:55,632
That was the sick one, right?

279
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:02,143
But I thought she had more time.

280
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,066
Did she look...

281
00:12:09,356 --> 00:12:11,069
When you saw her, how was she looking?

282
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:12,237
Really dead.

283
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:15,045
Like a, just a dead cat.

284
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,666
So...

285
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:18,897
Hey, come on.

286
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,774
Don't be sad.
Just...

287
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:22,163
Okay?
Just...

288
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:25,399
- She's in a better place.
- All right.

289
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:29,243
Actually, the place that she's in
is the freezer.

290
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:31,426
Because of the odor.

291
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,201
It's gonna be okay.

292
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,840
Okay, you know what?

293
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,975
Everybody, let's just get over
the whole Meredith thing.

294
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,791
She cracked her pelvis.

295
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:46,896
A tiny, little crack.
And she's gonna be fine.

296
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,156
So let just...

297
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:49,899
Michael, Angela's cat died.

298
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:52,711
Sprinkles?

299
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,619
I'm sorry, Angela.

300
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:07,864
Man, what a day, huh?

301
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:12,338
How could it get any worse?
Her computer crashes with the porn,

302
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:15,133
and then Meredith with the accident,
and then...

303
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:17,302
Sprinkles!

304
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:18,772
God!

305
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:20,909
That's three things.

306
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:22,593
I'll tell you what's going on.

307
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,547
This office is cursed.

308
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:28,985
And we need to do something about it.

309
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:31,152
Well, I am taking responsibility.

310
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:34,635
An it's up to me
to get rid of the curse

311
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,423
that hit Meredith with my car.

312
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:40,440
I'm not supersticious, but...

313
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,840
I'm... I am a little sticious.

314
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:47,832
Did anyone do anything
involving an indian burial ground?

315
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:50,663
- Like what?
- Like park on it.

316
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:52,476
Or dig up a body.

317
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:57,099
Toby?
Do you have anything you wanna tell us?

318
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:01,179
No, I did not violate
an indian burial ground.

319
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:03,569
In fact, I had some good luck recently.

320
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:07,245
Alfredo's pizza picked my business card
out of the basket, so...

321
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:08,705
I get a week of free pies.

322
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:10,011
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

323
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:11,189
Perfect.

324
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:13,822
So our tragedy is your good luck.

325
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:16,191
Satan.

326
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:18,261
Sprinkles never hurt a soul.

327
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:21,756
God, in your infinite wisdom,
how can you do this?

328
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:24,535
She wasn't ready.
She had so much left to accomplish.

329
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:26,353
It is only a cat.

330
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:28,047
You never...

331
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,240
You don't like them.

332
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:33,336
Cats do not provide
milk or wool or meat.

333
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:36,574
- Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith?
- No, I have not.

334
00:14:36,694 --> 00:14:39,467
Well, I think you should go
to the hospital and pay your respects.

335
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:41,758
I do not respect her.

336
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:43,000
But I will go.

337
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,504
All right.

338
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,615
I would now like to talk about

339
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,728
each of your
individual religious beliefs.

340
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:53,982
Oh, Michael,
you can't ask about religious beliefs.

341
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:56,819
Satan is the master of lies.

342
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,153
Everything he says is the opposite.

343
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:02,168
All right, well, then you can ask
about religious beliefs.

344
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,068
Thank you for the permission.
Psych!

345
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:07,495
Alright, let's just go around the room,
and tell me what you believe in.

346
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:11,009
- Catholic.
- Okay.

347
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:13,069
- Presbyterian.
- Oh, me too.

348
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:14,694
- For real?
- Same religion.

349
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:20,278
I'm a lutheran, and bob is a unitarian.
It keeps things spicy.

350
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,377
That's why we're cursed.

351
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:26,341
I've been involved in a number of cults,
both as a leader and a follower.

352
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:30,316
You have more fun as a follower
but you make more money as a leader.

353
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:33,425
Kelly, you are hindu.
So you believe in Buddha.

354
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,148
That's buddhists.

355
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:36,564
Are you sure?

356
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:38,239
No.

357
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,130
What are you?

358
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,701
Well, if you're gonna reduce my identity
to my religion, then I'm sikh.

359
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:47,252
But I also like hip-hop and NPR.

360
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:50,455
And I'm restoring a 1967 corvette
in my spare time.

361
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,160
Okay.
So one sikh,

362
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,195
and...

363
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:59,442
As a farmer,
I know that when an animal is sick,

364
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:03,282
sometimes the right thing to do
is to put it out of its misery.

365
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,678
With the electricity
used to keep Meredith alive,

366
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:08,868
we could power a small fan for two days.

367
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:10,949
You tell me what's unethical.

368
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:13,811
Blink once
if you want me to pull the plug.

369
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:16,751
Don't pull any plugs.

370
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:18,390
How are you doing, miss Palmer?

371
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,673
- Better.
- Excellent.

372
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:21,419
Are you a doctor or a male nurse?

373
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,661
I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor.

374
00:16:25,314 --> 00:16:28,210
Her chart doesn't indicate
that she had a hysterectomy,

375
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,453
but she did,
or at least, she got time off for one.

376
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:34,515
So that is where her uterus went.

377
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,961
Your last tetanus shot was when you were
bitten by a bat a few months ago?

378
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:43,430
Yes. Dwight here trapped it
in a bag against my head.

379
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:45,274
Just doing my job.

380
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:47,445
You also were recently bitten
by a raccoon?

381
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:48,565
And a rat.

382
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,680
Separate occasions.

383
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:53,371
Spend your whole life

384
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:56,677
trying to get people to like you,
and then you run over one person

385
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,231
with your car.

386
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:00,870
And it's not even
one of the popular ones.

387
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:04,131
Everybody gets on your case.
Doesn't make any sense.

388
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:06,064
God is dead.

389
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:09,341
If there was a god,
then Ryan and I would be married by now.

390
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,653
Maybe believing in god was a mistake.

391
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:16,082
What did people believe in before?

392
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:18,481
The sun?

393
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:21,806
Maybe there's some sort of animal

394
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:24,189
that we could make a sacrifice to.

395
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:25,677
Like...

396
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,677
a giant buffalo.

397
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,687
Or some sort of monster,

398
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:34,719
like something with the body of a walrus

399
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:38,252
with the head of...

400
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,490
a sea lion.

401
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:44,323
Or something with the body of an egret

402
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,363
with the head of a meerkat.

403
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,104
Or just...

404
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,273
the head of a monkey with...

405
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:57,848
the antlers of a reindeer.

406
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:02,652
With the body of...

407
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:09,600
a porcupine.

408
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:14,011
I will do some research.

409
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:15,975
- Okay.
- I can help you with that.

410
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:22,791
So just to be safe,
they are giving her the rabies vaccine.

411
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:25,218
God, rabies?

412
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:27,968
I was in the hospital room with her.

413
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:30,288
How contagious is that?
Is that like an STD?

414
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:33,820
- No. You gotta be bitten by something.
- This place is so cursed.

415
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,288
Actually, the doctor said she was lucky,

416
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,840
'cause the only way to beat rabies
is to start treatment

417
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,366
before the symptoms set in.

418
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,692
Lockjaw.

419
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,803
I know a lot of you
are very upset with me

420
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,570
for endangering Meredith's life
by hitting her

421
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:54,756
with my car.

422
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:59,606
But it may make you feel a little bit
better to know that before that happened

423
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,689
Dwight endangered her life

424
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:05,485
by putting a garbage bag over her head
and it had a bat in it.

425
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:07,768
Six of one, really.

426
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:09,934
Turns out, Meredith

427
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:12,524
has been exposed to rabies.

428
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:16,911
Which is, like, ten times worse
than a little crack in your pelvis.

429
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:20,838
Thanks to me, she went to the hospital,
and that saved her life.

430
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:22,638
Curse is broken.

431
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:24,794
Curse is broken, people!

432
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,253
Oh, there is a god!

433
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:30,383
And he has a plan for us after all.
So go home,

434
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:34,374
get some rest.
Very, very good work today.

435
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:37,041
Got a lot accomplished.

436
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:42,780
Is there a god?
If not, what are all these churches for?

437
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:46,648
And who is Jesus' dad?

438
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:56,826
Oh, well.

439
00:19:57,273 --> 00:20:00,162
If they aren't together now,
then they probably never will be.

440
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,574
I thought they'd be good together.

441
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:06,664
Like PB & J.

442
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:10,837
Pam Beesly and Jim.

443
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:14,698
What a waste.

444
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:17,684
What a waste.

445
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:20,234
I told you I'm not dating anyone.

446
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:24,294
And even if I was,
I don't think it's anyone's business.

447
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:26,254
I mean,

448
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,243
when I do fall in love,
like, when it's for real,

449
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,754
the last person
I'm gonna talk about it to

450
00:20:31,874 --> 00:20:34,777
is a camera crew or my coworkers.

451
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,689
Almost marrying Roy Anderson

452
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,883
was as close to Pamela Anderson
as I ever wanna be.

453
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,503
Trust me,
when I fall in love, you'll know.

454
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:58,287
Michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton
Meredith Palmer memorial

455
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:02,143
celebrity rabies awareness fun run race
for the cure, this is Pam.

456
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:03,176
Pro-am.

457
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:04,695
Pro-am race for the...

458
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:05,879
They hung up.

459
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,900
A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a
car to learn that she may have rabies.

460
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:13,660
But that is where we are in America.

461
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:17,426
And that does not sit right with me.

462
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:22,828
And that is why I'm hosting a fun
run race for the cure for rabies...

463
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,608
To raise awareness of the fact
that there is a cure for rabies.

464
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:31,761
A disease that has been
largely eradicated in the U.S.

465
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:34,342
But not very many people know that.

466
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:36,838
No, rabies.

467
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,057
Babies would be a good idea.

468
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:41,040
Can I put you down for a dime?

469
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,168
Hi, Stankley,
how many sponsors so far?

470
00:21:45,288 --> 00:21:46,391
Zero.

471
00:21:47,498 --> 00:21:49,708
Come on, man.
You gotta step it up.

472
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:51,081
It's for a good cause.

473
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:53,779
Jan called this morning
and pledged $500.

474
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:55,908
Isn't that your money?

475
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,060
That is for a good cause.

476
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:05,110
- Phyllis, how the rabies quilt coming?
- Oh, it's coming.

477
00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:08,512
Oh, look at that! Three.
Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.

478
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:12,836
You can't make me run.
It is not a real charity.

479
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,451
It's stupid, Michael
and I'm not gonna do it.

480
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:18,005
You didn't run for me
when I thought I had skin cancer.

481
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:22,798
I know that you're probably scared of
people seeing your fat legs in shorts.

482
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,525
Well, back in olden times,
a large, fat person like this

483
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:32,181
was a person of power.

484
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:35,774
A person who had money,
who could buy food.

485
00:22:35,894 --> 00:22:38,796
A person of respect,
like the regional manager of the day.

486
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:42,269
Whereas someone athletic
and trim like myself

487
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:45,309
was somebody who worked in the fields,
and I was a peasant.

488
00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:47,271
I just don't wanna run.

489
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:49,420
I didn't bring my sneakers
or my clothes.

490
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,269
You're gonna have to run
or you're gonna be in a lot of trouble.

491
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,229
It is not olden times anymore.

492
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:01,043
I'm petrified of nipple chafing.

493
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:04,028
Once it starts, is a vicious circle.

494
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:06,981
You have sensitive nipples, they chafe.

495
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:08,479
So they become more sensitive.

496
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,897
So they chafe more.

497
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:11,017
So...

498
00:23:11,754 --> 00:23:12,912
I take precautions.

499
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:16,289
Hey, Angela.

500
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,374
I'm sorry about your cat.

501
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:29,592
This is Sprinkles.

502
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:31,704
She was my best friend.

503
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:34,877
I kept her
going through countless ailments.

504
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:40,712
I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once,
and she is now deceased.

505
00:23:45,698 --> 00:23:47,723
This is Halloween last year.

506
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,180
Just a couple of kittens.

507
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:53,803
Out on the town.

508
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:08,819
I'm having relationship problems.

509
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:11,897
And since you're always having
relationship problems,

510
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,860
I thought you could give me some advice.

511
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,035
What's wrong?

512
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:19,075
I have this crazy thought
that I know is crazy...

513
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:21,829
that maybe Dwight killed my cat.

514
00:24:23,882 --> 00:24:26,428
When I got home,
Sprinkles' body was in the freezer

515
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,228
where Dwight said he left her.

516
00:24:28,454 --> 00:24:31,469
But all my bags of frozen french fries
had been clawed to shreds!

517
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:33,767
Something's not right.

518
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,036
The vet's doing an autopsy.

519
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,761
Angela, I'm sorry.

520
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:39,842
Did Roy ever killed one of your cats?

521
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:42,743
I'm more of a dog person.

522
00:24:47,342 --> 00:24:48,974
So what's your strategy for this race?

523
00:24:49,094 --> 00:24:50,432
I'm gonna start fast.

524
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:53,776
Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
Then I'm gonna end fast.

525
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:56,918
- Why won't more people do that?
- 'Cause they're stupid.

526
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:00,383
What?

527
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:15,839
Oh, um, no, that's not...

528
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:18,965
- I mean, that wasn't...
- Yeah, that was, um...

529
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:22,635
I mean, I can see
how it would seem a bit like we, uh...

530
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:24,642
How it looks like, um...

531
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:27,710
But nowadays,
you can edit anything, right?

532
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,147
I mean, you can edit anything to...

533
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:32,248
Look like, um, anything.

534
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:34,151
- So...
- Yeah, I gave him a ride home

535
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:36,143
- because...
- Right.

536
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:38,143
We're dating.

537
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:42,329
There it is.

538
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:44,354
Uh, yeah.

539
00:25:45,248 --> 00:25:48,573
We haven't told anybody,
but it's going really great.

540
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:51,266
Right?

541
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:53,313
It is going really great.

542
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:56,457
Shut up!

543
00:25:56,998 --> 00:25:59,530
You're taking this out on me,
but I was only the messenger.

544
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,770
Oh, really?

545
00:26:06,484 --> 00:26:08,458
You'll feel better after the 5k.

546
00:26:09,246 --> 00:26:11,150
Exercise is good for depression.

547
00:26:11,547 --> 00:26:13,833
I am not depressed.
I'm in grief!

548
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:20,728
We have raised almost $700,
most of it from me and Jan.

549
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,403
When do they put that
on the giant check?

550
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:26,898
Or is that something
that we write in later?

551
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:30,130
Well, a giant check costs
about $200 to make up.

552
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:32,888
I have a print shop standing by, but...

553
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,342
What do you think, Michael?
That's over 25% of our funds.

554
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:40,434
It's... a tough decision.

555
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:43,592
I always imagined it with a giant check.

556
00:26:43,712 --> 00:26:46,606
Yeah, I mean, I personally am
definitely on board for the giant check.

557
00:26:46,726 --> 00:26:47,941
Giant check it is.

558
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:52,795
I don't know. On the other hand, it does
leave less money for bat birth control.

559
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,632
Bat birth control.

560
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:58,956
This money's going to bat birth control,
right? That's what you told me.

561
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,632
You didn't contribute very much.

562
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:03,104
I was also hoping to hand

563
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:05,471
the giant check to a rabies doctor.

564
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:07,839
- How's that going?
- Not well.

565
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,034
A doctor won't come out
to collect a check for $700.

566
00:27:11,154 --> 00:27:13,343
Or $500 if we go with the giant check.

567
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:15,274
- Which we are.
- And also...

568
00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:17,740
There is no such thing
as a rabies doctor.

569
00:27:18,644 --> 00:27:19,994
How about a rabies nurse?

570
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:21,680
- I don't think so.
- You know what?

571
00:27:21,802 --> 00:27:24,650
I've actually seen ads for nurses
that you can hire by the hour.

572
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,425
For parties and bachelor events.

573
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,874
That's possible.
look into that.

574
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:32,212
Great, it's gonna cost 200 bucks.
And actually, more...

575
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:33,837
with tips.

576
00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:35,682
Maybe we should skip the ceremony

577
00:27:35,802 --> 00:27:38,345
and just set up
a college fund for Meredith's son.

578
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,665
Have you met that kid?

579
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,481
I'm not going to college.

580
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:51,293
5k means five kilometers,
not 5,000 miles.

581
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:52,678
Come in.

582
00:27:54,198 --> 00:27:55,676
- My god!
- What're you doing?!

583
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:57,720
- You said, "come in!"
- No, I didn't. Just...

584
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,521
- Oh, my god.
- Please, get out.

585
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:02,583
So I closed the door
but the image of his...

586
00:28:02,703 --> 00:28:04,546
- Baguette.
- dangling participle

587
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,006
still burned in my eyes.

588
00:28:07,138 --> 00:28:08,325
I can imagine.

589
00:28:10,263 --> 00:28:11,263
Come in.

590
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:13,210
May I enter the room?

591
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:15,747
Yes.
Or "come in."

592
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:19,650
See how I did that?

593
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:23,955
That's the way you should enter a room.
You knock and wait for the all clear.

594
00:28:24,146 --> 00:28:25,728
You couldn't undress in the men's room?

595
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:28,427
Yes. But I have an office,
so why would I do that?

596
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:31,524
On average, how many hours a day
do you spend naked in your office?

597
00:28:31,764 --> 00:28:33,994
- Just ballpark.
- European offices are always naked.

598
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:37,197
- They're so not.
- Besides, my shirt covered most of it.

599
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:38,793
I only saw where it ended.

600
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,081
- Gross.
- That's not gross!

601
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:43,584
It's the human body.
What is your problem?

602
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:46,933
Pam, you're an artist, right?
Think of me as one of your models.

603
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:49,005
Okay, you know what?

604
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,646
I don't want this to detract from what
we really need to think about today.

605
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,854
It's not fair to people with rabies.

606
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:58,037
And that's the point, right?

607
00:28:58,454 --> 00:29:00,637
Okay.
Let's go have some fun all right.

608
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:04,778
They say if you're nervous around
someone, you should picture them naked.

609
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,286
I do not recommend this strategy.

610
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:10,077
Try picturing them with more clothes on.

611
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:11,808
Or a funny coat.

612
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:16,550
I'm sorry, is this a working office?

613
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,495
And not a french beach?

614
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,479
Okay, name, please?

615
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,488
Creed Bratton, 75+ division.

616
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:26,425
- You're over 75 years old?
- 82 november 1st.

617
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:29,520
- How much is the prize money?
- There's no prize money.

618
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,924
Well, is any of this real?

619
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,395
Check that out.

620
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:35,169
Look at me, I'm Toby!
I'm stretching.

621
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:37,371
I know what l'm doing.
Why is he even here?

622
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:45,210
So I heard
that you were peeping on Michael.

623
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:46,964
What?
No, it was not...

624
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:48,742
I don't know what your deal is,

625
00:29:48,862 --> 00:29:51,132
but he's mine, okay?
So hands off.

626
00:29:52,171 --> 00:29:54,139
Okay, everybody, listen up!

627
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:56,895
Thank you for coming.

628
00:29:57,015 --> 00:29:59,868
Before we get started,
I want to say a few words

629
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:02,890
about this deadly disease called rabies.

630
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:05,263
And I'd like you to take a look

631
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,967
into the face of rabies.

632
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:12,064
That should scare you.

633
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:15,022
It scares me.
You people need to educate yourselves.

634
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:18,631
Meth: three americans every year
die from rabies.

635
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:23,787
Fact: four americans every year
die from rabies.

636
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,581
How many of you

637
00:30:25,918 --> 00:30:29,179
know someone who has been afflicted
or affected by rabies?

638
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:31,490
Show of hands.

639
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,384
One, two, three...
too many to count.

640
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:35,543
It is truly the silent killer.

641
00:30:36,078 --> 00:30:38,754
No, it is the foaming, barking killer.

642
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,794
And it is something that...
Darryl!

643
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:44,085
- What're you doing?
- I give him a peanut.

644
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:45,783
No, don't give him...
Just...

645
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:48,342
Did you...
hear anything I said?

646
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:51,190
- Look how happy he is.
- He's happy because he's insane.

647
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:52,998
That's a perfect example

648
00:30:53,544 --> 00:30:56,040
of the kind of awareness
we need to generate.

649
00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:57,600
Where's the nurse?

650
00:30:58,142 --> 00:31:01,266
- This is the reason we're here.
- Hello, Michael.

651
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,659
Oh, hey, I know you.

652
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:04,091
- Elizabeth, right?
- Yeah.

653
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:07,525
Very cool you went back
and got your degree.

654
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:11,180
I would like you to accept this check

655
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:15,199
for $340

656
00:31:15,764 --> 00:31:17,423
made out to Science.

657
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:20,759
Make sure that
that gets into the right hands.

658
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:26,639
You got it?

659
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,194
Okay.

660
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:32,413
Fettuccini Alfredo.

661
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,188
Time to carbo load.

662
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:43,488
Just remember, folks, it's not
about winning, it is about finishing.

663
00:31:44,604 --> 00:31:46,435
On your marks!

664
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:49,424
Get set!

665
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:06,936
On your left!

666
00:32:07,336 --> 00:32:09,517
You're doing great, Michael.
Look at you go!

667
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,459
That's my boss!

668
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,314
- Yeah, baby!
- I'm fast.

669
00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:14,890
I'm very fast.

670
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:17,792
I'm like Forrest Gump,
except...

671
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,609
I am not an idiot.

672
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,414
Oh, yes, I will work out today.

673
00:32:24,186 --> 00:32:28,005
I will work out a way
to avoid running for a stupid cause.

674
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:31,052
I've walked 2 marathons.

675
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:33,777
Pretty sure I can handle a 5k.

676
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:37,646
The key is drafting
to eliminate wind resistance.

677
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:43,649
Yeah.

678
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:47,279
Oh, we're in last place.

679
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,705
- Oh, would you look at that?
- Darn it.

680
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,321
Water!

681
00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:57,081
Water.

682
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:01,102
- Water, babe?
- No, no water for me.

683
00:33:01,222 --> 00:33:04,360
Not while rabies causes fear of water.
Solidarity!

684
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,105
Michael, that's irrational!

685
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,869
Rabies victims...

686
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:11,668
have to live
with an irrational hatred of water

687
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:14,243
their entire lives.
So...

688
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:16,109
least I could do.

689
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:18,646
Oh, god.

690
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:20,017
My nipples!

691
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:21,766
It's starting.

692
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:25,021
- Can we get another round?
- Okay.

693
00:33:25,142 --> 00:33:26,142
Thanks.

694
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,429
So we've got what?

695
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,892
Another 20 minutes?

696
00:33:31,114 --> 00:33:32,187
More or less.

697
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:36,638
That fettuccini...

698
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:39,348
is hitting my stomach like a rock.

699
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:41,560
You got nothing to worry about.

700
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,448
I put imodium in Toby's coffee
before the race.

701
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,357
Excellent!

702
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,704
Simpsons!

703
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,416
Wait, imodium or ex-lax?

704
00:33:52,082 --> 00:33:53,612
I'm making great time.

705
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:57,948
Usually I have to take a bathroom break
halfway through a race like this, but...

706
00:33:58,463 --> 00:33:59,679
not today.

707
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:03,822
Ooh, an estate sale.

708
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,888
Want to go in?

709
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:08,034
I'm really committed to winning.

710
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:10,768
Okay, but what if I told you
that all the money you spend here

711
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:12,834
goes to preventing
a disease already cured.

712
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:14,903
- Yes.
- That's what I thought.

713
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,273
- Yeah.
- Right?

714
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:18,161
Let's do some good.

715
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,854
<i>You have reached
the offices of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.</i>

716
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:27,159
<i>Currently the entire staff is out
doing the Michael scott D.M.S.M.P.M.C.</i>

717
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:29,648
<i>Rabies awarness pro-am fun run race...</i>

718
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:30,948
<i>For the cure.</i>

719
00:34:31,707 --> 00:34:33,057
<i>Leave a message.</i>

720
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:36,529
Oh, god.

721
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,024
Oh, Alfredo sauce.

722
00:34:40,197 --> 00:34:41,438
I'm getting a stitch.

723
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:47,273
God!
Watch the nipples, Kevin!

724
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:49,419
Back off me.

725
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,266
You're feeling better?

726
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:52,347
No.

727
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:55,606
Well, you look cute as a button.
You've worked up quite a sweat.

728
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:57,910
The vet's removing
Sprinkles' organs right now

729
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,596
and sending them to the lab.

730
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:02,711
- I am a farmer, Angela.
- What does that mean?

731
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:04,878
When a farmer sees
an animal that is in pain,

732
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:07,667
that has no quality of life,
that has no utility,

733
00:35:07,787 --> 00:35:11,144
a farmer does what city folk
don't have the stomach to do.

734
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,182
You did kill her!

735
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:16,393
I sang her her favorite songs.

736
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,004
You put her in my freezer!

737
00:35:18,124 --> 00:35:20,339
It was beautiful
and gentle and respectful.

738
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:22,780
I fed her antihistamines
and she gradually fell asleep.

739
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:25,370
She barfed them up in the freezer
and tried to get out.

740
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,885
I'm not responsible for that...

741
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:31,178
- It's nothing!
- I'm robbing her!

742
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,152
- It's nothing!
- It's nothing! It's fine!

743
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,064
How could you do that
without telling me?

744
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:39,057
I thought I was helping you.
I expected a hug.

745
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:42,973
I took care of that cat
the best way I knew how.

746
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:46,127
Cat heaven is a beautiful place,

747
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,088
but you don't get there
if you're euthanized.

748
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,647
I know a great taxidermist.

749
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:52,233
I'll pay to have her stuff.

750
00:35:52,412 --> 00:35:54,321
Well, he's not great,
but he's pretty good.

751
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:55,916
You don't understand.

752
00:35:56,494 --> 00:35:58,689
Take bat bites seriously.
Don't get bit.

753
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:04,102
Or we can have her buried out
at the east field by mother.

754
00:36:06,384 --> 00:36:08,865
- Huh, Angela?
- Don't touch me, Dwight.

755
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,484
You like it?
It's kind of designy and cool.

756
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:23,855
It was $8.

757
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:26,837
Oh, and I get to carry it.

758
00:36:41,403 --> 00:36:43,805
And the winner is Toby Flenderson!

759
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:46,973
Have a seat.
I'll write it down.

760
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,159
Where are we?

761
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:56,348
I don't know.
Like five kilometers from the office.

762
00:36:57,971 --> 00:36:59,916
He couldn't have made it circle?

763
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:09,892
I am not going to finish.

764
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,610
I can't beat rabies.

765
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,814
Nobody can beat rabies.

766
00:37:17,054 --> 00:37:19,615
Rabies has been around
for a thousand years.

767
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:22,844
I was a fool
to think that I could beat it.

768
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:30,040
- Pictures of the dog all around.
- Yeah, probably...

769
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:37,634
What are you doing here?
Did you come back for us or...

770
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,219
I can't finish.

771
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:41,977
I feel so weak.
I just...

772
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,079
- You're probably dehydrated.
- What do you want me to do, Jim?

773
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,849
A glass of water would be a start.

774
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,967
There are people...

775
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,169
all over the world with all sorts
of problems and afflictions

776
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:56,208
and diseases.
They're deformed

777
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:59,077
and they're abnormal, and...

778
00:37:59,962 --> 00:38:02,588
they're illiterate and ugly.

779
00:38:03,277 --> 00:38:06,995
Symphonies don't have any money.
Public TV is bust.

780
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:10,535
I can't do anything about it.
I can't, you know...

781
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:13,101
There's just one of me,

782
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:16,185
and there's thousand of them.

783
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:18,250
And rabies wins.

784
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:21,037
You are a downer.

785
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,672
We were having a pretty nice day.

786
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:25,095
I'm still having a nice day.

787
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:26,470
- You are?
- Yeah.

788
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,007
Hey, Michael, look at this lamp.

789
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:30,409
$8.

790
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:32,104
That's a good deal.

791
00:38:34,254 --> 00:38:36,693
And Michael, you don't have rabies.

792
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:40,326
And chances are
you're not gonna get it anytime soon.

793
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,708
So... you don't really have
to think about it too much.

794
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:46,268
Pam, if everybody felt that way,

795
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,063
nothing would get done.

796
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:53,663
Yeah, but there's other better people
out there who are helping.

797
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:56,473
You just don't think I am capable

798
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:58,411
of making a difference.

799
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:01,050
I know you, Michael.

800
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:03,072
I saw you naked.

801
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:04,849
You don't...

802
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,609
You don't know me.

803
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:09,286
You've just seen my penis.

804
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:11,389
I can make a difference.

805
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:12,995
Remember, I'm the one

806
00:39:13,115 --> 00:39:15,983
who started this whole thing off
by hitting Meredith with my car.

807
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,393
And I owe it to her

808
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:21,683
to finish this G.D. 5k.

809
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,792
Finishing that 5k

810
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:47,644
was the hardest thing
I have ever had to do.

811
00:39:50,502 --> 00:39:54,623
I ate more Fettuccine Alfredo
and drank less water

812
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,262
than I have in my entire life.

813
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,666
People always talk
about triumphs of the human spirit.

814
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:05,914
Today, I had a triumph
of the human body.

815
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:09,346
That's why everybody
was applauding for me at the end.

816
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,427
My guts and my heart.

817
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:18,195
And while I eventually puked
my guts out, I never...

818
00:40:19,357 --> 00:40:20,764
puked my heart out.

819
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,475
And I'm very, very proud of that.

820
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:27,959
Hey, Michael.

821
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:29,715
Hey, Mer.

822
00:40:30,352 --> 00:40:32,337
- How you doing?
- Better.

823
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,941
It's ironic, isn't it?

824
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:37,473
I mean, I'm in the hospital
for not getting enough water.

825
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,441
And you're in it for a disease
that causes a fear of water.

826
00:40:41,254 --> 00:40:42,899
I'm in because you hit me with your car.

827
00:40:44,243 --> 00:40:45,552
But I want to say...

828
00:40:45,899 --> 00:40:48,627
I heard you were trying really hard,
so...

829
00:40:49,285 --> 00:40:50,730
I'm not mad at you anymore.

830
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:52,897
Thanks.

831
00:40:53,898 --> 00:40:55,911
I'm not mad at you anymore.

832
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:05,083
Want to share?

833
00:41:06,451 --> 00:41:07,352
Sure.

834
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:09,067
I'm not really sick.

835
00:41:16,783 --> 00:41:17,961
I'm good.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
