1
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:05,547
What is it?

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:09,759
I can't find anything to eat.
Everything makes me nauseous.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,348
Being pregnant is no piece of cake.
Oh, cake!

4
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,644
Honey, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:24,108
What is that smell?
It's coming from the bathroom.

6
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:28,153
Pregnancy does give you
some weird cravings.

7
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:33,992
It's me. Listen, there's
something in here I want to eat.

8
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,912
What smells so good?

9
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:41,333
Is it the shampoo?
It's guava.

10
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,919
Wait.

11
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,798
Is it my bologna sandwich?

12
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:54,805
I can't believe it! The baby
wants bologna. I can't eat meat.

13
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,349
Wait!

14
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,935
Maybe it's the pickle!

15
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,313
The One with the Fake Party

16
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,696
What are you writing?

17
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:57,159
Joshua's coming in, and since
I don't have the guts to ask him out...

18
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,622
...I'll sell him a coat
and put this note in the pocket.

19
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:05,959
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.
Guys like you...

20
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,296
...never go out of style."

21
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,091
What did you throw away?

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,678
- Hi, guys.
- What have you been up to?

23
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:21,100
We went to see a collection of
Victorian doorknobs at the museum.

24
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,270
Without me?

25
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,065
My uncle dragged us there,
but it turned out to be interesting.

26
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,235
They were so ornate and beautiful.
Look at that.

27
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:36,615
I don't know about England, but here,
you're not supposed to take stuff.

28
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,658
I got it from the gift shop.

29
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,371
They have really lax security.

30
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,499
It's a joke.

31
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,131
I've got to be off.
See you.

32
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,593
You're having a good time.

33
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,973
She is amazing,
and she's so much fun.

34
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:06,478
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun!

35
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:10,357
I even signed up
for helicopter classes.

36
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,735
She's leaving in two days.
I don't have to do it.

37
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,988
In two days?
You must be bummed.

38
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:20,367
She's got to go back,
but I've been prepared for this.

39
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,329
We knew we had two weeks together
and then that's it.

40
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,708
That's what all
my relationships are like.

41
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,796
But in Ross' case,
they both know two weeks is it.

42
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,636
Yeah, I know. I know!

43
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,348
The baby is totally craving meat.

44
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:47,269
I made it a soy burger, so that
it'd think it was getting meat.

45
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,438
And I got nauseous.

46
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:53,734
Maybe that's because soy burgers suck!

47
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,028
Pregnancy is hard on your tummy.

48
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,072
But you got that
cool pregnant-lady glow.

49
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:04,119
You throw up all morning,
you'll have that glow too.

50
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,965
- Here's that trench coat you wanted.
- Great.

51
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,967
It's comfortable.

52
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,638
You could really
flash somebody in this.

53
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:28,477
Don't put your hands in the pockets
until you are out of the store.

54
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:29,728
Why not?

55
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,688
Well, because...

56
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,734
...we get a lot of...

57
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,195
They ruin it for everybody.

58
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,655
I know.

59
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,951
I wore that sweater
on a date last night.

60
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,078
It was the first date
since the divorce.

61
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:51,124
Congratulations.
So do you love her?

62
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,169
She's nice,
but it made me realize...

63
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,840
...I'm just not ready to be dating.

64
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,014
That's interesting.

65
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,852
- What was that?
- Just an anti-theft device.

66
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,562
Then what's this?

67
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:17,443
You need that too, because
a thief could just tear this up.

68
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:26,994
We have to have a party in five minutes,
so everybody cancel your plans.

69
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,495
What's going on?

70
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,706
We have to have
a bon voyage party for Emily.

71
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,960
But it's actually for Joshua.

72
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,587
He said he's not ready to date.

73
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,674
So I had to invite him to a party.

74
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:46,304
And now I have created
the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

75
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:51,518
As much as I'd like
to meet Josh and warn him...

76
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:55,898
...Emily and I won't be here.
She'll come by to say goodbye.

77
00:05:56,148 --> 00:06:01,779
I've got a special evening planned.
Sorry. No party.

78
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,992
Surprise!

79
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,620
Surprise!

80
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,332
No one's thrown me
a surprise party before.

81
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,920
Well, it was all Ross' idea.

82
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,380
You're so sweet.

83
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:24,135
And I'm so surprised.

84
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,765
You didn't know?

85
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,443
Why are you here
if Joshua's over there?

86
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,280
I'm trying to play hard-to-get.

87
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,242
Quick! Say something funny.

88
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,286
Like what?

89
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,332
What's so funny?

90
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,418
"Like what?"

91
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,547
Now that's a thinker.

92
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,591
This playing-hard-to-get thing
is not working.

93
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,596
Hand me those cherries.

94
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,563
- Care for a cherry?
- No, thanks.

95
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:23,402
I can tie one of these into a knot
using just my tongue.

96
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,874
You okay?

97
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,501
All right?

98
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,799
We should probably get going soon.

99
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,552
But the party's just getting started.

100
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,764
We have to be at The Four Seasons
for drinks in 15 minutes.

101
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,808
Then The Plaza for dinner.

102
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,229
Why did you plan a party
at the same time?

103
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:06,611
Actually, American surprise parties
are very short.

104
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:12,826
It's usually, "Surprise!"
Then, "My God, I'm so surprised. Bye!"

105
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,621
But I'm having such a great time.

106
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,833
Your sister told me that
you dressed up like old ladies...

107
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:24,087
...and hosted make-believe
tea parties.

108
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,675
Monica said that, did she?

109
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:32,179
Then what are you going
to put on top of that?

110
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,557
A little salami.

111
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,687
What goes on top of the salami?

112
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,314
Pastrami.

113
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,278
You're a genius.

114
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,866
Give me a hand with the zipper.

115
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,828
Up!

116
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,750
- You changed?
- I just needed my lucky dress.

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,171
- Lucky means more cleavage?
- It does for me.

118
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,850
Look at him!
He's so cute.

119
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,978
I just want to grab him and kiss him.

120
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,897
How could I kiss him
without him knowing I like him?

121
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,735
I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.

122
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:32,614
- This scene in "Footloose"...
<i>- Flashdance.</i>

123
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:36,660
- With that plumber girl?
- A welder.

124
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,998
Were you, like, in the movie?

125
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:46,545
She takes off her bra under the shirt
and pulls it out the sleeve.

126
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:51,049
Very sexy. And classy.

127
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,055
- Or you could use mistletoe.
- It's not Christmas.

128
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:00,684
- Spin the bottle.
- He's not 11.

129
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,981
Thank you.
It was so thoughtful of you.

130
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,441
You're leaving?

131
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,403
- We have something we have to get to.
- I'll take off too.

132
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,447
You can't leave yet.
You have to stay.

133
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,701
We've got the whole
big thing planned.

134
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,035
What big thing?

135
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,915
Spin-The-Bottle works like this:
I spin.

136
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:27,503
Lands on Gunther,
so I'd kiss Gunther.

137
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,757
Who wants to go first?

138
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,760
I'll go.

139
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:41,600
Welcome to America.

140
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,733
Oh, my God!

141
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,237
Two in a row!
Use your tongues now.

142
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,328
All right.

143
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,957
What are the odds?

144
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,418
That's enough!

145
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:12,131
Let's let someone else play.

146
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:16,760
If you didn't want to play,
why'd you come?

147
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,305
Okay, my turn!

148
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:23,976
Look at that!

149
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,020
Oh, my God.

150
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,858
The baby just kicked!

151
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:36,780
If it kicked once, it'll kick again!

152
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:44,705
Everybody just remember
where they were sitting.

153
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,882
It was a bug.

154
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,719
It doesn't matter
how much I'm craving it.

155
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:03,974
I'll never eat meat.
It's cold-blooded murder.

156
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,900
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!

157
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,694
What are you doing?

158
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,113
I can't help it!

159
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,241
I need the meat!
The baby needs the meat.

160
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:27,956
When you date, you don't want to cheat
unless it's with someone really hot.

161
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,542
Totally.

162
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,920
This is the same kind of deal.

163
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,883
If you do something wrong...

164
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:41,095
...do it right.

165
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,768
Feel better?

166
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,854
Yeah, but at what cost?

167
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,106
Six months, three meals a day?

168
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:58,821
I am going to eat like,
you know, millions of cows.

169
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,616
What if I even things out
for you, meat-wise?

170
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,702
I eat a lot of meat, right?

171
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:09,457
But suppose, until the baby's born,
I laid off it.

172
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:14,711
No extra animals would die.
You'd be eating my animals.

173
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,630
I can't believe you'd do that for me.

174
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,675
Absolutely!
I could be a vegetarian.

175
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,804
There's no meat in beer, right?

176
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:29,768
We can still make dinner
if we skip the appetizers.

177
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:37,735
We can't go now.
Rachel is going to put on a skit.

178
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:41,447
Oh, my God!
Have you lost your mind?

179
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:45,993
I am finally thinking clearly.

180
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,245
My lucky dress wasn't working.

181
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:52,290
But for four years,
this baby never missed.

182
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,169
Wait, I can't let...

183
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:59,214
Actually, I want to see what happens.

184
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,928
Nice costume.

185
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:10,934
Well, I wanted to give Emily
a big American goodbye cheer.

186
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,107
Ready.

187
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,984
Give me an "E"!

188
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,819
Give me an "M"!

189
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,445
Give me an "I"!

190
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,864
Give me an "L"!

191
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,574
Give me a "Y"!

192
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:29,661
What do you get?

193
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,130
That's me as a cheerleader!

194
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:44,343
I loosened a tooth.
It's no big deal. I have a dentist.

195
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:48,639
I'll put some ice on it.
Excuse me.

196
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,808
What do I do now?

197
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,602
I think you're done.

198
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,564
Time to take off the bra.

199
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,945
That was really great.

200
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,114
But I got to take off.

201
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:09,910
Take the bra off.

202
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,040
Let's go get your coat.

203
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,129
Rachel's my girlfriend.

204
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,466
So this was really fun.

205
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,969
Yeah, it was real fun.

206
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,018
You know, this bra...

207
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:39,815
...is really bothering me.

208
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:43,235
This used to be my bedroom.

209
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:48,115
A lot of memories in here.
Lot of memories.

210
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,409
If these walls could talk,
they'd say:

211
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:54,329
"Want to hear some memories?"

212
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,710
Need a hand?

213
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:04,548
I got this all under control.

214
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,136
You really don't seem like you do.

215
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:16,393
God! Forget it!

216
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,232
This is not how
this was supposed to happen.

217
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,402
What was supposed to happen?

218
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:29,365
Can you not look at me?

219
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:36,413
I thought that
if I could get you here...

220
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,959
...I could seduce you.

221
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,425
I don't wear suits to work.

222
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,928
And I bought six of them from you.

223
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:56,642
I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.

224
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:02,272
My point is, I kept coming back
because I wanted to see you.

225
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,775
Because I like you.

226
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,278
You like me?

227
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:13,200
I mean, you're beautiful
and smart and sophisticated.

228
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,079
A lot of this isn't based on tonight.

229
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,957
But you like me?

230
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:26,296
I can't believe this. All this time,
I liked you and you liked me!

231
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,132
No "but".

232
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:34,388
"But" is never good. Let's leave it
at "I like you and you like me."

233
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,643
- However...
- No, that's a fancy "but".

234
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:44,564
My marriage, like, just ended.

235
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:50,612
And I'm really not ready
to get into anything yet.

236
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:58,871
I'm sorry.
I just need a little time.

237
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,465
There you are.
I was looking for you.

238
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,885
Joshua's gone,
so you and Emily are free to go.

239
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,845
It's okay.

240
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,974
She's still in there
enjoying her fake party.

241
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:23,520
It's too late to do
the stuff I had planned.

242
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:28,316
I'm sorry.
I ruined your evening.

243
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:35,991
If it makes you feel any better,
I made a fool of myself.

244
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,785
Helps a little.

245
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:42,164
Is there room there
for a pathetic loser?

246
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,751
Have a seat.

247
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,008
I'm so sorry.

248
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,092
It's okay.

249
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,263
It was just a two-week thing anyway.

250
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,849
I just didn't want it
to end this way.

251
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,393
Or maybe you didn't want it to end?

252
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,271
What do you mean?

253
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:09,275
You seem to really like her.

254
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,487
I really do.

255
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,907
What am I going to do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

256
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,536
No commitment.

257
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:29,085
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

258
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,713
...asking to hear stories about you...

259
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,592
...Iooking through
Monica's photo albums.

260
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:38,387
You don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

261
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:41,181
You think?

262
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:46,061
You've got 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

263
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,563
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

264
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:53,527
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

265
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,740
You're right.

266
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,212
What photo album was it?

267
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:15,674
It was you
and a bunch of albino kids.

268
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,928
Oh, my God!
Those weren't albino kids.

269
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,766
That was computer camp!

270
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:32,316
You're a pathetic loser, right?

271
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,318
Sit!

272
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:45,454
Oh, my God. Joshua.

273
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,458
All those things I said
about not being ready...

274
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,754
- They're not true?
- They're all true.

275
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,591
But...

276
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,513
I love that "but".

277
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,985
Do you want to go inside
and get some coffee?

278
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:26,745
Every time.

279
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:34,670
- What do you got there?
- Pastrami.

280
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:40,801
- You know what goes good with that?
- Corned beef.

281
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:45,055
I was going to say bologna.
But that's better.

282
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:48,850
How about that smoked turkey?

283
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,771
Oh, mama!

284
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,691
- When is the baby due?
- Six months.

285
00:21:56,942 --> 00:22:01,447
If a cow died of natural causes,
I could have one of those, right?

286
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:05,326
Not if I get there first.
