1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,715
- Good! You guys are all here.
- What's up?

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:10,260
I have a job interview
at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,971
Congratulations!

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,391
Oh, boy.
That guy's underwear sucks!

5
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:16,433
What?

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,643
Well, I got this pair marked "XS".

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,898
Let me tell you, there was no room
for excess anything in there.

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,651
I'll be the coordinator
of the women's collection.

9
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:30,114
I'll work right under the director.
It's the perfect job for me!

10
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,575
If you nail the interview,
you'll get it.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,077
You want to work
on your interview skills?

12
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,957
Let's start with the handshake.

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,002
Very good handshake.
Good wrist action.

14
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,256
Let me try.

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,675
Oh, my God!
What did I ever do to you?

16
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,343
Did I squeeze too hard?

17
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:56,431
Let's just say
I'm glad I'm not Chandler.

18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,562
The One with Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss

19
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,777
That's right, Ross.
I can see you in your new apartment.

20
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,740
Same as yesterday,
same as the day before.

21
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,742
Is he doing
his "shark attack" bit?

22
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,246
No. Oh, wait!
There he goes.

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,593
Very funny, Ross.

24
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:20,265
Very lifelike and funny.

25
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,729
No, no.
I wasn't waving at you, lady.

26
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,899
Whoa, maybe I was.

27
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,361
This hot girl in Ross' building
is flirting with me.

28
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,406
Get in there, man.
Flirt back. Mix it up!

29
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,244
Yeah, I'm down with that.

30
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,663
Okay, here goes.

31
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,457
How...

32
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,542
...you...

33
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,130
...doing?

34
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,425
It worked! She's waving me over.
I'll be right over.

35
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,471
Let's see,
she's on the third floor...

36
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:03,976
- She is pretty, huh?
- Tell me about it.

37
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,145
No, no! I'm not with her.

38
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,690
That's just Monica.

39
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,667
Hey, Joey!

40
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,628
Great stuff, huh?

41
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,005
This your place?

42
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,632
Yeah, of course it is.
Come on in.

43
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:40,763
Go by the window.
You can pretend to be surfing.

44
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,891
I counted.
You're not supposed to live here!

45
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,019
Oh, man!

46
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,107
What happened?

47
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:57,779
I ended up at Ross' place.
I must have miscounted or something.

48
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,656
Damn! She's not there anymore.

49
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:04,703
Look, Ross is doing
his "watching TV" bit.

50
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:10,167
No, Joe, I think
he's just watching TV.

51
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,804
<i>We've lost visual contact</i>
<i>with the suspect.</i>

52
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,682
Okay, now I really have to go.

53
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,726
It's so unfair that
our date has to get cut short...

54
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,313
...just because some guy
shot at a store clerk.

55
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,941
- I know, but it's my job.
- Then maybe I could come too?

56
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:39,488
<i>Suspect has just emerged</i>
<i>naked from the sewer.</i>

57
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,449
All right, you go.

58
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,001
Oh, God!

59
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,838
Oh, I just miss him so much!

60
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,884
For just a week,
you guys are close.

61
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,304
Yeah, it's weird.
I can't help it. He's so sweet.

62
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,141
He's like this little
puppy dog, you know?

63
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:11,729
But like a really tough one
who shoots bad guys.

64
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,065
I love the beginning parts
of relationships.

65
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,484
You can't keep your hands
off each other.

66
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,779
I know. It is the best.

67
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,533
How long did that last
for you and Chandler?

68
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,494
What? It's still going on.

69
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,330
Come on, seriously.
When did it end?

70
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,668
I am serious. We're all over
each other all the time.

71
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,338
Okay, you know where you are
better than I do.

72
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,592
Why don't you just calm down?

73
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:47,681
Get all your facts before you tell
everybody you're the only hot couple.

74
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,017
God, I woke the beast.

75
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,813
I was wrong obviously.
I just misspoke. It's okay.

76
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,398
It is okay.

77
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,943
As long as you know Chandler and I
are also hot and fiery.

78
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,487
Just as hot as you.

79
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:02,947
I mean, our flame...

80
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,992
It is on fire!

81
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,370
Here's your broom back.

82
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,458
You are so cute!

83
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,174
How'd the interview go?

84
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,303
Horrible! I did the stupidest,
most embarrassing thing.

85
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:32,017
Did you say you wanted to have sex
with his wife then fall off your chair?

86
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:33,769
So what happened?

87
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,147
It was horrible!
And the interview part went so well.

88
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,815
I even made him laugh.

89
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,277
He said something about a boat...

90
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:47,825
...and I was like, "Well, yeah,
if you've got enough life jackets."

91
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,871
Trust me.
It was actually very funny.

92
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,541
Anyway, we were
saying goodbye and...

93
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:57,793
What happened?

94
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,670
We were shaking hands...

95
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,922
<i>... and he leaned in toward me.</i>

96
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,132
<i>Maybe he was opening the door...</i>

97
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:09,305
<i>... but I totally</i>
<i>misread him and I...</i>

98
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,728
You kissed him?

99
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,523
I didn't know what else to do!

100
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,316
You could have tried...

101
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,736
...not kissing him.

102
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:24,862
Thanks, Chandler.

103
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,866
A guy from Ralph Lauren called.
You got a second interview.

104
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,493
I can't believe it!
I got a second interview.

105
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,996
That kiss isn't looking like
such a mistake now, is it?

106
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,916
You don't think that's
why he wants me back?

107
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,211
Yeah!

108
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,545
No?

109
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,673
What are you talking about?

110
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,384
I accidentally kissed him
in the interview...

111
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,386
...and now he wants me back...

112
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:55,142
...because, "Let's bring back
the girl who kisses everybody!"

113
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,310
Come on, Rach.

114
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,105
What if he thinks
I'll just sleep with him?

115
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,524
He wants you back because
you're right for the job.

116
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,569
Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!
How could I be so stupid?

117
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,782
Rachel, don't say that. I think
you just need a hug from Joey.

118
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,911
Come on. Come on.

119
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,538
She's back! Hot girl's back!

120
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,458
Well, I'm not totally back yet.
But I appreciate it.

121
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,503
No. In Ross' building.
She's back!

122
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,881
Wait there.
I'll be over in a second.

123
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,176
One, two, three...
Got it!

124
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,808
I gotta check out this hot girl.

125
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,186
There she is!

126
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,069
Damn it! Did you move?

127
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,988
Yes.

128
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:55,077
I lived with you for a while.
Then I found this place.

129
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,790
I'm Ross.

130
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:16,932
Do you happen to have
a hot girl in there?

131
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,393
No, I'm all alone.

132
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:23,063
Yeah. Sorry about that.

133
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,654
Hey, little girl.

134
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:36,159
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter
by any chance, a hot girl?

135
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,286
Daddy!

136
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,581
Later, girl!

137
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,463
Oh, man!

138
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,967
Hot girl?

139
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,512
Hot girl!

140
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,144
Hi, Rachel. Come on in.

141
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:06,356
- It's nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

142
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,612
What?

143
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,737
Excuse me?

144
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,323
Yeah, let me...

145
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,826
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Now, look...

146
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,412
...I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

147
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,666
But I am not some hussy who will
just sleep around to get ahead.

148
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,462
Even though I kissed you,
that does not give you...

149
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:33,508
...the right to demand sex from me!
I do not want this job that bad.

150
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,136
Good day, sir.

151
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,727
You are not gonna believe...

152
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:48,231
...what that sleazeball
from Ralph Lauren did to me!

153
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:54,905
Okay, that's amazing!
How did you know that?

154
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,991
You got ink on your lip.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,836
What do you say, maybe,
sometime I hold your gun?

156
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,131
We're not supposed to do that.

157
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:16,218
What could happen? I mean...

158
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,679
Yeah. I'm gonna say no.

159
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,935
- Do you want to see a movie tonight?
- We can't. We already have plans.

160
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,395
What are you doing?

161
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:31,066
Well, same thing we did all day.
Just hang out at Gary's apartment.

162
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:35,862
He is so amazing.
We never left the bedroom.

163
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,992
But have fun at the movie.

164
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,204
Well, we're not seeing a movie.

165
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,498
Then why did you ask us
if we wanted to go?

166
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,626
Because I just wanted
to know what you were doing...

167
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,880
...so you wouldn't walk in
on me and Chandler...

168
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,675
...while we were doing it all night.

169
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,137
Will you excuse me?

170
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,310
Chandler?
Can I see you for a second?

171
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,690
- We have got to beat them!
- Why?

172
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,111
Because Gary and Phoebe think
they're a hotter couple than us.

173
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,280
So?

174
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,659
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex
and prove them wrong!

175
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,205
You've got to stop this
competitive thing. It's crazy.

176
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:30,501
Just to impress them, you want us
to have sex over and over...

177
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:35,256
...and I'm saying no to this, why?
Get your coat!

178
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,020
Excuse me.

179
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,484
You should check this out.
Tell the other tenants.

180
00:12:55,734 --> 00:13:00,489
Apparently, he's looking
for some kind of hot girl.

181
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,368
Who isn't?

182
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,334
I don't think we've met.
I'm Ross.

183
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:17,547
I know. You're the guy who
wouldn't chip in for the handyman.

184
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,717
Never mind.

185
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,554
I actually thought it was unfair
the way everyone reacted.

186
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,889
I mean, you had just moved in.

187
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,433
I had just moved in!

188
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,103
Thank you!

189
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,313
Listen...

190
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,149
Jen.

191
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,154
I know this may sound a little...

192
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:45,284
But would you want to grab
a cup of coffee sometime?

193
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,829
Sure, that would be nice.

194
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:52,750
My number's on there.
Give me a call.

195
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,127
I will give you a call.

196
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,672
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

197
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,763
I forgot my paper.

198
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,685
That was amazing.

199
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:16,356
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna
hear about this at dinner.

200
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,193
That was amazing.

201
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,654
We are the hottest, huh?

202
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,448
No one is hotter than we are.

203
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:28,243
- We're the best.
- No, you're the best.

204
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,705
- No, you're the best.
- No, you're the best.

205
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,375
I am the best.

206
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,795
Hey, guys.

207
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,965
What you been doing?

208
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,846
Isn't that the girl who waved at you?

209
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:52,475
I don't know, but I can
see through your sheet.

210
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,229
Yeah, that's her.

211
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,399
You know, it doesn't matter.
I'll never meet her.

212
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,860
It's impossible to find her apartment!

213
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:05,363
She lives in some hot-girl
parallel universe or something.

214
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,407
What are you talking about?

215
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,744
She lives on the 2nd floor,
7th apartment from the left.

216
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,748
No, she lives on the 3rd floor,
8th apartment from the left.

217
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:18,210
No. Those first two windows,
that's the lobby.

218
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,922
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.

219
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,258
I did not know that!
Thank you, Monica.

220
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:29,930
I almost lost another girl
because of counting!

221
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:35,394
- So, you ready?
- Yeah, I'll just get my coat.

222
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:39,606
- Could you get that?
- Sure.

223
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,492
No! No!

224
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,543
First, I would like to say
thank you for seeing me again.

225
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:00,961
That's all right.

226
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:07,217
But I feel obligated to tell you
that this meeting is being videotaped.

227
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:15,642
Well, first, I would like to start
by apologizing for kissing you...

228
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,145
...and for yelling at you.

229
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,730
Fair enough.

230
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:26,653
Now, you're probably going to hire
one of the people who did not...

231
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,823
...yell at you and storm out.

232
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,826
And I think that's a big mistake.
And here's why.

233
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:37,914
I made a huge fool of myself,
and I came back. That shows courage.

234
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:42,169
When I thought you wanted sex
in exchange for this job, I said no.

235
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,921
That shows integrity.

236
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,924
And I was not afraid
to stand up for myself...

237
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,928
...and that shows courage.

238
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:55,099
Now, I know that I've
already said courage...

239
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:58,811
...but you've got to have courage.

240
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:03,732
And finally, when I thought
you were making sexual advances...

241
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,151
...I said no,
and I was not litigious.

242
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,486
So there you go!
You got courage...

243
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:12,366
...you got integrity,
you got courage again...

244
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,703
...and not litigious.

245
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,540
Look, Mr...

246
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,041
Zelner.

247
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,334
I knew that!

248
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,796
Oh, I knew that.

249
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,131
I really, really want this job.

250
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:33,929
And I think I would be
really good at it.

251
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,684
You know what?

252
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,937
I may regret this...

253
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,855
...but I'll give you a shot.

254
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,065
You are?

255
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,067
Really?

256
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,820
Thank you. Oh, God!

257
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,199
Would it be inappropriate
if I gave you a hug?

258
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:57,619
Well, how about a handshake?

259
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,706
Oh, God! I'm sorry!

260
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,044
I did not mean to touch that!
I mean, you!

261
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:08,464
There!

262
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,133
I'm gonna leave.
Thank you very much.

263
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:15,637
Hey, I'll see you Monday.

264
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:19,934
Are you tired?

265
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:23,145
You better believe he's tired
after the day we had!

266
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,607
If you know what I mean.
Do you know what I mean?

267
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:31,195
Honey? The tortilla chips
know what you mean.

268
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,364
Do you like that badge I got you?

269
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,867
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.

270
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:42,080
Now, I gotta go.
Officer Bing's got a 10-100.

271
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,834
That's pee-pee.

272
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,049
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.

273
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,303
We kind of took a detour
on our way over here.

274
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:00,474
We were strolling through the park
and no one was around, so...

275
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,268
- You didn't.
- We did!

276
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,233
We violated section 12,
paragraph 7 of the criminal code.

277
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,779
The park, huh?

278
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,281
Public place.

279
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:21,287
I hear you.
Can you excuse me for a second?

280
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,421
Hi, Chandler.

281
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,841
Monica, this is the men's room.

282
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:37,136
Isn't it?

283
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,096
Yes, it is.

284
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,891
But see, I've always found
the men's bathroom very sexual.

285
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,225
Haven't you?

286
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,769
No.

287
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,397
And if I did, I don't think
we'd be going out.

288
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,483
This is getting ridiculous.

289
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,402
Come on, we can't let them win!

290
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:59,032
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?

291
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,035
Phoebe and Gary are in that...

292
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,788
..."can't keep their hands
off each other" phase!

293
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,664
So?

294
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:10,043
It makes me really sad that
we're not really there anymore.

295
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:14,548
Oh, is that what
this has all been about?

296
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,842
Wasn't it a lot more exciting
when we were...

297
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,345
...all over each other all the time?

298
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,849
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.

299
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:27,728
But the truth is, I'm more
excited about where we are now.

300
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,771
- Really?
- Yeah.

301
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:33,317
I've never been in a relationship
this long before.

302
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:37,029
To get past the beginning and
still want to be around each other?

303
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,031
I think that's incredible.

304
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:42,284
And the fact that
this is happening with you...

305
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:46,204
...I think that's pretty exciting.

306
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,627
That's so sweet.

307
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,131
I know that I was acting
a little crazy...

308
00:20:56,381 --> 00:21:00,135
...but I feel the same way.

309
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,432
You know what I just realized?

310
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,185
You just freaked out
about our relationship.

311
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,811
- I did not.
- Yes, you did!

312
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,565
Admit it. You freaked out!

313
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,232
I freaked out a little.

314
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,194
A little?
You freaked out bigtime, okay?

315
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,404
And I fixed it!
We have switched places.

316
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:26,328
I am the relationship king, and you
are the crazy, irrational screwup!

317
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,668
And now we're back.

318
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,096
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.

319
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,099
Thank God!
I can't watch him anymore.

320
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,684
You guys ready?

321
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:53,939
By the way, thank you for
loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.

322
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:58,736
Man, they cannot get enough!
