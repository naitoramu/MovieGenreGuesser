1
00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:04,267
Hey, Ryan.

2
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:06,300
Can I get you a pencil
from the warehouse?

3
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:08,133
Uh, no thanks.
I'm good.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,167
Oh, it's okay.
I'm going down.

5
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:11,534
Um...

6
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:12,767
Oh.

7
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:14,067
Yeah.

8
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,133
Absolutely.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,701
All right,
I'll be right back.

10
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,760
<i>Whoo!
There you go.</i>

11
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:28,763
Awesome!

12
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:29,900
Thank you.
You're welcome!

13
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:31,263
Michael, could you
get me a pen

14
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,330
from down in the warehouse?

15
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,960
Don't mind if I do.

16
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:36,731
See you in a minute.

17
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:38,063
Okay!

18
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:48,901
<i>Whoo!</i>

19
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,103
There you go,
fresh from the warehouse.

20
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,362
<i>Hey, Michael.</i>

21
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,530
Would you get me some coffee
from the warehouse?

22
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:55,160
There's coffee
in the kitchen, Pam.

23
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:57,700
<i>But the warehouse coffee
tastes so much better.</i>

24
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:58,701
Yeah, it's better.

25
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:00,960
All right.
All right.

26
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:02,862
Okay.

27
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,233
<i>I am like Bette Midler
in For the Boys.</i>

28
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:18,001
Gotta keep the troops
entertained.

29
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,033
With cream and sugar?

30
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,061
All right.

31
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:44,103

<font color="#ffff00">sync:FRM@¹¾ßË</font>

33
00:02:03,237 --> 00:02:05,430
<i>So I wanted to let you know</i>

34
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:07,361
<i>that we lost Ed Truck.</i>

35
00:02:07,436 --> 00:02:08,862
Oh...kay.

36
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:10,600
Let me see
if I have his cell.

37
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:12,963
Is this the only reason
you are calling, Jan?

38
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:14,431
Or does somebody miss me?

39
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:19,101
<i>Michael...Ed died
over the weekend.</i>

40
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,230
Oh, wow.

41
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,701
Attention, everybody.

42
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:23,780
I just received a call
from corporate

43
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:26,702
with some news that they felt
that I should know first.

44
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:28,103
<i>My old boss,</i>

45
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:30,401
Ed Truck, has died.

46
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:34,131
Oh, Michael,
that's such terrible news.

47
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:36,761
You must feel so sad.

48
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:38,903
Yes, I am.

49
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,031
It's very sad.

50
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:43,803
Because he was my boss.

51
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:46,003
Oh, that's a shame.
Ed was a good guy.

52
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,962
That's right.
You worked with him.

53
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,561
<i>So did Creed.</i>

54
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:51,563
Well, I'll be
in my office.

55
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:54,201
In case anybody
wants to drop by.

56
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,133
Cheer me up.

57
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:07,963
So did you hear the news?

58
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:09,633
The news that you
just announced?

59
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:10,763
That Ed died?

60
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,133
Yeah.

61
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,401
Is there anything I can do?

62
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,770
Oh, gosh, what can
anybody do, really?

63
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:17,160
Just...psh.

64
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:19,800
He was almost 70.
Circle of life.

65
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,832
Yeah.

66
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,331
Oh. Okay.

67
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:32,060
Yeah.

68
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:35,383
Mmmmm.

69
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,662
Okay.

70
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:39,660
What's going on with
Fairfield County Schools?

71
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:41,203
<i>Karen, did you generate
that price list?</i>

72
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:44,431
Um...shoot.
Uh, I will. Sorry.

73
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:46,932
Okay, just get it done.

74
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:48,021
<i>Jim, will you make sure?</i>

75
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:50,403
Oh, yeah, definitely.

76
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:52,862
Suck up!

77
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:53,931
Ahem!

78
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:55,232
Josh, did you hear
what I said?

79
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:57,061
Thank you, everyone.

80
00:04:01,765 --> 00:04:03,433
Damn it.

81
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,603
What's up?

82
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:07,560
Oh, nothing.

83
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,402
They're just out
of Herr's Chips.

84
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:09,911
Oh.

85
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:11,042
But don't worry about it.

86
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:12,933
My snack food
doesn't fall

87
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:14,860
under  the umbrella
of your authority.

88
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:17,902
Mm, that's where
you're wrong.

89
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:21,001
I'm your project
supervisor today.

90
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,431
And I've just decided

91
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:23,863
that we're
not doing anything

92
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,631
until you get the chips
that you require.

93
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:29,260
So I think we should
go get some.

94
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,132
Now, please.

95
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,260
It's a real shame
about Ed, huh?

96
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:36,830
Yeah. Must really
have you thinkin'.

97
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:38,233
About what?

98
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:39,402
The older you get,

99
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:41,262
the bigger the chance is
you're gonna die.

100
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:42,361
You knew that.

101
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:43,783
Ed was decapitated.

102
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,001
What?
Really?

103
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,303
He was drunk as a skunk.

104
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:49,003
He was flying down Route 6.

105
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:51,032
<i>He slides under
an 18-wheeler.</i>

106
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:52,430
Pop, it snaps right off.

107
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:54,362
Oh, my God.

108
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:56,201
That is the way to go.

109
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:59,271
Instant death.
Very smart.

110
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:00,953
You  know, a human can go on
living for several hours

111
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,702
after being decapitated.

112
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,661
You're thinking
of a chicken.

113
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,262
What'd I say?

114
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:08,262
That is just not the way

115
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:09,832
a Dunder Mifflin manager
should go.

116
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:11,031
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:13,460
Alone, out of the blue.

118
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:15,861
Not even have his own head
to comfort him.

119
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:18,602
So I'm not exactly...

120
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,203
sure how to say this.

121
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:22,161
Ed was decapitated.
What are you doing?

122
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:24,002
You said you didn't
know how to say it.

123
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,761
< i>He...</i>

124
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:27,231
was driving

125
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:28,833
<i>on the road.</i>

126
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:30,831
And he went under a truck.

127
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:32,530
<i>And that's when his</i>

128
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,800
h-h-head was...

129
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,701
separated from...

130
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,061
the rest of him.

131
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,761
<i>And I will
let you know more</i>

132
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:43,163
as soon as I find out.

133
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:48,133
Hey.
Hi.

134
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,860
If my head ever comes off,

135
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:51,633
I would like you
to put it on ice.

136
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:53,811
I do not want
to talk about this.

137
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:56,260
When I die,

138
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:57,803
I want to be frozen.

139
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:59,643
And if they have to freeze me
in pieces,

140
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:01,183
so be it.

141
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,503
I will wake up
stronger than ever,

142
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:05,101
because I will have
used that time

143
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,830
to figure out exactly
why I died,

144
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:09,033
and what moves
I could have used

145
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:10,200
to defend myself better

146
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:12,303
now that I know what hold
he had me in.

147
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,723
I don't understand.

148
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:17,301
We have a day honoring
Martin Luther King.

149
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:19,930
But he didn't even
work here.

150
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:21,560
<i>I understand
how you feel, Michael.</i>

151
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:22,961
<i>I really do.</i>

152
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:26,302
<i>So would it be helpful
to give everyone the day off?</i>

153
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,031
You really don't get it,
do you?

154
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:29,231
You don't understand
these people.

155
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,230
That is the last thing
that they would want

156
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:32,361
<i>is a day off.</i>

157
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:34,862
<i>Well, what would you
suggest?</i>

158
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,502
A statue.

159
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,000
<i>Of Ed?
Yeah.</i>

160
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:40,631
<i>I'm not sure
that's realistic.</i>

161
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,631
Well, I think it would
be very realistic.

162
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,063
It would look just like him.

163
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:45,091
<i>No, that's not--</i>

164
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:46,220
We could have
his eyes light up.

165
00:06:46,236 --> 00:06:47,532
You could have his arms move.

166
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,691
That is not a statue.
That is a robot.

167
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:51,362
I think that is
a great way to honor Ed.

168
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:53,400
And how big
do you want this robot?

169
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:54,361
Life-size.

170
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:56,833
Mm, no.
Better make it 2/3.

171
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:58,360
Easier to stop
if it turns on us.

172
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:00,733
<i>What the hell
are you two talking about?</i>

173
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:03,563
Well, we are talking
about how to properly honor

174
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:05,162
a man who gave his life

175
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:07,530
as regional manger
of this company, Jan!

176
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:08,730
<i>You know what, Michael?</i>

177
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:10,230
<i>I've really
tried with you today.</i>

178
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,830
<i>And I have to get
back to work.</i>

179
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:13,003
Oh, do you?

180
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,601
You know who wished
they could get back to work

181
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,733
is Ed Truck!

182
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:17,660
But Ed Truck can't
because he is--

183
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,862
<i>Good-bye.
dead!</i>

184
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,402
Look...I gave him
a six-foot extension cord,

185
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:25,902
so he can't chase us.

186
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:27,402
That's perfect.

187
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:31,061
Okay, that is a no
on the West Side Market.

188
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:33,162
Okay, great.
I think that's enough.

189
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:35,261
Can I...get back
to work now?

190
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:38,630
Wow. Never pegged you
for a quitter.

191
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:40,163
I am not a quitter.

192
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:41,901
I will do this
all day, if you want.

193
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,330
<i>Really?
Yeah, all day.</i>

194
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:44,933
Hey.
What are we doing?

195
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,302
What's the game?
want in.

196
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,560
Oh, there's no game.

197
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,132
We're just trying to get
these chips for Karen.

198
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:51,433
Did you check
the vending machine?

199
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,732
Oh, the vending machines?
How did we miss that?

200
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:56,072
I have no idea.

201
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:57,343
We went right
for the copier.

202
00:07:57,806 --> 00:07:59,462
<i>Mm-hmm. And then we
checked the fax machine.</i>

203
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:00,203
<i>Yeah, nothing there.</i>

204
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:03,000
<i>Did you check your butt?</i>

205
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:07,800
Ooh, can you imagine
how much blood there was?

206
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,801
<i>If it happened right here,</i>

207
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,803
it would reach
all the way to reception.

208
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:12,900
Probably get on Pam.

209
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:14,072
Okay, that's enough.
What?

210
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,572
We do not want
to hear about this.

211
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:17,603
Well, you know what?

212
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:18,962
I didn't wanna
hear about it either, Stanley.

213
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:20,731
But I did, and now I can't
stop picturing it.

214
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:22,702
<i>He leaves work.
He's on his way home.</i>

215
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:26,000
Wham! His cappa is detated
from his head.

216
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:28,631
You have just
spit on my face.

217
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,632
Well, you know what?

218
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:30,833
There's something wrong
with you.

219
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:32,731
There is something wrong
with everybody in here.

220
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:34,902
<i>Because we have lost</i>

221
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,732
<i>a member of our family.</i>

222
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:38,231
And you don't wanna
talk about it.

223
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:39,360
You don't wanna
think about it.

224
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:41,601
You just wanna
get back to work.

225
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:43,933
There are five stages
to grief.

226
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:45,803
Which are denial,

227
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:49,333
anger,  bargaining,
depression, and acceptance.

228
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:51,930
And right now, out there,

229
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:53,732
they are all denying

230
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:55,560
the fact
that they're sad.

231
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:57,963
And...that's hard.

232
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:00,363
And it's
making them all angry.

233
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:03,532
And it is my job
to try to get them

234
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:06,130
all the way through
to acceptance.

235
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,031
And if not acceptance,
then just depression.

236
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:10,830
If I can get them depressed,
then I'll have done my job.

237
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,011
I'm going to throw you
this ball.

238
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,210
When you catch the ball,
I want you to say

239
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:20,141
the name of a person
very important to you,

240
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:22,860
somebody really special,
who died.

241
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,460
d then I want you to say
how they died.

242
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:27,093
And you may cry,
if you like.

243
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,523
That is encouraged.

244
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:30,362
<i>Let me just start.
Let me show you how this works.</i>

245
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:32,522
I catch the ball.

246
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:34,460
<i>I lost Ed Truck.</i>

247
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:37,863
And...it feels like somebody
took my heart

248
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:42,563
and dropped it into a bucket
of boiling tears.

249
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:45,191
<i>And, at the same time,</i>

250
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:49,133
somebody else
is hitting my soul

251
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:50,820
in the crotch

252
00:09:50,895 --> 00:09:53,863
with a frozen sledgehammer.

253
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,723
And then a third guy
walks in

254
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:57,590
and starts punching me
in the grief bone.

255
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:59,990
<i>And I am crying.</i>

256
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,493
And nobody can hear me,

257
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:05,563
because I am terribly,
terribly...

258
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:07,193
terribly alone.

259
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:09,290
<i>Excuse me, I'm sorry
to interrupt.</i>

260
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:10,590
I need to see Pam.

261
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,560
<i>There seems to be, like,
something wrong</i>

262
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:14,032
with the radiator
in her car.

263
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:15,032
Okay.

264
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:17,091
<i>Fine.
Hurry back.</i>

265
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:20,391
There's nothing wrong
with your car.

266
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:21,690
I just thought you might
want a break

267
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:24,291
from the grief
counseling session.

268
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:27,031
Oh...I would
like a break.

269
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:29,192
How are you liking
the new car?

270
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:31,891
Great.
Yeah?

271
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,693
It sure is small.

272
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:36,363
Got air bags?

273
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:37,763
I think so.

274
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,233
I don't know, I was mainly
focused on the cup holders.

275
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:45,592
Well, you're still not
driving so fast, are you?

276
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:47,130
Yeah.

277
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:53,362
Hi, yeah, this is Mike
from the West Side Market.

278
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:55,091
Well, we added a shipment

279
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,233
of Herr's
salt and vinegar chips.

280
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:00,360
And we ordered that about
three weeks ago, and have--

281
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:02,093
Yeah.

282
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,393
You have 'em
in the warehouse?

283
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:04,690
Great.

284
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:07,720
What is my store number?

285
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,662
Six.

286
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:13,891
Wa--no.
I'll call you back.

287
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,721
Shut up.
Six?

288
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,392
Okay, we can start.

289
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,820
You waited for me?

290
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:22,993
Y eah.

291
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:24,421
Pam, you're a member
of this family.

292
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:25,493
So we will wait

293
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,232
<i>for our family members.</i>

294
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:28,592
Phyllis, you wanna
give it a shot?

295
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,461
I got it.

296
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:32,161
When my mother
was pregnant with me,

297
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:35,031
they did an ultrasound
and found she was having twins.

298
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:37,030
When they did
another ultrasound

299
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:38,063
a few weeks later,

300
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:40,131
they discovered that

301
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:44,561
<i>I had re-sorbed
the other fetus.</i>

302
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,860
<i>Do I regret this?
No.</i>

303
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:49,332
I believe his tissue
has made me stronger.

304
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:51,420
I now have the strength
of a grown man

305
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:53,560
<i>and a little baby.</i>

306
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:56,062
Okay, why don't you
throw the ball to somebody else?

307
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:57,191
Nope.

308
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:59,262
Oh, yes, Stanley,
Come on, your turn.

309
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:00,721
<i>You have to go.
I will not!</i>

310
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:02,790
Okay...

311
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:04,031
<i>I'm going to</i>

312
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,391
toss the ball

313
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:07,491
to Pam.

314
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:08,863
Let's see.

315
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,563
<i>I had an aunt</i>

316
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,061
that I was really close to.

317
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:15,130
She was this amazing
female boxer.

318
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:18,333
Um, anyway,
she was injured in a fight,

319
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:20,193
and she was paralyzed.

320
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:24,521
<i>So you can imagine
how upset I was...</i>

321
00:12:24,598 --> 00:12:25,822
when I found out

322
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:27,692
that she asked her manager

323
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,723
to remove
her breathing tube

324
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:32,932
<i>so she could die.</i>

325
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:35,491
Wow.

326
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:37,932
<i>If you want to cry,
that's okay.</i>

327
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,132
Thanks.
Um...

328
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:45,693
A few years ago,

329
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,263
my family was
on a safari in Africa.

330
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:52,032
And, um, my cousin...
Mufasa...

331
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:55,822
was, um, he was
trampled to death

332
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:57,692
by a pack of wildebeests.

333
00:12:57,767 --> 00:13:02,893
And, um, we all...
took it really hard.

334
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:06,063
All of us kind
of in the audience...

335
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:07,421
of what happened.

336
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,590
Do you wanna
talk about it anymore?

337
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,820
Oh, it would probably
take me, like,

338
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:14,062
an hour and a half
to tell that whole story.

339
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:15,133
<i>Me me, me me me.</i>

340
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:17,131
Yes. Okay.

341
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:21,093
Um...I was trying
to throw this party once.

342
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,791
<i>And everyone was over
for the weekend.</i>

343
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:28,622
And then
my Uncle Bernie died.

344
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:31,490
<i>And so me and</i>

345
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:32,721
my best friend,

346
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,591
we had to pretend
like he was alive.

347
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:37,261
<i>So...</i>

348
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:39,033
Wait a second.

349
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:41,763
<i>That's Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

350
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:45,133
Do you think that this
is a game?

351
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:46,463
Well, there is a ball.

352
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,523
All right,
we're starting over.

353
00:13:47,598 --> 00:13:48,822
No, I'm done.

354
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,760
You are not leaving!
No, we are not done.

355
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:52,293
We really have
a lot of work to do.

356
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,363
Yeah, well,
you know what?

357
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:56,622
The guy who had my job
has died.

358
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,793
And nobody cares.

359
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:00,931
And he sat at my desk.

360
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:02,562
<i>Michael...</i>

361
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,331
Look, I know
this is hard for you.

362
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,232
But death's just
a part of life.

363
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:08,932
I mean, just this morning,
I saw a little bird

364
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:12,063
fly into the glass doors
downstairs and die.

365
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:13,960
And I had to keep going.

366
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,422
How do you know?
What?

367
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:17,261
That that bird was dead?

368
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,263
Did you check...
its breathing?

369
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:20,333
It was obvious.

370
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:22,062
Was its heart beating,
Toby?

371
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:24,333
Did you check it?
No, of course you didn't.

372
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:25,661
You're not a veterinarian.

373
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:27,563
You  don't know anything!

374
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:28,930
Michael!

375
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,522
<i>Michael!</i>

376
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:35,332
<i>Michael!</i>

377
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:36,460
Michael...

378
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:37,491
Oh, God.

379
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:39,061
<i>Ohh!
Oh, my God!</i>

380
00:14:39,138 --> 00:14:41,192
Oh, my God!
Come on.

381
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:42,230
<i>Poor little fella.</i>

382
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:43,592
<i>Oh, shoot.
He's a goner.</i>

383
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,233
<i>No, he's not.
Yeah.</i>

384
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:46,293
No, he's not.

385
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:47,693
Michael, get him
away from your head!

386
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:48,961
He is covered
in germs and bacteria!

387
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:50,880
You can't get
diseases from a bird!

388
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:55,613
<i>That bird should not
be in the kitchen.</i>

389
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:56,651
We don't know
if it's dead.

390
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:59,412
Uh, no, that thing is dead.

391
00:14:59,486 --> 00:15:00,710
You want me
to flush him?

392
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:04,583
Attention, everybody.

393
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:06,481
This will only
take a second...

394
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:08,982
of your time.

395
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:10,582
Today at 4:00 p.m.,

396
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:13,112
we will be meeting
in the parking lot

397
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:17,510
to have a funeral service
for this bird.

398
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:18,683
I have a lot
of work to do.

399
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:21,510
Well...I'm sorry
to inconvenience you,

400
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,811
Meredith.

401
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,553
But that is what you do
when things die.

402
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:26,882
You honor them.

403
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:28,583
Toby killed this bird.

404
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,181
And now we are going
to honor it.

405
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:31,681
But--
No! No! No!

406
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:32,811
That's enough.
You know what?

407
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:35,250
This bird is dead.

408
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:36,312
It died alone.

409
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,783
<i>The least you can do</i>

410
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:41,143
<i>is be there for him now.</i>

411
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:44,913
Find a box for him.

412
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,453
I'm calling a supermarket
in Montreal.

413
00:15:47,518 --> 00:15:48,712
Nice.

414
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,750
<i>Bonjour, je cherche</i>

415
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,981
<i>de chips
de la marque Herr's.</i>

416
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:54,551
Non?

417
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:57,481
<i>Oh, merci comme même.</i>

418
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,853
<i>Au revoir.</i>

419
00:15:58,918 --> 00:15:59,913
Nope.

420
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:01,852
<i>Sounded good.
Thanks.</i>

421
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:12,313
It's okay.

422
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,711
It's okay.

423
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:15,651
Shh.
Yes, I know.

424
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:17,481
I know it's been
a tough day.

425
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:19,411
But it's good
to let it show.

426
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:22,740
I mean, how many times
do I have to confirm plans

427
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:25,610
with Ryan for him to know
that we have a date tonight?

428
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:32,013
God.

429
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:33,512
<i>What are--</i>

430
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:34,812
What are you doing?!

431
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:36,140
What?

432
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:37,510
No, this is
about the right size.

433
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,811
No, God, no!
It's not!

434
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,381
What is the matter
with you?

435
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:42,813
Is that the beak?

436
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:46,851
I'm sorry,
I grew up on a farm.

437
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:49,680
We slaughtered a pig
whenever we wanted bacon.

438
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:52,810
My grandfather was re-buried
in an old oil drum.

439
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:57,812
It would've fit if he had
given me another minute.

440
00:16:57,887 --> 00:16:59,683
I need a box.

441
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:02,111
I need a box,
a small box.

442
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:04,413
Not too confining.

443
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:05,753
<i>Is it for the bird?
Yeah.</i>

444
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:06,880
I have it covered.

445
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,040
Oh, thank you.

446
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:12,180
If you want to do something
for the funeral--

447
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:13,612
Yes, please.

448
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,211
Maybe you could play a song
on your recorder. Excellent.

449
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,110
Do you have it with you?
Always.

450
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:21,911
Did I wake up this morning
thinking I'd be

451
00:17:21,985 --> 00:17:23,653
throwing together
a bird funeral?

452
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:26,581
You never can tell
what your day here

453
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:28,141
is gonna turn into.

454
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:34,383
Where'd you find them?

455
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,212
Where'd I find what?

456
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:45,812
I called the manufacturer,

457
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:47,883
who referred me
to the distributor,

458
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:49,983
who referred me
to the vending machine company,

459
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:52,480
who told me that
they sell them in the machines

460
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:54,183
in the building next door.

461
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:56,143
Glad you could all make it.

462
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:57,651
You told us
we had to.

463
00:17:57,718 --> 00:17:59,413
Dwight,
do you have the box?

464
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:01,111
Actually, I have it.

465
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,083
You made this?

466
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:07,780
Wow.

467
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:11,112
That's...
that's very nice.

468
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,113
When Ias five,
my mom told me

469
00:18:13,187 --> 00:18:15,040
that my fish
went to the hospital

470
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:16,512
in the toilet.

471
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:18,410
And it never came back.

472
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:20,310
So we had a funeral for it.

473
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:21,683
And I remember thinking,

474
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:23,710
"I'm a little too old
for this."

475
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,841
And I was five.

476
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,111
I'd also like
to say a few words,

477
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,380
if that's okay.

478
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,282
Yes.

479
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:35,311
What do we know
about this bird?

480
00:18:35,386 --> 00:18:38,683
You might think,
"Not much, it's just a bird."

481
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:40,813
But we do know
some things.

482
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:43,813
We know it was
a local bird.

483
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:47,383
Maybe it's that same bird
that surprised Oscar

484
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:50,252
that one morning with
a special present from above.

485
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:52,380
Oh, I remember that.
That was so funny.

486
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,113
And we know
how he died.

487
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:57,082
Flying into
the glass doors.

488
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:58,312
But you know what,

489
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:00,380
I don't think
he was being stupid.

490
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:02,853
I think he just...

491
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:05,682
really, really wanted
to come inside our building

492
00:19:05,757 --> 00:19:08,380
to spread his cheer

493
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,713
and lift our spirits
with a song.

494
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:12,413
It's not a songbird.
Shh.

495
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:14,013
An impression, then.

496
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:17,081
Lastly, we can't help
but notice

497
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:19,210
that he was by himself
when he died.

498
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:21,083
But of course,
we all know

499
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:23,683
that doesn't mean
he was alone.

500
00:19:23,757 --> 00:19:24,982
<i>Because I'm sure</i>

501
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:26,650
that there were lots
of other birds

502
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:28,080
out there
who cared for him

503
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:30,310
<i>very much.</i>

504
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:32,713
He will not be forgotten.
Amen.

505
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:40,980
* Just smile for me
and let the day begin *

506
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:44,210
* You are the sunshine *

507
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:47,710
* That lights my heart within *

508
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,752
Society teaches us

509
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:54,040
that having feelings
and crying

510
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:56,681
is bad and wrong.

511
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:59,311
Well, that's baloney,

512
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:03,513
because grief isn't wrong.

513
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:06,041
<i>There is such a thing
as good grief.</i>

514
00:20:06,115 --> 00:20:08,481
Just ask Charlie Brown.

515
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,211
Les get back to work.

516
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:35,463
Guys, get a broom.

517
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,561
Let's clean this up.

518
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:38,320
Grab a broom.

519
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,890
You heard me.
Mush.
