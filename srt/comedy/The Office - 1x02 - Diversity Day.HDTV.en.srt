1
00:00:35,324 --> 00:00:39,558
- Hey ya, can I help you out here?
- I'm all set, thank you.

2
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,812
Good, I'd go with the rows.
That's a good idea.

3
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:44,566
Today is Diversity Day,

4
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,824
and someone is going to come in
and talk to us about diversity,

5
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:49,064
something that I've been pushing,

6
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:53,290
that I've been wanting to push for a
long time, and Corporate mandated it,

7
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,122
I never actually talked
to corporate about it,

8
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:58,270
they kind of beat me to the punch,

9
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:00,685
those bastards!

10
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:06,244
But I was going to, and I think it's
very important that we have this.

11
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:09,024
I'm very, very excited.

12
00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:11,716
That's the thing,
it's very sturdy paper.

13
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:15,185
And on the back it says:
"100% post consumer content".

14
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:21,696
What? Hello? Uh-huh? Wait, what?

15
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:25,933
I'm sorry, Mr. Deckard,
I think I'm losing you.

16
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:32,733
Hello? Hello? Yeah, hold on
one sec, hold on one second.

17
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,686
- Do you really have to do that right now?
- Yes, I do.

18
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:37,419
I should have done this
weeks ago, actually.

19
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:42,183
Mr. Deckard, I'm sorry about that,
What were you...? Can you hold on one second?

20
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:46,205
Yeah, just one second. Thanks.

21
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:55,086
Hello? That's it, perfect.
So what I was saying... Hello?

22
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:01,806
- Thanks Dwight.
- Retaliation. Tit for tit.

23
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,949
- That is not the expression.
- Well, it should be.

24
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:13,877
This is my biggest sale of the year.

25
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,838
They love me over there, for some
reason, I’m not really sure why.

26
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:21,257
But, you know, I make one call over there,
every year, just to renew their account.

27
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:25,903
And that one call ends up being 25%
of my commission, for the whole year.

28
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:30,081
So, you know, I buy a mini bottle
of champagne and celebrate a little.

29
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:35,342
And this year, I'm pushing recycle
paper on them, for one percent more.

30
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:41,234
I know, I'm... getting cocky, right?

31
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:49,379
- Solitaire?
- Yeah, Freecell.

32
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:52,374
- 6 on 7.
- I know, I saw that.

33
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:55,384
- So then why didn't you do it?
- I'm saving that,

34
00:02:55,543 --> 00:03:02,501
- cause I like it when the cards go...
- Who doesn't love that?

35
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,865
- Hey! Oscar, how you doing man?
- All right.

36
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:16,865
A good weekend going there?

37
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:20,923
- It was fun.
- Oh yeah, I bet it was fun.

38
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:25,561
- Oh, hey! This is Oscar.
- Martinez.

39
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:29,112
- See, I don't even know, first name basis.
- We're all set.

40
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:32,304
Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody! Let's do it.

41
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:34,670
Oscar works in here.

42
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:37,949
- Jim, can you wrap it up, please?
- Yeah, uh, Mr. Deckard, please.

43
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:40,588
It's diversity day, Jim.

44
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,494
Wish everyday was diversity day.

45
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:45,839
You know what, I'm actually
gonna have to call you back.

46
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:50,442
Thank you, sorry about that.

47
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,971
- Thank you.
- Getting the cards! Getting the cards!

48
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,054
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

49
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:59,872
OK, thanks for filling these out,
and I promise this will be quick.

50
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:05,845
At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about
honesty and positive expectations.

51
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:11,533
We believe that 99% of the problems in the
workplace arise simply out of ignorance.

52
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:14,427
You know what? This is
a color-free zone here.

53
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:17,073
Stanley, I don't look
at you as another race.

54
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:22,001
See, this is what I'm talking about, we
don't have to pretend that we're colorblind.

55
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:25,935
- Exactly. We're not colorblind.
- That's fighting ignorance with...
- With intolerance.

56
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:31,223
No, with more ignorance. Right, exactly.
Instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.

57
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:32,932
Let's celebrate.

58
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:37,242
"Celebrate good times, come on!"
Let's celebrate diversity, right?

59
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:41,993
Yes, exactly. Now, here's what
we're gonna do, I’ve noticed that uh...

60
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:43,944
You know what, here's
what we're gonna do.

61
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:48,099
Why don't we go around and
everybody, everybody,

62
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:53,552
say a race that you are attracted to
sexually. I will go last. Go!

63
00:04:53,678 --> 00:04:56,148
I have two.
White and Indian.

64
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:58,769
Actually, I prefer not to start that way.

65
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:03,605
Michael, I would love to have your permission
to run this session. Can I have your permission?

66
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,426
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

67
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,868
And it would also help me
if you were seated.

68
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,229
Thank you. OK.

69
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:14,041
Now, at the start of the session
I had you write down an incident

70
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:16,782
that you found offensive
in the workplace.

71
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:19,945
- Now what I'm gonna do is choose one,
and we're gonna act it out...
- A few other ground rules?

72
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:22,483
Why don't you run it by me,
and I'll run it by him?

73
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:25,538
OK. Can we steer away from gay people?

74
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:28,803
I'm sorry, it's an orientation,
it's not a race.

75
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:32,541
Plus, a lot of other races
are also intolerant of gays, so,

76
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:33,745
paradox.

77
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:35,209
Well, we only have an hour.

78
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:40,741
- Why don't we just refer to mister, uh...?
- Mr. Brown.

79
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,794
Oh, all right! OK!

80
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:44,896
First test! I will not call you that!

81
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:47,013
Well, it's my name, it's not a test. OK?

82
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:51,659
So. Looking through your cards, I've noticed that
many of you wrote down the same incident,

83
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:52,408
which is ironic,

84
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:56,031
because it's the exact incident
I was brought in here to respond to.

85
00:05:56,043 --> 00:06:00,054
Now, how many of you are familiar
with the Chris Rock routine?

86
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:03,945
Very good, OK.

87
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:07,374
- How come Chris Rock can do a routine,

88
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:10,898
and everybody finds it hilarious,
and ground breaking,

89
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:14,651
and I go into the exact same
routine, same comedic timing,

90
00:06:14,672 --> 00:06:17,666
and people file a
complaint to corporate?

91
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:21,003
Is it because I’m white,
and Chris is black?

92
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,823
So we're gonna reenact this
with a more positive outcome.

93
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:27,792
I will play the Chris Rock guy!

94
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,060
I would like to see
someone else pull this off.

95
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,752
Oh, let's have someone who wasn't
involved in the reenactment?

96
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:35,703
OK, I will play "guy listening".

97
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,222
Great, guy listening.

98
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,926
- OK, anyone else remember?
- I remember.

99
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:43,352
Great. You're the Chris Rock guy
and you're the guy listening.

100
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,742
Kevin is a great guy,

101
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:48,994
he's a great accountant. He is
not much of an entertainer.

102
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:52,378
Basically, there are
two types of black people.

103
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:55,648
And black people are
actually more racist,

104
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,421
because they hate the
other type of black people.

105
00:06:58,672 --> 00:07:02,319
Every time the one type
wants to have a good time,

106
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:05,820
then the other type comes in
and makes a real mess.

107
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:11,638
OK, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, he's ruining,
he's butchering it, could you just let me...

108
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:16,206
Every time, every time black people
want to have a good time,

109
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:20,649
some ignorant-ass *****
I take care of my kids!

110
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,474
... always want credit for
something they supposed to do!

111
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,578
Stop it!

112
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:33,502
What you want, a cookie?

113
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,060
Now this is a simple acronym, H.E.R.O.

114
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:44,556
At Diversity Today, we believe
it's very easy to be a hero.

115
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:49,152
All you need are Honesty, Empathy,
Respect and Open-mindedness.

116
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:54,418
- Excuse me? I'm sorry, but
that's not all it takes to be a hero.
- Oh great, what is a hero to you ?

117
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:57,477
A hero kills people.
People that wish him harm.

118
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:57,983
OK.

119
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,891
A hero is part human, part supernatural.

120
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:05,845
A hero is born out of a childhood
trauma, or out of a disaster,

121
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:08,952
that must be avenged.

122
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:15,483
- OK, you're thinking of a superhero.
- We all have a hero in our heart.

123
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,079
Now I need you to take these forms.

124
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:22,632
This kind of expresses the
joint experience we had today.

125
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:28,872
And I want you to look them over and
sign them, as a kind of a group pledge.

126
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:33,163
I don't think I can sign this.

127
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,541
I can't leave until you do.

128
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,193
It says here that I've learned something,

129
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:40,682
and I knew all this stuff already, so...

130
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:43,862
You know, I could sign something
that says that I taught something.

131
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:48,095
Or that I helped you teach something.
So, Pam... where is she?

132
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:53,967
- Pam, could we change something on this?
- Michael, can I talk to you candidly?

133
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:58,157
- Sure.
- We both know that I’m here because
of the comments that you've made.

134
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:01,914
Here's the thing - this office,
I think it's very advanced,

135
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:06,951
in terms of racial awareness.

136
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:09,636
And it's probably more advanced
than you're used to.

137
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,290
- That's probably throwing you off.
- It's not throwing me, I need your signature.

138
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,890
- OK, well I know you told me that, several times.
- Yes, but you're not listening to me.

139
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,571
- Yours is the only signature I need.
- Oh, OK.

140
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,723
Those are my instructions
from the corporate offices.

141
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:26,502
To put your through this seminar,
for the comments that you made.

142
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,806
And the only reason I made copies for
everyone was that you wouldn’t be embarrassed.

143
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:42,534
Well, here I am thinking that you
actually cared about diversity training,

144
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:44,707
and you don't.

145
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:47,774
- Don't worry about dating it.
- I won't.

146
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:54,000
- OK, thank you.
- Yep.

147
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:01,857
I regret my actions, I regret
offending my co-workers.

148
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:07,484
I pledge to bring my best spirit of Honesty,
Empathy, Respect and Open-mindedness,

149
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:09,575
Open-mindedness, is that even a word?

150
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:13,854
Into the workplace. In this
way I can truly be a HERO.

151
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:17,162
Signed, Daffy Duck.

152
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:25,927
He's gonna lose it when he reads that.

153
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,039
Hi, is Mr. Deckard around?

154
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,065
Oh, well, could you just have him
call me after lunch? Thank you.

155
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:45,469
I pledge to always keep an open
mind and an open heart.

156
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:54,839
I do believe in that part of
the pledge that I just read,

157
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:59,052
but a pledge, come on, who are we?
The girl scouts? No.

158
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:05,647
Look, the guy, "Mr. Brown", he got
us halfway there, he got us talking.

159
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,900
Well no, I got us talking.
He got us nothing.

160
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,285
He insulted us and he abandoned us.

161
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,434
You call that diversity training?
I don't.

162
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:17,158
Were there any connections
between any of us?

163
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:22,083
Did anyone look each other in the eye,
was there any emotion going on?

164
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:25,709
No! Where was the heart?
I didn't see any heart.

165
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,462
Where was my Oprah moment?

166
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:34,476
OK, get as much done as you can
before lunch, because afterward,

167
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:38,126
I’m going to have you all in tears.

168
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:55,778
All right! Everybody pretty? Come on,
here we go! It's time. Let's do some good.

169
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:59,691
Hey, we're not all gonna sit
in a circle indian-style, are we?

170
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,601
- Get out!
- I'm sorry.

171
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:06,187
No. This is not a joke, OK?

172
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:09,814
It was offensive, and lame,
so double offensive.

173
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:17,666
This is an environment of welcoming, and
you should just get the hell out of here.

174
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:21,691
OK, let's go. Let's do it! Come on,
let's have some fun, everybody.

175
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:30,612
Here we go. Take a seat, cop a squat,
and thank you for coming in.

176
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:39,266
Diversity... is the cornerstone of
progress, as I’ve always said.

177
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:44,016
But don't take my word for it.
Let's take a look at the tape.

178
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:51,943
Hi, I’m Michael Scott. I’m in charge
of Dundler Mifflin paper products

179
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:53,743
here in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

180
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,942
But I'm also the founder
of Diversity Tomorrow,

181
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,392
because today is almost over.

182
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:06,232
Abraham Lincoln once
said that if you're a racist

183
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:09,542
I will attack you with the North.

184
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:14,576
And those are the principles that
I carry with me in the workplace.

185
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,202
OK. Questions? Comments?
Anybody? Jim?

186
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:25,101
- Uhh, is that it?
- Yes. I only had an hour to put it together,

187
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,628
- but I’m gonna add onto it later on.
- It was kind of hard to hear.

188
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:34,418
Yes, that probably has something to do
with the camera work. Anybody else?

189
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:39,098
- I have a customer meeting.
- Yeah, well if you leave we'll only have 2 left...

190
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:43,304
Yes, enjoy, absolutely.
"Namasté".

191
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:46,638
OK, well, since I am leading this

192
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,448
let's get down to business, and why
don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK?

193
00:13:53,035 --> 00:14:00,981
I am Michael, and I am part
English, Irish, German, and Scottish,

194
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:04,230
sort of a virtual United Nations.

195
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:09,883
But what some of you might not know,
is that I am also part Native American Indian.

196
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:12,188
What part Native American?

197
00:14:12,337 --> 00:14:15,470
- 2/15ths
- That fraction doesn't make any sense.

198
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:19,614
Well, you know what, it's kinda hard
for me to talk about. The suffering...

199
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:23,535
So, who else? Let's get this popping,
come on. Who's going?

200
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:27,438
Let's go here, Oscar,
right here, you're on!

201
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:33,459
OK, Michael. Both my parents
were born in Mexico,

202
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:38,142
and they moved to the United States
a year before I was born,

203
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:43,298
so I grew up in the United States and
my parents were Mexican.

204
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:47,257
That is a great story. That's the
American Dream right there, right?

205
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,315
Thank you, yeah.

206
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:55,397
Let me ask you, is there a term
besides "mexican", that you prefer?

207
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:57,610
Something less offensive?

208
00:14:57,654 --> 00:15:01,207
- "Mexican" isn't offensive.
- Well, it has certain connotations.

209
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:05,911
- Like what?
- Like... I don't know.

210
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,611
- What connotations, Michael ?
- No...

211
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:09,977
- It must have been something.
- No, remember:

212
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:14,990
- I'm just curious.
- Honesty, Empathy, Respect,

213
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,648
Jim?

214
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:19,763
Hello?

215
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:24,087
I have something here,
I want you to take a card,

216
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:26,887
Put it on you fore...
Don't look at the card!

217
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:30,629
I want you to take the card, I want
you to put it on you forehead and

218
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:33,868
Take a card, any card!

219
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:38,534
and I want you to treat other
people like the race

220
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:43,133
that is on their forehead.
So everybody has a different race

221
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:47,257
nobody knows what
their race is, so

222
00:15:47,386 --> 00:15:50,494
I want you to really go for it,
cause this is real.

223
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,056
You know, this isn't just an
exercise. This is real life, and

224
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:59,647
I *have a dream* that you
will really let the sparks fly.

225
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:01,470
Get 'er done!

226
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:04,900
Why? Because Martin Luther
King is a hero of mine.

227
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:09,985
There's this great Chris Rock bit about
how streets named after Martin Luther King

228
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:11,635
tend to be more violent.

229
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:15,549
I'm not gonna do it, but it's...

230
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,461
Oh, this is a good one!

231
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,939
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine, how are you?

232
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:23,620
- Push it!
- Great.

233
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:26,635
I admire your culture's success in America.

234
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:28,235
Thank you.

235
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:35,538
Come on! Olympics of suffering right here!
Slavery versus the Holocaust, come on!

236
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:37,725
- Who am I supposed to be?

237
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:41,254
Well, that was an invert,
we didn't actually plan that.

238
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:45,386
Lots of cultures eat rice,
That doesn't help me.

239
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:50,673
- Shalom! I'd like to apply for a loan.
- That's nice, Dwight.

240
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,274
OK, do me. Something stereotypical
so I can get it really quick.

241
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:55,834
OK, I like your food.

242
00:16:56,055 --> 00:16:58,088
Uh, Outback Steakhouse.
I'm Australian, mate!

243
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:01,118
- No...
- Pam..."I like your food"?

244
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:04,925
No! Come on, stir the pot.
Stir the melting pot, Pam!

245
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:07,139
Let's do it, let's get ugly,
let's get real.

246
00:17:07,183 --> 00:17:09,933
OK, if I have to do this,

247
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:14,833
based on stereotypes that are totally
untrue, that I do not agree with,

248
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,033
you would, maybe, not be
a very good driver.

249
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:19,833
Aw man, am I a woman ?

250
00:17:20,777 --> 00:17:23,029
You'll notice, I didn't
have anybody being Arab.

251
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:27,423
I thought that would be too
explosive, uh, no pun intended.

252
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,532
But I just thought, "too soon" for Arabs.

253
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:35,839
Maybe next year.
You know, the ball's in their court.

254
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:37,597
- What are you watching?
- Chappelle's Show.

255
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:40,035
- Really?
- Yeah, I downloaded it on her computer.

256
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:45,157
- I hope she doesn't mind,
she has a lot of extra space.
- No way! I think she really likes this stuff.

257
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:49,915
- She's cute, huh?
- Yeah, she's engaged, but...

258
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:56,876
- Oh, no, the girl on the... sketch
- Oh, yeah, she's hot.

259
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:59,703
- Hey.
- Hey.

260
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,669
- You wanna go to the beach?
- Sure.

261
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:07,119
- You wanna get high?
- No.

262
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:10,100
- I think you do, mon.
- Stop it.

263
00:18:10,268 --> 00:18:16,174
You need to push it, you know.
You need to go a little bit further.

264
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:23,596
- Kelly, how are you?
- I just had the longest meeting...

265
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:27,457
Welcome to my convenience store!
Would you like some cookie-cookie?

266
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:32,030
I have some very delicious cookie
cookie, only 99 cents plus tax!

267
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:36,824
Try my cookie-cookie!

268
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:51,967
All right, yes.

269
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:55,128
That was great! She gets it.

270
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:59,653
Now she knows what
it's like to be a minority.

271
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:07,936
Mr. Deckard, we didn't lose your
sale today, did we? Excellent, OK!

272
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:12,409
Let me just get your... What's that?

273
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,286
No, we didn't close last time...

274
00:19:15,624 --> 00:19:18,195
I just need your...

275
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:22,931
Oh. What code were you given?

276
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:25,338
Oh, OK.

277
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:30,105
Yeah, no, that's actually another salesman here.
Yeah, I can re-do it if you want to do that.

278
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:33,100
Oh, he gave you discount?
No, I don't blame you.

279
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:35,701
I just hated it when that guy was in here,

280
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,459
Mr. Brown? If that was his real name?

281
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:44,518
I mean, he had never met any of us before,
and here he was telling us how to do our thing

282
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:50,030
I just wanted to do it our way, you know?

283
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:52,341
On our own.

284
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:55,829
Man, I should have gotten some food.

285
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,375
- Maybe some spaghetti?
- OK, Kevin you can take off that thing, OK?

286
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:07,118
That would have really, really
shown him up, wouldn't it?

287
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:14,883
If I'd brought in some burritos, or some colored
greens, or some Pad Thai, love Pad Thai.

288
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:19,361
It's *collard* greens.

289
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:22,931
That doesn't really make sense, cause
you don't call them "collard people".

290
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,090
That's offensive.

291
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:33,719
OK, it's after five, so...
Thank you very much.

292
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,294
Buena vista, Oscar!
Thank you.

293
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:41,407
Good job!
