1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,049
<i>It's me.</i>
<i>I know you can't stand to see me.</i>

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,347
<i>I'm trying to apologize</i>
<i>over the phone...</i>

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:23,774
<i>I shouldn't have kissed</i>
<i>your girlfriend...</i>

4
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,235
Stop calling!

5
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:31,573
<i>This is 92.3 WXRK, K-Rock...</i>

6
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,451
<i>... calling with our $1000</i>
<i>daily challenge!</i>

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,827
All right!

8
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,204
<i>What is the name of...</i>

9
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:42,250
<i>... your roommate who is very sorry</i>
<i>and would do anything...</i>

10
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,671
The One with Chandler In a Box

11
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,093
Oh, turkey!

12
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,679
Giving thanks!

13
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,433
Look, everyone.
It's the spirit of Thanksgiving!

14
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,310
Are things with Joey better?

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,229
They couldn't be worse.
I spent eight hours calling him...

16
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,899
...trying to get him
to talk to me.

17
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,234
Eight hours.

18
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:53,196
You could probably use
a plug-in telephone headset.

19
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:59,328
Should we all expect Christmas gifts
that are stolen from your office?

20
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,082
You shouldn't.

21
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,625
Speaking of Christmas...

22
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,796
Since Monica and I are starting
a new business and have no money...

23
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:13,634
...this year we could do Secret Santa
and each only buy one gift.

24
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:18,639
And there's the added mystery
of who gets who.

25
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,934
Who gets "whom".

26
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:26,188
I don't know why I do that.

27
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,527
I'm going to take a nap.
Turkey makes me sleepy.

28
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,862
We haven't eaten yet.

29
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,076
I know, but all that work
you're doing to get it ready and...

30
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:44,247
Did you pick Rachel for your
Secret Santa? I'll trade for her.

31
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,960
I picked her.
Thank God, you want her!

32
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,462
Why do you want to get
rid of her so badly?

33
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,631
She exchanges every gift she gets.

34
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,217
It's impossible to get her
something she likes.

35
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,010
Come on, let's trade!

36
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,930
I got her that backpack
and she loved it.

37
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,601
I remember she cried
when that big dog ran off with...

38
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,064
There was no big dog.

39
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:14,236
This sucks! I already got her
a briefcase with "R.G." put on it.

40
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,364
Her initials.

41
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:22,286
You can give it to somebody else.
Like Ross Geller!

42
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,122
You know what?
It's a girlie briefcase.

43
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,585
Who cares!
He works in a museum.

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,004
The big game's about to start!

45
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:36,925
Ross and Joey aren't here.
You can watch the parade.

46
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:42,097
What is wrong with this freezer?

47
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,975
- What happened?
- Ice just got in my eye!

48
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,270
People are trying
to sleep in here!

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,397
Monica got ice in her eye
and it hurts!

50
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,525
- Open it up. Let me see.
- I can't. It really kills.

51
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,946
Maybe you should put
some ice on it.

52
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,908
- It looks bad.
- We should take you to a doctor.

53
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,910
No, my eye doctor is Richard!

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,246
I can't go to him
when I don't have a boyfriend.

55
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,332
He's really picky about his patients.

56
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,252
You've got to go.
What's his office number?

57
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,964
Like I remember his office number!

58
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,259
Speed dial seven.

59
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,555
I'm calling on behalf
of Monica Geller's eye.

60
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,850
Is Richard Burke in today?

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,312
He's not in. Will she
see the on-call doctor?

62
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,441
She's very excited about that!

63
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,406
It's so cool.
Till Monica gets back, I'm head chef.

64
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,826
And I get to make all the decisions.

65
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,954
She told you to follow
the recipe exactly.

66
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,499
Get out of my kitchen.

67
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,586
I think I'm making
some progress with Joey.

68
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,339
When I walked in,
he went to his bedroom...

69
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,382
...but he only slammed the door once.

70
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,178
Yeah, he gave me the finger
while doing it.

71
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:09,392
I've got to call my mom and
ask her a left-handed cooking question.

72
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,691
I picked Monica for Secret Santa, but
I'm getting her something for Hanukkah.

73
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,860
You want to switch?

74
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,362
I was trying to trade...

75
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,281
...for you.

76
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,910
Really? That's so nice.
What are you getting me?

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,666
I don't know, R.G. I was thinking
something girlie for your office.

78
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,669
Maybe Phoebe will switch with me.

79
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,257
Then you'll get stuck with Rachel,
and she exchanges every gift.

80
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,301
No, I got her lots of stuff
she never took back.

81
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,553
Like?

82
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,306
Like that gold necklace
I got her last year.

83
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,183
When did she wear it last?

84
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:54,271
She wore it all Christmas day
and then...

85
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,190
Big dog?

86
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:03,739
What are you doing?

87
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,950
Sending back this stuff
Chandler bought.

88
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,619
Even the TV?

89
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,373
No, I'll put that in my room.

90
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,626
Listen, Joey.
I know what he did was wrong.

91
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,004
But can't you hear him out?

92
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:23,550
If Chandler had kissed Rachel,
would you hear him out?

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,136
That's a good point.

94
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,680
How long you going to punish him?

95
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,475
Five years.

96
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,851
You've sentenced him?

97
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,187
Don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

98
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,106
The guy's your best friend.

99
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,150
Was my best friend.

100
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,360
I don't know why
you're pushing for him.

101
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:48,367
With him out of the way as
my best friend, there's a spot open.

102
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,662
Who, me?

103
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:56,249
I'm honored. You know what
I'm going to do as your best friend?

104
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,421
I'm going to get you
to talk to Chandler.

105
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,631
All right.

106
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,676
But if you weren't
my best friend...

107
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,721
Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?

108
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,183
I walk in the room,
and he won't talk to me.

109
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,311
He just mumbles something in Italian.

110
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:20,816
And I know he only knows
the bad words.

111
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,405
Gunther, have you seen Chandler?

112
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,242
I thought you were Chandler.

113
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,579
But one of you is over there.

114
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:44,173
Hey, Joe.

115
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,766
I'll be right with you.

116
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,393
Thanks for coming in.

117
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:01,064
Oh, my God!
How cute is the on-call doctor?

118
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:06,737
So cute that I'm thinking
about jamming this pen in my eye.

119
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,406
Dr. Burke will see you now.

120
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,451
Not Dr. Burke.
The on-call doctor will see me now.

121
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,037
Dr. Richard Burke is out.

122
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:20,083
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son,
will see you now.

123
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,420
Ready?

124
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,846
Hey, I'm sorry. That...

125
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:36,349
- Where you going?
- My folks'.

126
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,310
When you coming back?

127
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,483
I don't know. I might stay there
while I look for an apartment.

128
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:49,864
I thought we could talk
about this. Work it out.

129
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,157
Seeing you two together, I don't...

130
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,619
What do you want me to say?
Should I stop seeing her?

131
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,413
It's not about her. Okay?

132
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:02,126
But seeing you together
reminds me of what you did.

133
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,839
I won't live with someone who
doesn't know what it is to be a friend.

134
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,135
I know what it is to be a friend.
I screwed up.

135
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,637
Yeah, you did.

136
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,556
And that's why I'm leaving.

137
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:22,563
If you're not going to stay for me,
then at least stay for them.

138
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:27,151
They had a very difficult year.
What with the robbery and all.

139
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,694
When that guy was robbing us...

140
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,321
...and I was locked in the
entertainment unit for six hours...

141
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,574
...do you know what I was doing?

142
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,870
I was thinking about
how I let you down.

143
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:44,293
If I knew what kind of friend
you'd be, I wouldn't have worried.

144
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:48,046
Wait one second! There has
to be something that I can do.

145
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,632
If we still had that unit...

146
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:56,180
...I'd get in it for six hours
and think about how I let you down.

147
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,729
We got a box.

148
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,109
I remember the last time I saw you.

149
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,237
It was the morning I left for college.

150
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,865
You were standing
outside the Dairy Queen.

151
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,536
Just probably waiting for it to open.

152
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,830
You look great now.

153
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,498
You look great too.

154
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,543
You're an excellent patient.

155
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,794
How does it look?

156
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:32,216
You have a scratch on your cornea.
You have to wear a patch.

157
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,677
Like a pirate?

158
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:38,139
If that helps you.

159
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,769
How long have you been working
with your dad?

160
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,856
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

161
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,401
I moved back here a couple months ago.

162
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:55,030
Big family dinner tonight?

163
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,782
No way!

164
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,701
I was going to have Thanksgiving
at my girlfriend's.

165
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,955
But we broke up.

166
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:08,168
She wasn't ready
for a serious commitment.

167
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:13,090
So you made her walk the plank,
aye, matey?

168
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,385
You're not wearing the patch yet.

169
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,515
I know.

170
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,271
He's coming here for Thanksgiving?

171
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,897
I know. It's sick.

172
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,106
Why is it sick?

173
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,775
It's Richard's son!

174
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:36,196
It's like inviting
a Greek tragedy over for dinner.

175
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,865
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?

176
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:43,162
I could see where I'd be
your best shot, but no.

177
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,040
Sorry, honey. I think it's twisted.

178
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,249
What's twisted?

179
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,627
Me going out with Richard's son.

180
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,677
It sounds like a really bad idea.

181
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,305
Is he okay in there?

182
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,099
He's fine!

183
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,102
If things work out
between you and Richard's son...

184
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,937
...you can tell your kids...

185
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:13,150
...that you slept
with their grandfather.

186
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,943
Judge all you want to.

187
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,488
Married a lesbian,
left a man at the altar...

188
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,198
...fell in love with a gay ice dancer...

189
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:23,994
...threw a girl's wooden leg
in the fire. Live in a box!

190
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:34,129
What exactly is the point of the box?

191
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,217
The meaning of the box is threefold.

192
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:42,721
One, it gives me the time
to think about what I did.

193
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:48,143
Two, it proves how much I care
about my friendship with Joey.

194
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,729
And three...

195
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,774
...it hurts.

196
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,612
Remember that necklace
I gave you last year?

197
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,073
Can I see it?

198
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,616
Why?

199
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:06,620
I just want to check something.

200
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,666
Now we'll see.

201
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:16,004
Air hole! Air hole!

202
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:21,009
Here it is. I love it.
I wear it all the time.

203
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:27,558
The necklace I got you was gold.
This is silver.

204
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,395
Well, maybe...

205
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,689
...it changed.

206
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,692
Oh, my God!
You actually exchanged it.

207
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,112
Isn't it better to exchange it
for something I enjoy...

208
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,822
...and can use a lot?

209
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,615
What did you get?

210
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:47,036
Credit.

211
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,540
I'll get it. I'll get it.

212
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,712
Hi, Tim.

213
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:01,216
Thank you.
Come meet my friends.

214
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,009
Phoebe.

215
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,511
And Joey.

216
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,388
My brother, Ross.

217
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,766
And Rachel.

218
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,645
That's Chandler.

219
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,856
How do you do?

220
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,525
- What's...
- Well, he's...

221
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,570
He's doing some thinking.

222
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:31,079
- What happened?
- You kissed my girlfriend!

223
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,793
I like those sunglasses.

224
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:42,716
"Like them" like them? Or "I'd like
to get store credit" like them?

225
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,182
This turkey is ready.

226
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,684
Where can I wash up?

227
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,395
Let me show you.

228
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,438
The towels are hanging next
to the sink.

229
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,525
And you can use the fancy soap.

230
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:05,531
Fancy soap? I thought we were
saving that for the Pope.

231
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,491
See. He's nice, right?

232
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,869
Do you want a relationship
where you can actually say:

233
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:15,290
"That's not how your dad
used to do it?"

234
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,046
Everything looks great.
Where should I sit?

235
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,089
Saved you a seat.

236
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,760
Sick, sick, sick.

237
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,138
I'll get it.

238
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,600
Got you!

239
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,811
That doesn't sound
like thinking to me.

240
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:37,896
Sorry!

241
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,814
You shouldn't be talking.

242
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:43,193
You've got too much thinking to do
to be talking and joking.

243
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,070
Okay, you got it!

244
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,572
Ross, pass me the yams?

245
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:53,454
Joey's got the mashed potatoes
if you want to exchange them.

246
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,500
Stop!
What's the matter with you?

247
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,378
We've got company.

248
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,172
Nothing's the matter with me.

249
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:08,928
I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
I have feelings.

250
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:13,015
Okay, fine.

251
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:22,691
You can't tell, but I'm breaking
the tension by mooning you guys.

252
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,780
All right, look!

253
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,784
If this is a big joke to you,
forget about it.

254
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,036
This means something to me.

255
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:37,164
If it doesn't mean anything to you,
then get out of there.

256
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,000
Otherwise, you're just
an idiot in a box.

257
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,378
You're right. I'm sorry.
This means a lot to me.

258
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:48,551
I want to be friends again.
I swear I won't say another word.

259
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,594
- So you'll take this seriously?
- Absolutely!

260
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,890
That sounds like another word to me.

261
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,935
Are you going to take this seriously?

262
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,358
Okay!

263
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,404
Don't say that I have no sentiment.

264
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,615
This is a movie stub
from our first date.

265
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:16,161
This eggshell is from the first time
you made me breakfast in bed.

266
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:20,540
This is from the museum,
the first time we...

267
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,876
...were together.

268
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:29,049
Maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter.

269
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,469
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:38,225
Though you're not
supposed to take these.

271
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,021
It's like a million years old.

272
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:48,194
We actually have people
looking for that.

273
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,741
This always happens.

274
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,743
Here, let me.

275
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,996
Thank you.

276
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,583
You have very beautiful...

277
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,004
...eye.

278
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,589
My friends think this is weird.

279
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,053
I thought so too. I almost
canceled, but it really isn't.

280
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:17,765
I know. Me and your dad,
that's totally separate.

281
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,476
I totally agree.

282
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,354
We're two people
who find each other...

283
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,606
...very attractive.

284
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,859
Right?

285
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,787
What?

286
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,372
Nothing, nothing.

287
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:44,291
No, really.
Was that not okay?

288
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,293
No, that was good.

289
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,546
That was a good kiss.

290
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,214
It reminded you of...

291
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,509
Don't say it!

292
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,804
- It did, didn't it?
- Yes!

293
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,890
I know!

294
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,663
I want you to know how sorry I am...

295
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,082
Chandler's the one I'm mad at.

296
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,293
Well, I'm still sorry.

297
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:29,879
Is he here?

298
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,881
In the box.

299
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:43,851
He can't talk right now.

300
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,519
What's going on?

301
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,481
He's trying to show Joey
how much he means to him.

302
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,358
By being in a box?

303
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,361
Joey had reasons.

304
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:57,322
They were threefold.

305
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,830
You not being able to talk
might make this easier.

306
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:09,334
Listen...

307
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:23,974
I don't want to be someone
who comes between two best friends.

308
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:28,019
I can't stand seeing
what this is doing to you guys.

309
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,982
And I don't want to be
the cause of that.

310
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,527
I don't think we can see
each other anymore.

311
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,238
I'm going to my mom's in Chicago.

312
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,492
I'm going to stay there for a while.

313
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,708
I think this could have been
something really amazing.

314
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,546
But, you know, this is
probably for the best.

315
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:58,133
You know?

316
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,723
I'm going to miss you.

317
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:09,811
Goodbye, Chandler.

318
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,489
Open the box!

319
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,953
He can still catch her.
Get out of there!

320
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,000
We're going to be fine.
Get out!

321
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,297
You did some real good
thinking in there.

322
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:39,967
I mean, this is...

323
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,305
You could still catch her!

324
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:49,769
And Merry Christmas
from your Secret Santa!

325
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,150
All right, who got Chandler?
Because I need to trade.

326
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:02,907
He sees her!

327
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,493
He's catching up to her.

328
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,787
She sees him!

329
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:12,165
They're hugging!

330
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,752
He's taking her purse.

331
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,713
That's not them.

332
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:21,341
I'll go call the police.

333
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:25,929
There they are!

334
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:34,730
All right, get a room.
