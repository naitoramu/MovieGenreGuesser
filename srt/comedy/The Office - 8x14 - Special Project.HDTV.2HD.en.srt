1
00:00:01,856 --> 00:00:03,840
Oh, look who's back
reporting for duty.

2
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:05,108
Hey, guys.

3
00:00:05,143 --> 00:00:06,876
Hey.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,645
Hey, Pam, ah!

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,413
Look what I can do now that
she's no longer pregnant.

6
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:12,148
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

7
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:13,650
Are you glad to be back?

8
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:16,519
Yeah-- Yeah, I mean I could
have used another week or three.

9
00:00:16,554 --> 00:00:18,954
You still had eight weeks
more than we did.

10
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:21,624
Well, it's not exactly
a vacation.

11
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:22,757
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey.

12
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:25,160
Remember?
Little old me, hi.

13
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:26,328
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:27,762
You just had our baby.

15
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:31,099
Our collective,
Dunder Mifflin family baby.

16
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:32,267
Four days ago.

17
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:33,802
I wanted to come back to work.

18
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:36,004
Not everybody needs
some long, luxurious,

19
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:38,406
- Parisian maternity leave.
- What?

20
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,675
Damn, girl, your body.

21
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,476
Angela, you look amazing.

22
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:46,146
Really? I feel like
this big rhinoceros.

23
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,949
Anyway, I wanted to thank
you guys for covering for me,

24
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,284
so I made some treats.

25
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:52,086
I've got brownies
and magic cookie bars.

26
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,088
Nice.

27
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:56,789
Oh, Angela, those brownies
have walnuts in them

28
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,358
and I think Kevin's
allergic to walnuts.

29
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,959
You're allergic to walnuts,
right, Kevin?

30
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,329
Extremely, but I'm going
to fight through it.

31
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,863
Aw, it's okay, Angela.

32
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,232
I have mommy-brain too.

33
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,066
I don't know what that is, Pam.

34
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,068
I made a batch with no nuts,
special for you, Kevin.

35
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,369
- It's right here.
- Ooh.

36
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,704
When did you find time
to do all this?

37
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,272
Babies sleep a lot, Pam.

38
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,274
If you feed them enough.

39
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:21,280
Brownie, Pam?

40
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:24,250
Thank you.

41
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,817
Oh, my gosh, it's really good.

42
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:32,690
I wouldn't know,
I'm watching my weight.

43
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,992
So, you guys, you know what's
an even more useful treat

44
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:37,462
- is cash, so--
- Nope, it's over.

45
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,364
- We wanted to say thank you--
- Nope. Okay.

47
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:50,340
Dwight, I have
exciting news for you.

48
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,742
What?

49
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:53,910
I think you're
going to like it.

50
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:55,379
You can't tantalize me.

51
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:57,213
Oh, maybe I can.

52
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,015
I got an e-mail
from corporate

53
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:05,354
- okay.
- That told me that you got a promotion.

54
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:06,855
Right? I mean,
that's not the kind of thing

55
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,557
you want to read
quietly at your desk.

56
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,926
If you make me head of sales
one more time, I swear.

57
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,227
No, this is legit.

58
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,496
You will be assembling
a team to go to Tallahassee

59
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,367
for three weeks to develop and
launch a chain of Sabre stores.

60
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:22,937
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

61
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:28,943
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

62
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:31,077
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

63
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,413
The Schrutes have a word
for when everything

64
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:35,416
in a man's life
comes together perfectly.

65
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,484
<i>Perfectenschlag.</i>

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,019
Right now, I am in it.

67
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:41,288
I finally get a chance
to prove myself to corporate.

68
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:43,757
I am assembling
a competent team.

69
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,292
I am likely a father.

70
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:49,595
I am so deep inside
of <i>perfectenschlag</i> right now.

71
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,699
And, just to be clear,
there is a second definition,

72
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,535
"perfect pork anus,"
which I don't mean.

73
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,870
And here's the fax for you.

74
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:00,072
And here's some facts for you.

75
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:02,674
Did you know frogs
can hear with their lungs?

76
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,578
And that flamingos can have
orgasms that last 30 minutes.

77
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:08,313
Love to learn.

78
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:10,449
Yeah, it's weird
that I said that last one.

79
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,150
So...

80
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:13,719
Uh, yeah, look at that.

81
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:15,654
- We're pin twins.
- Pin twins.

82
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,956
This is a gift from Jessica,
kind of a gag gift, really.

83
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,657
Real gifts come later.

84
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,792
Yeah, that's cute.

85
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:26,163
When I saw it in CVS,
it made me gag too.

86
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,303
For awhile there, I thought
something would change,

87
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,605
but, nope,
Andy's still with Jessica.

88
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,741
They even carpool
together most days.

89
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:42,278
I don't know, I wouldn't mind
carpooling every day with Andy.

90
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:46,516
But I wouldn't want to spend
that much time with Jessica.

91
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:52,521
What do we have here?

92
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:54,523
Val knit me a beanie.

93
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:56,492
But I can't tell if it's a
"we're just friends" beanie

94
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:59,528
or a "I'm hot, you're hot,
let's get it popping" beanie.

95
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:01,663
So I'm going to up the ante,

96
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:05,166
give her
a clearly romantic gift.

97
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:08,035
And we'll get
to the meaning of the beanie.

98
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,505
Pam, pack up your
postnatal swimwear,

99
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,473
make it a one-piece,
or this offer is rescinded,

100
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:15,209
and join me for a fantastic
barbecue, one week from today,

101
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:17,011
in Tallahassee, Florida,
where I'm going to be living

102
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:18,345
for the next three weeks.

103
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,714
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:22,116
I'll fly anywhere
for some good barbecue.

105
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,216
Ooh, me three.

106
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,785
No plus-ones.

107
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,086
This is for competent
workers only.

108
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:29,890
And don't worry about the cost,
Sabre is footing the bill.

109
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,057
Does this have anything
to do with

110
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,091
what you were talking
to Andy about?

111
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:37,363
God, you're such a spy.

112
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:39,164
Notice anything
different about me?

113
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:40,833
You're wearing the beanie.

114
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:42,134
You like it?

115
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:44,537
Super comfortable,
like sweatpants for my head.

116
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:45,905
I love it too, Val.

117
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:49,174
It's really itchy,
but to be fair,

118
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,843
my head is constantly itching.

119
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:54,479
So I can't really
peg it on the hat.

120
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:57,916
Wow, it's like
the nation of islam down here.

121
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,919
I like to knit.
Don't hate.

122
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:02,687
And who's that for?

123
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:07,859
Oh, this is a gift
for my man, Nate, here.

124
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:08,993
- What?
- Yeah.

125
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:11,328
Darryl, you shouldn't have.

126
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,497
- Can I open it?
- No, no, no, maybe just--

127
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:16,433
Ah, I can't wait,
I'm sorry, I'm too excited.

128
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:22,639
Darryl.

129
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:24,207
Wow, those are really nice.

130
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,809
- They're so elegant.
- Cashmere.

131
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:27,844
How'd you know?

132
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:30,880
Just a hunch.

133
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,448
Your gift is on the way.

134
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,917
Can't wait.

135
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,787
I'm glad you're in my life,
happy Valentine's day.

136
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:38,955
Oh, Darryl.

137
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:42,024
I am glad to be
in your life too.

138
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:47,896
Your card is more beautiful
than the gloves.

139
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,033
My first task as Special
Project Manager, Dwight Schrute?

140
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,168
Assembling a crack team.

141
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:56,337
I need people who are loyal.

142
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:58,206
People who will help me
get an inroad

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,608
with the gay-hispanic
community.

144
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:03,276
People who won't be missed.

145
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:06,914
- We don't need idiots.
- This hurts.

146
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:08,782
Good for nothings.

147
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,918
Meth-heads.

148
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:14,554
Or--
What's your name?

149
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:15,722
Kathy.

150
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:17,223
Kathy.

151
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:23,930
I just got a text
from Robert California

152
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:26,132
that says,
"bring your clubs to Florida."

153
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,333
Why?

154
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:28,868
Does he think
you're going to Florida?

155
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:31,703
I hope not,
because I am not going.

156
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:32,905
Two question marks.

157
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:34,339
No, just do one.

158
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,642
Two question marks
is kind of aggressive.

159
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,810
You know, it's like,
"wh-- what?"

160
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:41,580
Just do one.

161
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:43,048
You want to take
Darryl, Phyllis,

162
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:45,483
- Toby, Angela, and Oscar?
- Yes.

163
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:47,952
Can I interest you
in someone less essential?

164
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:50,655
Like a--
A Creed or a Meredith perhaps?

165
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,523
- Oh, my God.
- They're not expendable,

166
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:54,324
exactly, I just can't--
I can't think of the word

167
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,426
I'm trying to find.

168
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,661
Are you kidding me?

169
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,563
I'm supposed to get on an
airplane with those nincompoops?

170
00:06:58,597 --> 00:06:59,797
We'd never
make it off the runway.

171
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:01,599
All right, look, I got to keep

172
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:04,100
this office functioning
somehow, so--

173
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:05,869
I have put together a list.

174
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,236
Here's your team.

175
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:09,205
Darryl and Phyllis,
you can have.

176
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,641
But you're also taking
Kathy, Kelly, and Kevin.

177
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:12,842
Oh, God.

178
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:13,877
You have your team.

179
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,813
Kevin? Kelly? Kathy?

180
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:19,414
Andy just gave me
a chain with three weak links.

181
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,483
Have you ever tried to use
a chain with three weak links?

182
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:23,840
I have, and now I no longer
own an arctic wolf.

183
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:28,519
Well, let's hear it.

184
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:29,620
"Robert, hey!"
Exclamation point.

185
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:30,521
I like it so far.

186
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:32,390
"Got your text, awesome idea.

187
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:34,291
Let's hit the links
the next time you're in PA."

188
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:35,692
Dash, JH.

189
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:37,827
It's perfect.

190
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:40,696
You emphasized the golf,
completely omit the Florida.

191
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:41,931
Yeah, it's a golf text.

192
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:44,534
Total golf text, send it.

193
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:47,570
Done--
Wait, I just feel weird.

194
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:48,938
I should just call him.

195
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:51,441
You want to call someone
that texted you?

196
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:54,543
Do you want to drive them away?
I mean--?

197
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,380
This is Darryl.

198
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,615
Oh, sorry, I asked
for the main shipping number.

199
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,084
I just need the address
for the warehouse.

200
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:04,153
I want to send my girlfriend
some flowers.

201
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:06,155
Your girlfriend?

202
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:07,322
Is your girlfriend Val?

203
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:09,890
Yeah, do you know her?

204
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:14,529
We're friends, we're friends.

205
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:17,765
Cool. Uh, so can I get
that address or--?

206
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,901
Yeah, yeah, sorry,
I'm just looking for a pen.

207
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:22,070
Why do you need a pen?

208
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:24,138
Back off.
I got my reasons.

209
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:25,838
May I have
your attention, please?

210
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:28,007
Could Kathy, Phyllis, Darryl,
Kevin, and Kelly please

211
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,709
join me in the conference room
immediately.

212
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,278
- Why?
- Oh, no big deal.

213
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:33,380
It's just that you five
have been deemed most deserving

214
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:35,748
of a three-week,
all expenses paid business trip

215
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,016
to Tallahassee, Florida.

216
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,318
Hell, yeah.

217
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,719
What?

218
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,020
Oh, I'm sorry, Stanley.

219
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:42,221
I can't share any more
details with you.

220
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,690
You see, Andy rejected you.

221
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,559
Wait, Kathy gets to go?

222
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,926
Why does she even
still work here?

223
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,595
Pam is back.

224
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,929
It just feels like
a slap in the face.

225
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,565
I can understand your pain
and your rage,

226
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,366
but you know what?
Andy is an honorable man,

227
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:55,767
let us not question
his choices.

228
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,868
I'm sure he had his reasons.

229
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:59,170
We're not questioning
his reasons.

230
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,438
I just want to know
what they are.

231
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,806
I know, you and me both,
brother.

232
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,808
It seemed kind of random to me,
but he was pretty clear

233
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,343
on who he thought
truly deserved

234
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:06,944
this boondoggle of a lifetime.

235
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,480
Well, he nailed it.

236
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,682
Because I do deserve
a vacation.

237
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,617
Sometimes Batman's
got to take off his cape.

238
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:14,918
Good point,

239
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:16,686
but we're going to be working
pretty hard until 5:00 P.M.

240
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:19,689
After that, it's gonna be
beach volleyball,

241
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:20,924
trips to Cape Canaveral,

242
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,427
and sea-kayaking
with Gloria Estefan.

243
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,195
What were the criteria
for going?

244
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,532
It might be innate goodness
versus innate badness.

245
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:32,168
But there's an easy way
to find out.

246
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:36,105
Oh, Andy,
got a few questions for you.

247
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,474
<i>Moshi moshi.</i>

248
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:40,909
Uh, the Florida picks got out,

249
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:42,478
and people were just
kind of curious

250
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:44,079
as to why they weren't picked,

251
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:45,780
and maybe you could
just clarify.

252
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:51,253
Uh, well, the deliberations
were confidential,

253
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:53,721
so I feel like
we should respect that.

254
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:54,956
Respect it?

255
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,291
You're trying to tell me
Kevin Malone

256
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,959
deserves more
than Stanley Hudson?

257
00:09:57,993 --> 00:09:59,394
Hey.

258
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,162
Okay, it's obvious
that Andy picked the people

259
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:03,330
that are least important
to the office.

260
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:04,565
Important?

261
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,099
Oh, because you and your
enormous monster-baby

262
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:07,434
are so important to the branch.

263
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:09,303
My baby is not a monster.

264
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:11,472
Hey, be proud of your
enormous monster-baby.

265
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:13,541
I was once
an enormous monster-baby.

266
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:18,110
Guys, guys, guys,
come on, seriously?

267
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:21,981
We cannot let this trip
cause this kind of rift, guys.

268
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:23,349
Stop calling us "guys."

269
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:26,819
I use the word "guys"
a lot when I'm nervous.

270
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:27,820
Guys.

271
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:30,657
- Guys, guys, guys.
- Andy, please.

272
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,292
Stop it, Andy.

273
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:33,925
- Dudes--
- Andy.

274
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,960
The dudes
who are going to Florida

275
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:38,497
were picked by Dwight and me.

276
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,799
Okay, hey, I specifically
remember that there were

277
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,835
a lot of other people
I thought should be considered.

278
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:45,704
If anybody's going
to Florida, it should be me.

279
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:47,506
Every shirt that I have
that isn't a work shirt

280
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,007
is a Tommy Bahama.

281
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,742
I'm the only person in this
office who watches <i>Burn Notice.</i>

282
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,011
Okay, I did not realize
that so many of you

283
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:55,279
wanted to go so badly.

284
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:57,548
So if you feel like
you have a very good reason

285
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,016
to go to Florida,
I'm happy to hear you out.

286
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,518
Great idea.

287
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,253
So why doesn't everyone just
take the next five to six hours,

288
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,821
come up with a statement
on why you feel you deserve

289
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:05,622
to go to Florida, and Andy
and I will listen to it.

290
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:07,190
No, that is a ridiculous
waste of time.

291
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:08,458
For you, maybe.

292
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:10,159
- Five to six hours?
- Three to four hours.

293
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:12,028
- No, no, no, no.
- Just two to three hours--

294
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:14,497
come up with a statement
over the next hour.

295
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:16,065
30 minutes.

296
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm out.

297
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:19,135
Okay, read it back to me.

298
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:20,503
"Robert, great offer."

299
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:21,903
Wish I could hit the links
with you in Florida,

300
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:24,172
but a father of a newborn
really should be helping out

301
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:25,374
"his wife
any chance he gets."

302
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,843
Good, doesn't sound pushy.

303
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:29,044
You're just stating a fact.

304
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:31,012
Absolutely.
Works for me.

305
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:34,383
- Okay, sending.
- Well done.

306
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,184
And we managed to kill
the entire morning.

307
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:37,152
We really did.

308
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,926
He responded "LOL."

309
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:56,403
I have a new swimsuit
I need to break in.

310
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:58,204
I already picked my team.

311
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,907
Darryl, Oscar, Angela,
Phyllis, and Toby.

312
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,876
And that is the team
that I am taking.

313
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,210
What's that?
It's not up to me?

314
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,112
I only have influence?

315
00:12:06,147 --> 00:12:09,015
Well, that's all
Baltzer Glattfielder had,

316
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:12,418
and now no one
eats owls for Thanksgiving.

317
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:14,253
You have two young,
dynamic people in this office

318
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:16,322
who know trends,
who know youth.

319
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:19,458
That's myself and Kelly Kapoor.
You need one of us there.

320
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,193
Or both.

321
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:23,195
Not both.
Just one. Me.

322
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:25,330
Or if not me, Kelly.
Ideally, me.

323
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:26,998
Again, youth knowledge.

324
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:28,700
That's what you get
when you put Ryan Howard

325
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,101
on your Special Project Team.

326
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:34,839
Or Kelly Kapoor.
Again, not both. Thanks.

327
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:36,374
Very impressive.

328
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:38,109
He put a lot of work into that.

329
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:41,212
Powerpoints are the peacocks
of the business world.

330
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,380
All show, no meat.

331
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:45,248
Because I feel like
that I'm at a place

332
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:47,083
with my gambling rehab

333
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:50,621
that I can finally start
going to dog racing again.

334
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:55,526
You know, just sitting,
watching, enjoying the sport.

335
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,760
Maybe putting down a few
dollars, if there's, like,

336
00:12:57,795 --> 00:13:00,095
a crazy mismatch or something.

337
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,131
Okay, thank you, Kevin.
We'll let you know.

338
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,966
- Thank you.
- When do we leave?

339
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,535
Thank you.

340
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,771
It has been a long,
lonely winter.

341
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:12,642
Wow, seasonal affective
disorder, aka, "SAD."

342
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:15,477
That sounds like
a very real thing, Toby.

343
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:18,347
It is real.
Thank you for saying that.

344
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,382
Yeah, wow, it's almost like

345
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:25,253
we're not all experiencing
the same winter.

346
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:26,655
"Florida Stanley" smiles.

347
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,857
"Florida Stanley"
is happy to go to work.

348
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:34,228
"Florida Stanley" is who
you want on your Florida team.

349
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,430
It's still, well--

350
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,466
Hey, guys, any spots left?

351
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,300
Erin, you want
to go to Tallahassee?

352
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:42,570
I do.
I really do.

353
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:45,072
I think it would be
a nice way to clear my head.

354
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,507
You know, I don't think
it's a good idea for you

355
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,776
to clear your head anymore
than it has been already.

356
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,412
I think you need a workplace
where the burdens

357
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:55,515
of everyday life keep you
tethered to reality.

358
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:56,916
Either or.

359
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,786
But if you can find someone
to fill in, I would love to go.

360
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,121
Well, it wouldn't be hard
to find someone to fill in.

361
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:06,859
Really?
Oh, great, good.

362
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,528
Now, is it too dark to say
that Cece's having an operation?

363
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:12,664
I think you
need to go to Florida.

364
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:14,366
I think you're right.

365
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:15,701
It's only for three weeks.

366
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:18,469
You know, with my mom and sister
at the house it'll be--

367
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:20,738
- A total nightmare.
- I was going to say,

368
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:22,440
"good, because I'll have
all the help I need."

369
00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:23,875
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

370
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:25,075
They're incredibly helpful.
You're lucky to have them.

371
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,310
I mean, with them there,

372
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:27,879
you probably
won't even know I'm gone.

373
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:30,681
Exactly.

374
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,316
Well--

375
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,918
No, no, absolutely not.

376
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:37,353
You are not going.
Over my dead body, no.

377
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:39,923
Tunes, I'm really sorry.

378
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:41,658
You're too essential
to the operation here.

379
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:42,992
I can't let you go.

380
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:45,094
I wouldn't say that.
That's a bit much.

381
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:46,229
You know, Dwight,
if you didn't want me to go,

382
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:47,597
the smart move would be
to tell Andy

383
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:49,265
that I actually <i>am</i>
essential to the operation.

384
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,199
That way I couldn't go.

385
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:52,435
Jim is essential to--

386
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:55,404
Hold on, just want
to get it on camera.

387
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:59,508
Andy,
Jim is just too ess--

388
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:00,776
Essential.

389
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:02,511
This is stupid.
Cut.

390
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:03,913
All right, I'm going
to pack my trunks.

391
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:05,314
He doesn't even want to go.

392
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:07,682
Well, I got a text from RC
inviting me to come down,

393
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:11,319
so I think that's going
to make us roommates.

394
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:12,253
Oh, my God.

395
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,788
Hey, quick question.

396
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:15,222
Do you shower at night
or do you shower in the morning?

397
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:16,691
Because I want to shower
when you're showering

398
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:20,294
to save some water.

399
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,762
Okay, listen up, everyone.

400
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,196
Here's who's going to Florida.

401
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,598
- Kathy.
- What?

402
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,966
- Stanley.
- No.

403
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
- Ryan.
- No.

404
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:28,368
- Erin.
- Fuck.

405
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:29,970
And Jim.

406
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:31,438
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

407
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:35,509
Okay, okay.

408
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:36,896
Florida group,
welcome to the team.

409
00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:43,102
Aah!

410
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,754
Let's go.
Step it up, you runts.

411
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:51,322
Infants, let's move.

412
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:52,957
Why is it so hot in here?

413
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:55,126
Hot?
What are you talking about?

414
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,095
This is a nice,
temperate, Florida morning.

415
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:59,297
85 degrees, 73% humidity.

416
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,799
This is the exact environment
that you will be facing

417
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,968
for the next three weeks
of your life.

418
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:07,271
Welcome to Special Projects
Orientation.

419
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:09,006
The next three weeks
of your life

420
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,943
are going to be the most
miserable you've ever faced.

421
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,845
They're going to be hard,
they're going to be dirty.

422
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,348
You're going to wish
you were dead.

423
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:19,783
But.

424
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:21,650
But?
There's no buts.

425
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:23,352
That's it,
you'll wish you were dead.

426
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:25,854
You seem a little disturbed,
do you want to stay here?

427
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,256
No, no, I want to go.

428
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,825
Because if any of you
would prefer to stay here,

429
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:32,995
all you need to do
is ring this bell.

430
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,663
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?

431
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:36,765
- Shut up, maggot!
- It is.

432
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,333
You don't want to go,
ring the bell.

433
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,402
Ring it, ring it.

434
00:16:40,436 --> 00:16:44,872
How many of you have seen
the documentary <i>Deliverance?</i>

435
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:46,942
How did a mosquito get in here?

436
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:49,377
I released 300 mosquitoes
into the conference room.

437
00:16:49,412 --> 00:16:50,878
Just temporarily.

438
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:56,650
When I'm done, the frogs will
take care of the mosquitoes.

439
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:00,321
Yes, then he brushes your soft,
supple cheeks

440
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:03,190
with his worn,
leathery hands and says,

441
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:06,994
"I'm going to make you
the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt."

442
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:08,595
Unless you ring the bell,
ring it.

443
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:09,728
- No.
- Ring the bell.

444
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:10,930
You want to spend
the rest of your life

445
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,531
changing your husband's
colostomy bags?

446
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:13,833
Huh, do you?

447
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,235
Ring it. Ah.

448
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,236
What was that?

449
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:20,206
Mosquito.

450
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,646
Orientation's over.

451
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,449
Oh, Darryl, hey.

452
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,616
Hey, what's up?
You called?

453
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,685
Yeah, you know,
I felt really terrible

454
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,287
that you got me
these lovely gloves

455
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,421
and I didn't get you anything.

456
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,589
It's cool, really.

457
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,358
No, it's anything but cool.

458
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,959
Now, I haven't
really had time to go out

459
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:46,197
and buy you anything,
but here goes.

460
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,867
- "This coupon entitles you to
one free tickle-monster attack."

461
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,369
Yeah, they're Nate coupons,

462
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,570
or "Na-pons,"
and they're all different.

463
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,273
Cash that one in and I will
bring you a stick of gum.

464
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,876
Any time, any place.
I'll find you.

465
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,047
Thanks.

466
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:04,914
Nice flowers.

467
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:07,717
Thanks, they're from my mom.

468
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:11,988
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

469
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:14,189
Oh, so I guess
that was your mom

470
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:16,691
who called me earlier
looking for the address?

471
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:18,460
Real deep-voiced woman.

472
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,095
Yeah, that's her.

473
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,797
She said her name
was Brandon, I think.

474
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:26,101
Your mom's name is Brandon?

475
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:29,970
Yeah, Darryl,
my mom's name is Brandon.

476
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:36,677
I guess I figured out
where I stand.

477
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:40,714
This is a love beanie.

478
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:46,686
Okay, Florida Team,
let's reconvene.

479
00:18:56,997 --> 00:19:00,733
I'm going to Florida
and I'm not coming back.

480
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:05,171
So Sabre has setup
a conference room for our use

481
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:06,972
while we're at corporate.

482
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:08,640
So what is this
Special Project?

483
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,809
Basically, Sabre has
tasked us with helping them

484
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:12,311
branch into
the retail marketplace.

485
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:14,280
They want to setup their own
version of an Apple Store.

486
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:15,614
That sounds awesome.

487
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:17,648
It did, it did.

488
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:19,050
You know what might
be great is if instead

489
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:21,652
of a genius bar,
we have a lounge area

490
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,788
where people can ask questions
about the product

491
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:25,957
with other customers
who liked it.

492
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:27,725
Yeah, and they should
have a place where people

493
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,161
can check their computers
or printers before they see you

494
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:32,863
so you don't have
to carry it around like a dope.

495
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:34,931
Like a coat check.

496
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,604
Oh, don't write it down
unless you like it.

497
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,473
Oh, I like it.

498
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:43,740
It seems to me
that the Apple Store

499
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:44,874
is kind of like a party,

500
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:46,410
so I think our question is,

501
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:47,711
"how do we make this
a better party?"

502
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:49,512
No, we sell business tools,

503
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,314
and the stores
need to reflect that.

504
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:52,815
They need to be all business.

505
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:55,384
Let all the other stores
look like a toy store.

506
00:19:55,419 --> 00:20:00,889
Right, think different
from Apple.

507
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:02,358
Dwight, is now
a good time to go over

508
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:06,495
what you expect of us?

509
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,066
Yes.

510
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:14,035
What are my expectations
for the group?

511
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:16,004
I had been given
the responsibility

512
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:17,839
to manage Stanley,
a solid player.

513
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:19,941
Ryan, who is capable
of surprises.

514
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:21,975
Erin, an excellent follower.

515
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,346
And Kathy, a probably not
totally useless enigma.

516
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,215
And, well, Jim.

517
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,053
Under the right manager,
that's not a bad team.

518
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:34,855
<i>Perfectenschlag.</i>

519
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:42,819
I don't know how I'm going
to live here without you.

520
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:43,786
Me neither.

521
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:45,755
Hey, will you put this coat
on my chair?

522
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:47,324
I just realized I'm not
going to need it down there.

523
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:49,658
Yes, I will take your coat
and I will keep it with me.

524
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:51,827
And I will sleep with it,
because it smells like you.

525
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:55,197
No, no, no, no,
just put it on my chair.

526
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:56,098
- All right.
- Bye.

527
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:57,199
Bye.

528
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:59,635
- Call me when you land.
- I will.

529
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:01,203
Safe travels.

530
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:02,471
Goodbye.

531
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:04,606
For a very, very long time.

532
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,142
Hmm?
Okay.

533
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:13,147
It's only three weeks.

534
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:15,382
All expenses paid.

535
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,783
Yeah, Jim's going to be there.

536
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:21,622
That marriage is not good.
Nobody knows better than me.

537
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,089
Definitely we will.

538
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:28,267
It's three weeks in Tallahassee.
What else is there to do?

539
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:37,097
