00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,591
I think we should try it again.

164
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,144
This time,
worst-case scenario.

165
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,645
Okay, here we go.
Jessica,

166
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,964
I'm really sorry.
I just need you to know--

167
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:10,433
- [Whining] What?

168
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:12,234
I just need you to know--

169
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:15,137
What is it?
I didn't sleep well last night.

170
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:17,189
[Laughs]

171
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:20,142
Ugh!

172
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,144
- Ow.
- Nellie, that reminds me.

173
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:23,446
Do you want this chair
in the bedroom?

174
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,780
'Cause to be honest,
I don't think

175
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:25,998
it's gonna
fit through the door.

176
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:27,500
Don't listen to Jim.

177
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:28,951
Have you ever seen him
play Tetris?

178
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:31,170
"Oh, I think I'll just use
this line horizontally.

179
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:33,706
Oh, I had no idea what a gift
this line is."

180
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:36,492
- The one time--
- I will get the chair in.

181
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,627
Watch the great Schrutini
work his magic.

182
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:40,429
Oh, no.
Really? Magic?

183
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:42,298
No, no, no.
Let's not go there.

184
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:45,885
No, nothing is more repellant
than magicians.

185
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:49,054
Bunch of grown men
waving wands,

186
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,223
pulling bunnies
out of body crevices.

187
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:53,826
Magicians are repulsive.
Next topic.

188
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,228
[Cell phone rings]
Excuse me, one second.

189
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,564
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up?

190
00:06:58,615 --> 00:07:01,200
Ah, nothing, just hauling
some cube with Dwight.

191
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:02,568
[Shouting] Haulin' cube!

192
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:03,953
That's moving boxes.

193
00:07:03,987 --> 00:07:06,855
We just came up with the term
to make it sound cooler.

194
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:08,524
So we're planning
this party for Nellie,

195
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,743
and we're gonna make it
really bad.

196
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:12,261
Sounds like
every other party.

197
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,580
No. We're gonna make it
like a prank.

198
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:17,516
Like order bad food, give her
this passive-aggressive card.

199
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:19,468
Oh! Hire a magician.

200
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:21,220
- What?
- Trust me.

201
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:23,705
[Laughing] Okay.

202
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,513
Oh.

203
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:32,348
Wow. There's a lot
of cars here.

204
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:34,233
This is just weird.

205
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,186
Andy!

206
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,522
Hey, what are you doing here?

207
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:41,106
Hey, Lauren.
Look at you.

208
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,075
Well, I know.
Look at me.

209
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:45,060
I was just on my way back
from this business trip,

210
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,612
thought I'd stop
and say hi to Jessica.

211
00:07:46,663 --> 00:07:47,947
Aww!
[Clicks tongue]

212
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:50,366
Why is Erin with me?
That's a great question.

213
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,700
She is my coworker,

214
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:55,254
and she needed a ride
because she totaled her car.

215
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,872
Oh.
God.

216
00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:58,257
So I'm Erin.
Hi.

217
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,042
- Yep. This is Erin.
- Nice to meet you.

218
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,927
[Gasps]

219
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:04,580
Well,
Jess went out for a run,

220
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:06,415
but she'll be back soon.

221
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:07,766
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, ladies.

222
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,402
Andy's here.

223
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:13,589
[Softly] Okay, Andy,
that is a bachelorette party,

224
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,808
this is Jessica's friends,

225
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:17,610
an they've been drinking
during the daytime.

226
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,645
Should we go?

227
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:21,814
You know, we had such a quick
window to make this work,

228
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,649
I think we should
probably just--

229
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,934
Oh, Jess!
[Claps]

230
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:27,486
Look who stopped by
after his business trip.

231
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:30,456
Andy!
Hey!

232
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,241
I wonder if king-sized
sheets

233
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:34,677
are called presidential-sized
in england.

234
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:37,429
I really should have
a tweeter account.

235
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:39,832
Yes, you should.

236
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,434
Ooh!

237
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:45,588
"Nellie, don't open, stupid.
Love, Nellie."

238
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:48,924
- I have to see these shoes.
- I doubt that they're sh--

239
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,978
- [Exhales]
- Whoa.

240
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:55,648
Who's this guy?

241
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:57,633
Here's the two of them
taking a hike.

242
00:08:57,651 --> 00:08:59,602
I'm guessing
he's some kind of friend.

243
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:01,437
Boyfriend.

244
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,138
Here's the two of them
kissing at a beach

245
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:06,025
and kissing
at the Eiffel Tower.

246
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm guessing he's some kind
of close romantic friend.

247
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:09,811
Like a boyfriend?

248
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:12,615
- You read my mind.
- Yeah.

249
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:15,951
Whoa. Here's one with
his face whited out.

250
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:18,037
Hmm. Maybe someone
threw a pie in his face.

251
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:20,172
New theory-- He's a hated
Italian politician.

252
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:21,957
Better theory--
This is her ex-boyfriend,

253
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:24,209
and they went through
some kind of painful breakup.

254
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:25,778
- Oh, Nellie.
- Oh.

255
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:28,631
I'm so sorry.
We were just...

256
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:30,599
I see you've discovered
Benjamin.

257
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:34,103
That's what I call my box
full of photos of Henry.

258
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:35,888
- Why not call...
- Shh!

259
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:41,758
God. We owned a flat together.

260
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:44,263
Then one morning,
just like that, he was gone.

261
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:46,916
He ran off with the waitress
at our favorite restaurant.

262
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,551
That's awful.

263
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,520
What kind of restaurant?

264
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:52,738
Dwight.

265
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:54,106
I couldn't afford
the flat myself.

266
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:56,292
So I sold it at a loss.

267
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,861
Ah, but what's ten years
of bliss down the drain

268
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:00,863
compared with the thrill
of starting over

269
00:10:00,897 --> 00:10:02,865
with nothing and no one?

270
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,166
I'm so sorry.

271
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:05,901
These must be
very painful memories.

272
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,536
If it would help you
to forget,

273
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,590
I could hit you in the brain
stem with this candle stick.

274
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,242
[Softly] Thank you.

275
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,710
No.

276
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:17,563
Jim, Dwight, please...

277
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:18,931
[Sniffles]

278
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,633
Don't tell anyone about this.

279
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:22,985
No, no.
Of course.

280
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,688
Just one quick question.

281
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:28,390
Was this, um, Halloween or...

282
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:30,309
No.

283
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,878
That's the most embarrassing
thing of all of this.

284
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:34,429
What kind of fool
gets her heart broken

285
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:36,598
by a bloody stage magician?

286
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:40,152
Hey, you know what, Pam?

287
00:10:40,203 --> 00:10:42,121
I was thinking maybe
we should change course here.

288
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:43,239
Let's give up
on all this mean stuff.

289
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:45,391
What? No!
No, I just had

290
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:47,910
this brilliant idea--
Everyone loved it.

291
00:10:47,944 --> 00:10:49,879
You don't have a copyright
on pranks.

292
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:51,931
I might be better
at this than you.

293
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:54,116
- No, that's not what I--
- Jim, could you give us a hand?

294
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:55,334
Absolutely.
Yeah.

295
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:56,969
[Whispers] Call it off, Pam.
Call it off, okay?

296
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:58,771
It's way more complicated
than you think.

297
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:00,622
Cancel the magician.
Trust me.

298
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,224
Oh. O-okay.

299
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,677
Okay, I will.

300
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:10,516
- Pam, we have a great idea.
- Listen to this.

301
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,134
We're gonna have the
fluorescent lights flickering.

302
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:13,769
It's gonna make everyone sick.

303
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:16,105
- Or what if...
- Okay.

304
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:17,690
We discuss...
[Women giggling]

305
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:20,776
The idea of doing the party

306
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,161
totally normal?

307
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:24,330
Like... Not mean.

308
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:26,632
Just a regular party.

309
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,617
Not mean.

310
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:29,702
I knew she'd crack!

311
00:11:29,753 --> 00:11:31,704
I wanted to leave you out,
you know.

312
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:32,922
We're in far too deep.

313
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:34,489
We can't change course
at this point.

314
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,342
What are you talking about?
Of course we can.

315
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:38,043
What I mean to say is
we don't want to.

316
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:39,628
Toots, we're not stopping
this train,

317
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:41,897
so get off the tracks.

318
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,349
Suck it!

319
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,301
[Whooping, applause]

320
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:47,186
- Andy--
- It'll be fine.

321
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,554
Just act natural.

No, I'll just have

more complicated than you think.

Watch out for... birds.

484
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,788
[Chuckling]

485
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:12,825
All right, let's, uh--
Let's do some card magic.

486
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,844
Now, what I want you
to do is...

487
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,680
I want you to pick a card
just by looking at it.

488
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:20,683
Do not say what it is.

489
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,154
It's the 4 of hearts.

490
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,189
Oh, no, you--

491
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:29,526
Looks like we got a guy
from another country here, huh?

492
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,362
No hablo el cardo, señor?

493
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:33,696
Hmm? Ha.

494
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:35,148
All right, the card is picked.

495
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:38,401
Now, sir, will you please
shuffle the deck?

496
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,343
You didn't just do that
on... Purpose, did ya?

497
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:49,829
Why is Jim treating
the magician poorly?

498
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,464
Little known fact
about me--

499
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:55,301
Before I was a magician,
I used to work...

500
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:56,869
- at a rope factory.
- Not true.

501
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,588
'Cause that's not a real place.

502
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,724
But I never could seem
to figure out those knots.

503
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,926
That's not a real knot.

504
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:04,477
When you pull on it,
it disappears.

505
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:06,012
[Yells] What the hell?

506
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:07,514
All right, where's Phyllis?

507
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,766
Who's Phyllis?

508
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,184
Look!

509
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,553
This is really uncool, okay?

510
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:15,438
I put on
a clean show here--

511
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:16,856
- Okay, scram, wizard.
- What?

512
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,441
- You heard me!
- Ho oh!

513
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,193
Well, Nellie, I'm sorry.

514
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,695
If I'd known Jim and Pam

515
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,881
would use this party
as an excuse

516
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,382
to abuse a magician--

517
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,585
Well, I thought
it was quite fun.

518
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,037
In fact, I think
they're brilliant employees

519
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,255
in their own way.

520
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:34,791
Don't you see what I see?

521
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,376
Interesting.
Yes.

522
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,461
No, yes, I see that.

523
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,746
Great work, team.

524
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,599
Great party.

525
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:45,018
You think this is
a great party?

526
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:47,954
This cake has vegetables in it.

527
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:50,023
Like a salad bar, Robert.

528
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:52,775
How do I get this taste
out of my mouth?

529
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:57,814
What?
Why are we--

530
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,266
- I just gotta do one thing.

531
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,607
Oh. Hello.

532
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,409
Hey, everybody,
look who's here.

533
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:10,660
What are you doing here?

534
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,580
Hi.
Super-duper honesty time.

535
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,281
I'm not gay.

536
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,750
In fact, I'm so not gay
that I'm in love with a girl.

537
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:21,437
Her name is Erin Hannon,
and she's right there.

538
00:20:21,472 --> 00:20:23,973
She's sweet, funny,
and beautiful,

539
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:27,443
and total relationship
material.

540
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:28,945
Why the hell
did you come back here?

541
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,930
- Go away.
- Get lost.

542
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,682
- Get out!
- Okay.

543
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,933
- You're done!
- Bye, guys.

544
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,318
Get out.
You ruined my party!

545
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:38,638
Who does that?
Are you kidding me?

546
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:40,106
Yeah, run away, Andy.

547
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,658
- Run away!
- You're disgusting!

548
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:44,977
I can't believe
you're not gay!

549
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:48,197
- Yeah, get outta here.
- Don't come back.

550
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,035
Uh-oh.
[Laughing]

551
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:53,202
- You don't even know how to drive!
- Bye, Andy!

552
00:20:53,254 --> 00:20:55,338
- Loser!
- Nice car!

553
00:20:55,372 --> 00:20:56,489
Have fun!

554
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,746
- Hey, Hank.
- Yes, ma'am.

555
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,844
I thought I was very specific about
not letting up a magician?

556
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,074
Yes, ma'am.
I got my eyes open.

557
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,294
Oh, turns out that he
actually made it up there.

558
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:15,266
What? That ain't right.

559
00:21:15,353 --> 00:21:17,014
Yeah, he came and went.

560
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:19,469
Wait a minute!

561
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:22,141
You said he was a magician, right?

562
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,850
You don't think he could have used...
It couldn't have been...

563
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,474
Just let's go...

564
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:30,008
Night, night.

565
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:36,726
