1
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,677
Come in.

2
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:15,057
I've been waiting for you.

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,727
Hi, I just...

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,812
Oh, my God!
Monica!

5
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,481
Oh, my God!

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,608
I'm sorry! I was...

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,234
I was taking a nap.

8
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:31,115
Since when do you
take naps in that position?

9
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:35,119
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.
Please tell me.

10
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,955
Yes, I was.
A guy.

11
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,124
From work.

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:44,044
I'm seeing a guy from work!

13
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:50,383
That cute waiter guy that looks like
a non-threatening Ray Liotta?

14
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,094
That one!

15
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,973
Give me a second.
I'm just going to grab a jacket.

16
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:01,687
When I get back,
I want every little detail.

17
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,566
Maybe that's him.

18
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,280
It's just Joey and Ross.

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,906
Why aren't you at the movie?

20
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,493
Ross was so loud, they threw us out.

21
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:21,665
I had to talk loud
because the movie was loud!

22
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,002
- He's talking to London.
- Did he get in touch with Emily?

23
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:31,133
No, not yet. He's hoping that someone
will help him get in touch with her.

24
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:37,639
I don't care if I said some
other girl's name, you prissy old twit!

25
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,810
Way to suck up to the family!

26
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:54,281
I'm so glad you're all here. My office
finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!

27
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,536
The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS

28
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,252
No, no! Vomit tux!

29
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,546
Don't worry,
I had it dry-cleaned.

30
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,047
Vomit tux?

31
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,216
Who vomited on...

32
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,427
You know what?
What you up to, Joe?

33
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,347
They're doing
this telethon thing on TV.

34
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,058
And my agent
got me a job as cohost!

35
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,768
That's great!

36
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,939
A little good deed for PBS,
plus some TV exposure.

37
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,276
That's the kind of math
Joey likes to do.

38
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,654
Oh, PBS!

39
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:20,200
- What's wrong with PBS?
- What's right with them?

40
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,910
Why don't you like PBS?

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,833
Right after my Mom killed herself,
I was in a bad place, personally.

42
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,421
I thought I'd write
to "Sesame Street".

43
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,632
Because they were nice
when I was a little kid.

44
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,510
No one ever wrote back.

45
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,138
A lot of those muppets
don't have thumbs.

46
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,768
All I got was a lousy keychain, and
by that time, I was living in a box.

47
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,605
I didn't have keys!

48
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,106
I'm sorry, Pheebs.

49
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,734
I wanted to do a good deed,
like you did with the babies.

50
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:59,156
This isn't a good deed. You just
want to get on TV. This is selfish.

51
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,368
What about you having
those babies for your brother?

52
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:06,747
That's selfish!

53
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,874
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,294
It was a nice thing,
but it made you feel good, right?

55
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,754
Yeah, so?

56
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,673
It made you feel good
so that makes it selfish.

57
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,302
Look, there's no
unselfish good deeds. Sorry.

58
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:24,264
Yes, there are totally
good deeds that are selfless!

59
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,308
May I ask for one example?

60
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,394
Yeah, it's...
You know, there's...

61
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,940
No, you may not!

62
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,275
Because all people are selfish.

63
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,445
Are you calling me selfish?

64
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,573
Are you calling you people?

65
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,537
Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs,
but selfless good deeds don't exist.

66
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,249
You know the deal
on Santa Claus?

67
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:57,172
I'll find a selfless good deed.
I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!

68
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,555
Oh, my God! It's Emily!

69
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,350
It's Emily, everyone!

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,939
I'm only ringing to say
stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.

71
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,026
You can hang up, but I'll keep calling
everyone in England...

72
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:22,406
...if that's what it takes
to get you to talk to me.

73
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,866
Really? About what?

74
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,952
Look, you're my wife.
We're married.

75
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,704
You know, I love you.

76
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,666
<i>I really miss you.</i>

77
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,626
I miss you too.

78
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,796
<i>At least, I think I do.</i>

79
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,382
She's talking.

80
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,972
When you said "the deal with Santa",
you meant...?

81
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,682
That he doesn't exist.

82
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,726
Right.

83
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,985
Chandler, have you heard
about Monica's secret boyfriend?

84
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,072
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.

85
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:07,868
So, Mon, when are we going
to meet this new, secret waiter man?

86
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,954
I don't think he's
up to meeting everyone yet.

87
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,916
Yeah, I don't think he's up to it.

88
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:19,129
I want to meet this guy
who's the best sex she ever had.

89
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,173
Really?

90
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,260
That's what you heard?
You said that?

91
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,264
I might have.

92
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,058
Why is that funny?

93
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,978
Because I'm very happy for him.

94
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,066
And you!
You lucky dog!

95
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,529
She's willing to work
on the relationship.

96
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,781
That's great!

97
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,491
In London.

98
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,035
She wants me to move to London.

99
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,871
But you live here.

100
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,584
You know that.

101
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,503
What will you do?

102
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,297
I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...

103
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:06,302
...I could convince them
to move to London with Ben.

104
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,305
I'm sure your ex-wife
would be more than happy to move...

105
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,893
...so you can patch things up
with your new wife.

106
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,979
It could happen.

107
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,320
How you doing? Welcome.
Good to see you.

108
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,532
This'll be your phone.

109
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,285
That's great.

110
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,831
But I'm not really
expecting a lot of calls.

111
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,458
No, you answer it
and take pledges.

112
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,752
But I'm the host.

113
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:44,757
Gary Collins is the host.
You'll be answering the phone.

114
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:49,011
You don't seem to understand.
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

115
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:53,223
Well, here's your phone, Doctor.

116
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,310
I can't believe I can't find
a selfless good deed.

117
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,855
You know that old guy
that lives next to me?

118
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,483
I snuck over there and raked up
the leaves on his front stoop.

119
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:09,323
But he caught me, and he
force-fed me cider and cookies.

120
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:13,410
Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!

121
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,122
Maybe Joey's right.
Maybe all good deeds are selfish.

122
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,792
I will find a selfless good deed.
I gave birth to three children...

123
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:26,382
...and I won't let them be raised
in a world where Joey's right!

124
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,968
Can I ask you a cooking question?

125
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,179
If you're cooking on the stove...

126
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,851
...that means your new boyfriend
is better in bed than Richard?

127
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,356
Is he?

128
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:48,112
I think I'll respect the privacy
of my new, secret boyfriend.

129
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,156
Why?

130
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,408
If this guy was me...

131
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,913
...and it's me who'd learned that it was
me who was the best you'd ever had...

132
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,957
...I'd be like this:

133
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:10,926
<i>All right, Emily.</i>

134
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,844
As much as I love you...

135
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,807
...I'm sorry, I can't
move to London without Ben.

136
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,518
I understand that would be difficult.

137
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,480
Would you consider moving here?
You were moving here anyway.

138
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,982
<i>Why can't you just do that?</i>

139
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,695
I don't know. It's just...

140
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,242
But I know that even though I've been
a complete idiot up till now...

141
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,411
...you have to come here.

142
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,373
<i>You have to, so we can</i>
<i>work this out together.</i>

143
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,708
All right.

144
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,544
Did you just say "all right"?

145
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,297
I did.
Now I'm the idiot.

146
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,632
Emily, that is so great!

147
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,009
<i>It'll be great!</i>

148
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,765
We're going to be
like two idiots in love!

149
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,769
There's one thing that
really scares me still.

150
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,356
- Yes, tell me.
<i>- You must understand...</i>

151
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,442
...how humiliating it was
for me at the altar...

152
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,944
...in front of my family and friends.

153
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,989
I know. I am so sorry.

154
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,076
And then, after deciding
to forgive you...

155
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:21,997
...seeing you at the airport,
catching our plane with her.

156
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:26,293
Again, very sorry.

157
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,671
I mean, I can't be
in the same room as her.

158
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:34,176
It drives me mad thinking of you
being in the same room as her.

159
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:39,514
Emily, there is nothing
between Rachel and me.

160
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,601
<i>I love you.</i>

161
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,603
All right.

162
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:48,732
I'll come to New York,
and we'll try to make this work.

163
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,066
That's so great!

164
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:55,489
As long as you
don't see Rachel anymore.

165
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,040
I asked Emily
if she would come to New York.

166
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,875
And she said yes.

167
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,669
Great!

168
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,632
Only if I promise
never to see Rachel again.

169
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,300
What? You can't...

170
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:16,552
What did you say?

171
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:22,933
I'd think about it. How am I
supposed to make this decision?

172
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,228
I'm actually asking you!

173
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:31,984
Rachel is one of your best friends.

174
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,986
But Emily's his wife!

175
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,030
That's true!

176
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,493
You can't just cut Rachel
out of your life!

177
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,787
That's true!

178
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,832
Thanks for the help.
Problem solved!

179
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,092
When will you be on TV?

180
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,303
There was kind of a mix-up
in my agent's office...

181
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,849
...but I'm still on TV,
and that's good exposure.

182
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,019
You're not on TV.

183
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,566
How about now?

184
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,069
There he is!

185
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,697
<i>Hello, New York!</i>

186
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:22,451
<i>Maybe just put the whole duck in there.</i>
<i>Who cares?</i>

187
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,787
<i>Now I got the legs.</i>

188
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:34,546
How many times have I told you
to never watch the cooking channel?

189
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,842
I need that broiling pan
that Joey borrowed.

190
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,677
That was yours?

191
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:45,474
We used it when the duck
was throwing up caterpillars.

192
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,435
Williams-Sonoma,
fall catalog, page 27.

193
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,813
Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.

194
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,568
Joey's at the telethon
for the rest of the day.

195
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,653
We have the place to ourselves.

196
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,322
Yeah, so?

197
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:06,411
Maybe you'd want to book some time
with "the best you've ever had".

198
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,581
You know what, champ?

199
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,290
I think I'll pass.

200
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,918
Why?

201
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,184
What's your point?

202
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,523
PBS Telethon.

203
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:39,111
I just wanted to let you know
that I found a selfless good deed.

204
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,990
I went down to the park
and I let a bee sting me.

205
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,451
What good is that going to do?

206
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,788
It helps the bee look tough
in front of his bee friends.

207
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,832
The bee is happy,
and I am definitely not.

208
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:58,171
You know, the bee probably
died after he stung you.

209
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,427
Damn it!

210
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,640
Back on in 30 seconds, people!

211
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:17,274
Excuse me,
would you mind switching with me?

212
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,235
No way.
I'm in the shot, man.

213
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,530
- You've been here all day!
- I'm taking pledges.

214
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,783
And we're on three, two...

215
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,994
Welcome back to our fall telethon.

216
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,080
If you've been enjoying
<i>Cirque du Soleil...</i>

217
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:36,252
...and you'd like to see more,
it's very simple.

218
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:39,505
All you have to do
is call in a pledge...

219
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:46,345
...and tell one of our volunteers
what type of programming you...

220
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,893
That's it. I cannot make this decision.
It is too difficult.

221
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:57,856
I leave it entirely
up to the gods of fate.

222
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,442
A Magic 8 Ball?

223
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,278
You can't make this decision
with a toy!

224
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:07,074
It's not a toy.

225
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,451
I don't know what else to do!

226
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,997
I either keep my wife
and lose one of my best friends...

227
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:18,002
...or I get divorced
for the second time before I'm 30.

228
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:21,630
If anyone else has
a better suggestion, let's hear it.

229
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,216
Because I got nothing!
Don't be shy.

230
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:28,261
Any suggestion will do.

231
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:35,352
Okay, then.

232
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,689
Here we go.

233
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,483
Magic 8 Ball...

234
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:46,071
...should I never see Rachel again?

235
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,992
"Ask Again Later."

236
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:55,873
Later is not good enough!

237
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,545
"Ask Again Later."

238
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,921
What the hell?

239
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:06,592
This is broken! It is broken!

240
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,219
Let me see.

241
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,555
Will Chandler have sex tonight?

242
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,559
"Don't Count On It."

243
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,065
Seems like it works to me.

244
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,027
PBS Telethon.

245
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,195
<i>Hi, Joey.</i>

246
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,446
Hey, Pheebs.

247
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,239
I'd like
to make a pledge.

248
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,408
I would like to donate $200.

249
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,868
Two hundred dollars?

250
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,871
You sure?
After what "Sesame Street" did to you?

251
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,582
I'm still mad at them,
but they bring happiness...

252
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:43,837
...to lots of kids
whose moms didn't kill themselves.

253
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:49,134
By supporting them, I'm doing a good
thing, but I'm not happy about it.

254
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,845
So there!
A selfless good deed.

255
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,723
You don't feel good
about donating the money?

256
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:58,894
No, it sucks!
I was saving up to buy a hamster.

257
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,730
A hamster?
Those things are, like, $10.

258
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,524
Not the one I had my eye on.

259
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:08,737
<i>It looks like we have surpassed</i>
<i>last year's pledge total.</i>

260
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,614
<i>Thank you!</i>

261
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:15,786
<i>And the pledge that did it</i>
<i>was taken by one of our volunteers.</i>

262
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:21,792
<i>Oh, boy! And may I say,</i>
<i>one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.</i>

263
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,169
<i>Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!</i>

264
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,462
Oh, look!

265
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,297
Joey's on TV!

266
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:28,758
Isn't that great?

267
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,594
My pledge got Joey on TV!
That makes me feel so...

268
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,639
Oh, no!

269
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,312
Look...

270
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:46,776
...I got carried away before,
but there's something you got to know.

271
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:53,073
If I'm the best, it's only
because you made me the best.

272
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,826
Keep talking.

273
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,744
I was nothing before you.

274
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,873
Call the other girls and ask.

275
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,876
Which wouldn't take long.

276
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:07,421
But when I'm with you,
and we're together...

277
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:11,842
...oh, my God!

278
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,683
Oh, my God!

279
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,272
I understand if you never
want to sleep with me again.

280
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,191
But that'd be wrong.

281
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,152
We're too good.

282
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:34,406
We owe it to sex!

283
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,742
If we owe it!

284
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,623
Oh, my!

285
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,249
When will Joey be home?

286
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:48,670
I was kind of hoping
we could do this without him.

287
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:52,340
No, no, no!
Leave the gloves on.

288
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,051
I cleaned the bathroom.

289
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:58,055
Why don't we lose the gloves.

290
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,728
All right.
Let's show them how it's done.

291
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:09,817
- That wasn't part of it.
- I know.

292
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,958
You ready?
We're going to be late.

293
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,128
- For what?
- For Stella, remember?

294
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:33,716
She's getting her groove back
in 20 minutes.

295
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,968
I totally forgot about that.

296
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:41,724
Can I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily.

297
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,767
Sure, I guess.

298
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:48,104
I hear you don't have to
go to London.

299
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:53,860
It's not that easy. There's still
a lot of relationship stuff.

300
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,154
Like what?

301
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:56,947
Just stuff.

302
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:01,368
You know, kind of what Emily wants.

303
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:05,205
Talk to me.
Maybe I can help.

304
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,584
You can't help.

305
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:15,132
I have to do this
without your help.

306
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:22,305
I know you can do that too.
I'm just saying if you need to talk...

307
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,560
Thanks.

308
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,275
Whatever it is that Emily wants...

309
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,485
...just give it to her.

310
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:38,113
The bottom line is that you love her.

311
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,949
Fix whatever she wants fixed.

312
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,161
Just do it.

313
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:50,125
You're going to have to try.
You'll hate yourself if you don't.

314
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:55,214
Come on, answer it!

315
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,844
Hi, sweetie.

316
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,470
Good.

317
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,267
Yes, I've been thinking...

318
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:12,982
...about that thing
you wanted me to do.

319
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,567
I can do it.

320
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:20,489
Will you come to New York?

321
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:05,117
- Never done that before.
- Nope.
