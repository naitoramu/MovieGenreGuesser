1
00:00:00,498 --> 00:00:02,680
All right, let's get started. Um...

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,578
Oh, first off,

3
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:05,671
we're supposed to be 
pushing cardstock this week

4
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:09,171
so... let's push cardstock this week.

5
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:12,186
Uh, also? what is this?

6
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:13,712
Tape recorder.

7
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:15,384
For what?

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,552
For recording.

9
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:18,719
Michael is on vacation,

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,244
and he has asked me 
to record all meetings

11
00:00:20,244 --> 00:00:21,883
and to type up the transcripts.

12
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:22,996
Okay

13
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:25,105
Karen, any news 
from that warehouse?

14
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:27,721
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday 
with six-month commitment.

15
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:29,176
Oh my god, Dwight, 
what are you doing?

16
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:29,792
What?

17
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,629
You're not allowed 
to take off your pants

18
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,094
in the middle of the office.

19
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:34,148
I'm not...

20
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:35,298
Dwight, you know what? 
Just back off,

21
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:36,601
Okay. It's making me 
uncomfortable.

22
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,575
This is sexual 
harassment, by the way.

23
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:40,845
Oh my god. 
He's got a knife!

24
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:42,032
I do not have a knife.

25
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:43,430
No, let the record show

26
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,692
that Dwight K. Schrute is 
now completely nude

27
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:48,700
and is holding a plastic knife 
to Stanley's neck.

28
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,413
Let the record show 
that Jim Halpert is a liar!

29
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:53,482
Dwight Schrute is now 
wearing a baby's bonnet.

30
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:54,216
I am not!

31
00:00:54,216 --> 00:00:55,291
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in!

32
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,926
Dwight, get his autograph 
for Michael, quickly!

33
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:59,004
Jim Carrey did not 
just walk in. Okay?

34
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:00,369
Dwight, what is that 
on your stomach?

35
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:03,416
- Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
- Oh my god, Karen, you're right.

36
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,927
- That is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
- You can't see my stomach...

37
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:09,604
I am now chopping off Phyllis' 
head with a chainsaw!

38
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:45,287

40
00:01:56,355 --> 00:01:57,822
Hey mon!

41
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:02,041
Hey, you have 
a bunch of messages.

42
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,381
And, that's nice.

43
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,398
Hannah quit while you're gone.

44
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:07,764
I guess she'd memo to file 
some complaints she had

45
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:09,148
about being a working mother.

46
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:11,005
And- so, you might also 
have to be deposed.

47
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:14,331
- Relax 
- Okay

48
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:17,032
- Relax. Okay, I'll get to all of that later. 
- It's kinda serious.

49
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:19,453
Aren't you going to ask me 
how Jamaica was?

50
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,221
Say it. Ask me.

51
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,426
- How was Jamaica
- It was so good!

52
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:27,426
Hey Mon!

53
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:29,256
At Sandals, Jamaica,

54
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:30,960
when somebody says 
"hey mon"

55
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,318
Everybody says 
"hey mon" back.

56
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:35,075
Oh, Michael, 
I'm glad you're here.

57
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:36,921
Stanley, you know what?

58
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:38,600
It is really good to see you, too.

59
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,249
My bonus check was 
$100 less than you promised.

60
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:43,759
Okay, well, payroll is 
in charge of all of that.

61
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,781
They said I should talk to you.

62
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:46,724
Well, I am just getting settled in,

63
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:47,506
so I am gonna...

64
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:49,405
I am not doing a lick more work

65
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,055
until I get my full bonus check.

66
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:54,233
You are not as much fun as 
your Jamaican brothers.

67
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:56,024
Mon.

68
00:02:58,401 --> 00:02:59,916
Don't you wanna talk about it?

69
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:00,807
Nope.

70
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,210
I still haven't found 
an apartment yet.

71
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,066
I'm living in a hotel.

72
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,913
Yesterday I saw a "For Rent" sign, 
down street from Jim's

73
00:03:10,913 --> 00:03:13,486
And he said he didn't think 
it would be such a good idea.

74
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,449
He said it would be like 
we were living together.

75
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,532
In different houses.

76
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,615
Two blocks away.

77
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:22,504
"Feelin' hot, hot, hot!"

78
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:26,164
"Feelin' hot, hot, hot!"

79
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:30,158
"Feelin' hot, hot, hot!"

80
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:33,781
"Feelin' hot, hot, hot!"

81
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,170
That's all I know so far,

82
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,407
but I'm gonna keep practicing.

83
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:37,039
It's good.

84
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,019
You know, I had never been 
out of the country

85
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,125
before now.

86
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:43,418
<i>Got to see how Jamaicans live.

87
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:44,657
It is great,

88
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,178
you know? They just relax.

89
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:47,269
They party all the time.

90
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:49,313
It's kind of 
an impoverished country.

91
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,017
Yeah. Gosh... great.

92
00:03:52,017 --> 00:03:53,640
You know what? Pam,

93
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:54,595
Make your note.

94
00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:58,163
I want us all to start 
having pina coladas

95
00:03:58,248 --> 00:03:59,460
every day at three.

96
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:00,747
We can't today.

97
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:01,881
We're doing inventory.

98
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:03,411
Inventory was 
at the end of December.

99
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:05,551
We couldn't do without you,
so we postponed.

100
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:09,033
I specifically went on vacation, 
so I would miss it.

101
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,143
Inventory is boring.

102
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:13,303
In the islands, 
they don't make you do stuff

103
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:14,717
like taking care of inventory.

104
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:18,032
Why do you think so many 
businesses moved to the Caymans?

105
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,683
Tonight, we are going to have 
an inventory luau.

106
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:23,736
I want to bring back a little slice

107
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:27,105
of paradise to the Dunder-Mifflin 
warehouse inventories.

108
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:29,655
So, party planning committee.
Get on it.

109
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,109
By end of the day?

110
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:32,025
That's impossible.

111
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:34,901
The Jamaicans don't have 
a word for "impossible"

112
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,890
Yep, It' English. 
It's impossible.

113
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,563
Michael, there is no way 
that we can do it in time.

114
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:40,675
How hard is a luau.

115
00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:42,502
All you need are some grass skirts,

116
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:43,948
pineapple, poi,

117
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:46,438
tiki torches, sucking pig,

118
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:47,658
some fire dancers.

119
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:51,786
It's all you need.

120
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:52,680
Come on in.

121
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,322
Settle in.

122
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,884
Settling...

123
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:01,086
Settling...

124
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:02,277
And... settled.

125
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:03,674
Good. There is something

126
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:05,698
I would like to show, everybody.

127
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:06,776
See this sign?

128
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:09,703
No shirt, no shoes, 
no problem.

129
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:11,520
This is an attitude

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,680
I would like all of you 
to have right here.

131
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,254
So what, if we have to say 
like doing inventory

132
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:18,589
No, problem!

133
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:21,605
Oh my god, is that Jan?

134
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:22,447
What? Where?

135
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:23,481
On the left.

136
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:27,647
No, that's a German woman named...

137
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:29,267
Urkel Grue.

138
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,235
Jan told me to play it cool

139
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:32,964
and not tell anybody

140
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:34,854
because it could get us 
both in trouble.

141
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,826
So officially,

142
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:39,353
I did not see her.

143
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:43,273
But I did see Jan there.

144
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:45,099
In our room.

145
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:47,854
At night.

146
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:50,846
And in the morning.

147
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,182
And that's all I'm gonna say.

148
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,177
Sex.

149
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:56,838
Sex.

150
00:05:58,361 --> 00:05:59,119
We had sex.

151
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,382
I had sex with her.

152
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:06,421
I had sex with Jan.

153
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:09,029
Hey dude. 
Just got from Jamaica.

154
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:11,576
Big whoop. 
I was in Hotlanta.

155
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:13,537
That whole town is whack.

156
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:14,770
Yea, that sounds amazing.

157
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,793
But you know what?

158
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:19,380
The lady, Jan Levinson 
wanted go to Montego bay.

159
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,277
You took the ice cream?

160
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:23,185
I don't buy it.

161
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:26,469
Well, I'm looking at a photo, 
right now.

162
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,791
And, I'm telling you, 
it could be a Maxim.

163
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,548
They wouldn't give you 
a subscription to Maxim.

164
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:34,079
- Oh, no?
- No.

165
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,631
Okay, well...

166
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,109
Check this out.

167
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:44,742
I'm sending you some e-mail.

168
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:46,920
You got it?

169
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,079
What a- No. I got nothing.

170
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:52,485
Check it again. 
It'll refresh.

171
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:54,642
Yeah, Mike, still nothing.

172
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:55,821
Okay, wait a second,

173
00:06:55,821 --> 00:07:01,188
I sent it to you at 
Packer@Dunder-Mifflin.com

174
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:05,031
Packaging@Dunder-Mifflin.com

175
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:10,335
Wait, I just got it from 
somebody else.

176
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:15,103
Wow! This is god damn!

177
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:17,524
I don't like 
you've had this picture.

178
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:28,373
Darryl?

179
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:32,218
Hey. Hi, where is Darryl?

180
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:33,674
He's in the office.

181
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:38,132
Hey, man. How's it going?

182
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:39,294
Alright, what's up, Mike?

183
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:41,218
Yeah, it's great. 
Okay- um-

184
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:43,853
So, did you get 
any e-mail from me?

185
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:45,297
- Yeah 
- Okay

186
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:48,554
Well, that was supposed 
to go to Packer,

187
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:49,807
not "packaging."

188
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:54,483
Did you already forward it 
to a whole bunch of people?

189
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,987
- Un-huh
- Okay

190
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:58,378
Um- well,

191
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,158
did you get the second 
email that I sent,

192
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,617
explaining that the first 
email was a mistake

193
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:03,718
and that you should delete it?

194
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:04,566
Yep.

195
00:08:04,753 --> 00:08:07,085
And you sent that out to everyone?

196
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,849
Mike, I'm very busy down here.

197
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:12,101
Yikes.

198
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:14,200
Already sent it to you, my friend

199
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,096
Fantastic

200
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:16,196
Boring.

201
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,919
Call me if she rolls over.

202
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:21,960
Hey

203
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:24,606
You okay?

204
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:25,442
Yeah

205
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,578
You sure?

206
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:32,712
Yeah

207
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:33,728
Yes.

208
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:42,337
Um- just- it's like- 
it's stupid fight with Karen.

209
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:48,117
You want to talk about it?

210
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:50,945
Really?

211
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,867
I have a special 
assignment for you.

212
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:58,494
Who's the target?

213
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:03,505
A sensitive email has been 
released to the office.

214
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:04,691
It contains a file...

215
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:07,068
A picture...

216
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:11,025
the filename is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."

217
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:11,673
What's it of?

218
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:12,945
Not important.

219
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:14,368
Unless you're willing to 
tell me everything,

220
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:15,993
- I cannot accept this assignment.
- Okay, forget it.

221
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:17,383
Okay, I accept it.

222
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:18,154
So, I don't know,

223
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:20,795
I just feel we've been 
dating a month, right?

224
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:22,335
Same street?

225
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:24,640
I think that might be 
a little close, a little bit much.

226
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:25,442
Hmm.

227
00:09:27,815 --> 00:09:29,190
"Hmm," what?

228
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:33,672
How far away does she live now, 
like ten minutes?

229
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:37,166
Yeah, I guess.

230
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:41,127
Honestly, I think 
you should go easy on her.

231
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:44,726
No, I didn't mind helping 
Jim with his problem.

232
00:09:44,873 --> 00:09:46,545
That's what friends do.

233
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:50,432
I... help Phyllis all the time.

234
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:54,015
Just yesterday I untangled 
a piece of tape from her hair.

235
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:56,964
So, yeah.

236
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,169
Hey. Thanks, a lot.

237
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:07,296
Oh, don't worry about it.

238
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,053
I mean, it's better than listening to 
Michael play a conch shell,

239
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,590
which is what I was doing.

240
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,885
Oh, also?

241
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,868
Michael went to 
Jamaica with Jan...

242
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:23,060
Yeah, how have we not 
talked about this already?

243
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,639
I mean, 
what happened there?

244
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,019
Kidnapping?

245
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,796
- Hey, I need to talk to you.
- Not now.

246
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,658
Not ever.

247
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:32,086
<i>It's about you and Jan.

248
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:33,920
Oh, none of your business.

249
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:37,393
But so the truth is- um-

250
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:38,475
It seems from that photo

251
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:40,772
that you two have been 
intimate relationship

252
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,450
That photo was 
my personal property

253
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,565
And if you are  telling me that

254
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:45,737
you want my computer 
to steal that photo,

255
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:47,201
And I'm going to call the cops.

256
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,332
I have nine different people 
emailed me that photo,

257
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:51,717
including my ex-wife.

258
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,238
We wanna talk, you know

259
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,195
Well, this is probably the ice-breaker you need

260
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:57,666
You know, 
for your own protection,

261
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,754
you should disclose 
the relationship to HR.

262
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:02,332
I bet you'd love all of details.

263
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:04,805
Wouldn't you, 
Skeevy little perv.

264
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:07,269
All right, if you are having 
a relationship with your superior,

265
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,712
you must disclose it.

266
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:10,503
No, no, no. 
I am not dating Jan.

267
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,258
She was very clear about that.

268
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,244
Just two like souls 
having a romantic time

269
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:17,868
in the most romantic 
place on earth.

270
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:20,764
Got enough? Weirdo?

271
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:22,926
- Alright. Thank Michael. 
- Okay

272
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:26,235
Hey, we only have three hours, people,
to plan the whole luau

273
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:27,565
You're not helping.

274
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:29,596
What are the ingredients for poi?

275
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,773
I called every grocery stores 
in Scranton,

276
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:33,232
and no one sells whole pigs.

277
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:34,684
Did you try to petting zoo?

278
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:39,665
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.

279
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:41,661
Just a second.

280
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:42,672
Michael,

281
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:44,179
it's Jan on the phone waiting.

282
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,335
Oh, God! No, no, no, no!

283
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:47,622
Hang up. Hang up.

284
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:49,776
Tell her I'm not here! 
Don't. Don't.

285
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,126
I ran out of gas.

286
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,168
I hit a deer!

287
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:54,504
I hit a deer with my car.

288
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:57,727
No, I hit a cat. 
Tell her I hit a cat.

289
00:11:57,727 --> 00:11:58,724
He'll call you back.

290
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,524
Okay. Great.

291
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:03,772
Do you think she bought it?

292
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,958
Okay. Okay.

293
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,043
Michael hit a deer?

294
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:13,728
Michael,

295
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,629
Michael, there's an emergency 
in the warehouse.

296
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:18,014
An accident? Somebody hurt?

297
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:20,717
No, it's nasty photograph.

298
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:23,832
Oh, god. No, no, no.

299
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:35,442
Mike, you are a rock star, man.

300
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:37,688
You are the man!

301
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:38,884
Well done!

302
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,748
Alright, Okay.

303
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:43,120
- That corporate booty 
- He likes to hit it!

304
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:51,965
Hello, hi. Attention everyone.

305
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:55,963
Um- apparently, there is an e-mail 
circulating around,

306
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:58,984
That contains very 
PG-13 rated picture of me.

307
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:00,185
And, a woman.

308
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:01,304
Jan

309
00:13:01,304 --> 00:13:02,382
No, Kevin.

310
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,305
A woman.

311
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:04,483
Maybe, Jan. Maybe...

312
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,425
Urkel Grue.

313
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:06,614
My point is that,

314
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:10,259
If you get it, I would ask you 
to just delete it.

315
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:11,029
sight unseen

316
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,470
Let's be very professional. Alright?

317
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:17,442
"Feeling... feeling hot hot hot."

318
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:20,978
What are you doing out here?

319
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:22,647
I live living, you know.

320
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:26,677
Jan calls, she's coming in here later to talk to you.

321
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,427
Did she say what's about?

322
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:29,937
That's all she said.

323
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:52,459
People in the party, ha-ha-ha!

324
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,056
I think you drop this.

325
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,154
You sure?

326
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:01,413
Definitely.

327
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:05,934
I have disconnected 
the office T1 line.

328
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:08,082
I have ordered that 
that can be taken down.

329
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:10,971
And destroyed all print-outs 
from the bathroom.

330
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:12,108
There are copies in the bathroom?

331
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,419
Oh, well- a lot- of them.

332
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:23,897
I think I owe you one.

333
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:24,936
Sorry?

334
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,113
For taking sense into to Halpert.

335
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:30,380
The Day's Inn room 228 
was starting to get really depressing.

336
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,136
Yeah, I know. 
Don't worry about it.

337
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:34,166
I mean, he was being ridiculous.

338
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,244
Yeah.

339
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:36,830
But thanks.

340
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,640
Seriously.

341
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,436
Sure.

342
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:48,462
Oh, yes! 
What did I tell you!

343
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:49,969
I knew he turned it off!

344
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:51,482
<i>You see that?

345
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:54,606
This is the greatest time 
of my life!

346
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,629
Who did this to you?

347
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:08,681
Where is he?

348
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,203
What?

349
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:14,545
No... it's not... 
it's nothing.

350
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:26,463
It's hot in here.

351
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:29,261
- Yeah
- Yeah

352
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:39,987
Thanks.

353
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,486
- You don't need to stay here.
- I know.

354
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,746
So you're PMS-ing 
pretty bad, huh?

355
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:32,382
<i>Hello, everyone?

356
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,694
- Hello, Michael? 
- Hello

357
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,010
Hi, Jan.

358
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,292
You look... tan.

359
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:44,328
I was in Scottsdale 
visiting my sister.

360
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:47,201
Yeah? How was it?

361
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,285
Very sunny.

362
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,661
Family is important.

363
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,422
Michael, I would like to 
speak with you.

364
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:56,876
- In your office 
- Okay

365
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,614
Why am I here, Michael?

366
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:37,245
Uh, I...

367
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:37,945
In the last year

368
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:39,483
I've gone through a divorce,

369
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,981
an identity theft,

370
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,734
a husband who would not...

371
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:45,147
communicate.

372
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,051
This is neither here nor there.

373
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:49,563
My psychiatrist thinks that 
I have some self-destructive tendencies

374
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:52,066
and that for once, 
I should indulge them.

375
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:53,415
<i>Are you following me?

376
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:55,696
Uh, uh, yes.

377
00:17:56,056 --> 00:18:01,517
I think I owe it to myself 
to find some kind of happiness.

378
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:04,978
<i>You know, I mean, 
I mean even if it means

379
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:06,988
lowering my expectations, or...

380
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:09,450
or redefining the word itself...

381
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:10,767
Okay, yeah.

382
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:11,705
This is the thing, you know.

383
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:15,644
I am attracted to you.

384
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:17,585
I- I don't know why,

385
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:20,210
but I am.

386
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,420
And I need to follow 
my instincts.

387
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,950
At least that's 
what Dr. Perry thinks.

388
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:28,909
Who's Dr. Perry? I...

389
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:31,362
This is the point, okay?

390
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:32,655
You're wrong for me.

391
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:39,287
- In- in... every way. 
- Well, not...

392
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:43,833
But I still find myself wanting to...

393
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:48,084
be with you.

394
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:55,133
And I, to you, in addition,

395
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:59,255
feel, the same feelings,

396
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,761
that you are, as well.

397
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,720
Good, good.

398
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:17,988
So, um- thanks for coming by.

399
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:25,767
Thank you for taking your time.

400
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,550
Well, thanks for coming over.
I appreciate...

401
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:34,291
Wait 15 minutes,

402
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:36,113
find an excuse,

403
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:37,572
and meet me at your condo.

404
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:42,594
Jan.

405
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:46,988
You complete me.

406
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:53,962
Oh, God.

407
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:00,794
Hey.

408
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:04,900
Remember when we were 
planning our honeymoon?

409
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:07,134
You wanted to go to Hawaii,

410
00:20:07,443 --> 00:20:09,283
and I wanted to go to Mexico.

411
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,839
Yeah.

412
00:20:12,397 --> 00:20:14,614
I was definitely right.

413
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:22,472
Oh brother.

414
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:25,833
What am I gonna do?

415
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:28,079
I'm gonna hang it up at home.

416
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,560
I don't have a lot of art.

417
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,560
