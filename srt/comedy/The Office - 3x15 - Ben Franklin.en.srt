00:00:00,457 --> 00:00:01,290
Hello, son.

2
00:00:01,451 --> 00:00:03,198
If you are watching this,

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:04,520
that means I'm already dead.

4
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:07,100
Life is...

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,010
How do you know 
it's going to be a boy?

6
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,100
How... would you stop 
interrupting, please?

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,432
Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off 
my wall sockets with a metal fork,

8
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,934
and I gave myself the nastiest shock.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,276
And when I came to, 
I had an epiphery.

10
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:25,716
Life is precious.

11
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:28,856
And if I die,

12
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:32,756
I want my... son...

13
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:36,033
to know the dealio.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,356
The dealio of life.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,746
Here're some things 
that I want to teach you.

16
00:00:40,746 --> 00:00:42,260
That your mother 
won't be able to.

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,362
To jump start a car,

18
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:45,454
First, pop the hood.

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,919
then you take these bad boys.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,360
And clip them 
anywhere on the engine.

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,307
Then, you take these...

22
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:56,309
And clip them wherever.

23
00:00:58,871 --> 00:00:59,814
Number eight.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,633
Learn how to take off 
a woman's bra.

25
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,225
We will demonstrate 
on Pam, and...

26
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:05,465
-No, no. 
- Come on

27
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:07,604
You just twist your hands,

28
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:12,042
Until... something breaks.

29
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:14,486
Well, you get the picture.

30
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:15,549
Thanks, Pam.

31
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:18,153
And, remember.

32
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:19,903
No matter what, 
I will always love you.

33
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,144
What if he's a murderer?

34
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:23,498
He's not going to be a murderer.

35
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:24,903
Maybe, that's how you die.

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,116
You know what, Dwight?

37
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:27,662
Do you want to this or no?

38
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,209
- I want to do this.
- Okay.

39
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,413
from the top, ready?

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,369
- Three 
- Action

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
Hello, everyone.

44
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:58,601
As you know,

45
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:01,801
we are six days away 
from Philly's wedding

46
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:05,023
To get your suits 
to the dry cleaners,

47
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:05,998
To get your hair did.

48
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:09,032
And, Karen, um... 
you might want to invest in

49
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:11,373
a dress 
or a skirt of some kind,

50
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:12,909
<i>if you don't 
or already have one.

51
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:15,971
<i>This may be 
Phyllis's only wedding ever.

52
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:18,793
<i>It's my job to ensure 
that none of you look like ragamuffins.

53
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:24,178
So... I am instituting 
<i>Primae Noctis</i>.

54
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:27,074
<i>Primae Noctis.</i>

55
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:28,889
I believe from the movie Braveheart,

56
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,139
and confirmed on Wikipedia,

57
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:34,009
is when the king got to deflower

58
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:40,203
every new bride 
on her wedding night. So...

59
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:42,099
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,675
I had a very different understanding

61
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:46,629
as to what <i>Primae Noctis</i> meant.

62
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:49,561
I'm trying to get everyone 
excited about Philly's wedding.

63
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:52,970
Because I want her to get people 
excited about my wedding

64
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:54,579
...when the time comes

65
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:55,947
...which won't be hard

66
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,348
Because it's going to be awesome,

67
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:58,547
a lot better than hers.

68
00:02:58,547 --> 00:02:59,100
That's for sure.

69
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,511
It will probably be on a boat.

70
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,072
Whazzup, spinstas?

71
00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:03,813
Nothing.

72
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:05,664
You know, 
this is a luncheon shower.

73
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:06,909
Girls only.

74
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,005
No problem.

75
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:11,499
The guys are having a little 
Shindig in the room,

76
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:12,329
in the warehouse

77
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,023
From 2:30 to 3:15

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
And, this is the only time 
that Bob is available.

79
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:18,818
Sort of a guy's night out.

80
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:20,711
A G-N-O, if you will.

81
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,790
A gno.

82
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:24,855
Actually, it's more of 
a guy's afternoon in.

83
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,263
A G-A-I. A gai.

84
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,401
Not. Not... it's, uh... not gay.

85
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:32,591
It's... just...

86
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:36,134
it's a bridal shower for guys.

87
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:36,995
A guy shower.

88
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,070
An hour-long shower with guys.

89
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:42,964
Shit

90
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:51,989
<i>I guess, Jim and I have had 
a little bit of rough patch

91
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:53,000
<i>for the past couple of weeks.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,360
But, we had some really good talks.

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,284
And, actually now 
I think that were better than ever.

94
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:03,880
Karen and I 
had a long talk last night.

95
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,872
And, the night before that,

96
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:13,475
And... every night... 
for the last five nights

97
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,768
<i>Something's up with 
Jim and Karen.

98
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:30,652
<i>Not that I've been eavesdropping.

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,668
<i>It's not really 
any of my business.

100
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:37,988
But... I've gotten pretty good at 
reading the back of Jim's neck.

101
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:40,422
Halpert!

102
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:43,085
Tall, queer, 
handsome as ever.

103
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:45,625
Everybody, it's me, Jim.

104
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:49,495
Hello, Hello.

105
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:51,243
Todd Packer.

106
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:52,538
Karen Filippelli.

107
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:53,481
Jim's girlfriend.

108
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:55,857
Shut up! Shut!

109
00:04:55,857 --> 00:04:56,913
That's rude

110
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,996
Either this chick is dude

111
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:01,477
or Halpert got scared straight!

112
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:03,765
<i>Yes! Yes!

113
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:06,226
Ohhh... there...

114
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,244
- What happened? What? 
- Oh, god...

115
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:11,298
<i>Somebody help!

116
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:12,695
Help the man!

117
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:14,160
No! no!

118
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,771
<i>I can't believe 
you're not going to be there.

119
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:17,214
<i>It's gonna be good.

120
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:20,429
<i>It's gonna be 
a great bachelor party, man.

121
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:22,920
- I have a full day sales call
- you should get out of them.

122
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,612
It's the only time 
you can do it.

123
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,892
2:30 to 3:15

124
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:30,513
It's going to be great.

125
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:31,817
We are going to be 
doing some darts.

126
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:33,714
There's going to be 
a grilling up some stakes,

127
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:36,028
have some pies,

128
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,723
... going to be very delicious

129
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:41,139
and what kind of stripper 
did you get?

130
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:44,684
I did not order a stripper.

131
00:05:44,684 --> 00:05:46,372
You didn't order a stripper.

132
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:48,579
Have you ever been to 
a bachelor party?

133
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,619
Not personally. No.

134
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,576
Mike, okay.

135
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:00,634
A stripper is ¡®Bachelor Party 101'

136
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,294
If you don't order a stripper,

137
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:03,171
your party is going to suck.

138
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,313
I can't get a stripper here.

139
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,199
Sexual harassment.

140
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:09,990
Just... Get one for the girls too.

141
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:10,917
That evens it out.

142
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,302
You know, separate but equal.

143
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:14,642
So that's what that means.

144
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:16,302
Okay everybody.

145
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:17,138
slight change of plans

146
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:19,360
We are still going to be having two parties

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,740
But each is going to get 
a little extra dose of naugh-tay.

148
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:25,385
All right.

149
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,262
Okay, coed naked stripper 
in this office. For realsies.

150
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:32,604
Under no circumstance

151
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:34,925
should a man strip off 
his clothes in this office.

152
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,889
Shut up! Angela!

153
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,926
- Hey 
- Hey

154
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,541
Everything okay?

155
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:54,271
Oh, yeah. Why?

156
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:56,888
Well, you seem a little tired.

157
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,974
Oh, yeah. Well, I guess 
there's been a couple of late nights.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,268
Karen and I have been up talking.

159
00:07:09,898 --> 00:07:10,943
You should get more sleep.

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,766
Yeah, I know I should.

161
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,862
Never underestimate 
the power of a good night's sleep.

162
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,964
No, I'm sure you're right.

163
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:19,325
When I get eight hours,

164
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:21,336
compared to like, six hours...

165
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,005
it's like, big difference.

166
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:24,170
Really?

167
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,536
Oh yeah.

168
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,919
Gotta get your REM cycle,

169
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:32,161
going with the whole... sleeping...

170
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:34,346
better than not.

171
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:37,389
Good advice, Beesly.

172
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:39,540
Thanks. See you out there?

173
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,236
Yeah.

174
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,379
Don't fall asleep at your desk.

175
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:48,307
Okay, we are off.

176
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:50,512
Ryan and I are going 
to get some supplies.

177
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:56,496
And, I need you to handle 
hiring the strippers.

178
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:57,882
Absolutely not.

179
00:07:57,882 --> 00:07:58,660
On it!

180
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,643
Go get on it, 
and make it happen.

181
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,955
Ruddy chicks, thick calves,

182
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:04,877
no tats, no moles...

183
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:08,667
No tats. No, tats! 
Of course, I ...

184
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,762
Stop. That's disgusting.

185
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,310
Leave me alone 
and get the male stripper.

186
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,309
I knew you would, Nancy.

187
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:15,122
Sally.

188
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,931
No preference.

189
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:18,806
What do you think?

190
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:19,833
Redhead or blondhead?

191
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,898
Blond.

192
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:23,730
Nice.

193
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:27,299
Do you have 
any blond women?

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,387
He hasn't even 
said a word, yet.

195
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,484
Just giggling.

196
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,925
Yes ?

197
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:50,979
<i>You okay?</i>

198
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,052
I'm... I'm in the sex shop

199
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,167
Ah, gotcha.

200
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,801
<i>Okay, so they had Albert Einstein,

201
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:59,075
<i>Ben Franklin, 
or Sponge Bob SquarePants.

202
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,394
SquarePants?

203
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,475
<i>Yup. Sponge Bob SquarePants

204
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:04,568
And, you think that'd be sexy?

205
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,545
Michael referred me to a male strip club,

206
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:08,929
called Banana Slings.

207
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,469
Instead, I called 
the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.

208
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,468
Oh, hold the door, please.

209
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,640
Thank you.

210
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,157
- Oh, hello 
- Hello

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,814
You wearing a thong?

212
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,678
What?

213
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,400
Sparking cider is very good.

214
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,257
I think that's champagne.

215
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,068
Hello, ladies.

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,004
Who here is the history buff?

217
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,550
I.

218
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,962
Who's the fan of buff naked?

219
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,052
Without further ado

220
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,764
the one,

221
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,208
the only,

222
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:47,919
the sexy.

223
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,716
Mr. Benjamin Franklin.

224
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,011
Thank you for 
the introduction, Mr. Scott.

225
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:54,833
And, good afternoon,

226
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,118
fine gentlewomen 
of Dunder-Mifflin.

227
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:01,182
Half-pants.

228
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:02,241
Right, Mr. Franklin?

229
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,200
Knickers in fact, yes.

230
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,796
He says it is knickers.

231
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:07,060
Mr. Franklin,

232
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,201
I would say you were probably 
one of the sexiest presidents ever.

233
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:14,580
Well, actually, 
I never was president.

234
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,083
Yes, but Ben Franklin was.

235
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:22,416
Well, I'm here to teach you

236
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,009
a little bit about my life,

237
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,168
and, the era of founding fathers.

238
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:31,376
and, when they came 
over on the mayflowers.

239
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,061
Wait, this is the entertainment?

240
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,412
Yeah, all right.

241
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:41,728
So, I want you to give him 
your undivided attention.

242
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:42,835
And, Mr. Franklin,

243
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:45,152
if anyone of these ladies misbehave,

244
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,466
I'd give you a permission 
to spank them.

245
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,214
Especially, that one.

246
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,366
Have you ever seen 
a stripper before?

247
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:56,294
Yes.

248
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,083
Jennifer Garner 
portrayed one on Alias.

249
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:00,781
It was one of 
her many aliases.

250
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:02,859
Yeah. Me neither.

251
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:03,914
- Hey 
- Hi

252
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:04,847
I'm Elizabeth.

253
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,573
I'm the dancer 
that you guys requested

254
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:11,403
Okay, I specifically 
ordered a stripper.

255
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,026
I'm the stripper.

256
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,675
Oh, okay, good.

257
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:17,092
Well, I'll keep your 
'Please identify yourself', or such.

258
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,269
Oh, god.

259
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,517
"Is she hot?¡±

260
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,986
Text back, ¡°Kind of¡±

261
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,437
It was warm June evening in 1752,

262
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:36,000
the night of my faithful kite flight.

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,060
Mr. Franklin,

264
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:38,363
do you have a girlfriend?

265
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,527
I have a lovely wife, Deborah.

266
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,856
But don't you also have 
girlfriends in Paris?

267
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,426
Like, a lot of them?

268
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:50,154
Ah, well, that is a gray area 
of my life. Okay?

269
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:53,486
So, it was a warm June evening...

270
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,213
Look at that.

271
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,207
Nothing like grilling 
in the great outdoors.

272
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,110
Is this the same grill 
you grilled your foot on?

273
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,198
No.

274
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:05,429
Yes.

275
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,161
- Oh gross...
- But I got all the of the foot off of it.

276
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,968
Okay, Ben Franklin.

277
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:14,793
Oh, Ben Franklin tied 
a cherry stem in his mouth!

278
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,079
Well, that is because 
I am a renaissance man.

279
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,973
Ben Franklin?

280
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,470
Do you wear boxers, 
briefs, or pantaloons?

281
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,944
Well, you're very saucy...

282
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,708
Guys, Beef!

283
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:34,307
It's what's for dinner.

284
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:36,828
Who wants some man meat?

285
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:38,793
I do! I want some man meat!

286
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:40,344
Michael, Dwight would 
like your man meat.

287
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,997
Well, then my man meat 
he shall have.

288
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,371
There you go.

289
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,055
- Dee-li-ci-ous-ity
- Of course

290
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,013
So, I guess 
you have the Ben Franklin wig,

291
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:55,100
and a costume,

292
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,208
And you figure 
how can I put those for practical use?

293
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,623
Well, I'd like to think that his dad 
was a Ben Franklin impersonator.

294
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,475
And, he really pressured him into it.

295
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,552
Hey, um, I wanted to talk to you...

296
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,299
I know this is weird 
or whatever, but um...

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,297
Jim told me about you guys.

298
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,007
What do you mean?

299
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,963
Well, that you kissed.

300
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:19,422
And we've talked it through,

301
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:20,868
and it's totally fine.

302
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:21,655
It's not a big deal.

303
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,929
It was just a kiss.

304
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:26,906
Wait, you're not still...

305
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:27,820
interested in him?

306
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,367
Oh, yeah.

307
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,659
Really?

308
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,945
Oh, no! I? I'm...

309
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:36,448
I was confused by your phrasing.

310
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,504
You should definitely 
go out with Jim.

311
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,083
I mean, you're going out with Jim.

312
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,600
I¡®m not going out with Jim.

313
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,028
You're dating him.

314
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,401
Which is awesome because 
you guys are great together.

315
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,425
Okay.

316
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:50,600
And I'm not into Jim. Yeah.

317
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:53,797
So, uh... we're good.

318
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:55,093
Yeah.

319
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:57,465
Sorry.

320
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,944
What are you sorry about?

321
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,174
Um... what?

322
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:04,941
What are you sorry about?

323
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,164
Nothing.

324
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:08,499
I was just thinking of something else.

325
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:12,993
Okay, the game is 'No-limit Deuce-to-Seven Lowball'

326
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:14,739
Once 25/50,

327
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:18,649
nickels are worth 10, dimes 25, 
and quarters 50, nothing wild

328
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,573
I'll go suffle

329
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:21,470
Here we go.

330
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,637
Mike

331
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,284
Ah, gentlemen.

332
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,466
The entertainment is here.

333
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,961
Everybody, I'd like to 
introduce you to Elizabeth.

334
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,219
Hi, guys.

335
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,868
I hear there's 
an important meeting here.

336
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,116
I'm not really into strippers.

337
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,347
You know what I find sexy?

338
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:48,451
Pam's art.

339
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:50,191
She's an artist.

340
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:51,733
And I appreciate that.

341
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:54,359
It's very moving.

342
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,847
And... sexy.

343
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,573
The art.

344
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,363
Hit it.

345
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:07,052
So, where's the groom?

346
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,257
He is right there.

347
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:11,272
- There he is. 
- Absolutely not

348
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:13,893
That's all you need.

349
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:17,274
Okay, all right. I'll do it.

350
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:19,613
Yeah, let's do it.

351
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:20,700
Let's do this thing.

352
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,096
- Yeah, What am I...
- Sit down, down

353
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,607
Oh, here we go, alright.

354
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,302
Not bad, not bad.

355
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:34,722
You smell nice. Like Tide.

356
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:35,959
Um, What's that?

357
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:38,627
Smell like Tide Detergent.

358
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:41,520
Do you use Tide Detergent?

359
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,604
I have a girlfriend, so...

360
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:50,447
I bet she'd be jealous.

361
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,737
Yeah, she'd probably be.

362
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,700
Yeah, she'd be.

363
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,461
You know what? 
Okay, excuse me.

364
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:58,375
Just... please 
stop it, stop it.

365
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,479
Stop the music. 
This is wrong, this is wrong!

366
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,442
This is wrong.

367
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:04,671
I have a girlfriend,

368
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,682
and, you are engaged.

369
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:09,850
and, I'm sure you have a boyfriend...

370
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,027
in prison or something.

371
00:16:11,027 --> 00:16:13,863
So... let's just clear it out, okay?

372
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:15,456
Shame on you!

373
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,070
Go back to work!

374
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:24,243
Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.

375
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:25,745
When the phone rings, 
answer it.

376
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:27,463
You want me to 
answer the phones,

377
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:29,493
with my clothes on.

378
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,014
We hired you for three hours work,

379
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:33,374
and we are gonna get it.

380
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,020
Oh, I love your poster.

381
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,990
Thank you.

382
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,988
You know, 
I invented electricity.

383
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:57,205
I know.

384
00:16:57,288 --> 00:17:00,476
Well, I'm sensing 
a little electricity here.

385
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,523
Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis?

386
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:05,439
Yes.

387
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,112
But, I don't.

388
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,800
My name is Gordon.

389
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,881
On one hand, 
I want to be honest with Jan,

390
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:14,829
and tell her the truth.

391
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,718
And, on the other hand,

392
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,131
I'm afraid that 
she's gonna just dump me.

393
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:20,284
You know, Michael.

394
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:21,737
I fathered in illegitimate son.

395
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,722
Really?

396
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:25,264
But I've kept all this 
from my wife, Deborah.

397
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:28,457
These things are only serve 
to upset the women.

398
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,674
They are the gentler sex.

399
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:32,996
Wow.

400
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,138
Ben Franklin, you are really 
kind of sleazebag.

401
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,523
Stripper,

402
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:43,455
Can I ask you a question

403
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:44,729
about women?

404
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,997
Um... should I tell my girlfriend 
that you danced up on me?

405
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,984
Secrets, secrets are no fun.

406
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,243
Secrets, secrets hurt someone.

407
00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:03,644
Wow.

408
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:06,634
Thank you.

409
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:11,826
Care for a piece of chocolate?

410
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:12,975
Chocolate!

411
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,487
Where did you acquire it?

412
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,277
That is a delicacy in the Amazon

413
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:19,175
but it has not yet been 
imported to the United States.

414
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,700
- Who is the King of Austria?
- Joseph the Second.

415
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
- Who is the king of Prussia?
- Friedrich Wilhelm the Third.

416
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,600
Who is the king of England?

417
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,338
Why, the tyrant King George, 
of course.

418
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:28,715
I don't care what Jim says.

419
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:31,415
That is not the real Ben Franklin.

420
00:18:31,415 --> 00:18:33,660
I am 99% sure.

421
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:36,881
Michael, I left a meeting.

422
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:38,115
What is so urgent?

423
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:40,714
Are you... are you okay?

424
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,745
Not really.

425
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:45,447
Look, I don't know 
how to say this,

426
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:46,426
so I just will.

427
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:47,698
Okay.

428
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:52,403
I... um... went to a bachelor party.

429
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,066
And, things got little out of hand.

430
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,476
Ah... when? When did...

431
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:01,232
When...last night?

432
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,640
No, today at work.

433
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:04,546
You went to 
a bachelor party at work?

434
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,522
Yes, I kind of arranged it.

435
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,820
Well, I don't even think 
the stripper was that hot.

436
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,535
Do you guys think 
she was hot?

437
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:11,950
Kelly, don't do this.

438
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,000
Do what? 
I just asked a question.

439
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,008
You know what you're doing.

440
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:17,280
Anyway, you know who was
totally flirted with Franklin?

441
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:18,324
Pam.

442
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:20,015
Really?

443
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:21,973
Looks like I hired 
the right guy.

444
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:22,754
I'm glad.

445
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:24,681
And, you are the potential 
Deborah Read?

446
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:27,002
Yeah, right.

447
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,683
God, I need a boyfriend.

448
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,737
Um, you know what, Ryan.

449
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,487
I'm totally ready to be set up with 
one of your business school friends.

450
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:38,631
- Whenever
- Okay

451
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:45,100
Oh my god, I would get so fat 
if I worked here.

452
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,220
Yeah? I lose my appetite 
all the time.

453
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,423
You can stripe, you know.

454
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,186
Thanks.

455
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,567
So you don't want to end 
our relationship?

456
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,126
I'm closer to firing you!

457
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,666
That is so sweet.

458
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,308
You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.

459
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:02,170
Do you know that?

460
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,521
- Thank you
- you are. you are.

461
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:07,346
So you know who turned out 
to be kind of a creep?

462
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,855
Ben Franklin.

463
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,388
And Elizabeth, the stripper?

464
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,059
Gave me great advice.

465
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,377
Which rhymed.

466
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,394
Really makes you wonder

467
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:23,000
how Ben Franklin can become president,

468
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,821
but someone like Elizabeth can't.

469
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,700
Are you near-sighted or far-sighted?

470
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,409
Both

471
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:33,623
That's why I invented the bifocal.



9999
