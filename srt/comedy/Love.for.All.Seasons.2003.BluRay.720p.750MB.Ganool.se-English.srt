1
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:12,665
Calm down, Miss.

2
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:14,962
I want to see him.

3
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:17,265
Where's he?

4
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:19,194
Mr. Hung is on his way.

5
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:20,894
Please calm down.

6
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:22,899
I want him here right away.

7
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:25,165
There she is, Mr. Hung.

8
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,267
Susan

9
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,970
Tiger!

10
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,132
What are you doing?

11
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:35,673
Is this a threat?

12
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,900
No.

13
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:38,634
I'm just hurt!

14
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:39,901
You know I'm called The Heartbreaker.

15
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,771
This was bound to happen.

16
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:43,603
What did you expect?

17
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:46,066
Don't hurt me.

18
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:48,208
Forget it. Where's the negotiator?

19
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:49,902
She's over there.

20
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:53,745
Susan!

21
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:56,142
Tiger...

22
00:01:56,212 --> 00:01:57,269
She talked to the stewardess,

23
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:58,869
and learned you were dating her.

24
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:00,935
I think she's also your girlfriend.

25
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:04,037
What should I do? Who's in charge?

26
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:05,171
Over there.

27
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:09,944
Susan!

28
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:11,213
Tiger...

29
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:13,010
I thinks she's also your girlfriend.

30
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,345
3 people trying to kill themselves.
Where's the fire chief?

31
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,139
There.

32
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:19,308
Tiger.

33
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:21,278
Susan...

34
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:22,107
I think...

35
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,844
You're right. She's also my girlfriend.

36
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:25,009
What should we do?

37
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:30,576
- Tiger...
- Tiger...

38
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:32,342
Quiet!

39
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:33,880
Quiet!

40
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,583
Let me think.

41
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:44,279
Miss.

42
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,623
You seem to be
the only rational girl here.

43
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:50,555
Any advise?

44
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:52,352
Are you hitting on me?

45
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:54,684
Pretty girl, you're smart!

46
00:02:58,526 --> 00:02:59,514
You dated me already.

47
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,058
I did? When?

48
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:02,183
When I was 16.

49
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,090
You dumped me after 7 days.

50
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:05,923
You know how hurt I was?

51
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:07,154
You're...

52
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,489
Susan!

53
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:12,992
Did you take it well?

54
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:13,461
No.

55
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,156
I slashed my wrist and
overdosed on sleeping pills.

56
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:22,358
What are you doing?

57
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:23,489
Getting a tan.

58
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:24,462
Getting a tan?

59
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:26,192
Can't you see what's going on here?

60
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,323
What's your name?

61
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,126
- Susan
- What?

62
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,563
Susan!

63
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:31,528
You...

64
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,089
What's your number?

65
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,296
What kind of sunscreen do you use?

66
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,527
Nivia.

67
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,090
Try Lancome.

68
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:43,198
This place is a mess.

69
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,701
You should come to my house.

70
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:46,562
- I got a tanning bed.
- Where's your place?

71
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:48,399
You can do anything you want there.

72
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:14,339
Hi doc.

73
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:16,204
Still the same?

74
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,440
Can't believe
what those girls did to my body.

75
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,272
I'm over-exhausted.

76
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,571
Nothing to do with them.

77
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:25,476
It's because you party too much.

78
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:26,705
Your body is worn out.

79
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:28,435
You have to help me.

80
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:30,138
I've done everything I can.

81
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:31,611
Try Chinese doctor.

82
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,942
I did. They told me
Western medicine would help.

83
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:36,577
Then we have to try something extreme.

84
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:37,579
How extreme?

85
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:40,342
There are 3 places in this world
that can cure you.

86
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:41,381
Which 3?

87
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,211
One is Shaolin, the other is Wudan.

88
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,647
But they won't help people like you.

89
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,978
Why?

90
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,948
You're guilty of lust.

91
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:50,582
What's the third place?

92
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:53,345
This place was very well respected
in the past.

93
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,646
But today it's lost its influence

94
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:59,346
and forgotten by most people...

95
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:02,019
What's the name?

96
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:03,553
Think!

97
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,984
Omei!

98
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,356
Isn't Omei sect all women?

99
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,018
They're your employees in China.

100
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:30,457
Mr. Hung?

101
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,216
Mr. Hung?

102
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,354
Mr. Hung?

103
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,224
Where's Omei's representative?

104
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:44,152
Mr. Hung?

105
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,224
Get her.

106
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:48,630
Over here.

107
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,588
Tiger Hung is known as
The Heartbreaker.

108
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,462
He has to be good-looking.

109
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:01,056
Don't bother to ask the ugly people.

110
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:02,565
What's your name?

111
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:03,531
May.

112
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:05,533
Which one of you is Mr. Hung?

113
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:07,600
Come!

114
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:09,066
Here!

115
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,362
Wise up!

116
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:46,133
Can't believe we have to walk.

117
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:50,174
How far are we from the top?

118
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,241
Almost there.

119
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,204
No way. Who will it be?

120
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,177
What?

121
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:00,406
Who will carry me?

122
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,604
Hurry.

123
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:08,238
Lower.

124
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:14,413
What's that?

125
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:18,310
Cable car.

126
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:19,312
Where is it going?

127
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:20,680
Top of the mountain.

128
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:22,144
Why aren't we on it?

129
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:24,208
It's expensive. 80 dollars per head.

130
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:25,683
That's 400 dollars for all of us.

131
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:28,117
It's just a few more steps.

132
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,650
A few more steps?

133
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:54,248
Shit! More stairs?

134
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:55,587
This is a mountain.

135
00:07:58,393 --> 00:07:59,484
Shit!

136
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:40,059
Forget it.

137
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,362
Go get your Master.

138
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:42,561
I am the Master.

139
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:44,535
You?

140
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:47,162
I'm the temp.
Something happened here.

141
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:49,670
What? Everyone is dead?

142
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,761
Mr. Hung,
please promise me one thing.

143
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:53,767
Don't hit on my sisters.

144
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,733
We're simple people.

145
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,129
I can get girls anywhere.

146
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:00,434
Why would I come this far to do it?

147
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,470
A promise is a promise.

148
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:08,667
All clear!

149
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:12,238
All clear!

150
00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:21,204
What happened to your face?

151
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:22,142
3rd Sister told me

152
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:25,508
this would keep us safe.

153
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:30,104
Shit! I'm not interested
in mountain people.

154
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,079
So are my men.

155
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:33,375
Of course...

156
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:35,777
Thanks for the assurance.

157
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:38,345
I'll show you your room.

158
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,243
Prepare dinner for him.

159
00:09:40,316 --> 00:09:42,009
Yes.

160
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,708
What's wrong with him?

161
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,580
How can he compare us
to mountain people?

162
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:55,046
The one in yellow shirt is pretty.

163
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:56,415
The one behind the tree

164
00:09:56,486 --> 00:09:58,418
is very cute.

165
00:09:58,486 --> 00:09:59,578
Fourth Sister is the best.

166
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:01,483
Third Sister is better.

167
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:02,383
She's mine.

168
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:05,683
Forget it. Boss already set his eyes
on both of them.

169
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:07,312
Didn't you notice?

170
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:10,014
You can forget about the other girls.

171
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:12,647
Boss will take them all.

172
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:15,489
We won't have a chance.

173
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:21,787
This way.

174
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:24,351
You'll stay here until you're cured.

175
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,021
Shit!

176
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:29,491
Shit!

177
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,389
Enjoy.

178
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,428
Shit!

179
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:45,224
Shit!

180
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,561
Shit!

181
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,189
Shit!

182
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:54,030
Shit!

183
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,427
Like the food?

184
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:56,590
Shit!

185
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,428
Shit!

186
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,727
What does "shit" mean?

187
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,233
It means Omei is a bunch of crap!

188
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:08,701
Good thing I asked.

189
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,598
It'll improve my English.

190
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:18,659
May.

191
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:22,068
What does "shit" mean?

192
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,537
It means Omei is a bunch of crap.

193
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:25,435
What?

194
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:27,200
May, you've got good temper.

195
00:11:27,274 --> 00:11:30,206
If Big Sister returns, they'll be dead.

196
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:32,204
If Big Sister returns, we'll all be dead.

197
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,074
Keep practicing your sword.

198
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,667
Eat more.

199
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:42,369
Keep practicing.

200
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:48,507
Put your clothes on.

201
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:49,271
Put your clothes on.

202
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:50,140
What's wrong?

203
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,178
Let's go!

204
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,106
We're leaving.

205
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:56,137
What's wrong, boss?

206
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:59,577
This place is a fraud.

207
00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:01,509
I don't want some quack doctor
killing me.

208
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:03,104
The cable car has stopped running.

209
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,239
I don't care. I'm leaving!

210
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:06,213
I got cash. I'll find a way. Let's go!

211
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:11,605
I got money!

212
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:14,446
Start the cable car!

213
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,351
I got money!

214
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:24,785
So what? Leave or I'll let the dogs out!

215
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,810
Let's go, boss.

216
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,484
It's freezing.

217
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,214
No! We'll walk.

218
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:32,379
Who will it be?

219
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:36,044
Who will it be?

220
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,486
Boss!

221
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,783
Hurry.

222
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:48,114
Where are you going?

223
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,316
Boss, it's just one night.

224
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:56,558
At least we have a place to stay.

225
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,387
Omei is a fraud!

226
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,059
Put me down!

227
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:02,825
Boss...

228
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:04,220
Put me down!

229
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,825
Incredible.

230
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:27,192
It's not like they can fly.

231
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,292
Boss.

232
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:44,534
Isn't that amazing?

233
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,132
Let's go back first.

234
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:08,300
We don't see it.

235
00:14:08,376 --> 00:14:09,841
There isn't any.

236
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:12,333
But I saw it in my dream.

237
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,740
They used wireworks.

238
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,333
They must've took it down already.

239
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:28,302
Let's try her.

240
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,810
Easy on the lady.

241
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,442
Don't hurt her face.

242
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:44,229
Sisters!

243
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:46,829
Sisters!

244
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:52,293
Why are you here?

245
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:56,595
What is it?

246
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,099
They snuck up on me.

247
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:01,691
May!

248
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:06,824
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:15,462
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:21,137
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,130
We're losing the fat one!

252
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:32,236
You two must train harder.

253
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:36,870
- I'm sorry.
- What happened?

254
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,133
What?

255
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:41,500
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:44,339
You should never play around
like this again.

257
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:47,471
Boss, Omei is for real!

258
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,872
Your kidney is fine.

259
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:57,637
No internal injury.

260
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:00,647
Show me your tongue.

261
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,712
What's wrong with you?

262
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:11,215
You're in really bad shape.

263
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,843
You're better off dead.

264
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,481
Are you serious?

265
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:21,275
Heart.

266
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:23,241
Liver.

267
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,683
Spleen.

268
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,344
Lung.

269
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,886
Kidney.

270
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:34,346
This tree can cure me?

271
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:35,649
It has precious herbal essence.

272
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,712
It's over 500 years old.

273
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,220
This tree reminds me of a girl.

274
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,416
She had legs bigger than the tree trunk.

275
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:46,423
Another girl had great legs,

276
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:49,219
but her skin felt like tree bark.

277
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:54,753
Ants!

278
00:17:54,827 --> 00:17:56,157
A big nest!

279
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:57,693
You're in luck!

280
00:17:57,761 --> 00:17:59,819
Omei ants are a great cure!

281
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,759
They're in my pants!

282
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:03,726
They're moving upward.

283
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:05,693
Let them be.

284
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,887
They bit me!

285
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,652
Let them be.

286
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,890
They're in my crotch.

287
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,692
They're healing you. Let them be.

288
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:29,395
That's a lot of needles.
I'm like a hedgehog.

289
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:31,863
More needles give better result.

290
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:36,966
I knew a girl
who had a hedgehog hairstyle.

291
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,400
It made her look like a pig.

292
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:40,762
It was ugly!

293
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,736
But she had a great body.

294
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:45,168
So I made my move.

295
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:47,034
But her face kept getting in the way.

296
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:49,697
When I was with her,
I always had the urge

297
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:52,331
to cover her face with a pillow case.

298
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:56,896
It hurts.

299
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:59,406
The next batch of needles will hurt.

300
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:00,937
Acupuncture shouldn't hurt.

301
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:02,304
Omei style is different.

302
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,637
It'll give faster result.

303
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:08,939
It hurts!

304
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,738
Ouch!

305
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,717
Don't look under Grand Master's skirt!

306
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:52,412
I can't control the urge.

307
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:55,142
I just want to see what's underneath it.

308
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,084
Once when I saw a guy wearing a kilt,

309
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,780
I almost did the same thing.

310
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:01,286
You're really sick.

311
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:02,949
You don't have to cure this disease.

312
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:04,318
What's for today?

313
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,083
I'll teach you Revitalization Exercise.

314
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:08,146
Revitalization?

315
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:09,246
Perfect!

316
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,426
Can't follow?

317
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:44,324
Can't even see it.

318
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:47,127
I know something simpler,
but its 20% less effective.

319
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,154
Better than nothing!

320
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:50,391
Kneel down.

321
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:55,432
Slap yourself.

322
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,190
Slap here.

323
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:58,825
And here.

324
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:01,466
Do I start with the left hand?

325
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:04,361
Doesn't matter, just don't miss your face.

326
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:05,697
When do I stop?

327
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:08,793
Until your face is swollen.

328
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,302
But I'll look ugly.

329
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:12,427
Want to try the harder exercise?

330
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,762
I'll never be able to learn that.

331
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:23,898
Grand Mater must've been a pretty girl.

332
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:27,065
She looks like a 36G.

333
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,102
Hit your mouth.

334
00:21:29,175 --> 00:21:31,039
It's equally effective.

335
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:33,166
How will I talk?

336
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:34,868
You'll find ways.

337
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:42,777
I had this really hot girlfriend.

338
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,334
She had a 42G body,

339
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,105
but got short legs.

340
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:49,009
The other one was just the opposite.

341
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,272
She had long legs,

342
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:52,073
but small breast.

343
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:55,272
Would be great to see her again.

344
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:58,706
Forgot to slap myself.

345
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:00,145
A few more slaps.

346
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,973
It's painful.

347
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:07,073
It hurts!

348
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,048
Have you found it?

349
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:12,280
I can't pee...

350
00:22:13,718 --> 00:22:15,377
Found it.

351
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,282
This will release your bladder
right away.

352
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:29,443
I remember this other girlfriend.

353
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:32,949
- How fast did you say?
- Right away.

354
00:22:33,023 --> 00:22:35,455
You can't out-run it.

355
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:45,247
Don't be embarrassed, you're ill.

356
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:49,256
This is humiliating.

357
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,688
I remember this other girlfriend.

358
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:56,227
She would wet herself when she cries.

359
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:57,283
Am I...

360
00:22:57,894 --> 00:22:59,326
I found another cure!

361
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:00,486
What is it?

362
00:23:00,728 --> 00:23:01,785
It cures constipation.

363
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:28,892
This day had to come.

364
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:30,059
Big Sister has lost it.

365
00:23:30,135 --> 00:23:31,396
There's only 23 of us,

366
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:33,265
but she left 29 hand prints.

367
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:35,393
Ones on the right are us.

368
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,232
Ones on the left are our patients.

369
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:41,962
And the one on top?

370
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:43,402
That's Big Sister herself.

371
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,336
She plans to die together with us.

372
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:49,367
How about the footprint?

373
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:52,432
That's how she flew up there.

374
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:56,098
Big Sister is wearing Nike.

375
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,899
The other one is Adidas.

376
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:04,169
She must've found them at junk yard.

377
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,971
Big Sister is down in luck.

378
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:08,966
Why would a Omei Master

379
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:10,977
Iose her mind over a man?

380
00:24:11,078 --> 00:24:14,408
Master, emergency!

381
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:16,468
Emergency!

382
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,004
I'm in pain.

383
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:26,411
Am I poisoned?

384
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:28,380
Go get their luggage.

385
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:31,506
What for?

386
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:34,011
Omei is in trouble.
No time to play with you.

387
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,447
I'll cure you now.

388
00:24:57,754 --> 00:24:58,913
Boss!

389
00:24:59,055 --> 00:25:00,022
Omei Needle!

390
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:03,113
Stay back!

391
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:16,892
Boss.

392
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:17,755
How do you feel?

393
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,052
One dosage a day. You'll be fine.

394
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:21,785
Go now.

395
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:23,984
Can I ask you something?

396
00:25:25,027 --> 00:25:25,925
Sure.

397
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:28,026
What were you doing to me before?

398
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:28,890
Nothing.

399
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,929
They were just pranks

400
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,791
to make you pay for
what you did to women.

401
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:40,989
Screw you!

402
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:43,327
Forget it.

403
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:44,887
She saved your life.

404
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:46,489
See how you've recovered?

405
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,297
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

406
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:57,492
How should I cook the medicine?

407
00:25:57,735 --> 00:25:59,031
You have to tell me!

408
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:01,261
Use 3 cups of water.

409
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:03,499
How long do I cook it?

410
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:06,794
Until there's one cup of water left!

411
00:26:06,937 --> 00:26:07,960
Thanks!

412
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:08,964
Don't mention it.

413
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:32,731
It's windy.

414
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,901
Let's go in.

415
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,476
Big Sister is here. Attack formation!

416
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:02,538
It's raining. Let's go in.

417
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:03,806
Don't!

418
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,252
Big Sister...

419
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,052
Don't call me that.

420
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,455
When Grand Master expelled me
from Omei,

421
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:45,185
I took an oath

422
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:48,090
to die together with Omei.

423
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,989
Today is Master's funeral anniversary.

424
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,855
We'll all die together.

425
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:52,993
I'm kill myself first.

426
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,425
Then I'll kill you one by one.

427
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,022
Don't, Big Sister.

428
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:03,029
Scared? When Master expelled me...

429
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:04,393
She never expelled you.

430
00:28:04,464 --> 00:28:06,896
It was you who expelled her.

431
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,857
Why did I do that?

432
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:11,159
Master gave up her position.

433
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,289
You became the new Master.

434
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:14,854
Me?

435
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:17,263
You still are today.

436
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,799
I'm just the temp.

437
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,459
Why did I expel the Master?

438
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,001
You fell in love with a womanizer.

439
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:27,466
He broke your heart.

440
00:28:27,536 --> 00:28:29,866
Master tried to comfort you.

441
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:31,925
But you couldn't let go.

442
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:33,799
You felt ashamed for
being a Omei disciple.

443
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,859
Then you lost your mind.

444
00:28:35,937 --> 00:28:38,267
You told Master to leave.

445
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:40,236
When Master took you
to see a psychiatrist,

446
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:41,964
you expelled her from Omei.

447
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:43,561
How did the Master die?

448
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,033
She was 120 years old.

449
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:49,766
I killed her...

450
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,306
She died of natural cause.

451
00:28:52,374 --> 00:28:54,398
Will you listen to me?

452
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:58,501
I've killed the Master.

453
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:02,976
I'll continue my killing spree.

454
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,976
Then I'll kill myself.

455
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:16,479
Heartbreak Sword Technique is
the only way to beat me.

456
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,839
Heartbreak Sword Technique!

457
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,842
"One Night Stand"!

458
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:25,114
Too slow!

459
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:28,537
"Bitter Argument"!

460
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:33,545
No power! No real emotion!

461
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,477
"Mixed Emotion"!

462
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:39,842
You call this "Mixed Emotion"?

463
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:42,476
Have you ever been in love?

464
00:29:44,185 --> 00:29:45,344
"Deep Sorrow"!

465
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,216
Heartbreak Sword Technique...

466
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,186
...requires true heartache.

467
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:56,151
I'll show you how it's done!

468
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:19,021
Why am I here?

469
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,921
You came to kill us.

470
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:27,326
My condition is getting worse.

471
00:30:27,396 --> 00:30:29,123
You should seek help.

472
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,354
Quiet!

473
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,928
Who knows how long
I'll stay conscious?

474
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:35,190
Omei disciple May!

475
00:30:38,364 --> 00:30:40,126
As Omei's 28th Master,

476
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:42,221
I order you to perfect
Heartbreak Sword Technique

477
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,925
and to become the new Master.

478
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:48,125
You have to stop me
or Omei will perish.

479
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,526
You never know what I'll do.

480
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:55,199
What are you doing?

481
00:30:55,268 --> 00:30:57,791
I'll show you how Heartbreak
Sword Technique is done!

482
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,559
You're not worth my time.

483
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:05,201
I'll give you one month to practice.

484
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:07,560
When I return I'll finish the job!

485
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:09,394
You'll all be my victims!

486
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,065
Scared?

487
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:17,269
What is "One Night Stand"?

488
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:20,269
What is "Mixed Emotions"?

489
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:23,868
"What is "Deep Sorrow"?

490
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:28,407
If the first 7 moves are associated
with heartache,

491
00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:31,999
why is the last move called
"Eternal Harmony"?

492
00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:39,573
Why is the Grand Master smiling?

493
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:43,045
What makes her smile?

494
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:50,937
Why is love so deep?

495
00:31:51,181 --> 00:31:53,010
Love can't be studied.

496
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:54,580
Love needs to be experienced.

497
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:55,836
Big Sister was right.

498
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:56,972
You need to experience heartache

499
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,606
to perfect your training.

500
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:01,407
Practice only perfect your form,
but there's no soul.

501
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,072
I know.

502
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,810
I'll do anything.

503
00:32:04,884 --> 00:32:07,350
But time is running out.

504
00:32:07,418 --> 00:32:08,611
Where do I find someone

505
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:10,840
to fall in love with
and to break my heart?

506
00:32:10,918 --> 00:32:11,885
Don't worry.

507
00:32:11,952 --> 00:32:13,942
You have 3 options.

508
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,246
One is Leonard Dicaprio

509
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,308
One is Takuya Kimura.

510
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:18,148
But they can't help you.

511
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,208
Why?

512
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:20,810
You don't speak their language.

513
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:22,013
And they can't speak Chinese.

514
00:32:22,088 --> 00:32:23,281
What's my third option?

515
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:30,888
The love we have is precious.

516
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:34,321
May it last 1 billion light years.

517
00:32:43,826 --> 00:32:48,156
The love we have is precious.

518
00:32:48,226 --> 00:32:53,216
May it last 1 billion light years.

519
00:32:53,294 --> 00:32:57,125
Doesn't light year measure distance?

520
00:32:57,395 --> 00:32:58,827
Whatever.

521
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:24,063
Give me!

522
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:27,101
Tiger gave me this.

523
00:33:28,202 --> 00:33:29,463
Tiger is mine!

524
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:31,503
Tiger is mine!

525
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:38,831
May, Tiger is your only option.

526
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:14,468
Boss, look who's here.

527
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:15,876
Make way.

528
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:24,137
You look busy. I'll come tomorrow.

529
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:26,111
I'm like this every day.

530
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:27,578
Entertain the girls.

531
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:30,048
Cutie!

532
00:34:30,116 --> 00:34:31,377
It's a beach party!

533
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,417
Understood.

534
00:34:37,151 --> 00:34:38,879
Came to see me?

535
00:34:39,185 --> 00:34:40,549
What did you do to your hair?

536
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,586
You're wearing a skirt?

537
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:46,320
Are you called The Heartbreaker?

538
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,519
What did you tell them?

539
00:35:16,593 --> 00:35:19,059
Something cruel and mean.

540
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:20,559
What is it?

541
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:22,225
They're all different.

542
00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:24,557
Every relationship has its taboo.

543
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:27,959
I'm here asking you for a favor.

544
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:28,893
How dare you!

545
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:31,521
After what your "therapy" did to me?

546
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:35,523
I know you want to get even with me.

547
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:37,461
But this is serious.

548
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,326
Just kidding.

549
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:40,490
It's already behind me.

550
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:42,054
You're my savior.

551
00:35:42,132 --> 00:35:45,293
This beach party wouldn't exist
without your help.

552
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:46,856
So what's so serious?

553
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:48,559
You know, I'm the temporary Master.

554
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:50,294
My Big Sister Misery...

555
00:35:50,368 --> 00:35:51,959
No problem. Understood.

556
00:35:52,035 --> 00:35:53,262
You do?

557
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:54,301
The name Misery means

558
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,460
she's heartbroken.

559
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:57,058
She's probably a kung fu master.

560
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:59,034
You're obviously not her match.

561
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:00,567
As the temporary Master,

562
00:36:00,637 --> 00:36:03,967
You must beat Misery to protect Omei.

563
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:08,400
Omei must have a way to stop Misery.

564
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:11,128
But it isn't easy to learn.

565
00:36:11,206 --> 00:36:12,297
Must be something unusual.

566
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:14,237
What am I good at?

567
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:15,932
I only know how to break girl's heart.

568
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,200
I've seen your Grand Master's statue.

569
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:20,172
She looked graceful.

570
00:36:20,241 --> 00:36:22,332
She was holding a sword in her hand.

571
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:24,534
So it must be a sword technique.

572
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:27,575
Therefore, you want me to hurt you,

573
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:31,872
to perfect Heartbreak Sword Technique!

574
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:33,543
Will you help me?

575
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,372
Got a place to stay?

576
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,410
- Not yet.
- Come.

577
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:53,006
Before breaking my heart,
will you date me?

578
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:54,139
Sure.

579
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,913
But I can't hold hand.

580
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,439
No problem.

581
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:00,948
No embrace, no kissing.

582
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:02,540
No problem.

583
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:05,548
I can't sleep with you.

584
00:37:05,618 --> 00:37:07,516
Of course not.

585
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:09,377
You can still break my heart?

586
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:10,281
Sure.

587
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,052
You're really incredible!

588
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:30,317
Awful.

589
00:37:31,024 --> 00:37:32,251
What is this?

590
00:37:33,424 --> 00:37:36,016
This is unacceptable.

591
00:37:36,091 --> 00:37:36,954
Let's go.

592
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:38,491
Do you know who she is?

593
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:40,320
She's my savior!

594
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:41,892
Damn!

595
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:43,389
Let's go.

596
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:44,448
This room is awful.

597
00:37:44,526 --> 00:37:46,891
No... It's great.

598
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,992
Thank you.

599
00:37:49,428 --> 00:37:51,121
This is for you two.

600
00:37:54,462 --> 00:37:56,325
I'm sorry.

601
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:57,919
This is all my fault.

602
00:37:57,996 --> 00:37:59,189
I'm no good!

603
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:00,456
Don't' say that.

604
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,088
I appreciate everything you did.

605
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:05,097
I am helping you

606
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:07,461
for a selfish reason.

607
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:10,023
The first night at Omei,

608
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:12,497
when I saw you flying in the air,

609
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:15,055
I fell in love with you.

610
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,594
Are you serious?

611
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:21,100
It was love at first sight.

612
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,667
Don't tease me.

613
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,627
I'm tired. I'm going to the bathroom.

614
00:39:24,215 --> 00:39:28,410
When I first met you at Omei,

615
00:39:28,483 --> 00:39:33,212
I dreamt of our reunion.

616
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:38,183
I can give up my fortune for you.

617
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:42,447
Just pay me 10K everyday.

618
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,715
Ever since leaving Omei,

619
00:39:47,954 --> 00:39:52,148
I dreamt of seeing you again.

620
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:56,678
If you will marry me,

621
00:39:56,923 --> 00:40:01,219
I will give you my mansion.

622
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:06,049
Long time no see

623
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:10,058
I love you forever,
why are you laughing at me?

624
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:13,320
Long time no see

625
00:40:13,393 --> 00:40:15,985
I love me, you love me or not...

626
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:18,527
I love you. Do you love me?

627
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:23,323
I love you. Do you love me?

628
00:40:24,229 --> 00:40:25,956
I don't understand English.

629
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:28,325
What does the last part mean?

630
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,520
I'll sing it again in Chinese.

631
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:40,465
Long time no see.

632
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:44,364
I love you forever, you...

633
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:47,459
Damn! It's midnight.

634
00:40:47,701 --> 00:40:48,928
What's wrong?

635
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:50,297
- I'm going.
- You are?

636
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:51,959
If I don't get home by midnight,

637
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,228
My Ferrari will turn into a pumpkin.

638
00:40:54,302 --> 00:40:55,132
You're leaving?

639
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:55,930
Bye.

640
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:08,136
I forgot something.

641
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:09,229
What?

642
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:26,182
Did you just kiss me?

643
00:42:27,123 --> 00:42:29,113
You promised you wouldn't.

644
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:33,416
It'll hurt me more?

645
00:42:34,658 --> 00:42:36,955
It's 4.

646
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:39,992
You're coming over? Why?

647
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:43,421
You miss me?

648
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,984
What do I think?

649
00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:48,958
I don't know.

650
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:52,954
Do whatever you want. I'll wait.

651
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:03,363
Please leave me a message.

652
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,557
At around 5 this morning,

653
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:17,066
Police found a damaged Ferrari
at Hung Min Rd...

654
00:43:17,134 --> 00:43:20,033
The driver could not be found.

655
00:43:20,102 --> 00:43:22,261
According to the police,

656
00:43:22,335 --> 00:43:26,530
The car belongs to millionaire
Tiger Hung, a.k.a. The Heartbreaker.

657
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:28,627
The incident is being investigated.

658
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:31,193
Police are trying to contact Mr. Hung.

659
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:37,161
Who are you?

660
00:43:37,972 --> 00:43:40,598
I crashed my car.

661
00:43:40,673 --> 00:43:43,037
Why are you hurt?

662
00:43:43,107 --> 00:43:45,074
Your car looked fine.

663
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,507
That's why the car is expensive.

664
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:51,508
It protects itself, not the driver.

665
00:43:56,643 --> 00:43:59,303
Just kidding. I'm okay.

666
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:01,399
See?

667
00:44:10,446 --> 00:44:11,639
It's fake.

668
00:44:11,713 --> 00:44:13,407
You can rub it off.

669
00:44:13,481 --> 00:44:15,071
Try it.

670
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:18,308
See?

671
00:44:19,415 --> 00:44:20,676
Here?

672
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:22,682
That's real.

673
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,443
Does it hurt?

674
00:44:24,516 --> 00:44:27,449
Did your heart ache?

675
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:31,176
Great! Love has struck you.

676
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,114
That fast!

677
00:44:32,184 --> 00:44:34,582
You don't have much time
left for the duel.

678
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:35,742
How about what happened last night?

679
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:37,110
All real emotions.

680
00:44:37,185 --> 00:44:38,344
I got you a credit card.

681
00:44:38,419 --> 00:44:40,249
Go buy some nice clothes.

682
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,286
You need to look pretty.

683
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:42,341
Why?

684
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,410
I'm taking you to see my parents.

685
00:44:44,488 --> 00:44:46,454
Is it necessary?

686
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:51,087
The more things we do,
the more it'll hurt.

687
00:45:00,557 --> 00:45:01,648
My parents.

688
00:45:01,724 --> 00:45:02,588
Misery.

689
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,749
Uncle, Auntie.

690
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,457
A beautiful girl.

691
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:07,754
We've never met Tiger's girlfriends.

692
00:45:07,992 --> 00:45:09,652
We didn't prepare anything.

693
00:45:10,526 --> 00:45:11,753
Here's your gift.

694
00:45:11,827 --> 00:45:12,918
No.

695
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:14,688
It's okay, we're family.

696
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:16,522
You're such a darling.

697
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:17,855
I have a bracelet for you.

698
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:19,895
Take your time.

699
00:45:19,962 --> 00:45:21,258
She's pretty.

700
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:22,594
You want to get her drunk?

701
00:45:22,663 --> 00:45:23,560
70%?

702
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,789
80% drunk.

703
00:45:24,896 --> 00:45:25,884
It's done.

704
00:45:25,963 --> 00:45:28,987
May, let's drink.

705
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,897
Come on.

706
00:45:38,966 --> 00:45:39,897
I can't drink, uncle.

707
00:45:39,966 --> 00:45:41,489
It's okay.

708
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:42,931
Cheers.

709
00:45:43,734 --> 00:45:45,030
Drink.

710
00:45:51,136 --> 00:45:51,965
My turn.

711
00:45:52,036 --> 00:45:53,593
Cheers.

712
00:45:58,104 --> 00:45:59,764
Race 1 Northern Blaze.

713
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:01,498
Race 2 Tincan.

714
00:46:01,571 --> 00:46:03,504
Race 3 Blonde Okie.

715
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:04,936
Race 4 Lightning High.

716
00:46:05,006 --> 00:46:06,597
Fifty Grand on each race, thanks.

717
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:08,872
Enjoy.

718
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,565
- Let's eat.
- Drink!

719
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,664
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

720
00:46:20,175 --> 00:46:21,266
- 82 LaFite
- Let's eat.

721
00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:23,502
You have to try this.

722
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:26,232
Vintage Mow Tai. Cheers!

723
00:46:37,979 --> 00:46:39,809
Cheers!

724
00:46:53,983 --> 00:46:56,779
She said she can't drink...

725
00:46:56,851 --> 00:46:58,248
But she finished everything!

726
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,013
I'm not scared.

727
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:21,877
Cheers!

728
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,890
Done! She's 80% drunk.

729
00:47:50,863 --> 00:47:53,658
She said she can't drink...

730
00:47:53,729 --> 00:47:55,628
She's really something.

731
00:47:55,964 --> 00:47:58,522
She's a martial artist.

732
00:47:59,698 --> 00:48:01,289
No wonder.

733
00:48:02,731 --> 00:48:04,288
Are you okay?

734
00:48:05,932 --> 00:48:07,125
Yes.

735
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:08,290
Thanks.

736
00:48:11,668 --> 00:48:12,326
Leaving?

737
00:48:12,567 --> 00:48:13,590
Yes.

738
00:48:13,668 --> 00:48:15,191
Where's your parents?

739
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:16,893
You met them already.

740
00:48:18,535 --> 00:48:20,001
How did I behave?

741
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:21,330
Did they like me?

742
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:23,229
You knocked them out.

743
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:24,235
That's great.

744
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:25,565
Where are we going?

745
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:27,069
Fei Ngo Mountain!

746
00:48:30,605 --> 00:48:32,537
This is Fei Ngo Mountain?

747
00:48:32,605 --> 00:48:33,730
Omei moutain is a sacred ground.

748
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:35,169
So is Fei Ngo Mountain.

749
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:37,206
They're sacred for different reasons.

750
00:48:37,307 --> 00:48:38,295
Of course.

751
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,063
One is famous for martial arts,
the other for sightseeing.

752
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:51,301
Why are the cars moving funny?

753
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,039
It's difficult to explain.

754
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:02,043
Why don't I demonstrate?

755
00:49:03,745 --> 00:49:06,177
First you lower the girl's seat.

756
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:14,239
Then the driver will climb over.

757
00:49:14,315 --> 00:49:16,907
I want to go back to the hotel.

758
00:49:16,982 --> 00:49:18,209
Sure!

759
00:49:41,953 --> 00:49:42,749
I want to take a shower.

760
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:44,548
No need.

761
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:45,315
Come on!

762
00:49:48,022 --> 00:49:50,215
Noodle?

763
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:51,778
I want to take a shower.

764
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:53,254
No need.

765
00:50:00,658 --> 00:50:02,147
Lobster claw?

766
00:50:02,225 --> 00:50:03,657
I want to take a shower.

767
00:50:03,726 --> 00:50:05,919
Why is this lobster noodle here?

768
00:50:06,193 --> 00:50:07,988
I saw you too busy betting horses to eat,

769
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,618
so I got you something.

770
00:50:13,628 --> 00:50:15,560
I want to take a shower.

771
00:50:17,228 --> 00:50:18,819
Go ahead.

772
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:33,856
It's delicious.

773
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,625
You want some?

774
00:50:39,933 --> 00:50:42,162
You didn't have dinner either.

775
00:51:28,278 --> 00:51:29,835
What's wrong?

776
00:51:33,279 --> 00:51:35,939
I can't sleep with you.

777
00:51:36,779 --> 00:51:38,177
Do you want me to hurt you?

778
00:51:38,246 --> 00:51:40,179
You have to beat Misery.

779
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,172
I can't do it.

780
00:51:44,815 --> 00:51:46,145
This is bad.

781
00:51:46,882 --> 00:51:48,109
I'm at a loss.

782
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:51,114
I never hurt anyone
without sleeping with her.

783
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,173
I warned you before:

784
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,842
No kiss, no sleeping together.

785
00:51:55,918 --> 00:51:58,009
And you promised!

786
00:51:58,085 --> 00:52:01,176
Men always say yes.

787
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,345
What now?

788
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:08,313
Then...

789
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,177
Let's just get it over with.

790
00:52:11,355 --> 00:52:12,752
No need to shower...

791
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:14,344
No!

792
00:52:14,655 --> 00:52:16,087
What now?

793
00:52:16,155 --> 00:52:17,587
We'll pretend we've done it.

794
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:18,781
How?

795
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:19,822
I'll show you.

796
00:52:19,889 --> 00:52:20,946
How?

797
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:24,756
Here.

798
00:52:52,597 --> 00:52:53,187
So?

799
00:52:53,263 --> 00:52:54,854
You got it all wrong.

800
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:56,692
You're inexperienced.

801
00:52:56,764 --> 00:52:58,697
I'll show you. Come...

802
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:01,721
Let's say I'm you.

803
00:53:03,332 --> 00:53:05,628
First close your eyes.

804
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:09,098
Then gasp with great satisfaction.

805
00:53:10,867 --> 00:53:14,994
Do it 4 or 5 times, then smile.

806
00:53:15,202 --> 00:53:16,964
Slowly turn your head over

807
00:53:17,036 --> 00:53:18,763
and look at your lover.

808
00:53:21,203 --> 00:53:22,692
Got it?

809
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:24,128
You try it.

810
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:32,834
First close my eyes.

811
00:53:32,905 --> 00:53:36,066
Then gasp with great satisfaction.

812
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,970
Do it 4 or 5 times.

813
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:43,906
Then smile.

814
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:46,870
Slowly turn my head over.

815
00:53:46,942 --> 00:53:48,374
And look at my lover.

816
00:53:53,377 --> 00:53:55,776
You ruined it!

817
00:53:55,977 --> 00:53:57,967
It's like this after marriage.

818
00:53:58,745 --> 00:54:01,268
But this is our first time.

819
00:54:02,612 --> 00:54:06,306
The first time I'll hold you in my arms

820
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,839
and talk all night

821
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:11,278
until day breaks.

822
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,112
What do we talk about?

823
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:14,906
Just nonsense.

824
00:54:14,982 --> 00:54:17,846
But women will remember it
the rest of their lives.

825
00:54:17,915 --> 00:54:19,074
How about guys?

826
00:54:19,149 --> 00:54:20,809
We forget after waking up.

827
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,714
Then don't go to sleep.

828
00:54:23,784 --> 00:54:25,410
But I'll get hungry.

829
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,173
No problem. Here is...

830
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:28,148
Lobster noodle.

831
00:54:28,218 --> 00:54:29,878
It's finished.

832
00:54:29,952 --> 00:54:31,009
What about me?

833
00:54:31,085 --> 00:54:33,278
I asked you, but you didn't reply.

834
00:54:33,352 --> 00:54:34,909
It's okay.

835
00:54:35,086 --> 00:54:37,678
I also have... fried noodle.

836
00:54:38,287 --> 00:54:39,378
It tastes better with chili sauce.

837
00:54:39,621 --> 00:54:40,109
Got it!

838
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:44,710
How is it done?

839
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:47,187
The first night we would feed each other.

840
00:54:47,256 --> 00:54:49,119
The second night we'll fight for the food.

841
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:52,951
Feed me first!

842
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:55,949
Here you go.

843
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:38,027
When I first met you at Omei...

844
00:55:40,634 --> 00:55:43,328
Tiger, I bought you many things.

845
00:55:43,402 --> 00:55:46,766
Shirts, pants, shoes, and socks.

846
00:55:46,835 --> 00:55:47,426
Are you happy?

847
00:55:47,669 --> 00:55:48,999
I'm in a great mood.

848
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,434
- Really?
- Also...

849
00:55:50,669 --> 00:55:53,192
I bought you underwear.

850
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:54,964
First love is like this.

851
00:56:01,005 --> 00:56:03,404
Calling Fatty, subject is coming down.

852
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,698
Calling boss,
subject is heading your way.

853
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:13,273
What are you doing?

854
00:56:13,342 --> 00:56:15,002
What have I promised you?

855
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:16,269
That you'll help me.

856
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:18,172
To do what?

857
00:56:18,243 --> 00:56:20,005
To perfect Heartbreak Sword Technique.

858
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:21,043
How?

859
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,736
By breaking my heart.

860
00:57:20,424 --> 00:57:21,117
Where's she?

861
00:57:23,158 --> 00:57:24,646
Find her!

862
00:57:24,724 --> 00:57:25,850
Take the elevator!

863
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:41,754
What's wrong with you?

864
00:57:41,828 --> 00:57:42,794
I'm scared?

865
00:57:42,861 --> 00:57:43,953
Scared?

866
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:45,793
I'm scared of getting hurt.

867
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,953
Isn't that what you want?

868
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,719
How about not so fast?

869
00:57:50,797 --> 00:57:52,093
I want the good times last longer.

870
00:57:52,164 --> 00:57:53,152
You're running out of time!

871
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:55,390
Where's your dedication?

872
00:57:59,299 --> 00:58:01,094
Say something!

873
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:02,462
I want to go back to the hotel.

874
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:04,222
No. You're coming to my place.

875
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,823
Why?

876
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,833
So I'll have you cornered!

877
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:12,932
Master!

878
00:58:13,002 --> 00:58:15,366
Open up, May!

879
00:58:17,403 --> 00:58:19,232
Don't you want to be heartbroken?

880
00:58:19,303 --> 00:58:21,360
No... I'm scared.

881
00:58:21,804 --> 00:58:22,270
Damn!

882
00:58:22,337 --> 00:58:23,200
Where's the key?

883
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:25,237
- Here.
- Hurry!

884
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,703
Get her!

885
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:14,679
Don't go anywhere.

886
00:59:26,185 --> 00:59:28,152
Stop her, Ben!

887
00:59:41,255 --> 00:59:42,118
Where's she?

888
01:00:22,131 --> 01:00:22,994
What's wrong?

889
01:00:23,064 --> 01:00:24,894
Something got into my eyes.

890
01:00:24,965 --> 01:00:26,192
Go wash them.

891
01:00:32,233 --> 01:00:33,859
It's dusty down there.

892
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:36,894
You think I don't know?

893
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,065
Stop running around.

894
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,964
I won't next time.
I'm not feeling any pain.

895
01:00:41,035 --> 01:00:42,467
Actually I think it's funny.

896
01:00:42,702 --> 01:00:43,759
Why?

897
01:00:43,836 --> 01:00:45,132
You don't know how to hurt me.

898
01:00:45,203 --> 01:00:47,192
What do you mean? Where's the girl?

899
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:47,735
You all right?

900
01:00:47,803 --> 01:00:49,928
She's having an asthma attack.

901
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,028
Let me...

902
01:00:52,104 --> 01:00:54,127
Relax.

903
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:00,801
Done!

904
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,869
You house is dusty.

905
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,372
I won't get under the bed again!

906
01:01:04,707 --> 01:01:06,037
Pay her...

907
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:08,731
Time is running out.
Think of something.

908
01:01:13,209 --> 01:01:14,232
Get up!

909
01:01:15,009 --> 01:01:16,202
Get up!

910
01:01:16,276 --> 01:01:17,742
Get out of the bed!

911
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,867
Go back to your room.

912
01:01:19,944 --> 01:01:22,206
I like it here. Got a problem?

913
01:01:29,946 --> 01:01:31,412
Are you the lady from last time?

914
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,411
Yes.

915
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,038
It's great to see you again.

916
01:01:35,113 --> 01:01:37,205
Are you feeling better?

917
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,372
There's no way to cure asthma.

918
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:39,471
There is!

919
01:01:40,915 --> 01:01:42,744
I got you some medicine.

920
01:01:42,815 --> 01:01:45,247
Use 5 cups of water.

921
01:01:45,316 --> 01:01:47,146
Don't over-cook it.

922
01:01:47,217 --> 01:01:48,240
Thank you.

923
01:01:48,317 --> 01:01:48,975
Good night.

924
01:01:50,484 --> 01:01:52,383
You're not heartbroken?

925
01:02:07,287 --> 01:02:08,253
Did you take the medicine?

926
01:02:08,321 --> 01:02:10,083
- Not yet.
- Why not?

927
01:02:10,155 --> 01:02:12,383
I'm taking prescription drugs.

928
01:02:12,455 --> 01:02:13,944
I wanted to check with you first.

929
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,852
Good thing he called me over today.

930
01:02:15,923 --> 01:02:17,855
I'm glad to see you.

931
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:19,985
You made the right decision.

932
01:02:20,057 --> 01:02:21,387
I need to change the medicine.

933
01:02:21,457 --> 01:02:23,185
Let me take your pulse.

934
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:26,825
You're pregnant.

935
01:02:26,892 --> 01:02:28,222
It's my baby! Mine!

936
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:29,383
The father is not Chinese.

937
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:31,948
Right. He's Pakistani.

938
01:02:32,026 --> 01:02:32,957
How can you tell?

939
01:02:33,026 --> 01:02:35,255
Your pulse said it all.

940
01:02:35,327 --> 01:02:37,817
So can I take your medicine?

941
01:02:37,894 --> 01:02:40,327
Then... I'll make some changes.

942
01:02:40,395 --> 01:02:42,224
Watch out for second hand smoke.

943
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,858
Cheers!

944
01:02:51,197 --> 01:02:52,185
Want some?

945
01:02:52,264 --> 01:02:53,821
Sure.

946
01:02:53,998 --> 01:02:56,430
You should drink wine in the morning.

947
01:02:56,832 --> 01:02:58,093
It increases blood circulation.

948
01:02:58,466 --> 01:02:59,829
Bad news!

949
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:02,025
Boss, Cat is back.

950
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,829
Where's she?

951
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,127
She's outside the house.

952
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:05,894
Destroy all evidence!

953
01:03:05,968 --> 01:03:06,763
Get her luggage!

954
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:10,364
I haven't finished breakfast!

955
01:03:13,803 --> 01:03:16,031
Make sure Cat doesn't see anything.

956
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:22,903
Who is Cat?

957
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:24,961
She's Tiger's fiancee.
Their wedding is next month.

958
01:03:25,038 --> 01:03:26,766
Tiger didn't tell you?

959
01:03:27,105 --> 01:03:28,162
No.

960
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:29,535
Tiger doesn't like her.

961
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:30,897
We forced him into the marriage.

962
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,236
We don't like the girl either.

963
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,436
Then why make Tiger marrying her?

964
01:03:36,508 --> 01:03:39,804
Business decision.
It's good for both families.

965
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,002
Leave...

966
01:03:42,076 --> 01:03:44,406
Stay here, Cat.

967
01:03:46,077 --> 01:03:47,236
Too late.

968
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,342
Who is she?

969
01:03:49,978 --> 01:03:50,841
A friend.

970
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:52,309
Tiger!

971
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:54,742
Did you care about my feelings?

972
01:03:54,812 --> 01:03:55,176
Listen to me...

973
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:57,178
How dare you to bring a woman home?

974
01:03:57,246 --> 01:03:59,371
Look at her ugly face!

975
01:03:59,446 --> 01:04:00,912
I'm canceling the wedding.

976
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,410
Cat... It's a misunderstanding...

977
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,946
It's not what you think.

978
01:04:05,014 --> 01:04:06,776
You're the only one I love.

979
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:07,313
Listen to me.

980
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:08,040
Come on...

981
01:04:08,114 --> 01:04:09,308
Cut! Cut!

982
01:04:09,381 --> 01:04:11,075
She's not even watching.

983
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,975
What's wrong with you?

984
01:04:16,149 --> 01:04:17,911
It's delicious.

985
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:20,177
Do you love me?

986
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:20,945
I do.

987
01:04:21,017 --> 01:04:22,278
Why aren't you heartbroken?

988
01:04:22,351 --> 01:04:25,011
When your parents mentioned
your wedding,

989
01:04:25,085 --> 01:04:27,052
I was hurting inside.

990
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,915
But when she appeared,
all my feelings disappeared.

991
01:04:29,987 --> 01:04:31,748
I just feel hungry.

992
01:04:32,753 --> 01:04:34,219
You're a bad actress.

993
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,446
I only told you to lose temper.

994
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:37,511
Why throw cushions around?

995
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:38,948
You over-acted.

996
01:04:39,021 --> 01:04:40,147
It's too exaggerated!

997
01:04:40,222 --> 01:04:42,745
You're no better.
Why knock over wineglasses?

998
01:04:42,823 --> 01:04:44,448
You're even worse.

999
01:04:44,523 --> 01:04:46,080
Who told you to pick hair on the table?

1000
01:04:46,156 --> 01:04:48,247
May's got women's intuition.

1001
01:04:48,323 --> 01:04:50,153
She can tell what's real and what's not.

1002
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:52,190
We should get the real Cat.

1003
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:53,747
What "real Cat"?

1004
01:04:53,825 --> 01:04:55,791
The fiancee we want him to marry.

1005
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,791
You know about our relationship.

1006
01:04:57,859 --> 01:04:58,916
We agreed to mind our own business.

1007
01:04:58,993 --> 01:04:59,981
If she sees this, she'll just say:

1008
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:01,320
"Sorry."

1009
01:05:01,393 --> 01:05:02,984
"Didn't know your girlfriend was here."

1010
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:03,889
"Have fun."

1011
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,551
How can that break May's heart?

1012
01:05:05,794 --> 01:05:07,953
Can I go?

1013
01:05:08,061 --> 01:05:09,288
What's your hurry?

1014
01:05:09,362 --> 01:05:11,954
You're such a lousy actress.

1015
01:05:12,029 --> 01:05:12,960
You want a refund?

1016
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:14,393
No need.

1017
01:05:14,463 --> 01:05:15,952
I'll make you pay for it.

1018
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,018
Try me.

1019
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:19,159
Cat?

1020
01:05:19,464 --> 01:05:21,158
Sorry...

1021
01:05:21,231 --> 01:05:24,322
Didn't know your girlfriend was here.

1022
01:05:26,065 --> 01:05:27,964
Have fun.

1023
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:21,270
Who is she?

1024
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,004
My girlfriend.

1025
01:06:23,912 --> 01:06:25,845
How dare you, Tiger!

1026
01:06:25,913 --> 01:06:27,277
Did you care about my feelings?

1027
01:06:27,345 --> 01:06:28,209
What?

1028
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,439
We agreed to mind our own business.

1029
01:06:30,513 --> 01:06:33,275
But she's prettier than me.

1030
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:35,072
Did I ever do that to you?

1031
01:06:35,147 --> 01:06:37,011
I think you're better looking.

1032
01:06:37,081 --> 01:06:39,547
She's like an angel!

1033
01:06:39,782 --> 01:06:41,180
She's fashionable.

1034
01:06:41,249 --> 01:06:43,841
She chooses appropriate attires.

1035
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,281
She's got a great personality.

1036
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:48,373
She's perfect except for her appetite.

1037
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:49,939
How does she keep such a good figure?

1038
01:06:50,018 --> 01:06:51,416
Are you two serious?

1039
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:52,974
How can I face my friends?

1040
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,348
What do you want me to say?

1041
01:06:54,418 --> 01:06:56,282
I still think you're prettier.

1042
01:06:56,352 --> 01:06:58,341
Maybe she's got better temper.

1043
01:06:58,419 --> 01:07:00,817
What a show.

1044
01:07:03,288 --> 01:07:05,277
Is this another set-up?

1045
01:07:05,954 --> 01:07:07,250
You're not serious, right?

1046
01:07:07,321 --> 01:07:08,981
Tell her to leave!

1047
01:07:27,092 --> 01:07:30,116
Let me finish breakfast.

1048
01:07:51,932 --> 01:07:53,921
Is this for real?

1049
01:07:53,998 --> 01:07:56,556
Yes. You have to go.

1050
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:03,800
Can I swallow my food first?

1051
01:08:03,868 --> 01:08:06,357
No, she doesn't like it.

1052
01:08:07,335 --> 01:08:08,460
Spit it out.

1053
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:17,461
Please.

1054
01:08:48,177 --> 01:08:49,302
Stop!

1055
01:08:50,278 --> 01:08:51,335
Take your garbage with you!

1056
01:08:51,412 --> 01:08:52,309
Fatty!

1057
01:09:01,213 --> 01:09:02,406
Take care.

1058
01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:04,208
What are you doing?

1059
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:05,577
She's leaving!

1060
01:09:05,815 --> 01:09:07,008
Your turn!

1061
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,509
Take care!

1062
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:17,882
What's wrong with you?

1063
01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:21,549
We've become good friends.

1064
01:09:23,018 --> 01:09:24,314
Do you want to help her?

1065
01:09:26,919 --> 01:09:28,317
You want her to beat Misery?

1066
01:09:30,954 --> 01:09:33,386
Like this! Beat it!

1067
01:09:33,454 --> 01:09:34,579
Beat it!

1068
01:09:34,821 --> 01:09:35,582
Trash everything.

1069
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:47,284
What?

1070
01:09:54,593 --> 01:09:56,354
What's so funny?

1071
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,459
I'm happy

1072
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:01,322
because I'm finally feeling sad.

1073
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:02,584
Don't cheer up.

1074
01:10:02,827 --> 01:10:04,453
Make sure you stay this way!

1075
01:10:04,962 --> 01:10:07,224
Then make me more upset.

1076
01:10:07,295 --> 01:10:09,056
Okay...

1077
01:10:09,829 --> 01:10:10,294
Good!

1078
01:10:10,362 --> 01:10:12,522
Return your clothes and jewelry.

1079
01:10:12,597 --> 01:10:14,120
Return everything!

1080
01:10:22,231 --> 01:10:25,823
You have to fight a little to feel the pain.

1081
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:29,232
- No...
- Give it!

1082
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,197
Give it!

1083
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:31,198
No!

1084
01:10:31,267 --> 01:10:32,528
Come on...

1085
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:34,067
No!

1086
01:10:34,134 --> 01:10:37,532
Give it all!

1087
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:39,000
No!

1088
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:41,059
Let go. You're too powerful.

1089
01:10:41,262 --> 01:10:42,262
1, 2, 3

1090
01:10:43,236 --> 01:10:44,259
Take care.

1091
01:10:46,604 --> 01:10:48,127
The money is mine.

1092
01:10:48,204 --> 01:10:50,227
This makes up for your living expense.

1093
01:10:50,304 --> 01:10:51,998
Where will I stay without money?

1094
01:10:52,072 --> 01:10:53,902
Sleep on the streets if you have too.

1095
01:10:53,973 --> 01:10:55,337
What will I eat?

1096
01:10:55,405 --> 01:10:56,235
Try the trash can.

1097
01:10:56,306 --> 01:10:57,829
Get me a taxi.

1098
01:10:57,907 --> 01:10:59,032
Taxi!

1099
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,331
Beat it!

1100
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:01,901
Take care.

1101
01:11:01,974 --> 01:11:02,872
To which park?

1102
01:11:02,941 --> 01:11:03,372
Morse Park.

1103
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:04,305
It's rundown.

1104
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:05,136
Triangle Park!

1105
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,299
Good idea.

1106
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:07,500
Take her to Triangle Park.

1107
01:11:08,308 --> 01:11:10,002
Don't give me money.

1108
01:11:10,076 --> 01:11:11,406
Then you're on your own.

1109
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,067
What can I do?

1110
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:14,166
Then I'll pay for you.

1111
01:11:14,243 --> 01:11:16,436
But that won't break my heart.

1112
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,840
Then I won't.

1113
01:11:17,911 --> 01:11:19,468
Pay or I won't drive.

1114
01:11:20,478 --> 01:11:21,910
Here you go...

1115
01:11:23,845 --> 01:11:25,505
Get in. Be careful.

1116
01:11:25,579 --> 01:11:26,875
You got a phone.

1117
01:11:26,946 --> 01:11:27,969
It's in my purse.

1118
01:11:28,046 --> 01:11:29,444
Your purse...

1119
01:11:29,847 --> 01:11:31,870
Got a battery charger?

1120
01:11:31,947 --> 01:11:33,345
There are no outlets in the park.

1121
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,880
Batteries.

1122
01:11:37,882 --> 01:11:39,041
Bye.

1123
01:11:39,616 --> 01:11:41,344
Remember: Stay sad!

1124
01:11:56,286 --> 01:11:59,082
So you're Omei's Master.

1125
01:11:59,354 --> 01:12:01,115
This is a truly amazing

1126
01:12:01,187 --> 01:12:03,949
and shocking story.

1127
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:06,954
I wonder what he's doing now.

1128
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:10,887
Most likely busy with other women.

1129
01:12:11,423 --> 01:12:13,855
Where is my sword?

1130
01:12:13,924 --> 01:12:16,254
It's pouring!

1131
01:12:16,358 --> 01:12:18,984
Don't exercise after eating!

1132
01:12:20,425 --> 01:12:22,516
She's heartbroken.

1133
01:12:22,592 --> 01:12:24,252
She's completely crushed.

1134
01:12:24,325 --> 01:12:28,281
What's the big deal?

1135
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:44,396
Did that come from her sword?

1136
01:12:44,464 --> 01:12:48,056
Must be kids shooting air gun at us.

1137
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,626
Better stop doing that, kiddo!

1138
01:12:57,866 --> 01:12:59,162
Where's your manner?

1139
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,399
Kiddo, I've called the police!

1140
01:13:01,468 --> 01:13:02,957
I dialed 999!

1141
01:13:07,902 --> 01:13:09,391
I can see you, kiddo!

1142
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:11,333
I saw you, kiddo!

1143
01:13:17,604 --> 01:13:20,070
He fell for it.

1144
01:13:20,138 --> 01:13:22,105
We outsmarted him!

1145
01:14:00,347 --> 01:14:02,370
Yes?

1146
01:14:02,447 --> 01:14:04,607
What are you doing?

1147
01:14:04,914 --> 01:14:06,471
What's it to you?

1148
01:14:20,252 --> 01:14:22,411
It's pouring here.

1149
01:14:22,552 --> 01:14:24,950
I'm all wet.

1150
01:14:25,353 --> 01:14:27,581
Why do I care?

1151
01:14:33,254 --> 01:14:35,517
I practiced Heartbreak Sword Technique.

1152
01:14:35,589 --> 01:14:37,145
How was it?

1153
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:38,483
Was it powerful?

1154
01:14:38,555 --> 01:14:41,954
I couldn't do the last 5 moves.

1155
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:43,683
You need more pain.

1156
01:14:43,923 --> 01:14:45,219
Will you help me?

1157
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:46,052
Sure.

1158
01:14:46,124 --> 01:14:49,023
I'll think of something tonight.
I'll come tomorrow.

1159
01:14:51,358 --> 01:14:52,551
Thank you.

1160
01:14:53,526 --> 01:14:55,424
Try to stay out of the rain.

1161
01:15:13,064 --> 01:15:14,428
Lunch is ready.

1162
01:15:14,497 --> 01:15:16,293
We got some for you.

1163
01:15:21,966 --> 01:15:23,330
Come...

1164
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:26,195
No appetite.

1165
01:15:26,366 --> 01:15:28,162
Feeling sad?

1166
01:15:28,234 --> 01:15:29,961
He said he'd help me.

1167
01:15:30,034 --> 01:15:32,001
But he hasn't shown up.

1168
01:15:32,168 --> 01:15:34,191
You've waited all week.

1169
01:15:34,268 --> 01:15:36,132
He already forgot you.

1170
01:15:36,202 --> 01:15:38,930
Don't get her upset.

1171
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:41,699
He must be busy preparing his wedding.

1172
01:15:41,936 --> 01:15:43,334
He'll come afterwards.

1173
01:15:43,404 --> 01:15:46,030
But he'll be married by then.

1174
01:15:53,139 --> 01:15:56,163
See? She's lost it again.

1175
01:16:13,678 --> 01:16:15,405
Air gun again?

1176
01:16:15,477 --> 01:16:17,103
Screw you, kiddo!

1177
01:16:18,911 --> 01:16:21,003
I saw you kiddo!

1178
01:16:21,312 --> 01:16:22,608
He's not scared.

1179
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,976
We can't fool him.

1180
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:27,377
I saw you, little girl!

1181
01:16:29,914 --> 01:16:31,676
It's a little girl this time.

1182
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:35,107
I need more pain!

1183
01:17:01,422 --> 01:17:03,513
You said you would come.

1184
01:17:12,557 --> 01:17:13,523
I'm in pain.

1185
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:16,682
Me too!

1186
01:17:17,191 --> 01:17:21,522
No. I'm doing worse.

1187
01:17:21,592 --> 01:17:25,218
Why? You're The Heartbreaker!

1188
01:17:25,293 --> 01:17:27,486
I think I messed up.

1189
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:36,128
I came here many times before.

1190
01:17:36,196 --> 01:17:39,424
See? The invitation is crumpled.

1191
01:17:43,264 --> 01:17:45,423
A wedding invitation?

1192
01:17:47,598 --> 01:17:50,996
I figured inviting you to my wedding
would break your heart.

1193
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:54,994
I think I'll die!

1194
01:17:56,467 --> 01:17:57,433
Let's forget all this.

1195
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,966
Don't fight Misery. Give up Omei.

1196
01:18:00,234 --> 01:18:03,325
Then all I've done will be in vain.

1197
01:18:03,401 --> 01:18:06,994
It'll be a waste of your effort.

1198
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:08,400
That's true.

1199
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:12,595
On my wedding day, will you...

1200
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:13,432
I will!

1201
01:18:13,504 --> 01:18:14,026
What?

1202
01:18:14,104 --> 01:18:16,536
I'll come early to get sad.

1203
01:18:18,572 --> 01:18:20,060
I thought you would...

1204
01:18:20,138 --> 01:18:21,036
What?

1205
01:18:21,106 --> 01:18:21,696
Nothing.

1206
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:22,530
What?

1207
01:18:22,606 --> 01:18:23,629
Nothing.

1208
01:18:23,707 --> 01:18:25,639
What?

1209
01:18:27,474 --> 01:18:29,201
Steal me from the wedding!

1210
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,740
Don't leave me, Cat!

1211
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:58,344
Come on. Cat!

1212
01:18:59,147 --> 01:19:01,080
Calm down.

1213
01:19:01,182 --> 01:19:02,375
Excuse me!

1214
01:19:02,449 --> 01:19:04,972
Cat, I love you!

1215
01:19:05,049 --> 01:19:07,413
I won't forget you, Cat!

1216
01:19:08,383 --> 01:19:10,316
Cat is the center of the attention.

1217
01:19:11,517 --> 01:19:13,483
Where are Tiger's fans?

1218
01:19:13,551 --> 01:19:16,575
He hasn't been seeing them much lately.

1219
01:19:28,354 --> 01:19:30,445
Cat...

1220
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:32,316
Don't do this to me!

1221
01:19:34,522 --> 01:19:36,954
Cat!

1222
01:20:08,097 --> 01:20:09,687
Tiger!

1223
01:20:11,063 --> 01:20:11,620
Here's one.

1224
01:20:11,697 --> 01:20:13,526
Finally!

1225
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,367
I'll give up practicing
Heartbreak Sword Technique.

1226
01:20:27,434 --> 01:20:29,195
Don't get married.

1227
01:20:29,267 --> 01:20:30,426
Sure!

1228
01:20:32,302 --> 01:20:33,393
Tiger!

1229
01:20:39,237 --> 01:20:41,260
Wait. Something stinks.

1230
01:20:41,471 --> 01:20:43,198
Did you take a shower?

1231
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:44,032
Yes.

1232
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:45,264
Liar!

1233
01:20:45,338 --> 01:20:47,133
Where did you wash yourself?

1234
01:20:47,205 --> 01:20:48,229
Public toilet.

1235
01:20:48,305 --> 01:20:49,771
Why use public toilet?

1236
01:20:50,005 --> 01:20:52,767
Because I sleep in the park.

1237
01:20:53,006 --> 01:20:53,972
You know that.

1238
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,597
You sleep in the park?

1239
01:20:55,674 --> 01:20:57,537
Then you must be a beggar!

1240
01:20:57,607 --> 01:21:00,403
Look! We have a beggar here!

1241
01:21:00,475 --> 01:21:01,634
Are you playing me?

1242
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:03,072
Of course I am.

1243
01:21:03,142 --> 01:21:04,608
I'm famous for hurting people's feelings.

1244
01:21:04,676 --> 01:21:08,074
I've been waiting for this day
to get even with you.

1245
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:09,370
Stupid!

1246
01:21:27,347 --> 01:21:29,575
Does it work?

1247
01:21:29,647 --> 01:21:31,307
Are you heartbroken?

1248
01:21:32,582 --> 01:21:34,071
I didn't know
if the wedding will do the job.

1249
01:21:34,149 --> 01:21:36,547
So I thought of this way to insult you.

1250
01:21:36,616 --> 01:21:38,207
I'm a man of my words.

1251
01:21:38,283 --> 01:21:41,079
I'll help you in any way.

1252
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:43,041
You scare me.

1253
01:21:43,118 --> 01:21:45,744
I never know what you say is the truth.

1254
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:47,349
Love is all about getting things
mixed up.

1255
01:21:47,419 --> 01:21:48,783
That's why it confuses people.

1256
01:21:49,018 --> 01:21:50,450
Are you in pain now?

1257
01:21:52,386 --> 01:21:54,579
Can I ask you a question?

1258
01:21:54,653 --> 01:21:55,710
Sure.

1259
01:21:59,554 --> 01:22:01,384
Have you ever loved me?

1260
01:22:01,455 --> 01:22:02,614
Of course not!

1261
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:04,121
It was all make-believe.

1262
01:22:04,189 --> 01:22:05,587
No real emotions.

1263
01:22:05,655 --> 01:22:07,281
Only acting.

1264
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,682
Thanks for your help.

1265
01:22:17,759 --> 01:22:19,783
As long as you're feeling hurt.

1266
01:22:20,025 --> 01:22:21,286
I have one last kill for you.

1267
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:23,383
Every relationship has its taboo.

1268
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:24,585
Want to know what ours is?

1269
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:27,252
You already said it.

1270
01:22:29,394 --> 01:22:30,985
I did?

1271
01:22:31,062 --> 01:22:32,494
What is it?

1272
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:41,028
Done! Let's wrap things up.

1273
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:52,191
Let's settle this.

1274
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:53,390
How?

1275
01:22:53,466 --> 01:22:55,092
Divorce. Give me half of your fortune.

1276
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:56,326
We're only married for 1 hour.

1277
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,491
- 40%
- 20%

1278
01:22:57,567 --> 01:22:58,261
Deal!

1279
01:22:59,468 --> 01:23:01,696
Tiger, have you ever loved me?

1280
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:03,235
Have you?

1281
01:23:03,302 --> 01:23:05,495
A little, but there was never any trust.

1282
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:06,592
I feel the same.

1283
01:23:06,669 --> 01:23:08,533
What about her?

1284
01:23:08,604 --> 01:23:10,797
I never asked anything from her.

1285
01:23:11,037 --> 01:23:12,628
We never even sleep together.

1286
01:23:12,704 --> 01:23:14,102
Why go out of your way for her?

1287
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:15,467
True. Why?

1288
01:23:15,538 --> 01:23:17,402
Love. What else?

1289
01:23:20,773 --> 01:23:22,205
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1290
01:23:22,273 --> 01:23:23,534
Today's wedding is cancelled.

1291
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:25,732
Please take your gifts with you.

1292
01:23:45,178 --> 01:23:46,110
Big Sister!

1293
01:23:46,178 --> 01:23:47,270
Don't call me that!

1294
01:23:47,346 --> 01:23:49,141
What Master expelled me from Omei,

1295
01:23:49,212 --> 01:23:50,200
I took an oath

1296
01:23:50,279 --> 01:23:52,178
to die with Omei.

1297
01:23:52,247 --> 01:23:53,770
Today is Master's funeral anniversary.

1298
01:23:54,013 --> 01:23:55,707
We will all die together.

1299
01:23:56,014 --> 01:23:57,139
I'll kill myself first.

1300
01:23:57,214 --> 01:24:00,045
Then I'll kill you one by one.

1301
01:24:00,115 --> 01:24:01,581
Scared?

1302
01:24:03,315 --> 01:24:05,111
Big Sister...

1303
01:24:05,549 --> 01:24:08,209
I can feel your pain now.

1304
01:24:08,283 --> 01:24:10,273
Can we not fight?

1305
01:24:12,751 --> 01:24:15,217
You look sad.

1306
01:24:15,285 --> 01:24:16,512
Share your problem with someone.

1307
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:20,074
Talk to your family or friends.

1308
01:24:20,153 --> 01:24:22,381
Or a psychiatrist.

1309
01:24:22,453 --> 01:24:23,783
Don't mind how people look at you.

1310
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:27,078
Just think happy thoughts.

1311
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:31,121
Easy said than done.

1312
01:24:31,189 --> 01:24:32,177
I know.

1313
01:24:32,256 --> 01:24:34,779
Look what I have become.

1314
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:39,151
I wonder who it is

1315
01:24:39,223 --> 01:24:41,621
that caused you so much pain.

1316
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:43,418
What's his name?

1317
01:24:43,491 --> 01:24:45,321
Tiger Hung.

1318
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:49,024
Albert Yu is my man,
you stole him from me!

1319
01:24:49,093 --> 01:24:51,389
His name is Tiger Hung.

1320
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:52,483
Not Albert Yu.

1321
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,356
Will you listen to me?

1322
01:25:31,502 --> 01:25:33,764
Gift from Tiger.

1323
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,060
Here's more.

1324
01:25:49,373 --> 01:25:50,270
Tiger my love!

1325
01:25:50,339 --> 01:25:51,532
Don't call me that.

1326
01:25:56,208 --> 01:25:58,231
Call me Master Tiger.

1327
01:25:58,308 --> 01:25:59,467
What "Mater Tiger"?

1328
01:25:59,542 --> 01:26:02,373
I'll marry May after she beats Misery.

1329
01:26:02,442 --> 01:26:04,408
By then I'll become Master Tiger.

1330
01:26:04,476 --> 01:26:06,568
There's no such a thing.

1331
01:26:06,644 --> 01:26:09,576
Omei Master must be celibate.

1332
01:26:09,677 --> 01:26:11,701
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1333
01:26:12,611 --> 01:26:14,440
May, I'm divorced!

1334
01:26:16,345 --> 01:26:18,573
Give up Omei. Marry me!

1335
01:26:21,413 --> 01:26:23,073
What are you doing here?

1336
01:26:23,147 --> 01:26:24,772
I'm losing my power!

1337
01:26:25,147 --> 01:26:26,204
That's exactly what I want!

1338
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:28,305
I love you!

1339
01:26:29,282 --> 01:26:31,805
Misery is too powerful.

1340
01:26:32,283 --> 01:26:36,046
When I first met you at Omei,

1341
01:26:36,117 --> 01:26:40,379
I dreamt of our reunion.

1342
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:41,314
Stop singing!

1343
01:26:41,385 --> 01:26:42,442
You'll get me killed!

1344
01:26:42,518 --> 01:26:45,314
I'll give you my fortune.

1345
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:48,676
Boss, Misery is crazy.

1346
01:26:48,753 --> 01:26:51,379
If May can't beat her, we'll all die!

1347
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,677
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1348
01:26:53,754 --> 01:26:54,742
Come!

1349
01:26:55,555 --> 01:26:57,453
May, I don't love you anymore.

1350
01:26:57,521 --> 01:26:59,385
Look at my girls.

1351
01:26:59,455 --> 01:27:00,580
It's no use.

1352
01:27:00,656 --> 01:27:02,349
I don't feel sad at all.

1353
01:27:03,089 --> 01:27:04,146
Damn!

1354
01:27:04,623 --> 01:27:05,589
This is not good!

1355
01:27:05,657 --> 01:27:07,850
Is there another way to beat Misery?

1356
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:08,578
Yes.

1357
01:27:08,657 --> 01:27:11,385
Heartbreak Sword Technique 8th move:
"Eternal Harmony".

1358
01:27:11,457 --> 01:27:14,288
No one could figure it out
since Grand Master died.

1359
01:27:14,358 --> 01:27:15,688
"Eternal Harmony"?

1360
01:27:28,829 --> 01:27:31,295
What are the first 7 moves?

1361
01:27:31,362 --> 01:27:34,351
"Mixed Emotions", "Deep Sorrow",
"Bitter Argument"...

1362
01:27:34,429 --> 01:27:35,191
Understood.

1363
01:27:35,263 --> 01:27:36,593
All things come to a happy ending.

1364
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:39,128
May, I've figured out
"Eternal Harmony"

1365
01:27:41,364 --> 01:27:43,263
Just think of all the good things
I've done for you.

1366
01:27:43,331 --> 01:27:46,093
See how Grand Master has a smile
on her face?

1367
01:27:46,165 --> 01:27:47,324
The key is...

1368
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:49,423
"One eye open, one eye closed"!

1369
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:52,865
Grand Master is smarter than that.

1370
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,293
That's superficial!

1371
01:27:55,367 --> 01:27:56,628
Keep thinking.

1372
01:27:56,701 --> 01:27:58,531
There must be hints.

1373
01:28:02,369 --> 01:28:04,801
There's a clue under the skirt!

1374
01:28:09,604 --> 01:28:11,594
"One eye open, one eye closed."

1375
01:28:11,672 --> 01:28:13,638
"Remember the good and not the bad."

1376
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,694
"This is where the answer lies."

1377
01:28:15,772 --> 01:28:19,331
"May eternal harmony bless you all."

1378
01:28:44,612 --> 01:28:45,703
That's what I said.

1379
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:47,802
No it's different.

1380
01:29:22,854 --> 01:29:24,377
Congratulations, May.

1381
01:29:24,588 --> 01:29:27,282
He proved his affection for you.

1382
01:29:27,754 --> 01:29:29,380
You've recovered, Big Sister.

1383
01:29:30,388 --> 01:29:32,651
If a relationship can cause so much pain,

1384
01:29:32,723 --> 01:29:35,315
it's because
it also brought much happiness.

1385
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:41,424
This is the meaning of love.

1386
01:29:47,693 --> 01:29:49,716
You've recovered.

1387
01:29:50,293 --> 01:29:51,657
Welcome back, Master!

1388
01:29:51,727 --> 01:29:53,750
Welcome back, Master!

1389
01:30:00,329 --> 01:30:02,159
What are you thinking about?

1390
01:30:03,263 --> 01:30:06,491
I want to create one more move after
"Eternal Harmony".

1391
01:30:06,563 --> 01:30:08,120
How should I name it?

1392
01:30:08,197 --> 01:30:09,561
Let's see.

1393
01:30:10,564 --> 01:30:12,428
How about "Sons & Daughters"?

1394
01:30:12,498 --> 01:30:13,657
Good...

1395
01:30:13,732 --> 01:30:15,323
What's the key?

1396
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:17,592
"Eternal Harmony" focuses on
only the good thoughts.

1397
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:20,860
"Sons & Daughters" focuses on
the bad thoughts.

1398
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,430
How bad?

1399
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,194
Like this.
