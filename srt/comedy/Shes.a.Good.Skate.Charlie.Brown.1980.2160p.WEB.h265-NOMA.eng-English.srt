I think you should try eating
a couple of eggs for breakfast, sir.

You think that might help me stay awake,

That was a joke, sir.

I've been thinking
about your problem, sir.

37
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:20,200
Maybe you fall asleep in class
because of uncorrected astigmatism.

38

Oh, sure. You'd love to see me
wearing glasses, wouldn't you, Marcie?

You've got it all wrong, Marcie.

The reason I'm falling asleep in class
is simple.

I've been getting up every morning
at 4:30 to practice skating.

That's crazy, sir.

No one should have to get up at 4:30.

Marcie! This is the worst skating dress
I've ever seen.

It doesn't even have any sleeves in it.

00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:13,353
I'll be the laughingstock
of the whole competition.

If you will recall, sir,
I told you I didn't know how to sew.

00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,194

Coach, look at this skating dress.

That stupid Marcie has ruined everything.

What am I going to do?

170
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,676
When a skater is feeling low, she should
be able to cry on a pro's shoulder.

Okay, Coach, turn around and look.

How do I look?

You look beautiful, sir.

There's only one thing wrong. My hair.

How can I look beautiful
when I have hair that is mousy-blah?

If I'm gonna look nice
for the skating competition,

you'll have to help me with my hair.
