1
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:03,962
Come on, Joey!

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,549
I told you everything I knew
last night.

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,427
It's not that big a deal.
So they're doing it.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,305
I cannot believe you would say that!

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:18,143
Sorry. Monica and Chandler
are making love.

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:22,022
No, I mean, come on.
This is a huge deal!

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,650
I need more details.
Who initiated the first kiss?

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,278
I don't know.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,864
Is he romantic with her?

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,491
I don't know.

11
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,119
Are they in love?

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,747
I don't know.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,499
You don't know anything.

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,376
I know one thing.

15
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,420
They did it right there.

16
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,216
The One with Chandler's Work Laugh

17
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,643
Could I have a scone?

18
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,436
Want to hear some good news?

19
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,688
Someone I know is getting married.

20
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,026
Weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, it's my ex-wife, Emily!

21
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,361
Sorry, man.

22
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,949
- Here's your scone.
- Thanks.

23
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:00,579
Stupid British snack food!

24
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,916
Did they teach you that
in anger management?

25
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,795
You know what might
help you deal with it?

26
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,382
You two are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.

27
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:17,054
Are you still mad about, you know,
the Louisiana Purchase?

28
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,847
Nobody's mad about that.

29
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:23,310
Exactly!
Because it's in the past.

30
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,315
Anybody going to eat that?

31
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:34,780
Look at us all dressed up for the party.
What are we celebrating?

32
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,492
We had a lot of liquor
left over from Christmas.

33
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:43,455
Our friends aren't here. We can be
a real couple. We don't have to hide.

34
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,416
I know. I can do this.

35
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,795
And I can do this.

36
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,547
We can't do that.

37
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,718
Hey, Bing!

38
00:02:55,968 --> 00:03:00,598
Who's the pretty lady,
and what is she doing with you?

39
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,267
I asked myself
that very question, sir.

40
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,435
My boss, Doug.

41
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,270
- This is Monica.
- Hi.

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,649
- This is my wife, Kara.
- Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,903
Did you hear about the new law firm
working for us?

44
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,989
Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.

45
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,454
Let's go drink our body weight.

46
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,831
What was that?

47
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,125
That noise you made?

48
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,168
Oh, my work laugh.

49
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,337
Your work laugh?

50
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:35,800
If you're going to survive this party,
come up with one too.

51
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,094
All right. Check me out.

52
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,474
He says, "$30, Father.
Same as in town."

53
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,232
Everybody at work loved you last night.

54
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,443
And they like me more
just because I was with you.

55
00:03:55,694 --> 00:04:00,157
You repaired the damage
from when they met Joey.

56
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,953
Doug wants to play tennis.
He never talks to me outside of work.

57
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:08,040
Except for that time
at that strip club.

58
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,085
Strip church.

59
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,464
- I'll go find a racket.
- I thought you had one.

60
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,801
I used to, but then Joey thought
it'd be fun to go hit rocks...

61
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,846
...at bigger rocks.

62
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,806
Do you have a tennis racket?

63
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:28,727
I lent it to Joey and
I've never gotten it back.

64
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,688
Good luck with that.

65
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,901
What's up?

66
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,654
Why are you here?
I thought you had inventory.

67
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,323
I do, but I decided I'd take
a long lunch...

68
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,077
...and spend some time
with my friend, Monica.

69
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,871
You know, I feel like
we don't talk anymore.

70
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,497
How are you?

71
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,834
What is new with you?

72
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,048
Not much. Work's good.

73
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:01,968
We don't have to talk about work.
Talk about anything.

74
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,597
You know what?

75
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,391
Let's talk about relationships.

76
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,934
What's going on?

77
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,520
Nothing.

78
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,814
You go.

79
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,401
There was this guy at the bank
that I thought was cute.

80
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,237
But I don't anymore.

81
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,115
That's juicy.

82
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,535
You know what? I actually do
have a lot of work to do.

83
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,289
You're sure there's just
not anything else?

84
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,917
I'm sure. Is there something
you want to talk to me about?

85
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,962
No!

86
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,552
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.

87
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,811
Then what happened?

88
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,651
You'll get your turn.

89
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,446
- Hey, Pheebs. What's going on?
- Nothing.

90
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,865
This is not over.

91
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,075
No, no, no!

92
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:10,746
I was up all night writing
this nasty letter to Emily.

93
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,832
It was perfect,
and now it's all covered in...

94
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,376
Actually, thanks!

95
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,338
All right!
Ready to go to the movies?

96
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,590
Actually, I think I'll skip it.

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,632
Really?

98
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,345
I'll read my book.
I just want to be alone right now.

99
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,888
Sure you don't want to?

100
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:33,727
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
They get mail and stuff.

101
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,353
That's okay, Joe.

102
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,732
Let's go, Pheebs.

103
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,916
Game!

104
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,879
I got to tell you, that partner
of yours is a real tiger.

105
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,215
Are you all right?

106
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:08,929
We'll just get
a little sip of water.

107
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,890
Am I on fire today or what?

108
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,895
Those birds are browned,
basted and ready to be carved.

109
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,440
Okay, easy, Martina.

110
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,152
I think we should let them
win the next game.

111
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:27,448
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you just said.

112
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,741
Let them win one.

113
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:33,245
Are you crazy? We own those two.
Look at them!

114
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,332
He can't even breathe,
and she's popping pills.

115
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,210
You're not giving them a chance.

116
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,504
They have rackets.

117
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,257
We'll make this the last game.

118
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,427
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.

119
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,096
Are you sure you never played pro?

120
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,472
Please let them win.

121
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:58,020
I'll take it down to 95%,
but that's the best I can do.

122
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,694
- Missed it!
- I got it!

123
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,574
Nice shot.

124
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,792
I got it!

125
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,171
Long!

126
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,303
I can't believe you let them win.

127
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,848
Well, at least you hid
your feelings well about it.

128
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,182
I was frustrated.

129
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,351
It's my racket.

130
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,852
Frustrated with you!

131
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:43,607
If we hadn't lost, they would never have
invited us to dinner tomorrow.

132
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,858
What bothers me...

133
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,569
...is how different
you act around them.

134
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,655
The throwing the tennis games,
the fake laugh...

135
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:55,994
...the "See you later, Bing!"
"Not if I see you first, Doug!"

136
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,666
I don't like "work Chandler".
The guy's a suck-up.

137
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,751
Because you said that...

138
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,421
...I'm not putting out tonight!

139
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,305
Something's wrong.
My brother doesn't stay out all night.

140
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:19,226
Maybe we should check
the trash chute.

141
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,603
Ross couldn't fit
down the trash chute.

142
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,106
That's right. He almost could.

143
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:28,360
Which is exactly
how I got stuck there.

144
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,030
Oh, my God!

145
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,533
Where the hell have you been?

146
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,994
Just, you know, out.

147
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:41,915
Oh, out! God, I don't know
why we didn't think to check there.

148
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,458
What were you doing?

149
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,503
I went to a bar and then...

150
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,173
...I just walked around for a while.

151
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:55,095
You walked around all night
in the city by yourself?

152
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,139
He hooked up!

153
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,850
He hooked up.

154
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,270
I don't have to answer your questions.
I'm a big boy.

155
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,813
I can do what I want.

156
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,857
He hooked up!

157
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,111
Tell us about her!

158
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,364
Ross, you left your scarf...

159
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:24,208
Hey, you guys.

160
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:37,471
I know what you all are thinking,
but Chandler is in Yemen.

161
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,891
I'm a young woman. I have needs.
I can't wait forever.

162
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,770
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

163
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,566
So I'm asking you, please
just take a moment before you judge me.

164
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,652
Nobody's judging you.

165
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:58,658
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

166
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,163
...call me.

167
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,714
I know what you guys are going to say.

168
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:16,135
You two would have
very hairy children.

169
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,012
I didn't know you'd say that.

170
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,182
Ross! Janice?

171
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,350
All right. Hold on, hold on.

172
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,352
This is Ross.

173
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,730
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.

174
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,983
He obviously lost his mind.

175
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:35,487
I didn't lose my mind, okay?
Janice and I have a lot in common.

176
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,824
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.

177
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,952
Are you going to see her again?

178
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,955
- Don't put ideas in his head!
- I will see her.

179
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,792
Damn it, Phoebe!

180
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,631
I have to tell you something
that I've never admitted.

181
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:59,095
In high school, I made out with James
even though I knew you liked him.

182
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:04,099
That feels so good to get off my chest.
Okay, you go.

183
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:08,186
My turn? What are you talking about?

184
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:12,608
I know about you and Chandler.

185
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,819
I overheard you
on the phone the other day.

186
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,240
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing
laundry for a couple of hours."

187
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,410
And he said, "Laundry?
Is that my new nickname?"

188
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,537
And you said:

189
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:31,334
"You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."

190
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:39,885
You're writing yourself
a little play there, Rach.

191
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,139
Let me know how it turns out.

192
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,726
I wouldn't know because I got
so freaked out I hung up the phone.

193
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,353
Well, if you had kept listening...

194
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,149
...you would have heard me
call him Mister...

195
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,318
...Bigot.

196
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,780
Mr. Bigot.

197
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:04,326
He tells the most racist jokes.

198
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,828
All right. So that's it.

199
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,791
There's nothing going on
between you and Chandler?

200
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,795
Me and Chandler?

201
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,216
Put your $20 down.

202
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,678
First one to find
the tasty treat wins, okay?

203
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:27,891
All right, let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

204
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,144
And they're off!

205
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,480
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge?

206
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,192
Judge rules no violation.

207
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:45,034
It's so weird to say this,
but I just had a great date with Janice.

208
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,661
- What?
- Are you serious?

209
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:51,748
I opened up to her about all
the stuff that's been happening to me.

210
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,834
I mean, I talked for hours.

211
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,210
It is amazing...

212
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,130
...to have someone give you
such focused attention.

213
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,134
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.

214
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,345
The duck gets the Nutter Butter!

215
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,349
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!

216
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,892
Judge rules...

217
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,102
...Nutter Butter.

218
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,355
Tough call.

219
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:23,113
Seriously, I strongly believe that
we should support President Clinton...

220
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,741
...and her husband, Bill.

221
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,703
How do you like your coffee?

222
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,872
- None for me.
- A little sugar.

223
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:37,252
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.
That will sweeten it up.

224
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,133
- That laugh doesn't give you a headache?
- You get used to it.

225
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,801
I don't think that I can.

226
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,471
This will be it for me
on the work things.

227
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,098
I laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?

228
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,893
I'd rather not be with
this work-weasel guy...

229
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:57,898
...when I can be with my boyfriend,
who I actually respect.

230
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:05,155
I got to apologize for Kara's coffee.
I'd feel sorry for it in a fight.

231
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,743
It's not strong enough
to defend itself.

232
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,414
Hear what I said?

233
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,542
What?

234
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,086
It's a joke.
What's the matter with you?

235
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,381
Well, I just didn't think
it was funny, sir.

236
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,883
Excuse me?

237
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,260
- Well, I just...
- Honey?

238
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,723
I just don't think
you understood the joke.

239
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:31,849
Really?

240
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:36,437
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.

241
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,690
You see, Kara's coffee
is weak-tasting.

242
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,487
But what Doug did was imply
that it was weak physically.

243
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,784
- You get it now, honey?
- I think I do!

244
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:57,541
- Thank you, Monica.
- I thought you could use the help.

245
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,420
Coffee in a fight!

246
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:09,344
You mind if I read
my comic books in here?

247
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,264
Sure. Why?

248
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:17,352
Chandler and Monica are over there.
It's kind of hard to concentrate.

249
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:21,148
She just called and said
she was going to be working late.

250
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,108
She keeps lying to me.

251
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:28,947
That's it! I'm going over there
and confronting them right now.

252
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:43,003
All right, so you're telling me
that I have to tell racist jokes now?

253
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,213
I'm just not very good at this.

254
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,258
I'm a terrible liar.
I hate having to lie to Rachel.

255
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,220
- But we're not ready to tell yet.
- I know.

256
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,183
Ever since high school, Rachel was the
one person that I told everything to.

257
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,435
I miss that so much now.

258
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,314
She's my best friend.

259
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:13,241
Oh, my God, Rachel!

260
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,330
What are you doing here?

261
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,709
Well, I actually came over here
to borrow this lamp...

262
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,504
...to look at my books.

263
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:29,258
You know, see them a little better.

264
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:32,386
Okay, great.

265
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:36,056
Well, what I was doing
in Chandler's room is that...

266
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:39,100
...I was cleaning it.

267
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,603
He pays me to clean it.

268
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:46,275
What a great way to make
some extra pocket money.

269
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:49,737
When I said to you earlier
that I was at work...

270
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,072
...I'm at my new work.

271
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:56,201
Good enough. Right?

272
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,624
I'll go look at my books.

273
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:06,128
Go get back to my new job.

274
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:14,637
Congratulations on your new job!

275
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,854
Man, she is really gullible.

276
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,569
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

277
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,363
- Actually, I should get going.
- You're sure?

278
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,699
I can stay out as late as you want.

279
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,076
I told you I'm on
sabbatical from work...

280
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:41,288
Yes, yes. You did.

281
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,583
- Oh, man!
- What is wrong now?

282
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,877
This isn't what I ordered.

283
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:51,673
Man! Can't anything
go right in my life?

284
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:55,010
First, my marriage falls apart,
and then...

285
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,303
I know!

286
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,181
You lose your apartment,
you lose your job...

287
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:04,937
...your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!

288
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,857
We need to talk.

289
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,444
- Sometimes I feel...
- No, no, don't.

290
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,322
I'm going to talk.

291
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:16,990
I believe...

292
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,035
...that the sun has set...

293
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:25,040
...on our day in the sun.

294
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:31,004
You're a very sweet person, Ross.

295
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,549
Unfortunately...

296
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:39,388
...I just don't think I can take
another second of you whining!

297
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:45,144
Let me make sure
I'm hearing this right.

298
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,898
You're ending this with me because...

299
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,192
...I'm too whiny?

300
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,862
So you're saying...

301
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:59,283
...I've become so whiny...

302
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,160
...that I...

303
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,039
...annoy you...

304
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:06,999
...Janice.

305
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,500
Well, yeah!

306
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,837
Oh, my God!

307
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,257
Will you be okay?

308
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,760
I am now.

309
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,274
I guess, that's two out of three...

310
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,235
...Joey!

311
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:46,747
Dude, we got to talk.

312
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:50,792
I want to tell you something before
you heard it from someone else.

313
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:55,172
I hope this isn't too weird but...

314
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:59,551
...I had a thing with Janice.

315
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,264
You're not mad?

316
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:05,683
Why would I be mad?

317
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:09,103
Because there's certain rules
about this kind of stuff.

318
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:14,608
You don't fool around with
your friends' ex-girlfriends...

319
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:19,196
...or possible girlfriends
or girls they're related to.

320
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,203
I am mad.

321
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,872
But you know,
I'm going to forgive you.

322
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,082
Because that's what friends do.

323
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:35,587
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.

324
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:37,089
Thank you.

325
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,966
But I want you to remember...

326
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:43,095
...that I forgave you.

327
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:48,308
I also want you to remember
that I let you live here rent-free.

328
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,852
All right.

329
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:53,564
And I want you to remember
that I gave you...

330
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,817
...twenty-seven dollars.

331
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,193
No strings attached!

332
00:21:58,443 --> 00:21:59,819
If you can't remember that...

333
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,324
...we should write it down.
Let's write it down!
