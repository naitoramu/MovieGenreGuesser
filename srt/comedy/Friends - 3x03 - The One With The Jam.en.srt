1
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,760
Joe, that's why your parents
told you not to jump on the bed!

2
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,160
The One With the Jam

00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,440

4
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,320
Hey, look at me!
I' m making jam!

5
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,530
-I've been at it since 4 a.m.
-Where'd you get fruit at 4 a.m.?

6
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,530
Down at the docks.
You know, you can get it wholesale.

7
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,970
I didn't know there were docks.

8
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,920
Is it broken?

9
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,480
No, but I gotta wear this
for a couple weeks.

10
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,680
You tell the doctor you did it
jumping on your bed?

11
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,640
No. I had a whole story
worked out, but then. . .

12
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,210
. . .Chandler sold me out.

13
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,320
I didn't think the doctor would buy
that it "fell out of the socket. "

14
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,840
What is this? Fruit?

15
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,160
Monica's making jam.

16
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,000
Jam? I love jam! How come
we never have jam at our place?

17
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,240
Because the kids need new shoes.

18
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,240
I' m going into business. I' m sick of
being depressed about Richard.

19
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,010
I needed a plan.
A plan to get over my man.

20
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,120
What's the opposite of man? Jam!

21
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,200
Joey, don't! It's way too hot!

22
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,880
This'll just be my batch.

23
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,120
That's it.

24
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,760
Hey, you, J . Crew guy. . . .

25
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,690
Why are you following me?

26
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,080
All week, everywhere I look,
there's you.

27
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,690
You wouldn't return my calls.
You sent back my letters.

28
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,040
One more chance, Ursula. Please.

29
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,640
This is awkward.

30
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,160
Yeah, because you want Ursula,
and I' m Phoebe. Twin sisters.

31
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,920
Seriously.

32
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,600
That's great.
I' m stalking the wrong woman.

33
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,960
I am such a dingus!

34
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,320
Oh, you' re not a dingus.

35
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,000
I just want you to know
I wasn't always like this.

36
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,560
Before I met your sister, I was a
normal guy who sold cellular phones.

37
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,000
Look, it's not your fault.

38
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,680
I mean, this is just
what she does to guys, okay?

39
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,600
Well, thanks.

40
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,280
Wait. I got a little story.

41
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,280
Once, in junior high school,
I thought I was a witch.

42
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,010
And a guidance counselor told me
something that might help you.

43
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,960
He said, "Okay, you' re not a witch.
You' re just an average student. "

44
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,720
-See what I' m saying?
-Not really.

45
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,560
Well, get over it.

46
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,480
You seem like a really nice guy.

47
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,960
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?

48
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,160
You' re right. I know you' re right.
And thanks for being so nice.

49
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,370
Thanks a lot.

50
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,450
Want to get some coffee?

51
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,720
You don't have to
walk behind me anymore.

52
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,440
"Gone for more jars. Be back later.
Monica Geller. "

53
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,810
Wait a minute. Look!

54
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,720
It's an empty apartment.

55
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,960
We' re all alone
in an empty apartment.

56
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,320
I have to be at work
in 1 0 minutes.

57
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,120
All right. It's not like
I' m employee of the year or anything.

58
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,240
There it is!

59
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,370
Oh, that's what you mean.

60
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,320
Do I look fat?

61
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,240
No.

62
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,440
I accept that.

63
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,090
When Janice asked me and I said no,
she thought I was calling her a cow.

64
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,840
Walk us through it, honey.
Walk us through it.

65
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,240
Janice said, "Hi. Do I look fat
today?" And I looked at her--

66
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,280
You looked at her?

67
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,240
You never look.

68
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,330
You just answer. It's like a reflex.
"Do I look fat?" "No. "

69
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,520
"Is she prettier than I am?"
"No. "

70
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,880
"Does size matter?"

71
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,480
And it works both ways.

72
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,520
So you both just
know this stuff?

73
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,970
After 30 or 40 fights,
you kind of catch on.

74
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,160
Okay. For instance:

75
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,440
Janice is coming back from a trip.
She gives you two options.

76
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,770
Option one: She'll take a cab
home from the airport.

77
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,360
Option two: You can meet her
at baggage claim. What do you do?

78
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,600
Easy. Baggage claim.

79
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,600
Wrong! Now you' re single.

80
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,920
It's actually secret
option number three.

81
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,490
You meet her at the gate. That way
she knows you love her.

82
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,850
Okay, this is good.

83
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,480
All right, I have one.
Janice likes to cuddle. . .

84
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,040
. . .at night,
which I' m all for.

85
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,760
But when you want to go to sleep,
you want some space.

86
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,560
So how do I tell her that without. . .

87
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,920
. . .you know, accidentally
calling her fat or something?

88
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,480
Sorry, honey. We can't help you
there, because we' re cuddly sleepers.

89
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,450
I' m late for work.

90
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,040
-Are you guys coming down?
-Yeah. I' m right behind you.

91
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,050
Good luck, Chandler.

92
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,680
The sleeping thing.

93
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,240
very tricky business,
but solvable.

94
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,080
I thought you were "cuddly sleepers. "

95
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,840
No, not cuddly.
Not me. Just her.

96
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,080
I' m like you.
I need the room.

97
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,600
Okay, come here.

98
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,210
Okay. You' re in bed.

99
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,080
I'll use the cushion.

100
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,440
Okay. You' re in bed.
She's over on your side, cuddling.

101
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,600
Now, you wait for her to drift off. . .

102
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,960
. . .and then you hug her. . .

103
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,880
. . .and roll her over
to her side of the bed.

104
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,850
And then you. . .

105
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,120
. . .roll away.

106
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,560
Hug for her.

107
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,600
Roll for you.

108
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,720
The old "hug and roll. "

109
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,600
One question. You' re pretending
the pillow's a girl, right?

110
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,160
Remember when you were a kid, your
mom would send you to the movies. . .

111
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,880
. . .with a jar of jam
and a little spoon?

112
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,690
You' re so pretty.

113
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,280
You know that guy who's been
following me? I talked to him today.

114
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,000
You talked to him?
Are you crazy?

115
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,720
First, I' m not crazy.
And second, say it, don't spray it.

116
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,200
Anyway, his name is Malcolm,
and he wasn't following me.

117
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,080
I mean, he was,
but he thought I was Ursula.

118
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,770
That's why he couldn't just
come up and talk to me.

119
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,250
Because of the restraining order.

120
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,400
Not feeling better about Malcolm.

121
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,930
No, no, he's not a kook.

122
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,040
He's just this very passionate,
incredibly romantic guy. . .

123
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,050
. . .that just got
a teensy bit carried away.

124
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,970
We get along really well,
and he's so cute.

125
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,480
Oh, my God! You've got a crush
on your sister's stalker.

126
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,840
I' m going to help him get
"de-Ursula-ized. "

127
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,050
Like I did for Joey
after he went out with her.

128
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,440
I didn't stalk her.

129
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,000
I asked for the news,
not the weather.

130
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,370
Joey, this is for you.
It's blackberry currant.

131
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,530
Joe, I got to ask.

132
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,450
The girl from the xerox place,
buck naked. . .

133
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,520
. . .or a big tub of jam?

134
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,930
Put your hands together.

135
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,360
Take your time with that.
It's my last batch.

136
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,520
No more jam?

137
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,520
What happened to
your jam plan?

138
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,120
I figured out I'd need to charge
$ 1 7 a jar just to break even.

139
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,400
So I've got a new plan now.
Babies.

140
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, you'll need
much bigger jars.

141
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,480
-What are you talking about?
-About me having a baby.

142
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,840
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

143
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,210
The jam plan helped me
take control of my life.

144
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,210
So I thought, "What is
the most important thing to me?"

145
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,240
And that's when I came up
with the baby plan.

146
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,800
Aren't you forgetting something?

147
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,970
What is that guy's name?
Dad!

148
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,200
It took me 28 years to find a man
I wanted to spend my life with.

149
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,320
If I have to wait another 28 years,
I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.

150
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,330
And that's just stupid.

151
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,490
That's what's stupid?

152
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,490
I don't need an actual man.
Just a few of his best swimmers.

153
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,120
And there are places
you can go to get that. . .stuff.

154
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,280
Down to the docks again?

155
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,480
Night-night, Bing-a-ling.

156
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,640
Night-night. . .

157
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,640
. . .Janice.

158
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,000
Look at all the room on her side!

159
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,200
A giant penguin
could fit over there.

160
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,600
That'd be weird, though.

161
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,730
Hug and roll time.

162
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,120
I'm hugging. I'm hugging.

163
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,640
You're rolling, and....

164
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,760
Yes! Freedom!

165
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,320
Except for this arm!

166
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,160
I'm stuck. Stuck arm.

167
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,930
Time for the old tablecloth trick.
One fluid motion.

168
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,770
Quick like a cat.

169
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,440
And one, two...

170
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,200
... three!

171
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,130
Here's my binoculars.

172
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,760
Oh, great.
You' re doing great.

173
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,000
Going strong. Keep going.

174
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,400
These are my night-vision goggles.

175
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,720
This is the book I pretend to read
when I' m watching her in the park.

176
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,960
And these are Madlibs.
They' re just for fun.

177
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,080
This is the log I kept,
recording her every movement.

178
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,360
Want to hear some of it?

179
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,240
Not even a little bit.

180
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,600
It's about you.

181
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,480
Okay then.

182
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,170
"I met Phoebe today.

183
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,650
She was really nice to me
even though I' m such a loser.

184
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,720
And when I was walking home,
I thought about her a lot.

185
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,880
It was weird, but kind of cool. "

186
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,960
Good.

187
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,250
So what were you thinking?

188
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,840
I was thinking what it'd be
like to kiss you.

189
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,370
-Really?
-No.

190
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,960
That's just something I said now
so that maybe I could kiss you.

191
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,640
Oh, okay.

192
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,450
No, it's all right.
I just had a jar of mustard.

193
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,800
Okay. Sperm donor number 0381 5,
come on down!

194
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,650
Okay, he's 6' 2", 1 70 pounds.

195
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,850
He describes himself
as a male Gina Davis.

196
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,970
You mean there's
more than one of us?

197
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,890
You can't do this, Mon.
If you do this, I'll--

198
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,640
-You'll what?
-I'll tell Mom.

199
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,200
I' m sorry, but he's right.
I love you, but you' re crazy.

200
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,960
Why? Why is this crazy?

201
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,800
-So this isn't the ideal way--
-Oh, it's not--

202
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,770
Lips moving. Still talking.

203
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,920
It may not be ideal, but. . .

204
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,890
. . .I' m so ready.

205
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,520
I see the way
Ben looks at you.

206
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,360
It makes me ache, you know?

207
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,680
Check it out! Jam crackers!

208
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,920
Okay. All right, how's this?

209
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,840
Twenty-seven, ltalian-American guy.

210
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,600
He's an actor.

211
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,480
Born in Queens.

212
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,800
Wow! Big family.
Seven sisters. . .

213
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,720
. . .and he's the only. . .boy.

214
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,320
Oh, my God! Under personal comments:
"New York Knicks rule. "

215
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,010
Yeah, the Knicks rule!

216
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,650
Joey, this is you!

217
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,480
Let me see.

218
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,920
Oh, right!

219
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,880
You went to a sperm bank?

220
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,760
Right after I did that
sex study at NYU.

221
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,610
Remember that sweater I gave you?

222
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,720
That's how you bought it?

223
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,640
No. That's what I was wearing
when I donated.

224
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,650
I' m surprised there's any
of my boys left.

225
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,160
It is pretty competitive. There's
an actual rocket scientist here.

226
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,200
Maybe I should have them put my
Days of our Lives gig on here.

227
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,370
Juice this up a little.

228
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,210
How's the maniac?

229
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,080
He's yummy.
We did a little kissing.

230
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,210
Phoebe, what are you doing?

231
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,600
No, no. He's not into that anymore.
He quit for me.

232
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,880
This guy has been obsessed with
your sister for God knows how long.

233
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,650
You don't just give that up.

234
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,130
He gave me his night-vision
goggles and everything.

235
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,840
You' re taking the word of a guy
who has night-vision goggles?

236
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,760
He's not still following her.
You think he's still following her?

237
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,880
Wake up and smell
the restraining order.

238
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,000
What should I do?

239
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,130
If you really like this guy,
you should just trust him.

240
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,850
Thank you, Monica.

241
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,200
Or you could follow him.

242
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,480
That's what I'd do.
Forget mine.

243
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,160
What happened?

244
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,640
Crazy Chandler spun me. . .

245
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,360
. . .off the bed.

246
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,280
Wow! Spinning!
Sounds like fun.

247
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,720
I wish.

248
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,360
He was just trying
Ross' "hug and roll" thing.

249
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,200
Ross' what?

250
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,640
Where he hugs you
and then he rolls you away, and. . . .

251
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,240
Oh. . .my. . .God!

252
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,120
What are you doing?

253
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,490
Oh, I was just here looking
for my. . .my. . . .

254
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,920
Part of an old sandwich.
Here it is!

255
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,120
Were you following me?

256
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,080
Perhaps.

257
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,530
Yes. I' m sorry.

258
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,690
I was afraid you were still
hung up on my sister.

259
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,720
So you spied on me.

260
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,600
I can't believe
you don't trust me.

261
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,360
Well, what do you know?
There goes my identical twin sister!

262
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,120
Just walking along, looking like me.

263
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,280
Is this a freakish coincidence, or
did you know she takes this train?

264
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,560
I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

265
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,400
I tried to stop,
but I couldn't.

266
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,650
I' m so pathetic.

267
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,600
No, it's not your fault.
It's partly my fault.

268
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,320
I made you quit cold turkey.

269
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,400
Well, I can't date you anymore
because you' re, you know. . . .

270
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,760
Wow!

271
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,730
But I will definitely help you
get over my sister. Okay?

272
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,720
Stalk me for a while, huh?

273
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,880
I'll be like an Ursula patch.

274
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,160
I don't know.

275
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,560
Just. . . .
Look, I' m going!

276
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,080
Come on.

277
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,480
I' m on the pillar.
Which way will I go?

278
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,880
-Where you going?
-To the bank.

279
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,040
Sperm or regular?

280
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,880
Sperm.

281
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,400
You' re really doing it?

282
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,320
Oh, yeah. I picked a guy.
37 1 35.

283
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,160
Sounds nice.

284
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,080
He does. He's got
brown hair and green eyes.

285
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,690
No kidding?

286
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,920
I figured you'd have picked
a blond.

287
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,960
Really? Why?

288
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,320
I always pictured you with a tall,
smart, blond guy with a name like. . .

289
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,360
. . .Hoyt.

290
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,120
It's a name. Yeah.

291
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,640
I saw you in this great house
with a big pool.

292
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,080
Is he a swimmer?

293
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,440
He's got the body for it.

294
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,010
I like that.

295
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,600
What?

296
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,840
You have a sign that says:

297
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,040
"We don't swim in your toilet.
Don't pee in our pool. "

298
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,760
We don't have that sign.

299
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,490
You do!
It was a gift from me.

300
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,810
And you have three great kids.

301
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,680
Two girls and a boy?

302
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,610
And they wear little water wings,
and they run around on the deck.

303
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,450
And Hoyt wraps a towel
around all three of them.

304
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,480
Sure.

305
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,520
But, you know,
this way sounds good too.

306
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,320
Yeah.

307
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,680
Wow! This guy's an astronaut?

308
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,240
That would have been cool. . .

309
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,480
. . .for a day.

310
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,240
I called the sperm bank.

311
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,450
They haven't sold a single unit
of Tribbiani.

312
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,530
Nobody wants my product.

313
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,280
I don't get it.

314
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,360
Maybe if they met me in person.

315
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,720
You got a thing on your. . . .

316
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,120
Get it?

317
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,400
Yeah.

318
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,680
Hello.

319
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,520
Hello.

320
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,920
Chan, can I talk to you
for a second?

321
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,480
Sure. What's up?

322
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,050
Just one additional
relationship thought.

323
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,560
Something you' re probably aware of.

324
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,680
Women talk.
