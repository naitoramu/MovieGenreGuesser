1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,630
So I told Carl, nobody, no matter
how famous their parents are. . .

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,120
. . .is allowed to climb
on the dinosaur.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,360
Of course, it went
right in one ear. . . .

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,240
I love how he cares so much
about stuff.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,870
If I squint, I can pretend
he's Alan Alda.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,520
Oh, good. Another dinosaur story.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,510
When are those gonna become extinct?

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,710
If I was a superhero who could fly
and be invisible...

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,110
... that would be the best.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,910
What does Rachel see in this guy?

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,240
I love Rachel.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I wish she was my wife.

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,230
Who's singing?

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,430
The One With the Race Car Bed

16
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,560
When you guys were kids
and you played Happy Days...

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,240
. . .who were you?
I was Richie.

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,000
I was always Joanie.

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,520
Question: Was "Egg the Gellers! "
the war cry of your neighborhood?

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,320
It's the Mattress King!

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,750
Change the channel!

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,310
Wait! I want to see this!
After I divorce him. . .

23
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,520
. . .half of that kingdom
is gonna be mine!

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,560
Despair fills the mattress showroom.

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,640
My Kingdom is suddenly
without a Queen.

26
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,320
I'm so depressed...

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,000
...l'm going to slash...

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,190
...my prices!

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,280
Check it out!

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,120
599 for a California king!

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,240
499 for a pillow-top queen set!

32
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,710
I'm going medieval on prices!

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,360
What a wank!

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,710
I cannot believe he's using
our divorce to sell mattresses!

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,760
I know. At $499 for a pillow-top
queen, who cares about the divorce?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,310
Those babies will sell themselves!

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,040
And I' m appalled for you, by the way.

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,520
I'm close! I'm cheap! I'm the King!

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,320
Okay, Daddy. We'll see you
tomorrow night. Okay, bye-bye.

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,750
"We"?

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,200
--are having dinner with my Dad
tomorrow night. I hope that's okay.

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,360
Oh, shoot!
Tomorrow's not good.

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,910
I' m supposed to fall off
the Empire State Building. . .

44
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,600
. . .and land on a bicycle
with no seat, so. . . .

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,160
My father doesn't hate you.

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,040
Please. He refers to me
as "Wet-Head. "

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,720
Honey, he calls everybody
by a nickname.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,960
I know. Just one dinner.
One night. For me. Please?

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,960
I just want him to love you like I do.

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,760
All right. Well, not exactly
like I do.

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,560
But if you do come to dinner. . .

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,920
. . .I'll love you like I do
in that black thing that you like.

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,640
I'll go.

54
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,320
Fine.

55
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you.

56
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,760
Hi, Gunther.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
Yeah. We'll see.

58
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,350
Hey, you guys!

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,790
Guess what.

60
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
-I got a gig!
-Great!

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,320
That's why I can never be an actor.
I can't say "gig. "

62
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,520
I can't say "croissant. "
Oh, my God!

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,040
-What's the part?
-It's not a part.

64
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,120
I' m teaching Acting for Soap Operas
at the Learning Extension.

65
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,640
Come on! That's great!

66
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,110
It's my chance to give
something back. . .

67
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,510
. . .to the acting community.

68
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
You' re probably not allowed to sleep
with your students.

69
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,510
I know.

70
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,120
I don't know, Monica.
It feels funny just being here.

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,920
If you buy a bed from
Janice's ex-husband. . .

72
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,800
. . .it's like betraying Chandler.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,640
Not at these prices!

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,710
You know, in England this car would be
on the other side of the store.

75
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,920
Come here.

76
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,950
This is my new bed!

77
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,350
You gotta feel this bad boy!

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,920
Monica, it still feels so weird,
you know?

79
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,520
Chandler's your friend.

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,160
Oh, my God!

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,120
All right, take this bed.
You can make other friends.

82
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,470
Good evening.

83
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,880
I am Mr. Tribbiani.

84
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,440
And I will be teaching
Acting for Soap Operas.

85
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,840
Now. . .

86
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,400
. . .on my first day as Dr. Drake
Ramoray on Days Of Our Lives...

87
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,040
. . .I learned one of the most important
things in soap opera acting. . .

88
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,480
. . .is reacting.

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,110
This does not mean acting again.

90
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,560
It means you don't have a line,
but someone else just did.

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,720
And it goes something like this.

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,200
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

93
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,960
By the way, before I forget.
To work in soap operas. . .

94
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,590
. . .some of you will have to
become more attractive.

95
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,240
All right, moving right along. . . .

96
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,120
-How was teaching last night?
-Great! You get to say stuff like. . .

97
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,680
. . . "Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you.
I dismiss you. "

98
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,110
Oh, nice.

99
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,790
Oh, and I got an audition
for All My Children!

100
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,920
It's this great part.

101
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,400
This boxer named Nick.

102
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,240
And I' m so, so right for it.
He's just like me.

103
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,160
Except that he's a boxer. . .

104
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
. . .and has an evil twin.

105
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,880
Hear ye, hear ye!
Delivery from the Mattress King!

106
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,640
You Miss Geller?

107
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
Sign here.

108
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,760
Do I have a middle name?

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,720
All right. Monica "Felula" . . .

110
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,710
. . .Geller.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,480
It's that bedroom there.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,440
Monica bought a bed
from the Mattress King?

113
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,840
Please, please, please
don't say anything to Chandler.

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,680
-You want me to lie to him?
-Is that a problem?

115
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,920
Oh, hey, "Nick the boxer. "
Let's see what you got!

116
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,720
All right, put them up.

117
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,120
Hey, you' re pretty good at this.

118
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,440
I had to learn.
I was staying at the "Y" . . .

119
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,720
. . .and some of the young men
weren't acting Christian enough.

120
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,160
Hey, now!

121
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,360
And I' m bleeding.
Okay, great.

122
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,920
Wow! And I' m a vegetarian!

123
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,560
I' m sorry.
We'll put some ice on it.

124
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,440
Put your head back.

125
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,160
-I can't see.
-I have you.

126
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
Oh, God!

127
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,550
Which bedroom do you want it in,
Ms. Geller?

128
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,440
It's the compulsively neat one
by the window.

129
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,910
Gotcha.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,070
Hi, Daddy!

131
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,320
This is where they put us?

132
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,520
What? There was no table
in the kitchen?

133
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,710
-Hello, baby.
-You remember Ross.

134
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,840
Nice to see you again, Dr. Greene.

135
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,150
So!

136
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,990
-How's the library?
-Museum.

137
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,960
-What happened to the library?
-There never was a library.

138
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,720
I mean, there are libraries.
It's just. . .

139
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,920
. . .that I've never worked at one.

140
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,280
You know what's really good here?
The lobster.

141
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,400
-Shall I just order three?
-If you' re really hungry.

142
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
It was a joke. I made a joke.

143
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,920
Actually, Daddy,
Ross is allergic to lobster.

144
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,880
Who's allergic to lobster? I guess
someone that works in a library.

145
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,120
-It's--
-I know. It's a museum!

146
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,750
You' re the only who can make a joke?
At least mine was funny.

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,800
Waiter.

148
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,080
We will have two lobsters
and a menu.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,440
So, Dr. Greene, how's the old boat?

150
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,990
They found rust. Do you know
what rust does to a boat?

151
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,360
Gives it a nice antique-y look?

152
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
Rust is boat cancer, Ross.

153
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,200
Wow, I' m sorry.

154
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,640
When I was a kid,
I lost a bike to that.

155
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,830
Excuse me for a moment.

156
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,520
I want to say good night
to the Levines before we go.

157
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Honey, stop. It's not that bad.

158
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,560
Your dad must have added wrong.
He only tipped 4%%% .

159
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,560
Yeah. That's Daddy.

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,120
"That's Daddy"? Doesn't it
bother you? You' re a waitress.

161
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
Yes, it bothers me.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,960
If he was a regular at the coffee
house, I'd be serving him sneezers.

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,560
-So?
-So, Ross. . .

164
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,430
. . .I've bugged him about this
a million times. He won't change.

165
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,320
Do you really serve people sneezers?

166
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,720
Well, I don't.

167
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,240
All right, kids. Ready?

168
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,910
Thanks again, Dr. Greene.

169
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,630
Wait, I think I forgot my receipt.

170
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,520
-You don't need that.
-Why not?

171
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,880
The carbon. It's messy. I mean,
gets on your fingers and causes. . .

172
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,440
. . .night blindness.

173
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,640
What is this?

174
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,080
Who put a 20 down here?

175
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,640
Oh, yeah, that would be me.

176
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,840
I have a problem.

177
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,920
I tip way too much.
Way too much.

178
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
-It's a sickness, really.
-Yeah, it is.

179
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,160
-We have to do something about that.
-Excuse me.

180
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,320
You think I' m cheap?

181
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,520
He didn't mean anything by that.
He really didn't.

182
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,320
Nothing I do means anything. Really.

183
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,550
This is nice.
I pay $200 for dinner.

184
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,110
You put down $20 and you come out
looking like Mr. Big Shot.

185
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,520
You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?
Here.

186
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,720
I'll tell you what. You pay the
whole bill, Mr. Big Shot. All right?

187
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,510
Well, "Mr. Big Shot" is better
than "Wet-Head. "

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,150
Okay, some tricks of the trade.

189
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,120
Now, I've never been able to cry
as an actor. . .

190
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,240
. . .so if I have to cry. . .

191
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,240
. . .I cut a hole in my pocket. . .

192
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
. . .take a pair of tweezers. . .

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,800
. . .and just start pulling.

194
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,240
Or let's say I want to convey. . .

195
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,120
. . .that I've just done
something evil.

196
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,200
That would be your basic I've-got-a-
fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-l-like-it.

197
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,520
Let's say I've just gotten bad news.

198
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,160
Well, all I do there
is try and divide 232 by 1 3.

199
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,720
And that's how it's done.

200
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,120
Great soap opera acting
tonight, everybody.

201
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,600
Class dismissed.

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,280
Hey, Mr. Trib.

203
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,720
Guess what? I got an audition!

204
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,190
One of my students got an audition.
I' m so proud!

205
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,080
I was wondering if you'd
coach me for it.

206
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,920
You bet! What's the part?

207
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,950
Oh, it's great!

208
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,880
It's a role on All My Children.
Nick the boxer.

209
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,760
You couldn't leave it alone.

210
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,320
Four percent, okay? I tip more than
that when there's a bug in my food.

211
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,480
Tonight was about the two of you
getting along.

212
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,320
Would you just see
my chiropractor already?

213
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,320
I' m gonna go to a doctor who went
to medical school in a mini-mall.

214
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,520
Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?

215
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,680
I' m freaking out!

216
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,710
Monica trusted me with something
and she shouldn't have!

217
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,960
I haven't lived here in a while,
so I have to ask you.

218
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,480
Does Monica still turn the lights on
in her room?

219
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,440
I am so dead!

220
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,720
Look, here's the bottom line.

221
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,360
This is fixable if we act fast, okay?

222
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow,
and you can make nice.

223
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,520
Honey, I have tried to make nice.
It doesn't work.

224
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Look, I realize my father
is difficult.

225
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,350
But that's why you have got to be
the bigger man here.

226
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,120
Sweetie, I could be the bigger man.
I could be the biggest man.

227
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,840
I could be a huge, giant man, and
it still wouldn't make a difference.

228
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,240
Except I could pick your father up and
say, "Like me! Like me, tiny doctor! "

229
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,310
Can't you just try it one more time?
For me? For me?

230
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,960
One brunch is not gonna
solve anything.

231
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,320
Face it.
We' re never gonna get along.

232
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,760
Well, you are just going to have to.

233
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
I've already got a mother and father
who cannot stay in the same room.

234
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,320
I don't want to have a separate room
for you too!

235
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,640
I'll get the bagels.

236
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,830
What's this?

237
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,520
Isn't it cool?

238
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,960
This is not the bed I ordered.

239
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,120
I know! You must have won
a contest or something.

240
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,560
Why is this car in my bedroom?

241
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,640
I' m sorry. I wasn't looking. . .

242
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,880
. . .and the store won't take
it back, because you signed for it.

243
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,550
-When did I sign for it?
-When I was you.

244
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,560
It's all Joey's fault,
because he left his nose open!

245
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,400
Did you make brownies today?

246
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,710
Knock, knock!

247
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,120
Quick! Take off your dress.
He won't notice the bed.

248
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,720
I' m going for sushi.
Does anybody want--?

249
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,640
Somebody missed the off-ramp!

250
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,000
It's Monica's bed. What?

251
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,640
It's a racecar!

252
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,360
This has always been Monica's bed.
You just noticed?

253
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,400
How self-involved are you?

254
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,560
If this bed isn't new, then how come
there's plastic on the mattress?

255
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,480
Sometimes I have bad dreams.

256
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,430
Look. . .

257
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,960
. . .I just saw my best friend's
brain smeared across the canvas.

258
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,040
It's not gonna be me.

259
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,350
Not me.

260
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,960
That was good.

261
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,000
That was--

262
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,920
Tweezers?

263
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,240
-That was really good.
-Thanks.

264
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,440
Any suggestions?

265
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,680
You told him to play the boxer gay?

266
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,360
I might have said. . .

267
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,960
. . . "super-gay. "

268
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,200
You totally screwed him over.

269
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,120
You' re this guy's teacher.
How could you do this?

270
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,160
Because the guy's so good.

271
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,760
And I really, really want this part.

272
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,840
Well, if you really, really want it,
then it's okay.

273
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,880
-Hi, Daddy.
-Baby.

274
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,920
Dr. Greene, how are you?

275
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,160
Thanks for dinner last night.

276
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,000
Thank you for teaching me
a valuable lesson.

277
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,630
Nice hair. What did you do, swim here?

278
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,510
That's it.
I can't take it anymore.

279
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,120
What? He likes your hair and just
wants to know how you got here.

280
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,200
-It's hopeless. I' m just gonna go.
-What?

281
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,320
-I' m sorry. It's just--
-Ross?

282
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,000
What's with the neck?

283
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,920
I keep telling him
to go to my chiropractor.

284
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,840
You still going to him?

285
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,360
He couldn't get into
med school in lxtapa!

286
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,670
Thank you.
That's what I keep saying.

287
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,350
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens
to be an excellent doctor.

288
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,680
Wait a minute.
His name is Dr. Bobby?

289
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,040
-That's his last name.
-And his first name.

290
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,880
He's Bobby Bobby?

291
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,560
It's Robert Bobby.

292
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,960
And excuse me. He helps me.

293
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,800
-Please. Ask her how?
-What do you need help for?

294
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,150
My alignment.
One leg's shorter than the other.

295
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,320
-Oh, my God.
-Argue with that.

296
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,720
My right leg is two inches shorter!

297
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Come on, you' re just tilting!

298
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,120
-Her legs are fine.
-I know that.

299
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,000
-So why do you let her go to him?
-"Let her"?

300
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,550
She doesn't listen to me
about renter's insurance, either.

301
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,520
Wait a minute. You don't have
renter's insurance?

302
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,120
How you gonna run after a thief,
with one leg shorter than the other?

303
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,040
-Would you like some juice?
-I'd love some juice.

304
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,640
This is going so well!
Did you see us? Did you see?

305
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,110
Yeah, honey. I was standing
right there.

306
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,750
Why don't you tell him about
my mole?

307
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,070
Excellent!

308
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,160
There will come a time
in each of your careers. . .

309
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,320
. . .when you'll have a chance to screw
over another soap opera actor.

310
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,080
I had such an opportunity
in the recent present.

311
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
And I' m ashamed to say. . .

312
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,150
. . .that I took it.

313
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,200
I advised a fellow actor
to play a role. . .

314
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,120
. . .homosexually.

315
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,280
We both auditioned for the part. . .

316
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,400
. . .and as it turned out. . .

317
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,280
. . .they. . . .

318
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,920
They liked the stupid "gay" thing
and cast him.

319
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,920
And now. . .

320
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,080
. . .he's got a two-year contract. . .

321
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,080
. . .opposite Susan Lucci. . .

322
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,400
. . .the first lady
of daytime television.

323
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,440
And me?

324
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,840
Me, I' m stuck here teaching
a bunch of people. . .

325
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,240
. . .most of whom are too ugly
to even be on Tv.

326
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,030
I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

327
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,550
Thank you.

328
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,200
-May I help you?
-Yes, hi.

329
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,080
I' m the lady who got stuck
with the racecar bed.

330
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,360
Look, it's like I told you.
There's nothing I can do.

331
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,280
You signed for it.
"Monica Felula Geller. "

332
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,520
All right, we wanna see the King.

333
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,560
Nobody sees the King.

334
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Okay. I' m talking to the King.

335
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,600
Hey, you can't go back there!

336
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,240
Oh, my God.

337
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,520

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,800
