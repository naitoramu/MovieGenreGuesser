00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,258
So how was Joan?

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,844
Broke up with her.

5
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:10,927
Oh, why?

6
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,765
Don't tell me.
Because of the big nostril thing?

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,434
They were huge!

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,770
When she sneezed,
bats flew out of them.

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,856
They were not that huge.

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:27,902
I'm telling you, she leaned back,
I could see her brain.

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,030
How many women will you reject...

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,616
...over superficial,
insignificant things...

13
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,535
Hold it. I gotta side
with Chandler on this one.

14
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,372
When I first moved here,
I went out with this girl.

15
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,041
Really hot. Great kisser...

16
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,212
...but she had the biggest
Adam's apple.

17
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,131
Drove me nuts.

18
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,801
- You or me?
- I got it.

19
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,138
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

20
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:05,065
You guys are messing with me, right?

21
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,193
Yeah. We are!

22
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:13,073
That's a good one.
For a second there, I was like, whoa!

23
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,409
The One Where Heckles Dies

25
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:07,127
You name one woman that you broke up
with for an actual real reason.

26
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,211
Maureen Rasillo.

27
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:13,676
Because she doesn't hate Yanni
is not a real reason.

28
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,056
Hello, Mr. Heckles.

29
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,724
You're doing it again.

30
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,100
We're not doing anything.

31
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,772
You're stomping.
It's disturbing my birds.

32
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,025
You don't have birds.

33
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,861
I could have birds.

34
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,988
We'll try to keep it down.

35
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,490
Thank you.

36
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,826
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

37
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,497
All right, bye-bye.

38
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,498
Okay, Janice.

39
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,584
Give me Janice.
That wasn't about being picky.

40
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,003
We'll give you Janice.

41
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,172
I miss Janice, though.

42
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,008
Hello, Chandler Bing!

43
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,429
Oh, my God!

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,265
Oh, Chandler!

45
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,060
Now! Now!

46
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,688
That's it.

47
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,859
There! Faster!

48
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:22,703
Stop with the broom!
We're not making noise!

49
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,379
We won.

50
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,632
We did it!

51
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,428
Mr. Heckles!

52
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,642
- How did this happen?
- He was sweeping.

53
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,605
They found a broom in his hand.

54
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,066
- That's terrible.
- I know.

55
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,319
I was sweeping yesterday.

56
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,781
It could've been me.

57
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,991
Sweeping. You never know.

58
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,910
Never know.

59
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:11,335
It's very faint, but I can
still sense him in the building.

60
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,881
Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!

61
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,677
Okay, Phoebe.

62
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,639
I'm sorry,
but sometimes they need help.

63
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,433
Here we go.

64
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,101
That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

65
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,855
There are a lot of things
I don't believe in...

66
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,189
...but that doesn't mean
they're not true.

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,733
Such as?

68
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:40,989
Like crop circles or
the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.

69
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,619
What, you don't believe in evolution?

70
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,622
Not really.

71
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,542
You don't believe in evolution?

72
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,877
I don't know.
It's just, you know...

73
00:04:54,127 --> 00:05:00,425
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.
I just think it's a little too easy.

74
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,055
"Too easy"? Too...

75
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,683
The process of every living thing
on this planet evolving...

76
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:13,814
...over millions of years from
single-celled organisms is "too easy"?

77
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,733
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

78
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:21,197
Excuse me. Evolution is not
for you to buy, Phoebe.

79
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:25,241
Evolution is scientific fact,
like the air we breathe...

80
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,994
...like gravity.

81
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:31,081
Don't get me started on gravity.

82
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,671
You don't believe in gravity?

83
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:42,008
Well, it's not so much that,
you know, I don't believe in it.

84
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,094
Lately I get the feeling that...

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,597
...I'm not so much being pulled down
as I am being pushed.

86
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,392
Pushed.

87
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:55,064
It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.

88
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,859
There she is. And over there,
that's the other one.

89
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,362
This is Mr. Buddy Doyle,
Heckles' attorney.

90
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,864
He'd like to talk to you.

91
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,282
What can we do for you?

92
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,617
All right, kids, here's the deal.

93
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,870
According my client's will...

94
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,625
...he wants to leave
all his earthly possessions...

95
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:19,880
...to "the noisy girls
in the apartment above mine."

96
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,298
What about his family?

97
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,551
He didn't have any.

98
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,722
Okay, so let's talk money.

99
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,391
All right, there was none.

100
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,226
Now, let's talk signing.

101
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:37,189
You be noisy girl number one.
You be noisy girl number two.

102
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,400
I can't believe that this whole time
we thought he hated us.

103
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,155
Isn't it amazing how much
you can touch someone's life...

104
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,323
...without even knowing it?

105
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,991
Would you look at this dump?

106
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,578
He hated us!
This was his final revenge!

107
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,079
I've never seen so much crap!

108
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,668
Actually, I think this apartment
sullies the good name of crap.

109
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,046
Check this out.

110
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,258
Can I have this?

111
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,012
How can you not believe in evolution?

112
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,766
I don't know, just don't.
Look at this funky shirt!

113
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,851
Pheebs, I've studied evolution
my entire adult life.

114
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,522
And we've collected fossils
from all over the world...

115
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,192
...that actually show the evolution
of different species.

116
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,111
I mean, you can literally see them...

117
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:29,783
...evolving through time.

118
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,118
Really? You can actually see it?

119
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:37,457
You bet! In the U.S.,
China, Africa, all over!

120
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,877
See, I didn't know that.

121
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,797
Well, there you go.

122
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:50,512
So now the real question is,
who put those fossils there and why?

123
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:57,978
Look at this!
<i>My Big Book of Grievances.</i>

124
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,148
Hey, there's me!

125
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,151
"April 17 th, excessive noise...

126
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,905
...Italian guy comes home with a date."

127
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,740
You're in here too.

128
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,326
"April 18th, excessive noise...

129
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:17,790
...Italian guy's gay roommate
brings home dry cleaning."

130
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,089
Well, that's excellent.

131
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,675
Look at this lamp.

132
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,262
Is this tacky or what?
We have to have this.

133
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,681
I think we have enough regular lamps.

134
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,016
What? Come on, it's not like...

135
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,019
...I'm asking for this
girlie clock or anything.

136
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,689
Which, by the way,
I also think is really cool.

137
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,360
Look, it doesn't go
with any of my stuff.

138
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,029
Well, what about my stuff?

139
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,615
You don't have any stuff.

140
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:56,161
You still think of it
as your apartment, don't you?

141
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,787
Yes, you do.

142
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,834
You think of it as your apartment
and I just rent a room.

143
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:09,800
While you "mmm" on that,
I'll go find a place for my new lamp.

144
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:16,723
Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making
these little toys move?

145
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,936
Opposable thumbs!

146
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:26,567
Without evolution, how do you
explain opposable thumbs?

147
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:31,905
Maybe the Overlords needed them
to steer their spacecrafts.

148
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,448
Tell me you're joking.

149
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,620
Look, can't we say that you believe
in something and I don't?

150
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,581
- No, Pheebs, we can't.
- Why not?

151
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:44,668
What is this obsessive need
to make everybody agree with you?

152
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,754
No, what's that all about?
You know what I think?

153
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:54,553
I think maybe it's time
you put Ross under the microscope.

154
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,976
Is there blood coming out of my ears?

155
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,940
Check it out.
Heckles' high-school yearbook.

156
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,566
He looks so normal!

157
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,776
He's even kind of cute.

158
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,321
"Heckles, you crack me up
in science class."

159
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,531
"You're the funniest kid in school."

160
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,118
- Funniest? Heckles?
- That's what it says.

161
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:23,123
Heckles was voted class clown,
and so was I.

162
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,751
He was right!
Would you listen to that?

163
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,004
I'd call that excessive.

164
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,046
What?

165
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,634
Heckles played clarinet in band,
and I played clarinet.

166
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,970
He was in the scale
modeler's club and I was...

167
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,474
There was no club,
but I sure thought they were cool.

168
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,477
So? You were both dorks.

169
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:44,811
Big deal.

170
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:48,315
I just think it's weird, you know?
Heckles and me...

171
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,484
Heckles and me. Me...

172
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,069
Me and Heckles.

173
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:56,073
Hey, would you knock it off!

174
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,091
Have you been here all night?

175
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,010
Look at this.

176
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,180
Pictures of all the women
Heckles went out with.

177
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,099
Look what he wrote on them.
"Vivian, too tall."

178
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,936
"Madge, big gums."

179
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,270
"Too loud."

180
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,523
"Too smart."
"Makes noise when she eats."

181
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,441
This is me.

182
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:35,070
This is what I do.

183
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,698
I'm gonna end up alone,
just like he did.

184
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,533
Heckles was a nut case.

185
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,702
Our trains are on the same track.

186
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,456
I'm coming up 30 years behind him,
but the stops are all the same.

187
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,458
Bitter Town...

188
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,795
...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!

189
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,215
You know what we gotta do?
Get you out of here.

190
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,132
I'll buy you breakfast.

191
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,219
What if I never find somebody?
Or worse, what if I found her...

192
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,807
...but I dumped her because
she pronounces it, "supposably"?

193
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,060
Chandler, come on,
you're gonna find somebody.

194
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,230
How do you know that? How?

195
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,983
I don't know. I'm just
trying to help you out.

196
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,068
You guys will all get married...

197
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,321
...and I'll end up alone.

198
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,239
Will you promise me something?

199
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,993
When you're married, will you
invite me over for holidays?

200
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,413
I don't know what we'll be doing.

201
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:32,628
I mean, what if we're over
at her folks' place?

202
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:37,007
Yeah, I understand.

203
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,094
You can come over
and watch the Super Bowl.

204
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:44,265
Every year, all right?

205
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,852
You know what?
I'm not gonna end up like this.

206
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,396
I'll see you, man.

207
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,450
"Supposably."

208
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,620
Supposably!

209
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,956
Did they go to the zoo?

210
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,919
Supposably.

211
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:28,809
Hi. It's me.

212
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,896
Oh, my God!

213
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,858
Janice? You called Janice?

214
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,151
Yes. Janice.

215
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,321
Why is that difficult to comprehend?

216
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,741
You remember Janice, right?

217
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:48,496
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty
and she honestly cared about me.

218
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,958
Janice is my last chance
to have somebody.

219
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,092
Oh, my God!

220
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,887
Jeez, look how fat she got.

221
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,100
- Hey, it's everybody!
- Hi, Janice.

222
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,518
Janice, you're...

223
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,271
Yes, I am.

224
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,356
- Is it...?
- Is it yours?

225
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,110
You wish, Chandler Bing!

226
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:24,823
You are looking at a married lady now.

227
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,786
Congratulations.

228
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,289
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

229
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,458
You couldn't tell me on the phone?

230
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,628
And what? Miss the expression
on your face? Oh, no!

231
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:42,132
Janice likes to have her fun!

232
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,812
You know what we haven't
played in a while?

233
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:59,233
Hide the lamp.

234
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,570
Monica, let it go.

235
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,571
Did you know
I'm allergic to shellfish?

236
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:09,451
Then you'll just have
to eat the other lamps.

237
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,207
It's scary scientist man.

238
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,085
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

239
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:22,005
In this briefcase I carry
actual scientific facts.

240
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:26,510
A briefcase of facts, if you will.

241
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:32,182
Some of these fossils are
over 200 million years old.

242
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,685
Before you even start,
I'm not denying evolution.

243
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,938
It's just one of the possibilities.

244
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,190
It's the only possibility.

245
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,278
Ross, could you just open
your mind, like, this much?

246
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:50,450
Didn't the brightest minds in
the world believe the Earth was flat?

247
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:55,289
And up till 50 years ago, you thought
the atom was the smallest thing...

248
00:15:55,539 --> 00:16:00,753
...until you split it open
and this whole mess of crap came out.

249
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:05,716
Are you telling me that you are
so unbelievably arrogant...

250
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,720
...that you can't admit that
there's a teeny, tiny possibility...

251
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,557
...that you could be wrong about this?

252
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,815
There might be...

253
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,068
...a teeny...

254
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,905
...tiny...

255
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,199
...possibility.

256
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:35,162
I can't believe you caved.

257
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,001
You just abandoned
your whole belief system!

258
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,755
Before, I didn't agree with you,
but at least I respected you.

259
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,423
But...

260
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,842
How are you gonna go
into work tomorrow?

261
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,845
How are you going to face
the other science guys?

262
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:56,433
How are you going to face yourself?

263
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,533
That was fun.
So who's hungry?

264
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,535
I am.

265
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:18,539
Me too.
Let me just get my coat.

266
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,589
What happened?

267
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,883
It was an accident, I swear.

268
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,054
I was putting on my jacket and
the thing and the lamp and it broke.

269
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,641
Oh, please, Monica!
You've always hated my lamp!

270
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:42,145
And now all of a sudden,
it's just magically, it's just broken?

271
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:43,564
Phoebe, tell her?

272
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:47,067
I didn't see it, because
I was putting on my jacket.

273
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,195
But I want to believe you.

274
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:57,327
Hey, Chandler. Monica just
broke my seashell lamp.

275
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,746
Neat.

276
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,333
I'm gonna die alone!

277
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,669
Okay, you win.

278
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,922
Chandler, you are not
gonna die alone.

279
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,008
Janice was my safety net, okay?

280
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,428
And now I have to get a snake.

281
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,096
Why is that?

282
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,683
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man,
I'm gonna need a thing.

283
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,518
You know, a hook.

284
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,272
Like that guy on the subway
who eats his own face.

285
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,566
So I figure I'll be
"Crazy Man With A Snake."

286
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,026
Crazy Snake Man.

287
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,278
Then I'll get more snakes,
call them my babies.

288
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,697
Kids will run past my place!

289
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:38,618
"Run away from Crazy Snake Man",
they'll shout!

290
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,290
You've got to get over this.

291
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,958
You won't end up alone.

292
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,794
Of course I will.

293
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,714
I reject anyone who's crazy enough
to actually go out with me...

294
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:56,136
...and then I bitch that there
aren't any great women out there.

295
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,597
You have just described...

296
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:03,977
...virtually every man
that we've ever gone out with.

297
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:08,106
You are not a freak.
You're a guy.

298
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,400
She's right.

299
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,360
You're no different than the rest.

300
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,737
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Yes, he is.

301
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,780
You are totally different.

302
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,074
In a bad way?

303
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,034
No, honey, in a wonderful way.

304
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,994
You know what you want now.

305
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,830
Most guys don't even have a clue.

306
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,875
You're ready to take risks, be
vulnerable and intimate with someone.

307
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,669
You're not gonna end up alone.

308
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:36,552
You called Janice. That's how much
you wanted to be with someone!

309
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,679
- You've made it!
- You're there!

310
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,348
You are ready to make a commitment!

311
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:45,352
Don't know about that!

312
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,276
What you got there?

313
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:57,197
Something else that's not yours
that you can break?

314
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,535
I know you like this
and I want you to have it.

315
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,705
It'll look good in our apartment.

316
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:08,292
Thank you.

317
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,050
That's fine.

318
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:21,096
You'll all be pleased to know
that I have a date tomorrow night.

319
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,181
This woman Allison from work.
She is great.

320
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:26,560
She's pretty, she's smart.
And I've been...

321
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,981
...holding off asking her out
in the past, because she has a...

322
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,234
...unusually large head.

323
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,779
But I'm not going to let
that stuff hang me up anymore.

324
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,950
Look at me. I'm growing.

325
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,494
You can't recycle yearbooks, can you?

326
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:45,913
I'll take that.

327
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,998
You want his yearbook?

328
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,835
Some people said nice things about him.
Somebody should have it.

329
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,588
Gosh, this is so weird.

330
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:59,092
His whole life was in
this apartment and now it's gone.

331
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:04,598
I think it would be nice if we just
took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.

332
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:10,187
He was kind of a pain.
He was, but he was a person.

333
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,152
You're all going to hell.

334
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:21,072
It's really not that big!

335
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:26,495
- Taking that with you, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

336
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,169
You coming?

337
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,004
In a second.

338
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:54,231
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

339
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:59,653
We'll try to keep it down.

340
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,914
My major was useless.

341
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:15,168
How often do you look in the classifieds
and see "Philosopher Wanted"?

342
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,837
Sure.

343
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:20,924
<i>My God, that's a big head!</i>

344
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:25,095
<i>It didn't look this big in the office.</i>
<i>Maybe it's the lighting.</i>

345
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:29,349
<i>My head must look</i>
<i>like a golf ball at work.</i>

346
