00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,759
So what do you think?

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,179
<i>Casa de Joey.</i>

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,058
- I decorated it myself.
- Get out!

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,477
Wow, Joey, this is...

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,314
- Art.
- Art it is.

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,025
Check this out!
Is it a coffee table?

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:30,030
Is it a panther?
There's no need to decide.

10
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,616
Hey, nice pillow.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,370
So tell me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,748
Hey, excellent water, table thing.

13
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,250
Thanks. I love this.
But you know what?

14
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,212
It makes me want to pee.

15
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,841
Yeah, me too.
I think that's the challenge.

16
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,471
How come Chandler didn't come?

17
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,057
It's because he had
a thing with the...

18
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,893
...with the thing.

19
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,022
Right. I got it.

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,443
So why don't you show us
the rest of your "casa"?

21
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,989
The best part! Come on.

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,248
Nice toilet.

23
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,958
No, no, no. Behind it.

24
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,836
- You have a phone in here?
- That's right.

25
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,337
I have a phone.

26
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,424
In here.

27
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,342
Joey, promise me something.

28
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,679
Never call me from that phone.

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,057

31
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,866
Okay, here we go.

32
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:43,705
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.
Someone just got the last piece.

33
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,834
Oh, my God!
You won't believe this!

34
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,588
I have just been discovered.

35
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:56,302
Wait a minute. I claimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

36
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,513
Anyway.

37
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:05,018
Don't freak out and say how
great this is until I'm done.

38
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:08,188
I just met this producer
of this teeny record company...

39
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,358
...who said that I have
a very fresh, offbeat sound...

40
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:16,363
...and she wants to do
a demo of "Smelly Cat".

41
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,534
Okay, I told you not to do that yet.

42
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:24,663
And she wants to do a video.

43
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,124
I'm not done yet, okay?

44
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,960
God!

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,424
If that goes well,
they may even want to make an album.

46
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,261
I'm done now.

47
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,100
If you care about me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,646
- Get the what?
- There's a pie in the hood. Go!

49
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,111
What are you doing?

50
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,782
I'm sorry.
My pie was in your hood.

51
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,578
I have to get the coffee
out of that guy's pants...

52
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:08,832
...and I'll be back
in the hospital by 7.

53
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:17,132
Damn it, Ross!
Get your butt out of the bathroom!

54
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,385
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

55
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:24,765
Blow-drying what?
You have no hair.

56
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,058
What's going on?

57
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,685
Your boyfriend has been
in there for an hour!

58
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,771
It's like I'm living with him again.

59
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,858
He's here when I go to sleep and
wake up and when I want to shower.

60
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,818
I feel like I'm 16 again.

61
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,406
Well, you're not 16.
You're both adults now.

62
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,659
Get out, you doofus!

63
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:49,539
Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're glue.

64
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,586
All yours.

65
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:58,049
I hope you cleaned your hair
out of the drain.

66
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,384
Shut up!

67
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,263
Cut it out!

68
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,896
I've never wanted you more.

69
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,409
So what do you say, boys?
Should I call him?

70
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,833
You know what they say:

71
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,378
Ask your slippers a question...

72
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,965
...you're going crazy.

73
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,142
I'm sorry I didn't make it
over there today.

74
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,685
That's okay.

75
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,229
You had a thing.

76
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,731
I hear the place looks great.

77
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:00,360
Forget about it.
I'm having a ball!

78
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,446
How's the apartment?

79
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,992
It's terrific.
I mean, it's a regular space...

80
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,662
...- fest!

81
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,038
Well, great.

82
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,916
<i>Yeah, I just...</i>

83
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,628
...wanted to call and say hey.

84
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,922
Well, okay.

85
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,049
Was that the oven timer?

86
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,051
That's right, my friend.

87
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,719
<i>It's time for...</i>

88
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,472
<i>... Baywatch!</i>

89
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,644
Can you believe they gave
Stephanie skin cancer?

90
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,773
I can't believe
they made her lieutenant!

91
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,568
You're saying that because
you love Yasmine Bleeth.

92
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,322
How could anyone
not love Yasmine Bleeth?

93
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,325
Hey, they're running.

94
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,536
See, this is the
brilliance of the show.

95
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:55,040
I say always keep them running.

96
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,292
All the time running!

97
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,587
Run!

98
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:00,796
Run!

99
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:05,259
Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!

100
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,636
But you wanted to live by yourself.

101
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,430
I did. I thought it'd be great.

102
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,893
I figured I'd have time alone
with my thoughts.

103
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:18,938
But it turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you think.

104
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,109
Why don't you talk to Chandler
about moving back?

105
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,278
You really think he'd take me?

106
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,488
We had a good talk last night...

107
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,949
...but when I moved out,
I hurt him bad.

108
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,660
He would definitely want you back.

109
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,996
I'm telling you,
there's no way he's moving back.

110
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:39,168
But we had one of the greatest talks
we ever had last night.

111
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,628
I mean, it was...

112
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:44,006
It was like when we first
started living together.

113
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,092
I know you don't want
to hear this right now...

114
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:52,138
...but we've seen him
in his new place. And he's happy.

115
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,517
He's decorated.

116
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:59,438
Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

117
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,400
You'll have to accept the fact
that you're just friends now.

118
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,485
You're not...

119
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,697
...roommates anymore.

120
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,492
Okay, Phoebe.
You ready to try one?

121
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,790
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

122
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,043
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

123
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,463
<i>Smelly, smelly, smelly</i>
<i>Really bad smelling smelly cat</i>

124
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,341
Whoa! Oh, my God!

125
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,638
I mean, like, who was that?

126
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,018
They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

127
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,104
I thought they were just watching me.

128
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,607
Like at an aquarium, you know?

129
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,360
All right.

130
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,820
From the top.

131
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,241
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

132
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:56,954
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

133
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,875
Okay, sorry.

134
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,585
I'm just not getting...

135
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,755
...that everyone gets...

136
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,591
...how smelly
this cat actually is.

137
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,552
Maybe if we could talk about this...

138
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:16,890
...because I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.

139
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,683
We can talk.

140
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,438
It's just that this costs
$ 100 a minute to be in here.

141
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:26,734
So the cat stinks,
but you love it. Let's go.

142
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,362
No, there is no way
he was a velociraptor.

143
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,447
Look at the cranial ridge, okay?

144
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:37,536
If Dino was a velociraptor,
he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

145
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,288
Were you taking a nap?

146
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,249
I was.

147
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,503
Tony, can you hold on?
That's the other line.

148
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,756
Yeah, she's here,
but can she call you back?

149
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,425
Okay, thanks.

150
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,759
Call Joanna.

151
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,053
Did she leave a number?

152
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,765
Did you see me write one down?

153
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,685
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

154
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,397
She'll call back.
Don't be such a baby.

155
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,981
You're the baby.

156
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,942
- Get off my back.
- Get out of my face.

157
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,905
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

158
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,535
Yeah, she's right here.
Hold on.

159
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,204
Tony, can I call you back?

160
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,040
That's my sister's boyfriend.

161
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,293
Give me that.

162
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:33,383
Sweetie, before I forget, did I
leave my diaphragm at your place?

163
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,177
Hi, Mom.

164
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,201
So how's the palace?

165
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:04,206
It's funny you should mention that
because I was thinking...

166
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,793
What's with the boxes?

167
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,629
Actually, I have some news.

168
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,384
Is that Joey guy gonna pick up
his moose hat or should I toss it?

169
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:19,513
Why don't you ask him yourself?
This is my new roommate, Eddie.

170
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,847
Nice to meet you.

171
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,183
- Likewise.
- How you doing?

172
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,810
I'll take that.

173
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:29,273
It's what I came for.

174
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,525
This is new.
Where'd you two meet?

175
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:35,487
At the supermarket
in the ethnic food section.

176
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,115
I helped him pick out a chorizo.

177
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:45,498
We got to talking. He needed
a place, and I had a spare room.

178
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,082
Now it's a spare room?

179
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,085
Well, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

180
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,672
...and I have it to spare.

181
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,469
Well, I got what I came for.

182
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,431
I'll see you.

183
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,309
Hey, Joe.

184
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,605
When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

185
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,775
Is this guy great, or what?

186
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,946
Yeah, he is.

187
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,913
I can't believe he has
a new roommate. Who is he?

188
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,831
Eddie. He just met him.

189
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:33,086
It'll never last.
He's just a rebound roommate.

190
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,424
Check it out! Check it out!

191
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,136
It's "Smelly Cat", the video!

192
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:46,517
Now, I haven't seen it yet,
so if you don't like it...

193
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:50,854
...so what?
None of you ever made a video.

194
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:03,033
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

195
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,416
Smoking!

196
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,584
Look at me!

197
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:15,087
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

198
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,298
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

199
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,053
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

200
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,556
<i>It's not your fault</i>

201
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,520
<i>Smelly, smelly, smelly</i>
<i>Really bad smelling smelly cat</i>

202
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,897
<i>It's not your fault</i>

203
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,441
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

204
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,777
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

205
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,572
I sound amazing!

206
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,744
<i>They won't take you to the vet</i>

207
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,330
<i>You're obviously not their favorite pet</i>

208
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,999
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

209
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,669
<i>It's not your fault</i>

210
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,756
I've never heard myself sing before.

211
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,718
I mean, except in my own head.

212
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:07,181
This is so cool!
Now I can hear what you hear!

213
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,517
Pretty different, huh?

214
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:15,021
I am sorry,
but I'm incredibly talented!

215
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,983
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

216
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:22,070
<i>It's not your fault</i>

217
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,123
What's going on, man?

218
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,332
Eddie.

219
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,960
Morning.

220
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:41,173
I just came by to pick up my mail.

221
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,509
- Where's the mail?
- Over there on the table.

222
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,887
You don't keep it
on this table anymore?

223
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:50,265
Eddie likes it over there.

224
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,905
That's great.

225
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,740
What?

226
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,825
I thought you liked your eggs...

227
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:16,667
I do, but Eddie makes them this way.
They're pretty darn good.

228
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,585
Well, you guys...

229
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,963
...I'm out of here.

230
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,005
See you, pals.

231
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,717
See you.

232
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,264
- How are you two getting along?
- I couldn't be happier.

233
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,724
Great.

234
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:35,144
I'm happy for you.

235
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,272
All right, that's it!

236
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:44,820
He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs...

237
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:50,993
...with his moving the mail
and his "See you, pals".

238
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,454
And now there's no juice!

239
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:58,959
There's no juice for the people
who need the juice. I need the juice!

240
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,421
There's another carton there.

241
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,841
This isn't about juice anymore,
all right, man?

242
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,009
All right.

243
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,343
So what's it about?

244
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,429
Eggs!

245
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,348
Whose eggs do you like better,
his or mine?

246
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,602
- Well, I like both eggs equally.
- Oh, come on!

247
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:21,148
Nobody likes two eggs equally.
I wanna know which one you like better.

248
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:25,527
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore.

249
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,197
You took your eggs and you left!

250
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:32,618
Did you expect me
to never find new eggs?

251
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,329
I wanna watch "Entertainment Tonight".

252
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:39,249
Tough. We're watching
<i>Predators of the Serengeti.</i>

253
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,625
Would you guys stop!

254
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,836
It's my TV!

255
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,380
- Quit it!
- Bite me!

256
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,259
Monica keeps changing the channel.

257
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,429
That's great.
Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

258
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,556
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

259
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,808
Look, I refuse to get sucked into...

260
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,271
...this weird little Geller
dimension thing, okay?

261
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:03,482
So I'm gonna go take
a nice long hot bubble bath...

262
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:08,153
...because you kids
are driving me crazy!

263
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:10,990
What do we do about this?

264
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,159
We could tape "Entertainment Tonight".

265
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,326
Not that!

266
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,411
This! Us!

267
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:19,123
Oh, my God, Ross, it's...
You're just...

268
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,876
Since you've been here,
you're driving me...

269
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,587
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic
again, all right?

270
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,841
I just can't stand you being here...

271
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,134
...all the time!

272
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,554
Why? Why can't you
stand me being here?

273
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:34,972
We're just having fun.

274
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,976
Fun? You think this is fun?

275
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,688
I thought we were fooling around,
like when we were kids.

276
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:46,316
I hated you when we were kids!

277
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,985
You hated me when we were kids?

278
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,195
I hated you.

279
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,864
I loved you in a you're-my-brother-
so-I-have-to way...

280
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,619
...but basically, I hated your guts.

281
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,786
Why did you hate me?

282
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,956
Because you were mean to me...

283
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:06,086
...and you teased me
and you always got your way.

284
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,465
That wasn't fun for you?

285
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,679
I can't believe you hated me.

286
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,475
But now I love you.

287
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,311
And not just because I have to.

288
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,105
Really?

289
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:30,402
You're just gonna have
to stop pissing me off.

290
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,407
I can do that.

291
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:39,286
Then I won't have to kill you.

292
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:44,375
So you wanna watch
"Entertainment Tonight"?

293
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,253
Thanks.

294
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,007
You know what?

295
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:57,220
If you really wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

296
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:09,024
Listen, you are not
going to believe this...

297
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:13,069
...but that is not me
singing on the video.

298
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,491
How did you find out?

299
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:22,079
The record company sent this paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

300
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:26,792
...for someone else to sing for me.
That was my first clue.

301
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,043
What will you do?

302
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,837
I can't work with people
who would do this.

303
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,131
Sure.

304
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,884
I mean, this poor woman.

305
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:35,967
What woman?

306
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,428
The voice woman.

307
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:41,098
She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

308
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,433
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

309
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:47,188
I have a video. Pay attention.

310
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,150
This voice woman, she's so talented.

311
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:57,323
But according to the producer people,
she doesn't have the right look.

312
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,326
She's like one of those
animals at the pound...

313
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:03,037
...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty.

314
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,666
Or you know, like some old dog
who's kind of like stinky and...

315
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,420
Oh, my God! She's "smelly cat"!

316
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:16,926
That song has so many levels.

317
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,261
Hey, Eddie.

318
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,304
You wanna play some foosball?

319
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:25,768
No, thanks, man.
I'm not really into sports.

320
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,191
Yeah, okay. All right.

321
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:37,946
Doesn't matter.
Time for "Baywatch"!

322
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,116
You like that show?

323
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,829
You don't?

324
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,916
It's just pretty people
running around on the beach.

325
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,753
That's the brilliance of it.

326
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,465
The pretty people.

327
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,843
And the running.

328
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:04,140
I'm gonna go read in my room
for a little while.

329
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,350
Okay, man.

330
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:21,740
<i>I think of all the friends I've known</i>

331
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:27,371
<i>But when I dial the telephone</i>

332
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:32,584
<i>No one's home</i>

333
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:45,347
<i>All by myself</i>

334
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,224
<i>Don't wanna live</i>

335
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:52,354
<i>All by myself</i>

336
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,482
<i>Anymore</i>

337
00:21:55,732 --> 00:22:01,321
<i>All by myself</i>

338
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,658
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

339
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,744
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>
Everybody!

340
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,789
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

341
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,084
<i>It's not your fault</i>

342
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,921
<i>They won't take you to the vet</i>

343
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,844
<i>You're obviously not their favorite pet</i>

344
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,847
<i>You may not be a bed of roses</i>

345
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:30,851
<i>And you're no friend</i>
<i>To those with noses</i>

346
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:36,189
Ross, those are the only lines we have.
Back to the chorus!
