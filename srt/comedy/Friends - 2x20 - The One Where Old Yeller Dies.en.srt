00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:02,294
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:13,597
- What you guys doing?
- Monica's making us watch "Old Yeller".

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:18,602
Why are you guys upset?
It's "Old Yeller". It's a happy movie.

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,437
- What?
- What are you talking about?

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,981
Come on. Happy family gets a dog.

7
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,318
Frontier fun!

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,403
Pheebs, what about the end?

9
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,824
When Yeller saves the family
and everyone's happy?

10
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,117
That's not the end.

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:38,831
That's when my mother would
shut off the TV and say, "The end".

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,832
What about when he has rabies?

13
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,837
He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,006
That's what my mom said.

15
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:52,386
I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

16
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,346
Why? What's about to happen?

17
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,473
I've never seen this part.

18
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,144
Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

19
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,272
Oh, no.

20
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,025
No, no, Travis, put down the gun.

21
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,778
No, no, he's your buddy.
He's your Yeller.

22
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,988
No! The end! The end!

23
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:18,745
Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff film is this?

24
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,416
The One Where Old Yeller Dies

26
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:12,508
Have you guys eaten? Richard and I
just finished, and we've got leftovers.

27
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,177
Chicken and potatoes.

28
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,096
What am I wearing?

29
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,976
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

30
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,817
One of these times, you'll really
be naked and we won't come over.

31
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,112
I got a leg, three breasts
and a wing.

32
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:37,074
How do you find clothes that fit?

33
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,326
Hey, Monica? We got a question.

34
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,913
All right, yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

35
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,248
And no, I don't look.

36
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,792
No, not that one.

37
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,920
We're figuring out who to bring
to the Nicks game.

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,092
Ross can't go, so it's between my friend
Eric Prower, who has breath issues...

39
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,595
...and Dan, with the poking.
"Did you see that play?"

40
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,975
"You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?"

41
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,229
Why don't you ask Richard?

42
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:12,275
Richard, if you had an extra
ticket to the Nicks game...

43
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,655
...and you had to choose between
a friend who smelled...

44
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:22,160
...and one who bruises you,
who would you pick?

45
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,079
Being a huge Nicks fan myself...

46
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,835
...I think you should take someone
who's a huge Nicks fan.

47
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,963
That's Eric.

48
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,633
Glad to be of help.
Matches.

49
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,596
I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

50
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,223
What?

51
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,475
- I don't know.
- Come on!

52
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:50,147
He keeps his fingers to himself,
and he's always minty fresh.

53
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,859
Richard's really nice.
We just don't know him really well.

54
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,362
Plus, he's old...

55
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,824
- er than some people.

56
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,203
But younger than some buildings.

57
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,290
So what, he's a little older.
Big deal.

58
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,000
He's important to me.

59
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,755
If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

60
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,176
How do we say yes...

61
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,931
...and make it seem like it's not
just to ride in the cool car?

62
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,768
Okay, this could be tough.

63
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:34,024
We'll bring him,
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

64
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,404
You almost had it.

65
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,953
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

66
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,373
Hi, honey.

67
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,042
You are not gonna believe
what happened!

68
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,462
We were playing on the floor,
and he grabs the table...

69
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,924
...and he pulls himself up!

70
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,218
He pulled himself up!

71
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,929
Standing man!

72
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:08,517
I'm sorry you missed it,
but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

73
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,978
We know. He already did it last week.

74
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,230
You can watch our tape if you want.

75
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,901
See, I don't believe this.
I missed the first time of everything.

76
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,321
The first time he rolled over,
the first time he crawled.

77
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,866
What else? Has he spoken?
Is he driving?

78
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,577
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

79
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,413
He is getting closer
on the talking thing.

80
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,875
He can't quite say "mama" yet,
but once he said "Yemen".

81
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,962
See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

82
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,716
I want him for more than a day.
I want him for a whole weekend.

83
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:41,925
Listen. I feel...

84
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,137
That would be great.

85
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,224
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

86
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,103
Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.

87
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,939
Did you just see that?

88
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,693
Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

89
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,194
He's never waved before!

90
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:05,240
Yes, he has. Very good.

91
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,869
What you got there?

92
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:13,874
<i>Love Story, Brian's Song and</i>
<i>Terms of Endearment.</i>

93
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:19,713
All you need now is "The Killing Fields"
and guacamole, and you got a party!

94
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,008
I talked to my grandma
about the "Old Yeller" incident...

95
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:27,012
...and she said my mom used to not
show us the ends of sad movies...

96
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,931
...to shield us from
the pain and sadness.

97
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:34,269
You know, before she killed herself.

98
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,107
Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

99
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:43,571
After we stole his lunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

100
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,364
What's the matter?
He's parking the car.

101
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:50,536
- Did you guys have fun?
- Your boyfriend is so cool.

102
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:56,417
He let us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

103
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,627
He must like you best.

104
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,047
What about when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

105
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,257
You never even saw the money.

106
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,012
Hey, Chandler, thanks for
showing us to our seats.

107
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,348
You're welcome. Hey, Joey,
thanks for parking the car.

108
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,309
No problem.

109
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,314
- Hey, Chandler...
- I think they get it.

110
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,109
There's the man!

111
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,986
Hey, you're getting better.

112
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,198
I'm gonna keep this.

113
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,410
He kept my dollar.

114
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,709
Your first weekend without Ben.
What are you doing?

115
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,794
We're going to
colonial Williamsburg.

116
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:45,549
A woman I went to college with is
the first female blacksmith there.

117
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,511
They're a little behind the times
in colonial Williamsburg.

118
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,265
Look, I better go
before Mommy starts weeping.

119
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,851
- We love you.
- Bye, Mommy.

120
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,438
Have a good time.

121
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,067
Look.

122
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,785
Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

123
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,330
How come Richard looks cooler
with one of these?

124
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,043
You may wanna light it
and lose the spatula.

125
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,213
It's cute, you trying
to be more like Richard.

126
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,256
Not like him, per se.

127
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:30,177
Just not unlike him.

128
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,940
It's the artist formerly known
as Chandler.

129
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,734
I'm just trying something here,
you know?

130
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,736
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

131
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,112
We flipped for it.

132
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,449
I got the cigar,
he got the mustache.

133
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,911
If we both grew them,
we'd look like dorks.

134
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,206
You really sidestepped
that land mine.

135
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,042
I promised Richard
we'd meet him downstairs.

136
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,293
You're meeting Richard?

137
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,296
- Ranger game.
- Didn't he tell you?

138
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,799
He said he was going out with the guys.
I didn't know that was you.

139
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,175
You hear that?

140
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,386
We're the guys!

141
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,098
With that mustache,
he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

142
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,142
Thank you!

143
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,069
Hi. We're visiting.

144
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,907
It's Ben and his dada.

145
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,494
Can you say "dada"?

146
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,830
I'm telling your mommies you said it,
so you might as well.

147
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,499
No luck, huh?

148
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,126
A while ago,
I got a "seh" out of him...

149
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:51,800
...which I thought might turn into
"seh-condary caregiver", but...

150
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,930
Would you hold him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

151
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,601
Sure. Okay.

152
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,023
What are you doing?

153
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,777
I'm holding Ben.

154
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,697
He's a baby, not a bomb.

155
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,533
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

156
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,119
This is how I would hold a football.

157
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,580
Here. Here. There we go.

158
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,126
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

159
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,461
I mean, you know, since I was one.

160
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,423
- It's all right. No big deal.
- Really?

161
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,551
I'm sure you'll feel different
when it's our baby.

162
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,137
- What?
- What?

163
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,890
You think about stuff like that?

164
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,976
Yeah. I mean...

165
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:48,023
Actually, I kind of think
that we'll have two babies.

166
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,484
Two babies?

167
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,778
You know, a boy and a girl.

168
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:57,908
Hopefully, the girl will come first,
so Ben won't feel competitive.

169
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,911
Then what's gonna happen?

170
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:06,750
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

171
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,587
We'll be far enough from our parents
so we don't have to see them...

172
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,174
...but close enough
that they can baby-sit.

173
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,636
And yes, I know the taxes are
a little higher than Nassau County...

174
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,431
...but the school system's great.

175
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,977
Wow, that's great! Great!

176
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,230
Okay, wow! You know what?

177
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,441
I'm off my break now.

178
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,820
Here. You take this.

179
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,950
I'm gonna go pour these
very nice people some coffee.

180
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,160
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

181
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,830
I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

182
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,917
Or in Scarsdale.
Hey, is that a door?

183
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,592
Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

184
00:11:56,842 --> 00:12:02,014
Murder, cancer, soccer teams eating
each other in the Andes.

185
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,183
So you watched the movies?

186
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,144
What is happening to the world?

187
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,272
I mean...
No, no, because E.T. Leaves...

188
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,275
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

189
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,860
Charlotte who?

190
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,486
With the web. The spider.

191
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,739
She dies. She has babies and dies.

192
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:23,619
It's like, "Welcome home
from the hospital." Thud!

193
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,038
You wanna feel better?

194
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,668
Here. Watch this.

195
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,504
<i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>
I've heard of this.

196
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,298
So you can't lose.
It's there in the title.

197
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,216
Wonderfulness is baked right in.

198
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,928
I fell for that with
<i>Pride of the Yankees.</i>

199
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,138
I thought I'd see a film
about Yankee pride.

200
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,851
And boom! The guy gets
Lou Gehrig's disease.

201
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:54,065
The guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

202
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:58,237
Watch that. It'll restore
all your faith in humanity.

203
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,072
Hey, big guy. Game time.

204
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,075
- Hey! Be right there!
- There's a game?

205
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:07,412
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

206
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,208
Bring your nerves of steel.

207
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,961
It's the basketball playoffs.

208
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:18,632
I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

209
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,300
They have each other.

210
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,720
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

211
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,849
I like hanging out with them.
They're different than my other friends.

212
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:32,187
They don't start sentences with
"You know who just died shoveling snow?"

213
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,148
All right, that's great.
Then just go.

214
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,817
Go Nicks!

215
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,735
It's the college playoffs.

216
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,363
- Then, go Vassar!
- They're not in it.

217
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,991
Okay, then just go.

218
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,661
Why does this bother me so much?

219
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:52,541
I'm not one of those people who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

220
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,959
Sure.

221
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,295
He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

222
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:03,052
Does it matter? You'll just die
or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

223
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,513
Me too!

224
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,141
Rachel, I got a question. Richard
made plans again with the guys...

225
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,436
Ross made plans for the century.

226
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,607
I'm gonna go read "Cosmo".
Maybe there's something helpful in it.

227
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:23,155
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini
wax with leftover Christmas candles.

228
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,533
What happened back there?

229
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,493
I don't know. You tell me.

230
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,455
One minute I'm holding Ben,
then I've got two kids...

231
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,666
...I'm living in Scarsdale
complaining about taxes!

232
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,503
Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

233
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:41,340
You're at work, you're assembling bones,
your mind wanders.

234
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,219
You've planned out the next 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

235
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,429
You never think about our future?

236
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,724
I think about whose apartment
we'll sleep at tomorrow...

237
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,934
...and where we'll have dinner
next Saturday!

238
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:56,814
I do not think about
our children's names!

239
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:00,526
You know what our
children's names will be?

240
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:05,155
No, I mean, you know. I read a book,
and there was a girl named Emily.

241
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,159
And I thought that might be good.

242
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,495
What book?

243
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,165
<i>The Big Book of Children's Names.</i>

244
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,417
Okay, listen.

245
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,086
What we have is amazing.

246
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,089
But I do not want
everything decided for me!

247
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,966
I spent my whole life like that.

248
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,719
It's what I had with Barry.
That's a reason I left.

249
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,013
I like not knowing right now.

250
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:33,142
Sorry if that scares you, but if you
wanna be with me, deal with that!

251
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,060
- Okay, fine!
- Thank you!

252
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,979
- We're not done!
- I didn't know that.

253
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,234
You're with a guy who won't stop
planning his future with you.

254
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,319
He knows we'll end up together.

255
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,615
If that scares you, tough!
You'll have to deal with that.

256
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,825
- I will!
- Good, because I love you!

257
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,577
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

258
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,996
- That's the first time we've said that!
- Yes, it is!

259
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:58,292
- I'm gonna kiss you!
- You better!

260
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,175
Thanks for the great movie tip.

261
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:08,260
- Did you like it?
- Oh, yeah.

262
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,014
I don't know if I was happier when
George Bailey destroyed the business...

263
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:17,728
...or Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bleed.

264
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,022
I'll give you the ear thing,
but wasn't the ending wonderful?

265
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,233
I didn't watch it.
I was too depressed.

266
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,735
It kept getting worse!
It should've been called:

267
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:31,825
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

268
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,453
Kick, save! And...

269
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,455
...denied!

270
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,667
He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up...

271
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:41,752
Yes!

272
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,547
Could that shot be any prettier?

273
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,299
Man, you are incredible.

274
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,259
We had a table in college.

275
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,264
Really? I didn't know they had
foosball in the 1800s.

276
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:59,145
Nice mustache. At puberty,
that thing will really kick in.

277
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,359
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,
but dinner's on the table.

278
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,195
One more point.

279
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,491
Score!

280
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,410
Now can we go?

281
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,330
That's why we don't let her play.

282
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,292
Is everything all right?

283
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,545
Don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.

284
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,756
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

285
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,050
He's just really great
to hang out with.

286
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,426
- Well...
- No, seriously.

287
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:36,807
We just talked about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads.

288
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,978
Our dads are okay and all,
but Richard is just...

289
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,440
What are you kicking me for?

290
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:48,443
I'm trying to talk here.

291
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,197
You guys see me as a dad?

292
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,866
- Oh, yeah!
- No!

293
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,248
You're just clearly not familiar
with our young persons' vernacular.

294
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:05,419
When we say "dad", we mean "buddy".

295
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,337
We mean "pal".

296
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:11,926
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

297
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,095
Monica's my dad.

298
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,557
I've even got some dads down at work.

299
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:19,766
That's fine.

300
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:24,188
Well, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

301
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,482
I'll just see you kids around.

302
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:27,983
Nighty-night.

303
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:31,027
You're not a dad!

304
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:35,073
I can't believe you got us
into trouble.

305
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:42,664
So are you okay?

306
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,166
Just...

307
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,252
...I feel like I'm about a hundred.

308
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,548
I thought I was just one of the guys.

309
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,007
Come here.

310
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:56,386
I'll make you feel like
one of the guys.

311
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:04,603
For a really cool guy,
you suck at foosball.

312
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,688
I was killing them.

313
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:10,734
Yeah, well they suck too.

314
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,948
You take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

315
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:21,829
Calling it a "poopy diaper"
doesn't make this process any cuter.

316
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,250
<i>- It's us.</i>
- Come on up.

317
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,168
I'll get his stuff together.

318
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,671
Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

319
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,340
Yes, we can.

320
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,384
Yes, we can.

321
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,804
There! I did it!

322
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,057
I did it!

323
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,392
Look at that!

324
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:48,272
It stays on and everything.

325
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,364
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say "hi"?

326
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,408
Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

327
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:01,994
- What?
- Ben just said hi!

328
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,620
What, the word "hi"?

329
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,582
No, my Uncle Hi.

330
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,668
Great! And I missed that too.
I miss everything!

331
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:14,714
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

332
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,800
- Where is he?
- We missed you.

333
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,512
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben.

334
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,848
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

335
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,183
What did he say?

336
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,978
Something about hi.

337
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:33,400
That's so exciting!
Mommy's so proud of you!

338
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:37,779
You know, actually,
it's more like, hi!

339
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,535
This could go on for a while.

340
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,745
You're right.
We've got a cab waiting.

341
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,706
Well, this was fun.

342
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:52,210
We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

343
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,255
- All right, so I've got him...?
- Tuesday.

344
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:56,298
Bye, you guys.

345
00:20:56,548 --> 00:21:00,093
- Take care.
- Bye, Ben.

346
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,598
Did he just say "bye"?

347
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,016
He said bye!

348
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,226
You said bye!
He said bye to me!

349
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:10,396
Yes, he did!

350
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:14,108
Suddenly I'm seeing him
go off to college!

351
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,945
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

352
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,989
See you later.

353
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,634
<i>Look at this nice deep hole I dug.</i>
<i>Hey, Bert...</i>

354
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:43,762
<i>... isn't this a nice hole here?</i>

355
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:48,850
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

356
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:55,107
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

357
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,944
But before that happens,
there's some rough going for a while.

358
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,279
But I think we can handle it.

359
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,785
And there's just the alphabet,
but we know that ends well, so...

360
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,161
Here we go.

361
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:11,540
<i>Bert? Bert?</i>

362
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:15,294
<i>What happened to my friend Bert?</i>
<i>He was here just a moment ago.</i>

363
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,755
<i>Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.</i>

364
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:21,550
I'm so glad you're here.

365
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:25,470
Bye-bye, baby.
