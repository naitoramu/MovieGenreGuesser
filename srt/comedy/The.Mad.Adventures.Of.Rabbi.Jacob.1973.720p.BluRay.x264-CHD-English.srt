1
00:02:54,785 --> 00:03:01,001
Boys, boys, Rabbi Jacob is leaving.
C'mon, lets go and say goodbye.

2
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,467
Shalom, friends.

3
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,352
Have a safe trip.

4
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:42,406
My man has been in Paris
for the last 30 years.

5
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:46,452
Pay attention to him.
- Naturally.

6
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:51,750
I have something for you they have
never heard of in Paris.

7
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,005
Cheesecake.

8
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:58,969
Give it to David for his bar mitzvah.

9
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:12,446
Hey, I don't have all day.
let's go?

10
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:16,950
Come with me to the airport,
all of you.

11
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:34,223
This is a taxi, no synagogue.
Ok, move over.

12
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:41,400
Jacob, give our nephew Salomon a big
kiss. And Esther also and Tzipé and Moishe.

13
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:44,278
Ok all the Schmoll family.

14
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:51,371
And bring me a bottle of
Reviens-parfum, please.

15
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:54,625
Ok, I will return.

16
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,722
I love to see my Normandië

17
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,109
It does not go like that.
It is French... France...

18
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,910
I love to see my Normandië It's the
country where I saw the light of day

19
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:34,968
What is going on?
Hurry, driver.

20
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,430
Hey, what do you want?
Miracles?

21
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,230
Don't worry, rabbi,
we'll catch that plane.

22
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:27,580
You see my boy? That is a miracle.

23
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,815
Isn't it better that I drive, Mr?

24
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:29,035
- Mr, look ahead.
- What does that idiot do there?

25
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:39,089
An Englishman of course.
I don't like Englishmen. Do you?

26
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:41,468
No.

27
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,474
Now look.
A Swiss and a German.

28
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:50,104
It seems
as if we are abroad.

29
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:59,324
Now we are caught behind a Belgian.

30
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:01,160
What is wrong with the Belgians?

31
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:05,164
They pollute our air
with their exhaust gases.

32
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,503
I will pass him.

33
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,870
Now look beside us.

34
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:40,003
He sits quietly and smokes.
That is not a Frenchman.

35
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:45,343
Can't you go behind the line?
Imbecile, cheater...

36
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:48,763
...stupid...
- You hear that, a real Frenchman.

37
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:55,397
You won't talk huh?

38
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:03,366
What's the hurry?

39
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:08,040
- What is going on?
- A wedding.

40
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:12,044
- My daughter is also getting
married tomorrow. Let me pass.

41
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:31,528
Have you seen that? She is black.

42
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:38,953
- She is black and he is white.
- Yes, and?

43
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:43,961
White and black...

44
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,325
- Are you coming or not?
- I'm coming.

45
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:13,249
- Let me through! My
daughter is getting married.

46
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,920
- That's your daughter?
Congratulations.

47
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:19,591
My daughter is not black.

48
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:22,762
Mr...

49
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:06,026
Did you see that? Nowadays black
people ride white Rolls Royces.

50
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,324
- Nice for you that your daughter
isn't getting married to a black man.

51
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:12,326
What do you mean?

52
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:18,208
- Because you are rather racist.
- Racist? I?

53
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:24,091
Fortunately Antoinette marries
a neat white French man.

54
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:29,391
- He is as a matter of fact quite pale.
- And he has a speaks funny.

55
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,520
But he is rich, just like I am.
And catholic, such as everyone.

56
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,068
Not everyone. I am Jewish.

57
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:48,415
You are Jewish? Are you Jewish?

58
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,296
And my uncle Jacob from New York is a
rabbi.

59
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,008
- But he is no Jew.
- Yes.

60
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,805
- But not your entire family?
- Yes.

61
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:05,144
Well, nevertheless, you can remain.

62
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:11,905
- That will be my wife.
- We are late. What now?

63
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:21,124
Germaine...
Let me explain.

64
00:12:24,046 --> 00:12:28,259
Watch your mouth, Victor.
You are a hypocritical liar.

65
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:33,350
And watch your mouth too. If you want
a wedding tomorrow you must be nice.

66
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:40,275
Your crown.
I'm telling you!

67
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:44,531
- She is jealous again.
- Logically, you are good looking.

68
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,914
Just a moment. Wait now.

69
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,965
Pay attention to the road.

70
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:07,476
Germaine, did you know
that Salomon were a Jew?

71
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:09,521
No, and?

72
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:53,996
There he is.

73
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,196
Waiter?

74
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:23,367
A water with mint syrup.

75
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:37,178
Mr Slimane.
Telephone for Mr Slimane.

76
00:14:38,804 --> 00:14:40,473
That is me.

77
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:55,534
Cell 2, Mr.

78
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:07,050
- Mohammed Larbi Slimane?
- That is me.

79
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,221
Nobody comes to save you.
You have run into our trap.

80
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,933
- What?
- Farés wake up.

81
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:21,818
You are not getting away alive. It
is over with that revolution of yours.

82
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,963
Over 30 seconds. He tries
to escape along the back.

83
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:41,219
We cannot catch him in the middle of
Saint Germain de Prés.

84
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:43,096
Watch your mouth.

85
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:46,767
Go guard the back alley.

86
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:03,749
Farés.

87
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:59,363
Hurry up!

88
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:01,491
Drive.

89
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,476
Do not hang up, young lady.

90
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,906
- Send a tow truck immediately.
- Rather ask for a tow boat.

91
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:38,664
Pull the boat. And don't bungle.

92
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:45,590
Strike? They still strike
in my factory?

93
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:49,219
I will also strike.
I am exhausted.

94
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:52,390
What did you say?

95
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:01,401
I forbid them to strike.
No. No, I say.

96
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:07,284
Just promise them everything,
and I shall give them nothing.

97
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:10,540
Salomon, a car.

98
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:21,385
Stop, stop.

99
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:30,815
Beast, egoist, idiot.

100
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:35,989
First road on the left.
The factory is at the end.

101
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:42,413
It becomes dark.
We must find a place to sleep.

102
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:47,421
Put on the lights.
Then they can find us easier.

103
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:49,714
No, Mr.

104
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:55,180
I cannot put them on.
I cannot work on a Saturday.

105
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,599
It is Friday.

106
00:18:56,766 --> 00:19:02,439
The Sabbath starts Friday evening.
Then I can no longer work.

107
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:29,976
You can't make an exception
this time, Salomon?

108
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:32,855
Then you will get
two Sabbaths next week.

109
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:38,654
- You don't know our traditions.
- Exactly, and that I am proud of.

110
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,374
You eat no flesh on Fridays
and I don't work Saturdays.

111
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,335
- It's not crazier than that.
- Yes is it.

112
00:19:52,673 --> 00:19:56,259
It is crazy.
I tell you that it's crazy.

113
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,222
You are dismissed.
Now you can have Sabbath each evening.

114
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,439
- As you wish, Mr.
- Out!

115
00:20:47,661 --> 00:20:53,753
Saint Antonius of Padua, give me
a place to sleep and a driver.

116
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,552
A Catholic just like you,
the kind lord and I.

117
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,223
Oh, a light.
Thanks, Saint Antonius.

118
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:23,917
Is there anyone?

119
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:28,339
Conciërge?

120
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:40,479
Ms?

121
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,115
Is there someone?

122
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:50,785
There is someone!

123
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:11,391
I will make you to talk, Slimane.

124
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,521
Where will the revolution take place?

125
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,692
Which city? How? Which regiment?

126
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,864
Talk, Slimane.

127
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:29,330
Kill me, but do not try
to judge me.

128
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:54,864
The people stand behind me.

129
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:57,367
But the power comes from
the barrel of a gun.

130
00:23:57,785 --> 00:23:59,411
Mao Tse Tung.

131
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:07,422
Mohammed Larbi Slimane...

132
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:12,219
...as a president of
this contra-revolutionary tribunal...

133
00:24:13,346 --> 00:24:16,892
I find you guilty of treason.

134
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:26,487
What is that abracadabra?

135
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,330
Gentlemen, your sentence.

136
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:39,881
Death!

137
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:45,012
Speak, then we'll save your live.

138
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:50,061
The revolution is as a bicycle.
If it does not go ahead, it falls.

139
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:53,940
Eddy Merckx.
- No, Che Guevara.

140
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,438
The police force. 17

141
00:26:14,213 --> 00:26:18,843
No, the police force is 22... 17

142
00:26:35,616 --> 00:26:38,202
- Hello? Is this the police force?
- Yes.

143
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:42,415
- Give me the commissioner. Fast.
- This is the commissioner speaking.

144
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:47,129
Come directly to the
Yankee chewing-gum factory.

145
00:26:47,548 --> 00:26:49,758
- Chewing-gum?
- Yes, chewing-gum...

146
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:55,392
- Who are you?
- Victor Pivert.

147
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,772
Pivert. It means woodpecker.

148
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:10,411
- I'm listening.
- I have had an accident with my car.

149
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:12,121
I sought for help...

150
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:18,297
...and ended up with a some black
men with that brown head.

151
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:24,846
- Where are you now?
- In the office of the factory.

152
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:31,896
- Remain where you are. We'll come directly.
- Very nice of you.

153
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,828
Have you seen those black men?

154
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:50,880
Yes, especially that fat one with his curly
hair, his false eyes and his sun glasses.

155
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,635
A real assassin.

156
00:27:54,844 --> 00:28:00,225
Let them kill each other.
But not in our country.

157
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,148
- Where are they?
- There.

158
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,437
I have him.

159
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:45,144
- He has escaped.
- I could not help it, Colonel.

160
00:31:46,897 --> 00:31:51,153
Victor Pivert. Black Citroën D,
licence plate 438ZA75.

161
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,198
- Up at the river.
- Are you coming along?

162
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:57,827
No, he dismissed me.
His is on his own.

163
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:33,791
There he is.

164
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:01,906
- What are you doing here?
- Shut your mouth and sit quietly.

165
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:05,369
I'll return to my country
and you must help me.

166
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:20,473
Victor Pivert, he has shot down
two men.

167
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,187
Yes, a car on a boat.
Put out a search for him.

168
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,817
The latest news:

169
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:36,076
The kidnapped resistance leader
Slimane remains disappeared.

170
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:40,624
he hasn't contacted
the rebels in his fatherland.

171
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:48,508
Lets me call the police. They will catch
Farés and you can return to your country.

172
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,639
The police will hand me over
to our government and its assassins.

173
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:55,101
- Farés?
- Colonel Farés.

174
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:59,022
- Everyone is against you?
- No, the people stand behind me.

175
00:34:59,273 --> 00:35:02,777
- They cannot be lied to anymore!
- Yes, they can!

176
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:09,203
In my factory I lie the entire day.
The people love it there.

177
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:12,374
I'll end the disorder.

178
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:16,003
When I return,
I'll be Prime Minister.

179
00:35:16,378 --> 00:35:22,343
Prime Minister? Finally I can shake
the revolver of a Prime Minister.

180
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:24,222
And oil...

181
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:28,394
No more petrol. I must stop.

182
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,328
Where is he?
Where can he be?

183
00:35:43,164 --> 00:35:46,709
- What happens today?
- My daughter is getting married.

184
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:51,800
I only help you as favour.
Open your mouth and keep quiet.

185
00:35:53,594 --> 00:35:57,515
Yes, we have requested a conversation
with Piverts car.

186
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:03,106
Ms, I have contact with Mr.

187
00:36:08,822 --> 00:36:12,076
Keep it shut.
I am back in two minutes.

188
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,464
- Do not answer.
- It is my wife.

189
00:36:21,672 --> 00:36:24,759
If I don't answer,
she will track me down.

190
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:28,305
If I suspect the least...

191
00:36:32,227 --> 00:36:36,106
- Is that you, Germaine?
- It's been 11 hours.

192
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:40,822
I have waited since yesterday.
Where were you last night?

193
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,410
Say that you will leave for
the weekend with a woman.

194
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,996
- Do you get it?
- No.

195
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:55,382
- I'll elope with a woman.
- A woman? You are crazy.

196
00:36:55,592 --> 00:37:00,222
- Yes, I am crazy with her.
- What does she have that I don't?

197
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,023
She has large hairy hands,
large feet...

198
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:10,736
...that, and a large moustache.

199
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:17,829
- I hope that she believes you.
- I like her...

200
00:37:17,996 --> 00:37:21,750
...because she doesn't rub herself
with all kinds of lotion...

201
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:27,885
...and wears no clamp bra.
She sings when she massages my back.

202
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:31,680
She finds me clever
and thinks that I am 1.80 meter.

203
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:36,729
- What's her name?
- What's her name?

204
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:40,025
Invent a name.

205
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:45,031
- Thérése Leduc.
- She is 65.

206
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,913
Yes, she has loved me for 30 years.
And lets me be in peace.

207
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:54,835
Did you see that?
I hung up this time.

208
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:59,675
I'm off to Orly Airport, my
husband is there. Tell my daughter.

209
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:04,431
- Piverts wedding?
- Yes, put it there.

210
00:38:32,635 --> 00:38:35,889
I'm sorry, the doctor doesn't
receive patients today.

211
00:38:36,098 --> 00:38:42,148
- Police. I want to speak with Mr. Pivert.
- He is not here. What is the matter?

212
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:50,657
Quiet now. Ms. Pivert picks up her husband
at Orly Airport. She's back in two hours.

213
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:57,835
To Orly Airport. We must catch him
before he flies off.

214
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,631
- Hurry up.
- A moment, Mr.

215
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:12,728
57 francs, Mr.

216
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:18,236
- What was your speed?
- Eighty.

217
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:26,037
- Shall I check the oil?
- No, it's okay.

218
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:31,545
- Can I see your papers?
- Naturally.

219
00:39:59,415 --> 00:40:01,710
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

220
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,551
- Which of us were you mocking?
- Both.

221
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,890
- None of you, sir.
- Yes, you are both crazy.

222
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:20,442
- Turn around. What have you there?
- A wart.

223
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:22,486
A wart?

224
00:40:24,865 --> 00:40:27,951
- It's awful.
- I think it suits him.

225
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:34,753
Hideous. Small hair are coming out.

226
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:40,136
Doesn't it hurt?
And if I do this?

227
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,936
That does certainly hurt, huh?

228
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,776
- What happens here? Papers.
- I never have those.

229
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:56,948
No drivers license, no registration
certificate, no insurance. Arrest me.

230
00:40:57,116 --> 00:40:59,368
That will cost you.

231
00:41:00,078 --> 00:41:02,956
- What's your name?
- Pivert. Like in...

232
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,647
Full tank?

233
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:26,904
- We must leave. Farés is there.
- Now it's enough. Get out.

234
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:29,616
Into first gear!

235
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:27,316
Will you please remain seated?

236
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:32,240
Sit, Samuel.
My family waits for me in Paris.

237
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:37,747
I'm here for bar mitzvah...
the communion of my nephew David.

238
00:42:38,498 --> 00:42:40,334
He is already thirteen.

239
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:49,010
David, be quiet now.

240
00:42:51,473 --> 00:42:56,522
Mummy, how do you recognise uncle
Jacob? Only granny knows him.

241
00:42:57,523 --> 00:43:00,108
I'll recignize him.
- Hoezo, what do we do?

242
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,323
We had agreed on picking him up
in the car of Salomons boss.

243
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:10,456
He was fired yesterday.
- His boss fired him.

244
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:16,088
I have always said
that Mr. Pivert is very nice.

245
00:43:19,802 --> 00:43:23,474
I was almost run over and killed.
Why must I carry your trunk?

246
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,145
Because you must come along.
- No, go to your revolution alone.

247
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:30,191
I must go to the wedding.
- You must come along as my hostage.

248
00:43:53,638 --> 00:43:57,475
If you move one muscle, you're dead.
- I never do that.

249
00:43:57,934 --> 00:44:01,105
But look at that officer.

250
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,573
He is large.
A much better hostage than I.

251
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:38,028
Did you see her? Red hair.
- And?

252
00:44:42,118 --> 00:44:44,246
Stay here.

253
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:50,587
What a beauty.

254
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,634
What's his name?

255
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:04,271
Do you have a light?

256
00:45:11,072 --> 00:45:13,074
Of course he has a light.

257
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:25,090
Moron, idiot.
You find that funny, imbecile?

258
00:45:57,341 --> 00:46:01,637
There it is. The plane from New York
has landed.

259
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:05,936
Hurry up now.
- We can't miss him.

260
00:46:09,148 --> 00:46:12,110
David, come here.
- Hurry up.

261
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,948
Look, there he is.

262
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:19,161
Jacob, uncle Jacob.

263
00:46:19,662 --> 00:46:24,751
Where is Jacob? I see nothing.
- Look, there he comes.

264
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:31,259
Mr Pivert...

265
00:46:36,685 --> 00:46:41,649
Mr. Pivert, come to the counter!

266
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:44,860
They are here.
- Slimane and Pivert.

267
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:51,370
You come exactly on time.
Pivert has just been announced.

268
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:57,001
We must remember that
he is a murderer.

269
00:46:57,043 --> 00:46:58,962
Try it again.

270
00:47:03,094 --> 00:47:05,721
Victor, come back.

271
00:47:10,854 --> 00:47:14,900
- That is Germaine.
- Come back to me.

272
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:17,779
Germaine, where are you?

273
00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:30,880
I forgive you. Don't leave me
on the wedding day of our daughter.

274
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:33,048
Victor, do you hear me?

275
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:39,223
Yes, I hear you. Don't
shout this loud. I'm coming.

276
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:44,813
Your husband isn't about to
fly off with Thérése Leduc.

277
00:47:55,578 --> 00:47:59,792
- Give it back, I must announce things.
- This is more important.

278
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:24,991
- I saw the assassin.
- Is Farés here?

279
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:29,289
- He was right behind me.
- Wait, let me look first.

280
00:48:51,736 --> 00:48:53,572
- Open.
- No.

281
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,287
- Open.
- I am not here.

282
00:49:01,957 --> 00:49:05,043
- Open.
- Is not possible, it's occupied.

283
00:49:06,296 --> 00:49:08,798
- Open.
- Did you hear that?

284
00:49:10,718 --> 00:49:15,682
Mr, is your friend sick?
Perhaps we can help?

285
00:49:18,604 --> 00:49:20,272
Maybe you can.

286
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:48,017
Moron, out.

287
00:51:07,538 --> 00:51:12,419
Me as a rabbi - unbelievable!
- Wait.

288
00:51:25,728 --> 00:51:27,021
Jacob.

289
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:33,446
It is him.

290
00:51:43,919 --> 00:51:47,005
Let me greet him to.

291
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:52,512
- What now?
- Play the role. It is our only chance.

292
00:51:52,722 --> 00:51:58,227
I could recognise him among thousands.
He speaks as his brother, my husband.

293
00:51:58,437 --> 00:52:02,442
- Is he also a Schmoll?
- Schmoll?

294
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:04,445
Yes, who is he?

295
00:52:05,154 --> 00:52:10,119
Of course, you are right.

296
00:52:10,452 --> 00:52:16,460
He is my secretary, driver
and waiter. Here, my trunk.

297
00:52:17,004 --> 00:52:23,720
- What is he called?
- Him? Larbi Rabbi Slimane.

298
00:52:25,056 --> 00:52:30,354
Seligman, rabbi Seligman.
It's a pleasure.

299
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:37,404
Tell me, how are
they all in New York?

300
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:47,460
- Why don't you have a beard?
- I lent it out.

301
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:53,967
That Seligman is not just
anybody. A rabbi who is also a driver.

302
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:59,142
- You have a strange accent.
- You think?

303
00:52:59,433 --> 00:53:05,774
You have become a real American.
Shall I teach you your real accent?

304
00:53:06,901 --> 00:53:12,199
I know a good exercise.
Pronounce the names of fur.

305
00:53:13,912 --> 00:53:17,541
- Of fur.
- Ah, fur.

306
00:53:17,957 --> 00:53:19,668
Try.

307
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,349
Mink.

308
00:53:31,267 --> 00:53:33,686
Chinchilla.

309
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:36,231
Muskrat.

310
00:53:40,404 --> 00:53:44,784
- Fox.
- Fox, silver fox.

311
00:53:45,577 --> 00:53:48,747
- Panther.
- Panther.

312
00:53:49,874 --> 00:53:53,838
- No, panther. A cat.
- Panther.

313
00:53:57,802 --> 00:53:59,638
Very good, Jacob.

314
00:54:00,513 --> 00:54:02,974
Ms Pivert?
- That is me.

315
00:54:03,934 --> 00:54:07,230
Police. Your man waits
for you in the car.

316
00:54:07,814 --> 00:54:14,615
I knew that he would come back to me.
But why the police?

317
00:54:16,284 --> 00:54:20,915
- Your man is in trouble.
- That Thérése Leduc.

318
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:22,876
Come on, let's go.

319
00:54:32,055 --> 00:54:34,934
Where is Victor? Let me be.

320
00:54:41,275 --> 00:54:46,448
Where is Ms. Pivert?
- No idea. Somewhere there.

321
00:54:46,615 --> 00:54:49,493
Do I have pay attention to everyone?
- Yes, everyone.

322
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:55,292
Commissioner.
Two rabbis have been robbed.

323
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:59,674
- They have stolen their clothes and beards.
- What do the theives look like?

324
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:03,094
- A big guy with black hair.
- And a small bald guy.

325
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:06,808
Again Pivert and Slimane.

326
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:21,369
Pardon, this is a celebrity.

327
00:55:22,371 --> 00:55:25,123
Step up. I'll buy the tickets.

328
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,670
Ahead.

329
00:55:33,386 --> 00:55:35,304
You are very friendly.

330
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:40,519
And you are the nicest Jew
that I have ever seen.

331
00:55:40,686 --> 00:55:45,900
Beautiful looking and beautiful teeth.
Come, let me give you a kiss.

332
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:51,408
You are also very nice, Ms.

333
00:55:51,658 --> 00:55:55,580
Do you how many marriages
I have arranged?

334
00:55:55,747 --> 00:56:00,961
43. With 118 children. An average of
two and a half children by couple.

335
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:04,382
- Are you married?
- No.

336
00:56:04,718 --> 00:56:08,138
Do you prefer blondes or brunettes?

337
00:56:09,015 --> 00:56:10,766
- Redheads.
- I have that for your.

338
00:56:11,477 --> 00:56:14,981
After 30 years they don't even
come to pick me up.

339
00:56:15,356 --> 00:56:20,070
- Maybe they didn't get your telegram.
- I have sent 8.

340
00:56:20,823 --> 00:56:23,408
One must have arrived.

341
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:32,504
Do you see that violin box?
And what is inside that box?

342
00:56:35,633 --> 00:56:38,345
No, idiot...

343
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,850
Cover me. I'll go over there.

344
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,778
The address is Rue des Rosiers 8.
The phone number...

345
00:56:55,784 --> 00:56:57,953
Hello, rabbi...

346
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:01,375
Do you see. They did come to pick us
up?

347
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:06,840
Police. Commissioner Andréani.
- Ah, what an honour.

348
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:10,761
I don't often meet
two such strange looking rabbi's.

349
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:13,806
We aren't that strange looking.

350
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:18,230
- Keep off of my violin.
- Don't mistake me for a fool, Pivert.

351
00:57:20,816 --> 00:57:27,658
A big beard you have grown!
May I?

352
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:33,457
Pardon, Mr.

353
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:51,648
- Salomon, telephone.
- I'm coming.

354
00:57:57,364 --> 00:57:59,825
Who? Uncle Jacob?

355
00:58:01,454 --> 00:58:05,709
No, it's Salomon. Did you
have a pleasant journey?

356
00:58:05,709 --> 00:58:07,710
No, a very bad journey.

357
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:10,298
Where are you?
- At Orly Airport.

358
00:58:10,506 --> 00:58:13,844
After 30 years I'm picked
up by the police.

359
00:58:14,137 --> 00:58:18,475
- It is okay.
- Sorry, a misunderstanding.

360
00:58:19,435 --> 00:58:24,274
- What are you doing?
- I understand nothing, uncle Jacob.

361
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:33,829
Rabbi Jacob arrives in a taxi.
Bowl rapidly.

362
00:58:38,209 --> 00:58:43,550
What do you know?
Hang up, you idiot.

363
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:47,346
- Idiot?
- You must be crazy.

364
00:58:50,518 --> 00:58:51,978
Long live rabbi Jacob.

365
00:58:52,394 --> 00:58:56,358
Completely insane. Idiot...

366
00:59:04,827 --> 00:59:06,829
Bless them, uncle Jacob.

367
00:59:09,501 --> 00:59:15,884
- That is why you have come.
- He is modest.

368
00:59:18,136 --> 00:59:21,098
Stand up, uncle Jacob.
They want to welcome you.

369
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,728
Put out your head.

370
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:04,446
Not like that, you are a rabbi.

371
01:00:09,662 --> 01:00:13,626
This is your fault.
Wait until I tell them who you are.

372
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:22,304
Silence. All, be quiet now.

373
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,147
Welcome, rabbi Jacob,
my honoured teacher.

374
01:00:30,314 --> 01:00:35,111
You are brilliant,
you are bright as the sky.

375
01:00:35,821 --> 01:00:37,531
Well formulated.

376
01:00:42,747 --> 01:00:48,337
Receive, as a souvenir of this day,
this "streimel".

377
01:00:58,308 --> 01:01:05,650
What a beautiful "streimel".
Mink. I'll use it on Sundays.

378
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:12,493
For Saturdays.

379
01:01:12,787 --> 01:01:16,249
He said Sunday,
but of course I ment Saturday.

380
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:21,881
Silence.

381
01:01:23,634 --> 01:01:26,804
Rabbi Jacob will speak now.

382
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,601
Say something.

383
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,992
Dear Rosenfelds.

384
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:51,044
Dear Rozenbergs.

385
01:01:56,468 --> 01:01:58,679
Dear Koshers.

386
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:03,017
Not that.

387
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:10,570
Then that. Dear Levi's.

388
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:17,912
Dear Levi's.

389
01:02:19,749 --> 01:02:21,793
Keep the rest.

390
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:27,467
Uncle Jacob, you must get off.
The taxi driver wants to leave.

391
01:02:30,304 --> 01:02:34,560
- And if they ask me something?
- Do what Jews do.

392
01:02:34,726 --> 01:02:39,190
Always answer with a question.
Thus you can gain time.

393
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:53,751
Mr...

394
01:03:02,805 --> 01:03:06,475
- Jacob, do you recognise me?
- And do you recognise me?

395
01:03:06,643 --> 01:03:08,687
- No.
- So much the better.

396
01:03:10,691 --> 01:03:15,237
- We have thousands of questions for you.
- Then I have two thousand.

397
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:17,740
- Rabbi Jacob...
- Yes.

398
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:24,040
- My driver. He recognises me.
- I have but one question.

399
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:28,921
My boss fired me because I
don't want to work on Saturdays.

400
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:30,465
What do I do?

401
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:38,059
Ask if he will take you back
and ask for a rise. He will say yes.

402
01:03:38,309 --> 01:03:40,854
- The double?
- He will say yes.

403
01:03:41,063 --> 01:03:43,231
- Triple?
- No that.

404
01:03:48,448 --> 01:03:53,495
- I didn't know that you were Jewish.
- Yesterday I wasn't.

405
01:03:55,666 --> 01:04:00,463
You must not tell anyone.
Everyone's looking for me.

406
01:04:00,673 --> 01:04:03,884
- What have you done?
- I am innocent.

407
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:07,515
They want a scapegoat.

408
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:14,314
Hide me, then I re-hire you
and you get off for all your holidays!

409
01:04:14,523 --> 01:04:19,196
- And on the sabbat and on Sundays.
- And the Muslim holidays?

410
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:28,625
- Do they have that?
- What does Slimane do here?

411
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:30,711
Who?

412
01:04:31,004 --> 01:04:38,722
Rabbi Seligman, I have
found a redhair for you.

413
01:04:42,727 --> 01:04:46,314
She is called Hannah.
Go say hello.

414
01:04:53,783 --> 01:04:57,371
That is enough.
They are all ready.

415
01:04:58,497 --> 01:05:02,753
Silence, silence.

416
01:05:03,588 --> 01:05:07,258
Rabbi Jacob will dance.

417
01:05:08,803 --> 01:05:11,138
Can Rabbi Jacob dance?

418
01:07:18,055 --> 01:07:22,978
- You have talent!
- It was a wonder.

419
01:07:30,989 --> 01:07:34,367
How did you know that
Pivert was on Orly Airport?

420
01:07:34,618 --> 01:07:39,123
- He wants an adventure with Thérése Leduc.
- On his daughters wedding day?

421
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:43,420
No, not the drill.
I have always found that terrible.

422
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:50,514
He is with Slimane. Where are they?

423
01:07:57,022 --> 01:08:03,363
Is this 2334436? With whom do I speak?
- Answer. But be careful.

424
01:08:03,782 --> 01:08:07,411
- Germaine? It's Victor.
- Ah Victor, it's you.

425
01:08:08,162 --> 01:08:10,706
- Ask where he is.
- No.

426
01:08:12,502 --> 01:08:16,924
That drill. Did you hear me?

427
01:08:18,008 --> 01:08:21,930
- Where are you?
- Hiding at some Jewish friends.

428
01:08:22,305 --> 01:08:27,519
- Do you have Jewish friends?
- Yes. What's strange about that?

429
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:29,815
Say that the police force is here.

430
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:33,402
The police force is here.
They want to speak with you.

431
01:08:34,947 --> 01:08:38,034
Mr Pivert? This is the commissioner.

432
01:08:38,075 --> 01:08:42,331
I know where the assassins are.
You can catch them all.

433
01:08:43,709 --> 01:08:46,086
Where are you now?

434
01:08:46,128 --> 01:08:52,886
Their leader is called Farés.

435
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:56,474
I'll give you his description.

436
01:08:56,641 --> 01:09:00,480
Thick, curly hair, small false eyes,
sun glasses.

437
01:09:02,733 --> 01:09:05,944
A real assassin head.
- Exactly.

438
01:09:06,197 --> 01:09:08,616
I am at "Etoile de Kiev".

439
01:09:08,616 --> 01:09:13,914
A delikatessen-restaurant,
Rue des Rosiers 8.

440
01:09:17,878 --> 01:09:21,757
Sjaloom, rabbi.
- Sjaloom.

441
01:09:21,967 --> 01:09:23,927
Not you, him.

442
01:09:24,637 --> 01:09:30,394
Ask for rabbi Jacob.
Rabbi Jacob, that's me.

443
01:09:30,894 --> 01:09:34,816
Is Slimane also there?

444
01:09:35,067 --> 01:09:39,573
Yes, he is to marry
a red-haired girl.

445
01:09:39,739 --> 01:09:43,036
Remain where you are. We come.

446
01:09:44,872 --> 01:09:52,298
Have you heard it?
Hannah has gotten engaged.

447
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:58,055
- If rabbi Jacob agrees with it.
- What a neat little girl.

448
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:08,360
Does she please you? You have the
same hair.

449
01:10:10,321 --> 01:10:13,032
Rabbi Jacob gives his blessing.

450
01:10:21,587 --> 01:10:26,301
How can she let me down today?

451
01:10:34,102 --> 01:10:36,647
And dad has disappeared.

452
01:11:03,141 --> 01:11:05,769
Antoinette...

453
01:11:39,938 --> 01:11:43,860
- I can't do it.
- Are you rabbi Jacob or not?

454
01:11:44,236 --> 01:11:47,573
- I beg you.
- You are safe here.

455
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:50,785
Uncle Jacob, everything is ready.

456
01:11:55,668 --> 01:12:00,674
- What shall we do?
- How does such a Jewish communion work?

457
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:03,470
It'll work out fine.

458
01:12:08,559 --> 01:12:13,691
If my wife comes,
I'll go to the real church.

459
01:12:22,661 --> 01:12:25,580
Bless me, uncle Jacob.

460
01:12:30,839 --> 01:12:33,675
I give my blessing to you, David.

461
01:12:38,264 --> 01:12:40,976
You to, rabbi Seligman.

462
01:12:45,817 --> 01:12:49,486
God is with you, David.

463
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:05,758
- What is it?
- Tel. for rabbi Jacob.

464
01:13:05,926 --> 01:13:10,473
- One Ms Pivert.
- I'll be back.

465
01:13:25,784 --> 01:13:29,956
Do you hear that?
They say amen, just like us.

466
01:13:30,582 --> 01:13:34,671
Warn Mr. Pivert. Three assasins are
coming, their leader is called Farés.

467
01:13:35,047 --> 01:13:38,343
Three assassins? Here?

468
01:13:40,846 --> 01:13:46,604
- Quick, they want to kill Mr. Pivert.
- They are already here.

469
01:14:09,092 --> 01:14:11,219
Mazel tov, son.

470
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:33,915
What does he say?

471
01:14:34,584 --> 01:14:43,304
- You must read from the "thora".
- That is too much honour.

472
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:49,644
Also you, rabbi Seligman.

473
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:53,441
What a big honour for my family.

474
01:14:53,525 --> 01:14:56,778
As you like, rabbi Jacob.

475
01:15:21,019 --> 01:15:22,228
It is Hebrew.

476
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:25,190
From right to left,
just like Arabian.

477
01:15:26,442 --> 01:15:32,491
I'll give rabbi Seligman the honour.
He must read.

478
01:15:32,701 --> 01:15:35,954
The glasses. And the hand.

479
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:41,295
You must read from right to left.

480
01:15:42,964 --> 01:15:46,801
- Could they be here?
- It's possible.

481
01:15:46,886 --> 01:15:52,434
I think, it is a type of church.

482
01:15:56,065 --> 01:15:58,817
Your hat.

483
01:16:05,201 --> 01:16:09,832
Farés is in the synagogue.
Leave.

484
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:20,387
Your hat.

485
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:22,306
Your hat!

486
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:28,815
Silence.

487
01:16:29,775 --> 01:16:32,277
Brothers...

488
01:16:32,363 --> 01:16:34,823
...the three men
that have just come in...

489
01:16:35,074 --> 01:16:41,582
...are not here to pray.
They are assassins.

490
01:16:43,084 --> 01:16:48,048
They want to kill rabbi Jacob
and rabbi Seligman.

491
01:16:50,135 --> 01:16:53,722
Help me save them.

492
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:04,613
What are you doing? let me be.

493
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:24,929
Salomon, come here.

494
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:33,691
Wait in the "Etoile de Kiev".
I'll get the car.

495
01:17:33,692 --> 01:17:36,028
How did Farés know where we were?

496
01:17:36,195 --> 01:17:41,201
- From the commissioner.
- That was Farés.

497
01:17:41,243 --> 01:17:45,207
Was that Farés.

498
01:18:00,685 --> 01:18:05,108
Thirty years, Samuel,
and everything is still the same.

499
01:18:09,323 --> 01:18:14,787
There is the synagogue.
And this is the "Etoile de Kiev".

500
01:18:15,706 --> 01:18:20,378
Hey, what happens? Leave me alone.

501
01:18:25,718 --> 01:18:27,887
Drive.

502
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:36,564
Mr, come quick.
Take this and get away.

503
01:18:40,571 --> 01:18:42,197
Get away.

504
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,659
You have saved my life.
I will reward you.

505
01:18:45,411 --> 01:18:51,920
Hey, Salomon, Slimane...
Are you guys sometimes cousins?

506
01:18:52,086 --> 01:18:56,717
- Cousins?
- Distant cousins. Thanks.

507
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:02,099
Save that for later.
Ahead, to St. Louis des Invalides.

508
01:19:20,999 --> 01:19:24,377
Police. Commissioner Andréani.

509
01:19:29,217 --> 01:19:32,013
Mummy, there is the "Etoile de Kiev".

510
01:19:32,639 --> 01:19:38,187
We thought that you were someone else.
It was a misunderstanding.

511
01:19:38,605 --> 01:19:41,359
A misunderstanding which you will
regret.

512
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:50,454
- Let them be or I'll call the police.
- This is the police, mother.

513
01:19:51,872 --> 01:19:53,499
There's Salomon.

514
01:20:01,677 --> 01:20:05,973
- What have you done to my husband?
- He is safe.

515
01:20:05,974 --> 01:20:09,437
- Where is he?
- On the way to you, on my moped.

516
01:20:43,816 --> 01:20:46,443
I'm suffocating.

517
01:20:52,868 --> 01:20:59,710
- Take off your beard, Pivert.
- Pivert? Who are those Piverts?

518
01:21:02,673 --> 01:21:06,428
- What are you doing?
- That is not Slimane.

519
01:21:10,767 --> 01:21:12,644
And I am not Pivert.

520
01:21:17,734 --> 01:21:21,280
My boat and my car.
There, they have stolen it.

521
01:21:21,322 --> 01:21:27,037
- Follow them.
- Don't shout this way.

522
01:21:34,047 --> 01:21:37,051
- More speed.
- No, then my hat blows off.

523
01:21:54,784 --> 01:21:57,703
Quick, this way.

524
01:22:06,632 --> 01:22:08,968
Follow them.

525
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,982
No, it's not me.

526
01:22:22,695 --> 01:22:24,404
No, not my moustache.

527
01:22:38,173 --> 01:22:41,719
- You are Pivert.
- Rabbi Jacob.

528
01:22:50,355 --> 01:22:57,406
D, call number 438ZA75,
following the boat Germaine II...

529
01:22:57,656 --> 01:23:00,702
...driving in direction
of Place de la Concorde.

530
01:23:15,597 --> 01:23:20,060
- Don't kill them. They will say nothing.
- No, I say nothing.

531
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:24,400
I have forgotten everything. I
don't even know yout name, Mr Farés.

532
01:23:27,613 --> 01:23:30,116
Do not shoot. I have an idea.

533
01:23:30,617 --> 01:23:35,705
You do not shoot, let me go
to my daughters wedding.

534
01:23:35,832 --> 01:23:39,961
And tomorrow you send me a letter
bomb.

535
01:23:40,046 --> 01:23:44,301
I am at home, the doorbell rings...

536
01:23:51,101 --> 01:23:53,230
- Who is it?
- I open...

537
01:23:55,773 --> 01:23:57,526
A letter bomb.

538
01:24:00,155 --> 01:24:02,783
- And for whom?
- Not for me.

539
01:24:03,243 --> 01:24:04,411
Shut up.

540
01:24:05,203 --> 01:24:08,416
- I open it.
- No, don't open it. NO!

541
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:15,717
Pivert is gone, Jacob is one, Farés
is gone.

542
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:19,220
That is for me.

543
01:24:25,397 --> 01:24:31,028
Is it the car of Mr Pivert?
Is president Slimane there?

544
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:33,948
President Slimane?

545
01:24:35,576 --> 01:24:37,745
The minister wants to speak with him.

546
01:24:40,166 --> 01:24:42,459
It is for you, the minister.

547
01:24:43,921 --> 01:24:45,548
Give it to me.

548
01:24:48,052 --> 01:24:50,763
- President?
- Slimane speaking.

549
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:56,019
The Revolutionary Council has taken
over the power in your country.

550
01:24:56,228 --> 01:24:58,980
They want you to return directly.

551
01:24:59,191 --> 01:25:02,695
- Should I start mentioning the oil?
- That is inappropriate.

552
01:25:03,154 --> 01:25:08,368
- A concorde for him then?
- Not this fast. You'll spoil everything.

553
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:13,376
Then I'll start with the Alouette.
A careful start.

554
01:25:15,086 --> 01:25:19,717
We'll pick you op
with the newest Alouette.

555
01:25:19,967 --> 01:25:24,682
- Succeeded.
- We have made it.

556
01:25:26,101 --> 01:25:31,858
Slimane, you must be grateful
that I have saved your life.

557
01:25:32,025 --> 01:25:36,071
- Because they...
- Achkoum Farés, president.

558
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:42,079
Stop this Achkoum... You have
put your money on the wrong camel.

559
01:25:57,017 --> 01:25:59,059
You see that, president?

560
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:10,283
That's France...
France!

561
01:26:37,444 --> 01:26:41,449
Now it is enough. It has been 2
hours, I can't wait any longer.

562
01:26:41,992 --> 01:26:47,038
- Take away those flowers.
- But reverend...

563
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:50,669
I have found them.
They are on the way.

564
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:54,465
- But I soon have a burial.
- That can wait.

565
01:26:54,508 --> 01:27:01,350
Alexandre, Mrs. Markiezin leaves.
Will you please wait?

566
01:27:01,517 --> 01:27:06,481
- They are on the way.
- No, I have already waited for two hours.

567
01:27:08,066 --> 01:27:12,197
- Wasn't it in the Notre Dame?
- Will we get lunch anyway?

568
01:27:12,448 --> 01:27:15,160
- Better luck next time.
- Shut up.

569
01:27:15,202 --> 01:27:19,832
- Mother, father. What now?
- Two hours late.

570
01:27:19,999 --> 01:27:24,463
- Unbelievable.
- Pivert can't be trusted.

571
01:27:31,222 --> 01:27:32,807
What is that?

572
01:27:39,525 --> 01:27:43,030
- What is that, mother?
- Ready!

573
01:28:05,517 --> 01:28:09,481
- I am here, general.
- Pivert.

574
01:28:10,858 --> 01:28:12,527
I am ready.

575
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:16,530
I am the father of the bride.

576
01:28:16,615 --> 01:28:20,287
- You, rabbi?
- It is a scandal!

577
01:28:20,745 --> 01:28:24,833
I require an explanation.
Two hours late and wearing a disguise.

578
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,172
What now? You also
have a "streimel"?

579
01:28:30,091 --> 01:28:33,219
And you also have these corkscrew
curls.

580
01:28:36,056 --> 01:28:37,225
We are there.

581
01:28:37,977 --> 01:28:39,686
That is my wife.

582
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,905
- Mother, stop.
- Shall I drive?

583
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,991
The brakes don't work.

584
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:59,629
That white smoke comes from the
engine.

585
01:29:16,485 --> 01:29:18,863
My boat.

586
01:29:21,993 --> 01:29:24,745
- Was that on purpose?
- My hat.

587
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:27,791
My boat... Your hat.

588
01:29:29,877 --> 01:29:31,587
I'll just leave.

589
01:29:32,589 --> 01:29:37,803
- Is that necessary?
- Father, mother, not today.

590
01:29:38,305 --> 01:29:40,516
Jacob, there he is.

591
01:29:55,535 --> 01:30:00,917
- Pivert, who are those people?
- Those are my friends, the Schmolls.

592
01:30:01,085 --> 01:30:03,879
I was in the synagogue,
now we go to the church.

593
01:30:03,922 --> 01:30:06,342
- Got you!
- Good.

594
01:30:06,383 --> 01:30:07,926
Imbecile.

595
01:30:41,054 --> 01:30:43,056
Mr president...

596
01:30:50,441 --> 01:30:54,445
May I be the first to congratulate...

597
01:30:54,947 --> 01:30:58,200
- Slimane, you are arrested.
- Me?

598
01:30:58,409 --> 01:31:05,126
- You'll regret this.
- We will see.

599
01:31:05,335 --> 01:31:10,174
- Do you see? I have them in cuffs.
- Release them, imbecile.

600
01:31:11,927 --> 01:31:14,180
Yes sir, mr. minister.

601
01:31:15,432 --> 01:31:19,728
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Ah, it's nothing.

602
01:31:20,396 --> 01:31:21,939
Thank you, officer.
- Officer?

603
01:31:22,191 --> 01:31:25,152
Yes, tomorrow...

604
01:31:50,852 --> 01:31:54,607
My veil. Can I have it?

605
01:31:55,985 --> 01:31:57,611
No.

606
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:09,544
Antoinette.

607
01:32:11,088 --> 01:32:14,925
Where is she off to now?
Antoinette, come back.

608
01:32:15,135 --> 01:32:18,431
You see that, minister?
He takes her along...

609
01:32:20,725 --> 01:32:25,398
Victor, you can't let her
go along with a... a...

610
01:32:26,232 --> 01:32:30,862
President.
My daughter is marrying a president.

611
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:57,940
Are you coming to celebrate the
bar mitzvah tonight?

612
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:04,950
Rabbi Jacob, I must confess something.
I am not Jewish.

613
01:33:05,493 --> 01:33:08,245
Well, nevertheless, you can remain.
