1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,922
Phoebe found out about this lady...

2
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:09,259
...who knew her parents,
and I don't know what happened.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,637
I'm your mother.

4
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,973
<i>Monica joked she</i>
<i>wouldn't date Chandler.</i>

5
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,060
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>happened there either.</i>

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,521
<i>Ross' new girlfriend shows up.</i>

7
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:24,650
<i>Rachel gets Bonnie to shave her head.</i>
<i>Then they kiss.</i>

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,153
<i>Now he has to choose</i>
<i>Rachel or the bald girl.</i>

9
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,447
I don't know what
happened there either.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,701
Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.

11
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,388
She's helping me.
My head's sunburned.

12
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,017
- Thanks a million.
- You're welcome a million.

13
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:02,897
I'll be in our room.

14
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,659
Oh, my God!

15
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,954
I know.

16
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,084
I got to go.

17
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,420
I got to go break up with Bonnie.

18
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,214
Here? Now?

19
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,299
I can't stay here all night.

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,845
If I go in there, she'll want to...

21
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,055
...do stuff.

22
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,892
Can't you say
you aren't in the mood?

23
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,145
No, she likes that.

24
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,397
Faking sleep doesn't work.

25
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,818
I've woken up many times with her...

26
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:55,658
- Why am I telling you?
- I don't know.

27
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,627
- Not every morning...
- Making it worse!

28
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,881
The One with the Jellyfish

29
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,012
You probably want to know
how it happened.

30
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,724
I think I can figure it out.

31
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:06,312
I was born, and then
everyone lied their asses off.

32
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,939
No, it wasn't like that.

33
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,735
Remember how I said
Lilly, Frank and I were close?

34
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,571
We were very close.

35
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,197
How close?

36
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:22,619
The three of us were
kind of a couple.

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,288
I don't know how that would work.

38
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,708
I'm not asking!

39
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,003
Anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...

40
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,921
...and I was...

41
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:37,343
...scared.
I was stupid and selfish...

42
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:42,014
I was 18 years old.
Remember what it was like to be 18?

43
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,058
Mom killed herself
and my dad ran off.

44
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:50,815
I lived in a Gremlin with a guy
who talked to his hand.

45
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,902
I'm sorry. I thought I'd left you
with the best parents.

46
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,031
I didn't hear about them
till a few years ago.

47
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,366
By then, you were already grown-up.

48
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:06,080
You're here and I would
really like to get to know you.

49
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,250
Well, everybody does.

50
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,543
I'm a really cool person.

51
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:16,881
You had 29 years to find out,
but you didn't even try.

52
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,844
You walked out on me,
and I'll do the same.

53
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,181
I don't ever want to see you again.

54
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,021
Where's my purse?

55
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,440
Shoot! We're out of soda.

56
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,026
- I'll get you some.
- Really?

57
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,988
No, because I'm not your boyfriend.

58
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,159
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?

59
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:50,082
My mom's friend, Phoebe,
is actually my birth mom.

60
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,045
I found a dried-up seahorse.

61
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,671
What do you mean?

62
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:01,427
My new mom,
who's a big fat abandoner.

63
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:06,473
Don't you want to stay here
and talk about it?

64
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,227
I need to be alone.

65
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,742
It's over.

66
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,327
Was it awful?

67
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,580
It was long.

68
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,874
I didn't realize how late it was...

69
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:36,712
...till I saw the five o'clock shadow
on her head.

70
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:46,222
She didn't want to stay.
I called a cab. She just left.

71
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,354
I wrote you a letter.

72
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,316
Oh, thank you!

73
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,903
I like mail.

74
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,826
It's just some things I've been
thinking about. About us.

75
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,496
Before we even think about us
getting back together...

76
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:16,210
...I need to know
how you feel about this stuff.

77
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,889
It's 5:30 in the morning.

78
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:35,270
So I'd better get
cracking on this baby.

79
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,650
Come up when you're done.

80
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,444
I'll be up...

81
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,739
...in 18 pages.

82
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,201
Front and back.

83
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,830
Very exciting!

84
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,357
Why didn't you come up?

85
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,276
Done.

86
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:28,281
- You just finished?
- I wanted to be thorough.

87
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,536
This is clearly
very important to you. To us.

88
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,540
I wanted to read
every word carefully.

89
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,293
Twice.

90
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,132
Does it?

91
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,097
Sorry?

92
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,935
Does it?

93
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:07,071
I wanted to give that whole
"Does it?" part another glance.

94
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,449
What do you mean?
You said you read it twice.

95
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,286
It either does or doesn't.
If you have to think...

96
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,748
No, I don't have to think about it.

97
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,750
In fact...

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,003
...I've decided.
I have decided...

99
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,465
...that it...

100
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,346
...does.

101
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,404
Are you sure?

102
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,950
Sure, I'm sure!

103
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:03,127
There's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.

104
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,589
Would you go out with me?

105
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,637
I've got canned goods.

106
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,473
Take a look at this!

107
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:21,394
Check this baby out!
Dug me a hole.

108
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,524
Excellent hole, Joe.

109
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,818
Oh, no! My hole!

110
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,362
My foot!

111
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,863
What is it?

112
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,242
Jellyfish sting!
It hurts!

113
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,452
Can we help you to the house?

114
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,038
It's two miles.

115
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:43,042
And I'm tired from digging.

116
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,835
Damn the jellyfish!

117
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,504
Damn all the jellyfish!

118
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,047
Do something.

119
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,716
There's only one thing.

120
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,050
What is it?

121
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,054
Pee on it.

122
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,389
Gross!

123
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,808
I saw it on Discovery Channel.

124
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,812
He's right.
There's ammonia in that...

125
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,480
...that kills the pain.

126
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:10,569
Forget it.
It doesn't hurt that bad!

127
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,281
You can use my hole for privacy.

128
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:20,954
I'm ready to get
the hell out of here.

129
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,625
Are you...?

130
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,751
That's so great!

131
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,713
Not for Bonnie.

132
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:33,259
But for you, yea!

133
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,680
- How was the beach?
- Nothing. I don't know.

134
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,767
- What happened?
- Nothing.

135
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,478
- I'm going to shower.
- Me too.

136
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,980
Me too.

137
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,858
I'll put this in the car.

138
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,444
I have to go pack!

139
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,280
- And it really does?
- It does.

140
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,160
It really and truly does.

141
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:24,726
It so does not!

142
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,360
She wants me to take responsibility
for everything that went wrong.

143
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,907
She goes on for five pages
about how I was unfaithful to her.

144
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,826
We were on a break!

145
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:47,457
If you say that one more time,
I'll break up with you.

146
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,378
This breakup was not all my fault.
She says here...

147
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,422
..."If you accept full responsibility...

148
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,176
...I can begin to trust you again."

149
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:02,640
"Does that seem like
something you can do? Does it?"

150
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,729
You have what you want.
You're back with her.

151
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,983
If you bring this up now,
you'll wreck it.

152
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,070
Yeah, I know.
You're right.

153
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,031
I'll let it go.

154
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,451
But you know how hard it is
to forget this?

155
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,286
Sure, it's hard...

156
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,914
...but you don't have to talk about it.

157
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,542
A lot happened on that trip...

158
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:35,505
...that we should
never, ever talk about.

159
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:40,302
What happened on that beach?

160
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:45,015
It's between us and the sea, Ross.

161
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,609
Hi, Ursula.

162
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,488
I know that we haven't talked
in a long time.

163
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:04,534
Our mom is not our birth mom.
This other lady is our birth mom.

164
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,122
Right, the one that lives in Montauk.

165
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,373
You know her?

166
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:13,377
No. I read about her
in Mom's suicide note.

167
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:18,590
There was a suicide note?
Do you still have it?

168
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,969
Hang on.

169
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,680
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

170
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:29,226
Yeah, so how have you been doing?

171
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,270
Shut up!

172
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,943
"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.
I'll miss you."

173
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,738
"P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."

174
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,658
You just wrote this!

175
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:48,537
It's pretty much the gist.

176
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:53,458
Except for the poem.
You read the poem, right?

177
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:57,838
All right. Hang on.

178
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,928
Pass the cheese, please.

179
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:13,145
You can't even look at me, can you?

180
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:18,233
It's Phoebe!
We can talk to Phoebe!

181
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,902
I'm too depressed to talk.

182
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,198
I'll give you $1000 to talk.

183
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:30,204
What about making that
beach trip an annual thing?

184
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,040
What happened out there?

185
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,585
What? We took a walk.
Nothing happened.

186
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,921
I came back with nothing all over me.

187
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:43,550
What happened?
Joey?

188
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:44,844
All right.

189
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,970
We swore we'd never tell.

190
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,808
They'll never understand.

191
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:57,856
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive!

192
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:04,155
- Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
- All right!

193
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,163
I got stung.

194
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,708
Stung bad.

195
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,128
I couldn't stand.

196
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,088
I couldn't walk.

197
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,925
We were two miles from the house.

198
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,678
We were scared and alone.

199
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,932
We didn't think we could make it.

200
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,353
I was in pain.

201
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,315
And I was tired from digging.

202
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,778
Then Joey remembered something.

203
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,364
I'd seen it on Discovery Channel.

204
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,199
Wait, I saw that.

205
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:55,455
On the Discovery Channel.
About jellyfish and how if you...

206
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,586
You peed on yourself?

207
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,632
You can't say that!
You don't know!

208
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,719
I thought I would pass out.

209
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:12,264
I tried, but I couldn't...

210
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,183
...bend that way.

211
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,988
That's right.
I stepped up.

212
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:31,909
She's my friend and she needed help.

213
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,121
If I had to,
I'd pee on any of you.

214
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,251
Only...

215
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,255
...I couldn't.

216
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,509
I got the stage fright.

217
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,681
I wanted to help,
but there was too much pressure.

218
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,560
So I turned to Chandler.

219
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:04,941
Joey kept screaming at me,
"Do it now. Do it. Do it now!"

220
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:10,489
Sometimes, late at night,
I can still hear the screaming.

221
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:16,119
Because I do it through my wall
to freak you out.

222
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,457
<i>And fuchsia and mauve</i>

223
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:26,713
<i>Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom</i>

224
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:33,012
I invite all of you to count
the colors in your bedroom.

225
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:37,224
Except for you.
You go away.

226
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,686
I'll go in a second.

227
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,856
I just want to tell you...

228
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:48,110
...there wasn't a day
I didn't regret giving you up.

229
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,446
Okay, bye.

230
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:52,865
I'm not done.

231
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,702
The reason I never
looked you up was because...

232
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,871
...I was afraid you'd react...

233
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:02,499
...just like the way
you're reacting now.

234
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:07,629
Can't we just start from here?
Please?

235
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,473
Sorry.

236
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,767
One last thing.

237
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:24,980
You came looking for family.

238
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,858
I'm family.

239
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,069
I'm it.

240
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:35,824
Now I'm done.

241
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,413
It's not like we're losing anything.

242
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,832
I guess you're right.

243
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:48,712
It's not like we know each other
or have anything in common.

244
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,755
I don't know.
It's not like...

245
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:55,219
...we don't have anything in common.

246
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,805
I mean, I like pizza.

247
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,725
I like pizza!

248
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,687
Wait, I like the Beatles.

249
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:07,940
Oh, my God!
So do I.

250
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,609
Puppies.
Cute or ugly?

251
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:14,029
So cute!

252
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,198
You see?

253
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,492
But I'm still mad at you.

254
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,953
I know.

255
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:24,623
I'm mad at me too.

256
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:29,169
Do you want to get something to eat?
I'm kind of hungry.

257
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,046
Hey! Me too!

258
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:36,593
Stop it. Now you're just
doing it to freak me out.

259
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,641
I missed you.

260
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:46,311
I missed you too.

261
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:52,192
I was so nervous about that letter.

262
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,905
But the way you
owned up to everything...

263
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:02,160
...it just showed me
how much you've grown.

264
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,331
I suppose.

265
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:09,627
You have, Ross.
You should give yourself credit.

266
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:14,173
My mom never thought
this would work out.

267
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:19,678
She said, "Once a cheater,
always a cheater."

268
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:25,601
I just wish we hadn't
lost those four months.

269
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:32,191
But if time was what you needed
to gain a little perspective...

270
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,903
We were on a break!

271
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,447
- Coffeehouse?
- You bet.

272
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,743
It took two people
to break up this relationship.

273
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:48,081
You and that girl, which yesterday
you took full responsibility for.

274
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:51,043
I didn't know what
I took responsibility for.

275
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,754
I didn't finish the letter.

276
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,297
I fell asleep.

277
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,258
You fell asleep?

278
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,345
It was 5:30 in the morning.

279
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:07,684
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

280
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:11,605
Front and back!

281
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:16,735
By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E
means "you are".

282
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,488
Y-O-U-R means "your".

283
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:26,161
I can't believe I thought of getting
back with you! We are so over.

284
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,830
Fine by me!

285
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:33,168
Those spelling tips will be handy
Saturday nights at home...

286
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,712
...playing Scrabble with Monica.

287
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,132
Sorry!

288
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:41,886
All that sleep you'll miss
wishing you were with me!

289
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,596
Don't worry about me falling asleep.

290
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:48,642
I still have your letter!

291
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:51,770
Just so you know,
it's not that common.

292
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,231
It doesn't happen to every guy.

293
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,025
And it is a big deal!

294
00:21:57,276 --> 00:22:00,613
I knew it!

295
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,825
Gin.

296
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,621
We were playing gin?

297
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:13,876
If we were a couple,
we could play naked.

298
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:17,254
Would you stop?

299
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:18,838
All right.

300
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,882
I think you're great.

301
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:24,136
I think you're sweet and smart...

302
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:27,264
...and I love you.

303
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:32,436
But you'll always be the guy
who peed on me.
