1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,257
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go.

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:11,595
That's right. Daddy and Uncle Joey
are going on a trip today.

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:16,391
We're going to a conference in Barbados.
Right? Can you say, "Barbados"?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,519
Barbados.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:24,524
Okay. I've gotta say, it means so much
to me that you guys are coming...

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,402
...all the way over there
to hear me give my speech.

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,489
And I have a surprise.
I had to pull some strings...

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:35,702
...but I was able to get everyone passes
to the entire conference. That's right!

9
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:42,334
These babies will get you into all
the paleontology lectures and seminars.

10
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:46,630
Do you have anything
that will get us out of them?

11
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,593
We're excited to hear the speech,
but the rest of the time...

12
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,636
...we're gonna want to do island stuff.

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,055
David will probably want to hear
a few lectures.

14
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,265
- Right, because he's a scientist.
- No, no.

15
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:01,186
He's been in Minsk for eight years.
If he gets too much direct sunlight...

16
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,105
...he'll die.

17
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,148
- Okay, we'd better go.
- Yeah?

18
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,193
- So we'll see you guys tomorrow.
- All right, let's do it.

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,029
A five-hour flight with Charlie,
have a couple drinks...

20
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,699
...get under that blanket
and do what comes natural.

21
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,119
It's a blanket, Joe,
not a cloak of invisibility.

22
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,914
The One In Barbados

25
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:20,098
- Wow, this place is beautiful!
- Look at all these paleontologists!

26
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,686
I know. There are gonna be some
pasty folks by the pool tomorrow.

27
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,982
- My God, I can't believe you're here!
- I think I've been recognized.

28
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:33,445
- This happens all the time.
- Dr. Geller? I am such a huge fan.

29
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,031
That never happens.

30
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,619
I've been following your career for years.
I can't wait for your keynote speech.

31
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:45,207
- Wow! This is very flattering.
- I would love your autograph.

32
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,542
Well, sure.

33
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,587
- "Dear...?"
- Sarah.

34
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:56,009
"Sarah. I dig you."

35
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,263
- "Dr. Ross Geller."
- Oh, thank you so much.

36
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,685
Sure. Sarah, I'd like you to introduce you
to my colleague, Professor Wheeler.

37
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,855
- And this is Joey Tribbiani.
- Are you a paleontologist?

38
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,318
No, God, no, no.
I'm an actor.

39
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,321
You probably recognize me from a
little show called "The Days of Our Lives."

40
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:21,118
Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives."
There's no "the."

41
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:28,876
Okay, Ross. Boy, you... Yeah.
No, no. I play Dr. Drake Ramoray.

42
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:34,840
- I'm sorry. I don't own a TV.
- You don't own a TV?

43
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,593
What's all your furniture pointed at?

44
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,931
David, can you help me?

45
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,560
I'm trying to explain to Chandler
how a plane stays in the air.

46
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,521
Certainly. That's a combination
of Bernoulli's Principle...

47
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,524
...and Newton's third law of motion.
- See?

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,362
Yeah. That's the same as,
"It has something to do with wind."

49
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,448
I'm gonna go pick up a few things
for the trip.

50
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,493
I should go too. Now, tomorrow do you
want to share a cab to the airport...

51
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,287
...or should Mike and I meet you?

52
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,836
Mike? Who's Mike?

53
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,924
- Mike's your ex-boyfriend.
- That's right!

54
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,802
Oh, yeah.
Wow, I had totally forgotten about him.

55
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:26,892
- That's a blast from the past, huh?
- No, it's okay. Honest mistake.

56
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,811
It really doesn't mean anything.
I mean, you know...

57
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,981
...Monica refers to Chandler as Richard
all the time.

58
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,278
- She does?
- Let's get you out of here.

59
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,370
Well, at least you took me down
with you.

60
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,124
I'm so sorry. I just...
I keep thinking about Mike.

61
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:54,086
I'm crazy about David, and
we're having so much fun together.

62
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,423
Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just...
That's gonna go away, right?

63
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,634
- Well, I guess. In time.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,763
I mean, my feelings for Richard
are certainly gone.

65
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:09,518
You just did it again. Chandler. Your
feelings for Chandler are certainly gone.

66
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,064
Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up
on that Mike, huh?

67
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:17,276
I wouldn't read too much into it.

68
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,654
Still, a girl calls you
by her ex-boyfriend's name...

69
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,866
...that's not a good thing, right?
- Let me stop you there.

70
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:28,704
Because I think I see where this is going.
I'm not very good at giving advice.

71
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,748
See, if you want advice,
go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...

72
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:37,254
...for advice about pizza toppings
or a burning sensation when you pee.

73
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,717
I'm sorry, I just wish there
was something I could do, you know?

74
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,555
- Well, you know Phoebe...
- Seriously, we're gonna do this?

75
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,392
I'm sorry, I just wish I could make her
forget about Mike already.

76
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:55,397
- Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
- Because his penis was too big.

77
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,696
I'm sorry. That's the kind of thing I do.

78
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,825
They broke up because Mike
didn't want to get married.

79
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,578
What if you let Phoebe know
you'd be open to marriage?

80
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,999
That's great. That's great.
I'll propose to her.

81
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,625
What?

82
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,212
I was probably going to do it
at some point.

83
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,131
- No, I didn't mean now.
- Well, why not? It's brilliant.

84
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,217
"Goodbye, Mike.
We'll see you at the wedding, fella.

85
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,262
Well, we probably won't invite you
to the wedding, but..."

86
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,975
- Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
- Well, you're welcome.

87
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,102
Glad I could help.

88
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,648
- How do you think I should propose?
- I'm pretending to read here.

89
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,483
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,906
Yeah. How you doing?
Hey, how are you?

91
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,161
You said you were gonna wear a thong.
Where's the thong?

92
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:56,667
I didn't mean a thong.
I meant thongs.

93
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,337
You really should have been
more clear about that.

94
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,803
You're never gonna guess
who I just saw downstairs.

95
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,222
Britney Spears!

96
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,308
Yeah.
She never misses these conferences.

97
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,062
- No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
- Oh, my God!

98
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,814
- I know!
- Did you talk to him?

99
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:22,234
Oh, yeah. What am I gonna say
to Kenneth Schwartz?

100
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,571
You could say, "Hey, Kenny,
how come you're not Britney Spears?"

101
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,574
- You ready to go?
- You're gonna go now?

102
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,578
- I thought we could hang out.
- I can't. I have seminars all day.

103
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,872
I promised Ross
I'd look at his speech.

104
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:42,171
But maybe we could have dinner later?
Out on the balcony? Lt'll be romantic.

105
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,548
Will you wear a thong?

106
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,508
I will if you will.

107
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,470
You got yourself a very weird deal.

108
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,476
I'm good. I have dinner plans.

109
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,979
- So you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

110
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:03,234
I got tons of stuff I could do.
I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.

111
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,193
Joe, have you looked outside?

112
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,779
No. Why?

113
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,867
- Oh, man.
- There's an indoor pool.

114
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,619
- You could swim there.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,332
I wasn't gonna swim.
I was gonna dig a hole.

116
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,881
That Mike thing was interesting.
I don't know what's gonna happen...

117
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:30,677
...with Phoebe and David.
- I do. Want a hint, huh?

118
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,470
I do.

119
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,183
I do.

120
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:39,562
Okay, I'm sensing this is
some kind of wordplay...

121
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,815
...because you are pink
with barely controlled glee.

122
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:48,028
- David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
- What? Why?

123
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,573
Because we were talking about ways
he could beat Mike...

124
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,034
...and I told him Phoebe wanted
to get married.

125
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,161
Chandler, we have talked about this.

126
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,331
You are not supposed to give
people advice!

127
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,585
Couldn't you have made
some inappropriate joke?

128
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,297
I did! A penis one!

129
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,216
Just so I know, what was so wrong
about what I said?

130
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,635
They've only been going out
for a few weeks.

131
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,181
Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.
I mean, she'll say no...

132
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,935
...David's heart will be broken,
it'll be too hard for them to recover...

133
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,021
...and then Phoebe will end up
alone again.

134
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,025
Man, that's some bad advice.

135
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,034
Oh, hey.
Thank God. You guys are here.

136
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,455
- What's going on?
- Everything is upside-down here.

137
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:45,544
It rains all day long and nobody
watches TV, and Ross is famous.

138
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,423
I don't want to alarm anybody...

139
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,135
...but Monica's hair is twice as big
as it was when we landed.

140
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,013
Okay. When I go places
with high humidity...

141
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,599
...it gets a little extra body, okay?

142
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:04,021
That's why our honeymoon photos
look like me and Diana Ross.

143
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,981
I'll show you guys where to check in.

144
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,151
Oh, honey? Can you make sure
we get a king-size bed?

145
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:14,072
Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh, and
see if they have a heart-shaped one.

146
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,326
And with mirrors on the ceiling.

147
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,204
And make sure our room
isn't next to theirs.

148
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,625
Oh, you guys are so lucky
you're here with people.

149
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,002
You know, it's just
such a romantic place.

150
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:31,924
I just wish I could share it with a guy.

151
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,552
- Not Joey.
- Not Joey. No.

152
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:40,808
- I was just lusting after Chandler.
- Yeah, right.

153
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:47,898
So... I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.

154
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,608
Tonight?

155
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:53,404
Isn't an engagement ring
supposed to have a diamond?

156
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,740
Oh, there it is.

157
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,286
Yes, well, being a failed scientist doesn't
pay quite as well as you might think.

158
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,665
That's one-seventieth of a carat.

159
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,752
And the clarity is quite poor.

160
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,381
Nice.

161
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,927
- Monica, can I talk to you for a second?
- Okay.

162
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,970
David's gonna propose
to Phoebe tonight.

163
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,057
See what happens
when you give people advice?

164
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,852
- Well, I hope you told him not to.
- That would be advice!

165
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,980
Okay, fine. I'll handle this.

166
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,569
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

167
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:38,240
- I need to talk to you.
- Are you leaving the Supremes?

168
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:49,876
Okay, my husband just gave
your boyfriend some very bad advice.

169
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,254
David's gonna propose to you tonight.

170
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,924
Wow, really?

171
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,052
That's fantastic!

172
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,805
What? Are you serious?
You want to marry him?

173
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,017
- What about Mike?
- Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?

174
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,353
Let's just gag him and handcuff him...

175
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,855
...and force him down the aisle, okay?

176
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,732
I can just see it.
"Mike, do you take Phoebe?"

177
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,906
You know? It's every girl's dream.

178
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,618
Do you really think marrying
someone else is the right answer?

179
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:27,039
Sure. Look, okay, bottom line?
I love Mike... David!

180
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,834
David! I love David.

181
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,046
Don't look at me that way,
Roseanne Roseannadanna.

182
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:42,888
"By using CT scans and computer
imaging, we can, in a very real way...

183
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:47,684
...bring the Mesozoic Era
into the 21 st century."

184
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:53,065
It's great. You'll be the hit
of the conference.

185
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,858
It'll be even better tomorrow...

186
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,653
...because I won't be constantly
interrupted by Joey...

187
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,739
...checking to see if they put
chocolates on my pillow yet.

188
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,079
- Hey, guys.
- The chocolates aren't here.

189
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,206
Damn it!

190
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,666
Ross just read me his speech.
It's fantastic.

191
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,170
Oh, is it on the computer?
Because I'd love to give it a read.

192
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,299
If you want to check your e-mail,
just ask.

193
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,634
What? May I?

194
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:28,267
What's with the rain, Geller? I mean,
when I signed up for dino week...

195
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,353
...nobody said anything
about it being monsoon season.

196
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:35,148
- The wet season is June to December.
- It's not the time, Charlie.

197
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,609
Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!

198
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:41,030
What, did someone outbid you
for the teapot?

199
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:46,285
Secret teapot.

200
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,954
Your computer. I don't know what...
Everything's gone.

201
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,248
- What do you mean?
- Must be a virus.

202
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,375
I think it erased your hard drive.

203
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,878
What? Oh, my God. What did you do?

204
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,422
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail
and I opened it.

205
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,342
- Why? Why would you open it?
- Well, it didn't say, "This is a virus."

206
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:06,347
- What did it say?
- "Nude..."

207
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,309
"Pictures of Anna Kournikova."

208
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,937
- I'm so sorry.
- What am I gonna do?

209
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,190
- My speech is gone!
- It's not gone.

210
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,067
I'm sure you printed out a copy.
You have a hard copy?

211
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,861
No, I don't!

212
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:25,574
Well, you must be pretty mad
at yourself right now.

213
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,169
- It's really gone?
- Yep.

214
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,297
I'd like to thank you guys
for coming down here...

215
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:43,509
...to complain about the rain
and ruin my career.

216
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,636
- I just feel awful.
- Yeah, you should.

217
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:50,974
Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? She's
never even won a major tournament.

218
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,020
Well, I tried Billie Jean King, but...

219
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,817
You know, you and Monica have
the same I'm-gonna-kill-you look.

220
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,195
I can usually make it go away
by kissing her.

221
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,031
Get out.

222
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,993
You know, this happens all the time
to my computer at work.

223
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:11,871
- What do you do?
- I usually go...

224
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,373
...play Tetris on somebody else's
computer.

225
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,208
I can't believe this is happening.

226
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,879
I have to give the keynote speech
tomorrow.

227
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,716
I have to stand up in front of all
these people. What am I gonna say?

228
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,093
You can use a speech I memorized
for auditions.

229
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,930
I don't think your monologue from
"Star Wars" is gonna help me right now.

230
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,266
Ross, we can solve this.
I just heard your speech.

231
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:38,063
- We can re-create it. We've got all night.
- What, you really think we can do that?

232
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,692
Oh, wait.
Joey and I are supposed to have dinner.

233
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,277
Don't worry about that.
I mean, Ross needs you.

234
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:48,240
Rachel and I will stay and help
any way we can.

235
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,910
All right. Okay, let's do it.

236
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:56,706
Well, I know we start by discussing
the shortcomings of carbon dating.

237
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,419
And then I move on to what is clearly
the defining moment...

238
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:05,173
...of the Mesozoic Era,
the breakup of Pangaea. Hello?

239
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,511
And then there's the overview
of the Triassic.

240
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,766
Any chance any of this happened
in a galaxy far, far away?

241
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,026
- Hello?
"- Okay", "Mike?"

242
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,778
Enough is enough.
You love Phoebe, and she loves you.

243
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,573
So get over your
l-never-wanna-get-married thing...

244
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,157
...and step up!

245
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,285
Who is this?

246
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,704
"This is Monica", "Phoebe's friend."

247
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,540
Phoebe is back with David.

248
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,875
He's gonna propose,
and she's gonna say yes...

249
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,335
...but I know she really wants to be
with you.

250
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,007
He's gonna propose?

251
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:52,637
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I can't hear through all this damned hair!

252
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,016
If Phoebe wants to marry David,
she should.

253
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,145
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
Neither should you.

254
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:02,022
You don't tell me what to do.
I tell you what to do.

255
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:06,360
Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel
in Barbados.

256
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,779
And while I've got you,
you've got curly hair.

257
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,864
What do you do in the humidity?

258
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:14,159
Damn it!

259
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:21,125
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- I hope you're happy too, honey.

260
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,127
Phoebe's going to say yes to David.

261
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:28,591
- That's what happens when you meddle.
- Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.

262
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,926
No, it's not.
She's still in love with Mike.

263
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,428
- There's no chance that will work?
- No, I called.

264
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:37,015
- It's not gonna happen.
- Meddler! Meddler!

265
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,268
If you hadn't meddled to start with...

266
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,145
...then I wouldn't have had to go in
and meddle myself.

267
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,357
No matter how much we meddle,
we'll never be able to unmeddle...

268
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,402
...the thing that you meddled up
in the first place!

269
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,238
This vacation sucks!

270
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,455
I'm so bored.

271
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,417
Stupid rain. We can't do anything.

272
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,253
Well, I brought some books.
We could read.

273
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,422
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.

274
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,508
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.

275
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:14,845
I'm sorry, sir, these are
for the pharmaceutical convention.

276
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:20,142
You feel like going to a convention?

277
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,729
- We can't. We're not pharmacists.
- I know we're not...

278
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:29,819
...but Frank Madaio and Eva...

279
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,032
- Kate Miller.
- Kate Miller it is.

280
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,994
- Okay.
- Oh, good...

281
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:42,790
And that's the most sex
I'm gonna have this weekend.

282
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:47,044
Well, in that case,
should I make sure it's on real good?

283
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,551
Thank you.

284
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,473
Oh, and then you said that thing about
bringing the Mesozoic Era...

285
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,767
...into the 21 st century.

286
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,603
Well, yeah. That's it?

287
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,272
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. We did it.

288
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:12,277
Actually, I did it, Ross. You remembered
shockingly little of your own speech.

289
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,698
Yes, but I did make a pyramid
out of the bath products.

290
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,163
Oh, this is amazing.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

291
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,292
That's a pretty necklace.

292
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,254
Thank you.

293
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,717
Hey, what do you say we celebrate?
Champagne?

294
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:39,054
Yeah! Save the cork, and that way,
we can fill the bottle with water...

295
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,557
...and put it back so they
don't charge you.

296
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,687
Oh, my God, I love you.

297
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,900
This is such a cute picture of Emma.
And is this your son...

298
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,861
...or just some kid whose picture
you bring on vacation?

299
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,572
That's Ben, my son
from my first marriage.

300
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,282
- Your first marriage?
- Yeah.

301
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,909
You've been married more than once?

302
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,702
No.

303
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,666
So why'd you break up?

304
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,045
Oh, it was...

305
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:17,551
It's complicated, you know?
She was...

306
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,470
...gay.
- Oh, my God.

307
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,347
This is so cool!

308
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,517
Okay.
Odd thing to get excited about.

309
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:29,146
No, it's just that I was engaged
to a guy who turned out to be gay.

310
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,273
Hey! High-five!

311
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,820
Didn't you feel so stupid
that you didn't see the signs?

312
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,364
My fiance was always going on
long weekends with his "tennis partner."

313
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:44,078
My wife had a workout friend she went
to the gym with every day for a year.

314
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,747
She didn't get any fitter.

315
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,875
- Everybody's like, "I knew all along."
- I know.

316
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,670
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?
I mean, call, leave a note.

317
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,882
"Hi. Just dropped by
to say your wife's gay."

318
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,550
- I know.
- And then...

319
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,512
And then you try to make the best
of a bad situation...

320
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,640
...so you float the idea of a threesome.

321
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,184
I didn't do that.

322
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,896
Me neither.

323
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:16,277
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.

324
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,529
I know. That old lady at the end
was ready to take you home.

325
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,824
Not enough pills in the world, Rach.

326
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:28,956
What about you, huh? You're the single
one. See anybody in there you like?

327
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:32,960
Well, let's see. There was that
really big guy that I was talking to...

328
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,004
...with the really nice breasts.

329
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:41,927
But what about back home? Anything
going on there? Anybody you like?

330
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:46,765
No.

331
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:51,937
- There is. You're blushing.
- No, I'm not blushing...

332
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,980
...and I'm sunburned.

333
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,858
From, you know, the rain.

334
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,902
You like someone. Tell me who.

335
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,363
- Tell me who it is. Come on.
- No. Joey.

336
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:04,241
Who do you like?
You're not getting away that easy.

337
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,201
- Who do you like?
- Joey, come on!

338
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:10,914
It doesn't matter, you know?
It's not like anything's gonna happen.

339
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:15,461
What? Why not?
Rach, who can you not get?

340
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:25,053
Okay. Okay.
You really want to know who it is?

341
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,015
- Yeah. Who is it?
- Do you?

342
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,977
- Oh, hey.
- I just left you a message.

343
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:34,229
Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite...

344
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:37,024
...but now that you're here,
we could have that dinner.

345
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,944
Right! Of course.
Hey, did you guys finish the speech?

346
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:43,572
Yep! We got it. We got it.
Thank you so much.

347
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,657
- I had a great time.
- Yeah.

348
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,244
This isn't over,
because I really want to know...

349
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,869
Later. Later.

350
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,956
- So shall we?
- Yeah.

351
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:55,042
- Okay.
- Good night.

352
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,294
Good night.

353
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:07,012
- Okay, good night.
- Good night, Ross.

354
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,810
I can't believe she's gonna
say yes to David.

355
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,104
She's clearly in love with Mike.

356
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:20,150
You know, it's very hard to take you
seriously when you look like that.

357
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:29,827
Phoebe, I have something I want to say.

358
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,788
Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
I cannot watch this. Let's go.

359
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,415
I think we have time.
Have you heard him talk?

360
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:40,712
"Phoebe, I would be honored if..."
Spit it out, David!

361
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,091
Phoebe.

362
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:53,767
You're an amazing woman, and the time
we spent apart was unbearable.

363
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:57,396
Of course, the sanitation strikes in Minsk
didn't help.

364
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:58,939
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

365
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:05,236
But, well, now that we're together
again, I don't ever want to be apart.

366
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:09,491
So to that end...

367
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:16,039
- Oh, my God, Mike.
- It's David, actually.

368
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,125
No, Mike's here.

369
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:20,920
Oh, hey, Mike.

370
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,423
Hi, David.

371
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:28,009
Chandler. Monic... Oh!

372
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,682
It's the humidity!

373
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:40,063
- Hi, Phoebe.
- What are you doing here?

374
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,775
I have a question I need to ask you.

375
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:46,695
I have a question I was kind of
gonna ask her myself.

376
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:51,241
Yeah, I understand, but before you do,
she really needs to hear this.

377
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,953
Okay.

378
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,166
- Would you care for my seat as well?
- Actually, yeah, that'd be great.

379
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,628
Well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.

380
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:16,057
Phoebe, I love you.

381
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:19,019
I've missed you so much
these last few months.

382
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,480
I thought we were apart
for a good reason...

383
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,149
...but I realized that there was no reason
good enough...

384
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:27,862
...to keep me from spending
the rest of my life with you.

385
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:31,656
Kind of steps on the toes
of what I was going to say.

386
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,952
I'm sorry, David,
but she really has to know this.

387
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:39,456
All right, but after this,
I want to see you outside.

388
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:41,292
If the rain stops.

389
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:48,048
You're the most incredible woman
I've ever met.

390
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,679
How could I lose you?
Now, I don't actually have a ring.

391
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:57,224
- I have a ring.
- I wouldn't brag about that, big guy.

392
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,728
But, Phoebe...

393
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:04,064
...will you marry me?

394
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:08,985
No.

395
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,456
I love you, but I never needed
a proposal from you.

396
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:24,126
I just needed to know
we were headed somewhere.

397
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:29,339
- That we had a future.
- We can have any future you want.

398
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,807
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.

399
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,727
David, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

400
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:45,981
Just so I know, if I had asked first...?

401
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,696
Yeah, I might have said yes,
but that would've been wrong.

402
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,739
Please, you don't have to explain.

403
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,826
I mean, perhaps if I hadn't
gone to Minsk...

404
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:02,957
...things would have worked out for us,
and I wouldn't have ruined my career.

405
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:06,377
Or lost that toe to frostbite.

406
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,503
It was a good trip.

407
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,843
- Is it okay if I hug you now?
- Oh, yes.

408
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,474
Because of our meddling! All right?

409
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,363
Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet.
I could just lie here all day.

410
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,782
Oh, I know.

411
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:43,164
- Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
- So glad we got adjoining rooms.

412
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:48,794
- The sun is out!
- Hey! Remember when I had corneas?

413
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,754
Go to the pool and reserve chairs.

414
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:55,300
- I will get the magazines and the lotion.
- Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.

415
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,386
- No!
- Damn it!

416
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:01,097
Walls are pretty thin, guys.

417
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,817
"Then we have to weigh the data from
recent MRI scans and DNA testing...

418
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:17,907
...which call into question information
gathered from years of carbon dating."

419
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:21,868
Look at the woman sitting out
by the pool getting tan.

420
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:25,747
She's all leathery and wrinkled.
I'm so jealous!

421
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:30,294
"Finally, factor in the profusion
of new species recently discovered.

422
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,671
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

423
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,092
"- Argentinosaurus."
- Not to mention "Coldsaurus."

424
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:43,974
"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not
even gonna discuss the carnivores.

425
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:45,810
Their heads are already too big.

426
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:49,939
Which is ironic, considering
their stunted cerebral development."

427
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:55,777
Really?

428
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:01,033
"But all kidding aside,
in much the same way...

429
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:06,121
...that "Homo ergaster" is thought to be a
separate species from "Homo erectus"..."

430
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:13,003
- What?
- He said "erectus."

431
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:17,633
- You're kidding, right?
- No, he really said it.

432
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:21,303
"And while there are certainly
vast differences...

433
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:26,308
...between these Mesozoic fossils
and the example of "Homo erectus"..."

434
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,312
"Erectus"?

435
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,773
<i>- Homo.</i>
- Right.

436
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:40,238
"In a very real way, we can bring
the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century."

437
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,783
Thank you.

438
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,374
- Really great.
- Oh, thanks, guys.

439
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:55,837
I thought it was wonderful.
Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.

440
00:29:56,046 --> 00:30:01,802
I mean, the ideas you put forth,
and from someone so young and...

441
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:10,519
Okay, now we're just holding hands.

442
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:14,648
Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.
That was really great.

443
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:17,526
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah. Oh, and so funny.

444
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,863
- Take it easy.
- All right, thanks. Thanks so much.

445
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:24,658
I can't tell you how much it means
that you were here.

446
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,744
You kidding?
We wouldn't have missed it.

447
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,123
I'm back.

448
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:36,003
Okay. Well, excuse me?

449
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:39,965
- Well?
- You were incredible.

450
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,550
You blew them away.

451
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,637
I can't tell you how great it was
to look in the crowd and see your face.

452
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:49,433
I mean, did you know you were
mouthing the words along with me?

453
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,226
- I was not.
- No, it's okay.

454
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:54,396
It made me feel like a rock star.

455
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,774
Oh, my God. I'm your groupie.

456
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:01,070
Hey, I better not find you naked
in my hotel room.

457
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,409
Look, I took it too far.

458
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:16,585
I can't believe it's raining again.
It's so unfair.

459
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,546
Well, on the bright side,
now we won't have to see...

460
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:23,175
...all these paleontologists
with their shirts off.

461
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,471
Not you guys.

462
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,473
You've got it going on.

463
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,521
- What will we do today?
- They have a game room downstairs.

464
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,273
They have Ping-Pong and stuff.

465
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,317
Ping-Pong?
Honey, they have Ping-Pong.

466
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:42,862
- Let's play.
- I don't think so.

467
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,365
- Why not?
- You know how competitive you get.

468
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:49,659
And while I say it's cute,
others disagree, and I'm lying.

469
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:53,997
- I'm not always that bad.
- Oh, yeah?

470
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:56,583
What happened when we played
last time?

471
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:59,336
I punched you.

472
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:02,339
- And?
- Phoebe.

473
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:06,593
- And?
- I clunked your heads together.

474
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:27,614
- There you are.
- Hey. Listen.

475
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:31,410
As soon as it stops raining,
we have got to go snorkeling.

476
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,330
Some kid told me about this sea turtle.
If you blow bubbles in his face...

477
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:37,875
...he chases you.

478
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:42,588
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm running
a discussion group all afternoon.

479
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:45,340
That's okay.
I'll find someone else to do it.

480
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:47,343
I'd do it alone, but...

481
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:51,013
...I don't know what happens
if the sea turtle catches you.

482
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:53,891
You know, I feel so bad.

483
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,935
I haven't seen you this whole trip.
Especially last night...

484
00:32:57,144 --> 00:33:00,564
Don't worry about it. It was fine.
I had the best time with Rachel.

485
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:04,693
I just felt bad for you, stuck
in that room working on Ross' speech.

486
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:08,029
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.

487
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:12,701
Oh, well, at least
we're both having fun, right?

488
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,039
- Is it weird that it's not with each other?
- Yeah.

489
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,874
A little bit, yeah.

490
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,006
I think we need to talk.

491
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:29,968
Yeah, I think we do.

492
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,223
About what?

493
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,103
- Come on, you guys, it'll be fun!
- All right.

494
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:44,024
- I'll play if we don't keep score.
- Well, then how do we know who wins?

495
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:49,863
- Nobody wins.
- So we're just four losers. Super.

496
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,451
- Well, I'm not playing with her.
- I'm out.

497
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,452
- I'll play you.
- Okay.

498
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:58,164
- You don't know what you're doing.
- She gets crazy.

499
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,958
This scar? That's from Pictionary.

500
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,669
I think I'll be all right.

501
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:08,673
- You want to volley a bit for serve?
- Sure, if you want to.

502
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:18,225
Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.

503
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:23,022
Oh, dear God, there's two of them.

504
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:25,816
- You ready to play?
- Hell, yeah.

505
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:31,780
- Did you know this about him?
- No idea. I thought he was soft like you.

506
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,866
- Want to make it more interesting?
- How much you thinking?

507
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,868
- Ten bucks a game?
- Make it 50.

508
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,620
- I'll make it 100.
- One thousand...

509
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,748
Okay!

510
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,959
We'll flip to see who goes first.
You got a quarter?

511
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:47,129
No. Either of you girls got a quarter?

512
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,925
Honey, try to focus the trash talk
on him.

513
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:55,554
- Monica, you call it.
- Heads. No, tails! Heads!

514
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:58,181
- Tails.
- Oh, what are the chances?

515
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,064
- My point!
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

516
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:08,984
Standard rules: If at any time a player
uses his nonracket-bearing hand...

517
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:12,196
...to touch the playing surface,
he or she forfeits the point.

518
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:17,701
He was a lawyer.

519
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,872
<i>All the East Coast</i>
<i>is having beautiful weather.</i>

520
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:24,082
"In New York", "it's 72 and sunny."

521
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,752
Weather bitch.

522
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:30,589
It's open.

523
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:33,384
- Hi, Joe.
- Hey.

524
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:37,930
- What? Is everything okay?
- Charlie and I broke up.

525
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,224
No. Why?

526
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,227
Well, she said
we have nothing in common.

527
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,312
That's crazy.

528
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:48,107
No, it's not.
We have nothing in common.

529
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,444
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah.

530
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:54,696
I mean, she should be with someone
more like Ross.

531
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:58,116
You know, I mean he uses
all those big words too.

532
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:02,246
- Man, smart people are dull.
- Well, hey!

533
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:04,707
Okay, Rach.

534
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:11,755
I feel so stupid, you know? Why do I
keep going after the wrong girls?

535
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:14,591
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on.

536
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,222
I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie.
It's like... What the hell's my problem?

537
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,474
I just...

538
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:32,234
Okay. Maybe you're not
always going after the wrong girl.

539
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:35,487
I'm telling you, Rach,
Charlie is not right for me.

540
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:38,740
- I'm not talking about her.
- Well, then, who?

541
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:41,660
The waitress I went out with last month?

542
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,997
- You know what? Forget it.
- No, no, no, no.

543
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,541
- Who are you talking about?
- No, I don't...

544
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:50,585
I actually don't know who
I'm talking about, so...

545
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,088
- Okay.
- Yeah.

546
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:56,133
Well, I'm gonna go see
if I can get a room for tonight.

547
00:36:56,383 --> 00:37:00,053
- And I'll see you later.
- Yeah, sure. Okay.

548
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:28,415
- You like me?
- Okay.

549
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,710
- Let's not make a big thing about this.
- It's a huge thing!

550
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,087
Okay, not working with me, Joe.

551
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:39,719
Look, here's the thing.
Lately, I have been having thoughts.

552
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:42,220
Musings, if you will.

553
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:46,016
- Well, for how long?
- Oh, only like a month.

554
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,893
- A month?
- Well...

555
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:53,649
Dial it down. Listen, maybe they're
crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.

556
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:57,235
I have been thinking about,
you know, us.

557
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:02,324
- Okay, dial it up a little.
- Oh, you're right. Okay.

558
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,076
- I just have a question.
- Shoot.

559
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:07,662
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not trying to do anything.

560
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:11,166
It's just, we have such a good time
when we're together, you know?

561
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:15,588
And I mean, aren't you just
a little curious what it would be like?

562
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,717
Am I curious?
I mean, I'm as curious as...

563
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,344
...George!

564
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:26,348
- Who?
- Curious George!

565
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:29,310
You know, the monkey and the guy
with the yellow hat.

566
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:31,895
- Of course. I remember.
- He had a paper route.

567
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,897
Yeah, he did.

568
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:37,567
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- No, I know. We're great!

569
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:40,529
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.

570
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:44,616
Can't it just happen a little bit?

571
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:50,164
- No! It can't happen at all!
- Why not?

572
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:54,042
Because, look, no one wants
this to happen more than me, okay?

573
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:57,629
I have gone over this moment
in my head 100 times...

574
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,175
...and not once did I ever say no.

575
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,890
I couldn't do it to Ross.

576
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,560
- But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
- I know. I know...

577
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:17,233
...but I've thought about it a lot
since then, and it just wouldn't be right.

578
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,486
I'm sorry.

579
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:26,491
I'm sorry too.

580
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:30,245
- Oh, God, I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, no.

581
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,456
No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.

582
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,333
- Like you said, it's no big deal.
- It's not a big deal.

583
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:37,503
- No big deal.
- It's so not a big deal.

584
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:41,090
- I'll see you later. All right, hey.
- Okay, great.

585
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:02,653
Okay...

586
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:19,669
Oh, I'm sorry, I think...
I think that may have missed the table.

587
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:21,589
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

588
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,923
- Do you?
- Yeah.

589
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,966
- Do you?
- Yeah!

590
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:29,054
- You really find this attractive on him?
- Oh, yeah.

591
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:33,183
Are you telling me you're not even
a little turned on by Monica right now?

592
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:43,569
This is the first time in our marriage that
I've felt like the more attractive one.

593
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,697
All right, come on, Mike.
You can beat her.

594
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:49,366
Knock that dog off her head.

595
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:55,414
- Damn it!
- I sleep with him!

596
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,752
- Game point.
- Don't get too cocky.

597
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,503
Remember, I won the last one.

598
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,756
Oh, by the way,
how did that feel, losing to a girl?

599
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:07,927
You should look in the mirror
before you call yourself that.

600
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,767
- No! No! No!
- And that's how it's done.

601
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:17,686
Okey-dokey.

602
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:21,898
You've each won a game, and I've lost
what's felt like a year of my life.

603
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:23,942
Everybody goes home a winner.

604
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:25,903
- Best of three?
- That's what I'm thinking.

605
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:31,075
Should I use my invisibility
to fight crime or for evil?

606
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,661
- Serve the ball, chump.
- "Serve the ball, chump."

607
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:38,541
Okay, better comebacks, Mike.
Better comebacks.

608
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:43,670
I'm just saying,
I have a cabin in the Adirondacks.

609
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:47,842
If you ever want to get away
from the city, well, that'd be...

610
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,719
...just nifty.

611
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:57,684
Well, I've kind of got a lot on my plate
right now.

612
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:02,272
Not that I wouldn't love a weekend
in the country with a strange man.

613
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:07,027
- Jarvis?
- Oh, you're back.

614
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:12,283
- This is my wife, Nancy.
- Well, get out!

615
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:17,037
- Ross? Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yes, please.

616
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:22,751
So, what's going on?

617
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,507
Well, Joey and I broke up.

618
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:34,429
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Joey is a great guy...

619
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,140
...but we're just...
We're so different.

620
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:40,644
I mean, like, during your speech,
he kept laughing at "Homo erectus."

621
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:43,313
I knew that was him!

622
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,861
Anyway, I just...
I think it's for the best.

623
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:54,158
- Hey. Hey, you okay?
- I guess.

624
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,495
There was...

625
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:04,668
There was another reason that I thought
it was time to end it with Joey.

626
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:11,299
I started to realize that I was
having feelings for someone else.

627
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:15,471
Okay, Geller.
Last day of the conference.

628
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:17,973
You know what happens
to the keynote speaker.

629
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:21,226
Professor Klarik, we're in the middle
of a conversation here.

630
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:25,772
- Can't you throw him in the pool later?
- Or we could throw you both in now.

631
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:29,401
Okay, gentlemen, please.
Aren't we a little old for this?

632
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,279
I mean, we're scientists, all right?
We're academics...

633
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:36,575
...and most importantly,
you will have to catch us first.

634
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,869
Go! Go! Go!

635
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:50,589
Okay, so it's tied again,
41 to 41.

636
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:55,511
- Okay, look, enough is enough.
- No.

637
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:59,723
- I just have two more points to beat him.
- Monica, that was also true an hour ago!

638
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:01,475
I mean, please, look at you.

639
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:06,188
Your hand is blistered, you can
barely stand, your hair is inexplicable!

640
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:10,609
You've already proven
you're just as good as he is.

641
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:13,778
We missed our dinner reservations,
so let's just go upstairs...

642
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,990
...order room service, take a shower
and shave your head!

643
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,870
I can't just walk away.
I've put in four hours.

644
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:24,540
You knew this about me
when you married me.

645
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:27,668
You agreed to take me in sickness
and in health.

646
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:30,379
Well, this is my sickness!

647
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:34,258
- What about the obsessive cleaning?
- That's just good sense.

648
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:44,017
- You okay?
- No, honey, I'm okay.

649
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:48,147
Shake it off. Oh, no shaking.
No shaking. No shaking.

650
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:55,237
Oh, my God. I can't play.

651
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:57,864
- So you forfeit?
- Mike wins?

652
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:02,286
I can't believe it. I lost.

653
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:09,001
- No, you didn't.
- What?

654
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:12,337
- Because I'm gonna play for you.
- You can't do that.

655
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:15,841
It's okay.
I don't care which of them I beat.

656
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:20,470
Okay, we're taking that paddle home,
mister.

657
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,435
- Honey, you don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

658
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:28,937
I may not understand why
you have to win so badly...

659
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:31,690
...but if it's important to you,
it's important to me.

660
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:33,526
Because I love you.

661
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:37,988
But you suck.

662
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,116
You're welcome, sweetheart.

663
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:44,494
All right, let's get this over with.
Sudden death.

664
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:48,582
- Whoever wins this point, wins.
- Okay.

665
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:57,257
- Oh, my God. You're good.
- It's like watching porn.

666
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:05,682
And that's how it's done.

667
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:11,063
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That was so amazing.

668
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,064
Well, when did you...?

669
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:17,402
Hold on, I almost forgot. Loser.

670
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,534
- When did you stop sucking?
- I never sucked. I just didn't want you...

671
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:25,744
...to know how good I was.
- Why?

672
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:27,913
- I don't know.
- Well, this is so great.

673
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:30,790
- Now we can enter doubles tournaments.
- That's why.

674
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:42,344
- They still looking for us?
- Yeah.

675
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:45,347
The bartender said they split up
into two search parties.

676
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:47,933
The herbivores and the carnivores.

677
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:52,729
You know, we, as a group,
are not the coolest.

678
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:54,773
Oh, look out.

679
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:04,742
- I don't think they saw us.
- I don't think they did.

680
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:15,669
So I started to tell you something earlier.

681
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:22,968
There was another reason that I realized
it was time to end it with Joey.

682
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:28,307
I kind of realized I was starting
to have feelings...

683
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,684
...for someone else.

684
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:36,440
And can I ask who?

685
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:39,652
I think you know.

686
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:46,325
I think I know too, but I've been really
wrong about this stuff in the past, so...

687
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:09,181
- I'm sorry, we can't.
- All right. All right.

688
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:13,018
I mean, you just went out
with my best friend, you know?

689
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:16,980
I just think it would be a really,
really bad idea.

690
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:23,612
Or not. I mean...

691
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:02,192
What?

692
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:57,915
