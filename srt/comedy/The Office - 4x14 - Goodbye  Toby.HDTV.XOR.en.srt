1
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:08,815
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute.

2
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:10,847
- Hello?
- Hello, this is Dwight.

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,192
Hello? Hello?

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,810
Yes, we do have that.
Hold on one second.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,319
- Jim what are you doing?
- And how many would you like?

6
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:20,857
- Hang that up right now.
- I can get that out to you immediately.

7
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:24,610
It's an imposter. Don't do business
with him, this is not Dwight Schrute.

8
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:26,950
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,810
So, naturally,
I paired it to my headset.

10
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:34,036
Okay, fine,
I'll just let it go to voice mail.

11
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:39,042
- Hello, this is Dwight.
- Hey, is this Dwight?

12
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:41,628
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, my goodness, you sound sexy.

13
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,371
Thank you. I've been working out.

14
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,925
You're not talking to Dwight right now.
You're talking to Jim.

15
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:50,583
Pam, I'm over here.

16
00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:51,929
I'm confused.

17
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:53,472
Disconnect that right now.

18
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,809
- You give me your earpiece.
- I can't do that. Unsanitary.

19
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:00,270
You know what, fine.

20
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,158
I will reprogram my phone
to go to my office phone.

21
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:08,162
Done.

22
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,174
This is Dwight.

23
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:15,847
And I forwarded
his desk phone to mine.

24
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:20,416
Oh, hello, mater.
Good news, I've married. Tell fater.

25
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:23,361
Such a nice woman.

"GOODBYE, TOBY" (1.00)

28
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:52,534
Today

29
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:56,022
is Toby Flenderson's last day.

30
00:01:56,254 --> 00:01:57,578
I couldn't sleep last night.

31
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:59,371
I came in extra early.

32
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,015
So much energy.

33
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:04,285
There are certain days that you know
you'll remember the rest of your life.

34
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:08,476
And I just have a feeling
that today is one of those days.

35
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:10,491
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

36
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:13,331
So here we go.
Just a matter of hours now

37
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:16,201
until his horribleness
has left the building.

38
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,718
I'm going to set my watch alarm...

39
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:20,820
And...

40
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:23,979
Good morning, Kelly.

41
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:27,649
I can't believe this is your last day.
How do you feel?

42
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,326
Fine. Good.

43
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:30,915
I feel weird.

44
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:34,527
First thing on the agenda.
Actually, the only thing on the agenda

45
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,617
is that status
of Toby's going away party.

46
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:39,745
We have a buttercream cake
and a slide show of Toby.

47
00:02:40,473 --> 00:02:42,711
But so far we only have
two pictures of him.

48
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:45,205
Okay, well, this will not do.

49
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:48,646
Toby is going away forever,

50
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,583
and we need to do something
very, very special.

51
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:54,636
In some cultures, when somebody leaves,
like New Orleans culture,

52
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:56,961
they have a parade,
and they have a band.

53
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:58,781
And people party in the streets.

54
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:00,948
Do you mean leaves as in dies?

55
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:03,310
You want us to throw Toby
a New Orleans funeral?

56
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:06,834
If the devil were to explode,

57
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:10,954
and evil were gone forever,
what sort of party would you have?

58
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:13,404
- Michael...
- Like a beach blowout?

59
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:15,126
- Or a toga...
- No, you know... No!

60
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:16,782
- Toga!
- You always do this.

61
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:19,369
We have a nice,
modest party planned,

62
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,245
and you come in
and demand the world.

63
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:22,440
Let me be clear.

64
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,085
There is simply no money
for anything other than a cake,

65
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,337
and to develop a few more slides.

66
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,877
Although Toby won't be in them.

67
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:32,311
I thought that you might say that.

68
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:41,523
Every year, my sweet,
sweet grandmother

69
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:44,712
sends me a check
on my birthday for $50.

70
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:47,382
And lately she has been...

71
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:50,528
sending me, like,
nine or ten checks a year.

72
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:54,047
As Nana starts to...

73
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,924
But I knew I should be
saving it for something.

74
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:59,770
I just didn't know what
I should be saving it for.

75
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:01,735
And then I had an awakening.

76
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:04,214
Michael, buy a motorcycle.

77
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:08,648
So I put the money in my shoe,
and then I forgot about it until now.

78
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:12,297
I want a party that makes me feel
like I'm flying through the air

79
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,968
without this...
ugly weight holding me down.

80
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:18,358
You know?

81
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:22,973
I want an antigravity machine.
I saw it in a movie.

82
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:25,852
You drink a potion, and then you just
start floating all around.

83
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:28,479
So how much antigravity potion
do you want?

84
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,113
No, you know what? This is not
a party-planning committee anymore.

85
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:34,860
And I don't want your foot money,
and I feel uncomfortable participating.

86
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,422
Phyllis.

87
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:39,198
Can you do this?

88
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:43,358
Yes.

89
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,116
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hi, yes.

90
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:54,880
I'm Holly Flax.
I was told to ask for Mr. Flenderson.

91
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,399
As part of my last day,

92
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,234
I'm training the new human resources rep
in the ways of the company.

93
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:03,514
Again, the company
has allotted for this training...

94
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:05,006
one day.

95
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:08,561
So this is H.R.
This is your desk.

96
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,177
I love the view.

97
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:12,336
Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

98
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,851
Hey.

99
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:24,474
Hey.

100
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:31,988
What?

101
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,586
Guess who just got into
the Pratt school of design.

102
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:35,969
No way!

103
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:38,508
What'd I say?
I said that they'd love those sketches.

104
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:40,009
- Congrats.
- Oh, thank you.

105
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:43,096
I don't know why I doubted it.
Because I'm so clearly awesome.

106
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:45,223
Yes.
So when do you start?

107
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:48,491
I didn't read it carefully. I just saw
"congratulations," and skimmed the list.

108
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:50,894
I saw my name, I came in here
to tell you and get a snack.

109
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,709
Busy morning.

110
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:55,619
So...

111
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:59,278
you know, it means I have
to go to New York for three months.

112
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:01,947
It's not a big deal.
I'll come visit you.

113
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:05,313
And you'll visit me.
It's only two hours away. It'll be fine.

114
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,578
- It's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
- Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.

115
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,080
See how easy that is?

116
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,807
I wouldn't go if things
weren't so solid with Jim.

117
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:19,365
And down the road, if we have a family,
I couldn't go then either.

118
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,601
So the timing's perfect.

119
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,953
And that is the first time I've ever
used the word "perfect" in here.

120
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:28,660
Hey, Stanley.

121
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:30,309
I want to introduce you to...

122
00:06:30,429 --> 00:06:31,943
Toby's replacement.

123
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,119
So what do we know about her?

124
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:39,967
Well, we know that Toby thinks
she'll be great.

125
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,556
Oh, strike one. I hate her already.

126
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:43,926
I hate her too.

127
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:45,628
Why do you hate her?

128
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,367
Because she...

129
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,007
stinks...

130
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:52,081
with her ways and her...

131
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,955
head.

132
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:57,961
You know, Dwight, sometimes...

133
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:02,327
I don't know, I think you say things
just to agree with me.

134
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,719
- Would that be such a bad thing?
- Yeah, it would.

135
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,803
Just have a thought.
Have an original thought!

136
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:11,308
Although I will agree
that her head is weird.

137
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:14,545
- You know what we need to do?
- What?

138
00:07:14,972 --> 00:07:18,464
- We need to sell her an elevator pass.
- But our elevator doesn't require a...

139
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:20,430
Exactly.

140
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:22,460
A little old-fashioned hazing.

141
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:27,282
Hi, are there any local companies
that rent antigravity machines?

142
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:30,369
- <i>Antigravity machines?</i>
- That's right, yeah.

143
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,995
<i>What do they do, exactly?</i>

144
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,469
They make you feel lighter.

145
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:36,876
<i>Antigravity...</i>

146
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:41,582
<i>Antidepressant? I could
put you through to someone on that.</i>

147
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:43,591
Okay.

148
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,986
Yeah.

149
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:48,179
- Hey, Michael?
- Oh, hey, do you still work here?

150
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,522
I'd like to introduce you
to my replacement.

151
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,189
- Come on.
- No. I think I'll pass.

152
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:53,787
Michael Scott, this is Holly.

153
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,336
- Hi.
- Hi, yeah, right.

154
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,312
Okay, well,
they hired a female Toby.

155
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:59,690
Good for the world.
Thank you, god, for...

156
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:03,688
creating two of you.
Here's how things work here.

157
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:08,281
My job is to make the office fun,
your job is to make the office lame.

158
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,625
And we have an eternal struggle,

159
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:11,743
you and I.

160
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,015
And only one of us can be the winner.
Spoiler alert... I'm gonna win.

161
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:19,167
Man, someone doesn't like H.R.

162
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,590
Yeah.

163
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:23,713
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.

164
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,778
T...
No, he tortured me...

165
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:27,915
with his awfulness.

166
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,991
Yeah, I know what you mean.

167
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,973
I nearly fell asleep
when he gave me a tour of the files.

168
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,721
Well, look,
I'll let you get back to work,

169
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:40,063
but I really look forward
to working with you, Mr. Scott.

170
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:43,327
You can p...
Michael.

171
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:48,535
Thanks to Toby,
I have a very strong prejudice

172
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:50,158
against human resources.

173
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:53,696
I believe that the department is
a breeding ground for monsters.

174
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:57,977
What I failed to consider, though,
is that not all monsters are bad.

175
00:08:58,716 --> 00:08:59,859
Like E.T.

176
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:04,124
Is Holly our extraterrestrial?

177
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,780
Maybe.

178
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:10,093
Or maybe she's just
an awesome woman from this planet.

179
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:13,493
- The pleasure is all mine.
- Oh, thanks.

180
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:16,329
I'm really looking forward to sitting
down with you and finding out more

181
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:18,436
- about what you do here.
- Any time.

182
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:20,353
What do you do here?

183
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,740
Excuse me.

184
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,552
What is wrong with this woman?

185
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:30,369
She's asking about stuff
that's nobody's business.

186
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:31,639
What do I do?

187
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:36,336
Really, what do I do here?
I should have written it down.

188
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,116
"Qua" something.

189
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:41,620
Qua... Quar...

190
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,838
Quibo... Qual...

191
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,498
Quir... Quabity.

192
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,968
Quabity assuance.

193
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:49,633
No. No, no, no, no.
But I'm getting close.

194
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,992
Have you been introduced to Kevin?

195
00:09:52,112 --> 00:09:53,637
No. Which one's Kevin?

196
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:01,434
He's here on a special work program.

197
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:03,563
He's slow, you know, in his brain.

198
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:05,775
- Oh, good for you guys.
- Yeah...

199
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:08,309
Hazing is a fun way
to show a new employee

200
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,579
that she is not welcome or liked.

201
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:14,434
Accounting department, listen up.
Holly, human resources.

202
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:17,866
- Angela, Oscar, and Kevin.
- Hello. Hello.

203
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:19,604
Hi.

204
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:20,719
Hi.

205
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,165
What do you do?

206
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:23,876
I do the numbers.

207
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:26,045
Oh, good for you.

208
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:29,975
Do you want an M&M?

209
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:32,884
Oh, no, that is so sweet.
But thank you, though.

210
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:35,903
Yeah, I keep them here at my desk

211
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,931
so that everybody
doesn't take them.

212
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,028
Well, that is a very
safe place for them.

213
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,340
- Yeah.
- Here she is. Holly.

214
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:49,610
You know, if we hung Holly
from the ceiling,

215
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:52,184
we'd have to kiss
underneath of her.

216
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:53,952
So... I know.

217
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:55,593
Sorry. Question.

218
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:59,203
Are you real,
or are you a Hollygram?

219
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,225
Nice. I've never heard
that one before, actually.

220
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:05,793
- That's good.
- I bet.

221
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,546
Are these guys
boring your ears off?

222
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:09,836
No, no, I...

223
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,133
What is your commute like?

224
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:14,012
How long does it take to get in?

225
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,261
You know, I should make you a mix.

226
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:20,241
Do you have a CD player?

227
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,722
Yeah.

228
00:11:22,887 --> 00:11:24,103
- All right.
- Thanks.

229
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:25,124
Great.

230
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:26,841
Do you like it?

231
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:30,275
It's a photo of everyone in the office.
So you can take it to Costa Rica.

232
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:33,320
- You're... You're not in it.
- Well, I was taking the picture.

233
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,741
I love it.
I love it.

234
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:42,010
I would love a picture
of the two of us...

235
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,872
to also take to Costa Rica.

236
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:47,090
- Sure, do you have a camera here?
- No...

237
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:50,757
Does anyone have a camera here?

238
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:55,175
No one has a camera here.

239
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,659
I'm gonna...
I'll go get one.

240
00:11:58,779 --> 00:11:59,779
Stay.

241
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:08,131
So I just got the fax.
Closing the sale, and... it's big.

242
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,732
- It is really big.
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

243
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:13,902
<i>Don't interrupt.
Congratulations on doing your job.</i>

244
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,223
- <i>You put the sale on the web site?</i>
- No, I didn't. I just logged it in.

245
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:18,908
<i>Try to be a team player here, Jim.</i>

246
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,706
<i>Log it in the web site.</i>

247
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:23,371
- Well, it already went through, so...
- <i>Don't worry about that.</i>

248
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:24,733
<i>Just re-log it.</i>

249
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,492
Hello?

250
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:32,056
<i>Hike up your skirt a little more</i>

251
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:34,337
Jim?

252
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:44,134
- I am downloading some n3p music
- That's not it. Yeah.

253
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:48,038
- for a cd mix tape for Holly.
- Close.

254
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:51,523
And I'm looking for perfect songs
that work on two levels.

255
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:53,109
What are the two levels?

256
00:12:53,283 --> 00:12:55,772
The two levels being
welcome to Scranton...

257
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,072
and I... love you.

258
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:02,007
Okay, let's start
with the "I love you" level.

259
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:03,745
Hey, what's the group

260
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,079
that was from Scranton
that made it big?

261
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:07,725
- Was that U2?
- Yes.

262
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:09,395
You don't love Holly.

263
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:11,876
- I think I do.
- But you just met her.

264
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:14,213
Well, it was love at first sight.

265
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:18,164
Actually, it was...
No. It was when I heard her voice.

266
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:20,468
It was love at first see
with my ears.

267
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,291
Oh okay, it doesn't work like that.

268
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:24,454
Well, you're not a romantic.

269
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:27,182
Actually, I think I am, and...

270
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:29,644
I've a little bit of experience
in office romance.

271
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,267
- Oh, really? Like, with who?
- Yeah.

272
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,900
- We've been through this.
- Pam?

273
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:38,027
Yes, we are still dating.
And guess what. I took it slow.

274
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,779
Yeah, you took it too slow.

275
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:43,803
- Well, we're really happy.
- This thing with Holly feels...

276
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:45,703
a lot like love to me.

277
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:48,293
And that's really sweet.
And you can think that,

278
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:51,125
but you don't say that out loud.
And you definitely don't say it to her.

279
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:53,334
I don't want her to get away.

280
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,726
I know.
Here, Michael, you can...

281
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:58,605
court her as you get
to know her, you know?

282
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:00,975
I mean, the office is
a great place for that.

283
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:04,569
Pam and I, we got
to know each other right out there.

284
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:07,479
I mean, first time we joked around
was at my desk.

285
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:10,226
And the first meal
we ever had was...

286
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:12,603
in the break room, actually.

287
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:15,970
We were at two separate tables and...
I remember that.

288
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:20,584
The first time we kissed even
was right outside, and...

289
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:22,229
Look.

290
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,426
All I'm saying is that you can get
to know someone really, really well,

291
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:28,166
like I did...

292
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:29,876
Right here at work.

293
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:34,010
I was thinking...

294
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:36,837
fireworks for the party.
What do you think?

295
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:39,507
Oh, boy, I appreciate
your help, but I can't...

296
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:43,510
Oh, no. I just meant I wanted to pay
to have fireworks at the party.

297
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:45,011
Why would you do that?

298
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:47,806
Because I'm gonna miss Toby.

299
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:50,865
Yep, he's...

300
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,021
a heck of a guy, and I think we should
send him off right. It doesn't matter.

301
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:55,256
Here you go.

302
00:14:58,525 --> 00:14:59,526
Really?

303
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:01,694
Well, we all want
a good party, right?

304
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:05,784
I'm going to propose tonight.

305
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:09,036
Holy crap!

306
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:23,264
- Hey, Kevin.
- Hi.

307
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,486
Do you need some help?

308
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:27,934
I can't decide what to get.

309
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:30,513
Well, what do you like to eat?

310
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:33,845
Well, I like pretzels, but...

311
00:15:35,132 --> 00:15:37,120
I really like chips.

312
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:41,263
Well, how much money do you have there?

313
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:44,375
Okay, let's see.

314
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:46,419
50...

315
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:48,822
This is a button.

316
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,702
55, 65...
Okay, you have 75 cents.

317
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:57,418
So that means you could get

318
00:15:57,776 --> 00:16:00,028
anything up on the top row.

319
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:09,950
I am totally gonna bang Holly!

320
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,274
She is cute and helpful,

321
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,451
and she really seems into me.

322
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,755
Hey, Ryan, it's Jim.

323
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,637
I don't know what you got lately,

324
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:21,695
but you know what, I really don't care
because you're trying to get rid of me.

325
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:25,134
And I bet you think I don't care enough
about this job to actually fight back,

326
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:27,495
but you're wrong,
because I do, and I will.

327
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:29,634
So you can keep trying
to push me out of this place,

328
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:32,239
but guess what...
I'm not going anywhere.

329
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,814
Damn it!

330
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,975
Hello, Holly.

331
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:53,893
What are you doing?
You don't...

332
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:57,632
You don't have to do that. I mean,
we have already put-together chairs.

333
00:16:57,752 --> 00:16:59,444
That's how we buy them, actually.

334
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:03,734
I'm trying to adjust
the lumbar support on Toby's chair,

335
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:06,611
and that made this up/down
lever thing not work.

336
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:10,276
And then I took
the whole chair apart, and...

337
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,384
that is the story
of me on the floor.

338
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:15,703
It's pretty good, right?
I'm gonna sell the movie rights.

339
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,130
And the sequel,

340
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:18,998
woman stands at desk and works.

341
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:23,564
So,

342
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,845
I have no idea how you...

343
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:27,632
How you sit like that.

344
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:29,047
Yoga.

345
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:33,069
Sit on floor and
put together chair we will.

346
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:41,194
Yo-da.

347
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:49,302
Pass curvy metal piece you will.

348
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:58,602
So are you in town this weekend?

349
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,245
'Cause I'm not...
I'm not...

350
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:03,540
I'm not gonna be in town.

351
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,546
I'm going out of town.

352
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,297
So you can't make my orgy?

353
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,069
Kidding.

354
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,762
Kidding.

355
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:15,445
Acting!

356
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:18,346
- Acting!
- Acting!

357
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:20,784
Lovitz.

358
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:23,069
Yeah.

359
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:25,759
I did it.

360
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,531
- What'd you do?
- I talked to her... Holly.

361
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:33,951
Just pleasantries. Nothing, you know,
not like, do you want kids?

362
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,003
Or religion or what side
of the bed do you want?

363
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,388
Hey, I can take either side
of the bed at this point.

364
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:43,666
- Okay, so how'd that feel?
- It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.

365
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:45,727
Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.

366
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:46,850
Oh, god.

367
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:49,412
Laying a base.

368
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:51,257
- Laying a base.
- There you go.

369
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:53,774
There's plenty
of base laying left, right?

370
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,120
Yeah.

371
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,909
Hello, Angela.

372
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:02,685
Phyllis, you look like
you're gonna have a heart attack.

373
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:05,605
Could I get a list of your vendors?

374
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:08,817
- I shredded it.
- Why would you do that?

375
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,861
Gosh, I just don't know.
Why do you think?

376
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:18,493
Sorry.

377
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:24,204
What'd you guys do?

378
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,767
Oh, there he is.

379
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:27,890
Thought you had gone home already.

380
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,213
Why don't you go home
and come back for the party?

381
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:35,677
Well, we still have to do
the exit interview.

382
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:40,326
Yes, we do.

383
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:45,016
I'll let you in on a little secret. I've
been looking forward to this moment.

384
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:46,386
Very, very much.

385
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:49,731
I... I have been steeped
in anticipation.

386
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:51,610
Toby has been

387
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:55,322
cruisin' for a bruisin'
for 12 years,

388
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:58,283
and I am now his cruise director.

389
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:00,852
And my name is captain Bruisin'.

390
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:04,456
- Thanks, Michael. I didn't expect...
- Can I just say that

391
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:08,168
of all the idiots
in all the idiot villages

392
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,379
in all the idiot worlds,

393
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,519
you stand alone, my friend.

394
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,175
- Hello.
- Hey!

395
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:17,580
- Hi, good to see you.
- You too.

396
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:20,145
I'm just having
a little exit interview.

397
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:22,098
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here.

398
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,934
No, no. This is very boring stuff.
Why don't you take a tour?

399
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:26,511
Have you seen the bailer?

400
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:28,834
No, no, I'll look at it later.

401
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,464
It's part of my job.

402
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:35,453
Okay.

403
00:20:36,765 --> 00:20:39,199
- Did you need me to take notes?
- Hi, Pam. Stay.

404
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,265
Okay.

405
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,439
All right.
Well then,

406
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:49,938
I will proceed.
I just have some...

407
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:52,379
questions that I was gonna ask.

408
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:03,265
Who do you think you are?

409
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,479
I'm Toby.

410
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:10,824
Yeah.

411
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,705
Correct.

412
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:18,247
What gives... What...

413
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:21,141
What gives you the right?

414
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:26,797
I brought the binder.
Do you wanna take a little look?

415
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,957
Sure, you know what, that sounds good.
I'll take a little looksie.

416
00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:32,545
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

417
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:37,520
"What would you improve...

418
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:40,427
"about Dunder Mifflin?"

419
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,712
This place...

420
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:43,944
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- I've got some ideas.

421
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,338
I'm not asking it,
I'm just reading it out loud.

422
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,059
Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.

423
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,535
Well, let me see.

424
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:53,046
I would...

425
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,035
I'll kill you.

426
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:09,065
I guess everything's okay.

427
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,708
I made it this far, right?

428
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:13,744
What's the point?

429
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:15,962
Why don't you open your present?

430
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:21,509
This might not be what I think...

431
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:25,090
that I don't even know's in there 'cause
there are a lot of presents in my car,

432
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,917
and I don't know which is which.

433
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:29,020
"Suck on this."

434
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,891
- What the hell is that?
- Michael...

435
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:36,315
What do you mean "Michael"?!

436
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:39,394
That's not even my handwriting.

437
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:40,317
Hey!

438
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,234
What the hell is going on here?!

439
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:47,493
Who thought it would be hysterical
to give Toby a rock

440
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:49,214
for his going-away gift?!

441
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,466
- You did. You made me wrap it.
- No!

442
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:53,656
I thought it was over the line.
I just...

443
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,545
You know what that is?
You know what that is? That is...

444
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:00,648
a psyche.

445
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:03,135
Psyche.

446
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,842
So, that is not
my real gift to Toby.

447
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:08,950
- So what is your gift?
- My gift is forthcoming, Pam.

448
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:10,466
What is it?

449
00:23:12,111 --> 00:23:15,331
I am going to give Toby...

450
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:17,105
Your watch?

451
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:21,111
Yes, I am.

452
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:23,888
That was it.

453
00:23:24,342 --> 00:23:25,717
How did you know that?

454
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,529
- I just knew.
- How did you know?

455
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:29,340
Oh, that is so sweet.

456
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,039
Well...
That's my watch.

457
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:34,403
Thanks. I'm gonna set it
to Costa Rica time.

458
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:35,624
Hey, that's good.

459
00:23:35,785 --> 00:23:37,715
Hey, it's the kid.
Look, look, look.

460
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:41,672
It's the temp. Look.

461
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,641
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's the temp.

462
00:23:44,304 --> 00:23:46,550
- Is that the police?
- Yes.

463
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,846
This is what happened.

464
00:23:48,007 --> 00:23:50,819
Ryan's big project
was the web site,

465
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:53,185
which wasn't doing so well.

466
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:56,319
So Ryan, to give
the impression of sales,

467
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:57,905
recorded them twice.

468
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:00,563
Once as office sales,
and once as web site sales.

469
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:04,196
Which's what we refer to in the business
as misleading the shareholders.

470
00:24:04,357 --> 00:24:06,969
Another good term is fraud.

471
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:10,084
The real crime, I think,

472
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:11,661
was the beard.

473
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:14,247
Oh, my god. Ryan.

474
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:15,873
Oh, my god.

475
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,695
I cannot wait
to visit Ryan in prison.

476
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:21,592
I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit
and get my hair done.

477
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:23,532
And then be, like, "Hi, Ryan."

478
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:26,528
And then all the other prisoners
are gonna be like, "Damn!

479
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,659
"Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend.

480
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:32,701
"I would never have treated her so bad
when I was outside of prison."

481
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:35,459
Would you do me a favor
and connect me to Ryan?

482
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,725
Absolutely.

483
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,790
Right to voice mail.

484
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:47,133
Hey, Ryan, it's Jim.

485
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,845
You know what?
Totally disregard that last voice mail

486
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:52,034
because you obviously
have your hands tied.

487
00:24:53,154 --> 00:24:54,163
Good luck.

488
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,997
What's protocol on this?

489
00:24:57,401 --> 00:25:00,251
Well, I normally do nothing,
I guess.

490
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:03,505
You shouldn't...

491
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:07,722
Michael, are you okay?

492
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:09,885
I'm just worried about my friend.

493
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,058
Of course you are.

494
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,431
Just... I'm fine.

495
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,976
I'm holding it together.
I have a business to run. I'm cool.

496
00:25:17,153 --> 00:25:18,284
No, hey, stop.

497
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:20,729
You can let yourself be upset.
He's your friend.

498
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,223
You know what I usually find?

499
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:30,940
Holly is sweet and simple.

500
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:32,753
Like a lady baker.

501
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:36,233
I... would not be surprised

502
00:25:36,353 --> 00:25:40,268
to find out that she had worked
in a bakery before coming here.

503
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:42,117
She has that kind of warmth.

504
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:47,590
I'm pretty sure she's baked
on a professional level.

505
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:53,555
Cool!

506
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,224
A bouncy house!

507
00:25:55,344 --> 00:25:57,016
Kevin, take your shoes off first.

508
00:26:01,496 --> 00:26:03,224
No anti-gravity machine, huh?

509
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:05,524
Sorry, Michael.
I don't think they're real.

510
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:07,589
The ferris wheel
is pretty cool, though.

511
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:10,305
Look at our parking lot.

512
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,302
Yeah, who'd have thought?

513
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,083
Is Jim gonna propose tonight?

514
00:26:23,656 --> 00:26:24,906
He is, isn't he?

515
00:26:25,471 --> 00:26:26,621
No, he's not.

516
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:28,839
Is he?

517
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,101
Oh, it was a pretty good company,
but I just couldn't see a future there.

518
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:34,562
They kept hiring from the outside.

519
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:37,727
It was easy to get in,
but impossible to rise up.

520
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,163
That's what she...

521
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:41,115
A lot of places are like that.

522
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:44,021
I think it's really cool
you hired Kevin.

523
00:26:44,662 --> 00:26:45,642
Thanks.

524
00:26:47,685 --> 00:26:49,347
- You have it?
- Almost.

525
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,699
Here we go, here we go.
Put it in.

526
00:26:57,979 --> 00:26:59,453
That... that's my car.

527
00:27:02,346 --> 00:27:03,733
What are you doing?

528
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:08,330
- What the hell's going on here?!
- Nothing you need to know.

529
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,923
- There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
- No, there's not.

530
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:13,442
- Why did you do that?
- It was playful hazing.

531
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:16,136
No, there's no such thing
as playful hazing.

532
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:18,954
Dwight, I want you
to look at Holly now.

533
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:21,831
Everybody, I want you
to look at Holly right now.

534
00:27:21,951 --> 00:27:25,729
And maybe if you look at her deeply
enough, you'll see what I see in her.

535
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:28,983
And that is
that we are all very lucky

536
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:31,221
to have her here.

537
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:34,124
Holly is the best thing...

538
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:37,225
that has happened to this company

539
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,330
since World War II.

540
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:41,768
50 years...
She is the best.

541
00:27:43,535 --> 00:27:46,140
- Take care of that, all right?
- It's not rabid.

542
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:50,130
- Thanks for bringing that up.
- Get it out, come on, get it out.

543
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:51,521
I'm really sorry.

544
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:55,135
Michael, thank you so much
for saying that.

545
00:27:55,512 --> 00:27:57,679
I feel so welcome here.
I just...

546
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:04,409
Excuse me.

547
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:10,631
Did you see that? Did you see it?
Did you see what...

548
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,107
Well, Jan didn't believe
in showing affection, so...

549
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,051
sometimes I don't know how to react to
when a girl touches me.

550
00:28:22,516 --> 00:28:23,575
I like it.

551
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,167
Mrs. Vance, we're all out.

552
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:33,422
Kev, I need you to do me a solid
and go buy some more barbecue sauce.

553
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,301
Okay.

554
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:40,769
Cool.

555
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:43,098
You drive your own car?

556
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:45,779
Yup, this is my car.

557
00:28:46,337 --> 00:28:47,686
Do you drive your own car?

558
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:50,190
Yep, just like you.

559
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:52,812
Okay, bye.

560
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:54,209
Bye.

561
00:28:57,718 --> 00:28:59,157
I'm really proud of you.

562
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,957
<i>All right.
Let's hear it for Darryl and his band.</i>

563
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,901
<i>You know what?
Let's also give a shout out to Phyllis</i>

564
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:13,796
<i>for this awesome party, huh?</i>

565
00:29:14,472 --> 00:29:17,543
<i>Probably the best one
that we have ever had, right?</i>

566
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:20,652
<i>But the real reason
that we are here</i>

567
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:24,251
<i>is to say good-bye to a guy
who we will probably</i>

568
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:25,975
<i>never ever see again.</i>

569
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:29,144
<i>Now, a lot of you know
that I am an accomplished songwriter.</i>

570
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,529
Song parody writer.

571
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:33,482
<i>I have done things like...</i>
Beers in heaven.

572
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:35,693
- Classic.
- <i>Or</i> Total eclipse of the fart.

573
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:38,405
- Not my favorite, but...
- <i>I love to sing them,</i>

574
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:41,574
<i>but I am not going to be
doing that today.</i>

575
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:45,208
<i>I am going to be doing
something I wrote specifically for Toby.</i>

576
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,286
<i>Do you know... </i>

577
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:50,417
- Goodbye stranger, <i>Supertramp?</i>
- Yeah.

578
00:29:52,538 --> 00:29:54,566
<i>It was early morning yesterday</i>

579
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:58,075
<i>I was up before the dawn</i>

580
00:30:00,713 --> 00:30:03,409
<i>and I really have enjoyed my stay</i>

581
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:05,890
<i>but Toby must be moving on</i>

582
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,351
I'm gonna miss Toby.

583
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:13,940
He has a nice, calming presence
in the office.

584
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,013
<i>Goodbye, Toby</i>

585
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:17,916
<i>it's been nice</i>

586
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:21,281
<i>hope you find your paradise</i>

587
00:30:21,544 --> 00:30:24,575
Don't tell him I said this,
but I always thought he was kinda cute.

588
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:28,776
<i>Come tomorrow feel no pain</i>

589
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:32,880
<i>Feel no pain</i>

590
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:42,129
<i>Toby's goin' away!</i>

591
00:30:42,403 --> 00:30:43,403
<i>See ya!</i>

592
00:30:43,595 --> 00:30:45,203
<i>See ya, Toby, see ya!</i>

593
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:46,362
<i>He's outta here.</i>

594
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:49,972
<i>Goodbye, Toby</i>

595
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:57,817
- Not bad.
- Oh, hey.

596
00:30:58,642 --> 00:30:59,443
Thanks.

597
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:01,600
Someday I would love
to hear <i>Beers in heaven</i>.

598
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,973
Oh, okay. Yeah.

599
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:06,165
Well, actually, too soon.
It's...

600
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,827
It's very sexual.

601
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,030
Sorry.

602
00:31:12,326 --> 00:31:13,184
Kevin.

603
00:31:14,468 --> 00:31:17,221
Kevin, where are you?
You missed my song, buddy.

604
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:20,408
<i>Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's.
You have to come down here.</i>

605
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:22,722
Just pay for it and we'll
reimburse you when you get back.

606
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:24,092
<i>No, I brought my money.</i>

607
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:26,386
<i>There's something
that you need to see.</i>

608
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:28,530
- What is it?
- <i>Just hurry.</i>

609
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:32,768
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he needs me at the supermarket.

610
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,481
The party, driving to the supermarket...
It was a big day for him.

611
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:40,317
Yeah, that's true.
Don't move a muscle.

612
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:43,153
I will be back momentarily,
all right?

613
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:46,324
No, you can...
Finish your drink and then I'll...

614
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:47,642
I'll be back.

615
00:31:55,523 --> 00:31:58,818
- It was good to see you.
- It was great to see you, Jan.

616
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:00,493
Okay.

617
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,874
- Hello, Jan.
- Hello... Michael.

618
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:06,596
Kevin, really?
We're...

619
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,809
Sorry, we're in the middle of a party.
Is this why you called me?

620
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,071
Yeah, Michael, I just...

621
00:32:13,122 --> 00:32:15,250
I think you kids have a lot
to catch up on.

622
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,812
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

623
00:32:16,932 --> 00:32:18,082
Thanks, Kevin.

624
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:26,732
I can't believe it!

625
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:28,720
Look at you!

626
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:30,565
- Are you nauseous?
- No.

627
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:32,412
Do you...
Do you have cravings?

628
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:34,455
You never touched my Propecia
or my Accutane?

629
00:32:34,615 --> 00:32:38,125
- No, I didn't... touch that.
- Good. Thank god. 'Cause that's...

630
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:39,909
Wow, I'm so happy.

631
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:41,589
I am so deliriously happy.

632
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,350
- Why?
- Because you're pregnant.

633
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,824
And because it obviously happened
when we were together, and...

634
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:49,304
- I am very proud...
- Yeah, it did happen

635
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:51,786
when we were together.
That's true.

636
00:32:51,906 --> 00:32:53,683
But you...

637
00:32:55,468 --> 00:32:56,468
are not...

638
00:32:58,157 --> 00:32:59,617
You're not the dad.

639
00:33:09,216 --> 00:33:10,740
You cheated on me?

640
00:33:11,595 --> 00:33:15,783
- When I specifically asked you not to?
- No, I did not...

641
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:18,374
I did not cheat on you.

642
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,097
I did not.

643
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,484
Well... okay.

644
00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:27,008
Okay. So it's not mine,
and it's not somebody else's, so...

645
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:29,223
I know...

646
00:33:30,786 --> 00:33:32,888
the whole toilet seat thing
is a myth, so...

647
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,535
I went to...
a sperm bank.

648
00:33:36,858 --> 00:33:37,838
You did?

649
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:41,312
- When we were going out?
- Yeah.

650
00:33:42,224 --> 00:33:43,674
I don't understand.

651
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:46,290
You always used to be
very cautious.

652
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,572
- I'd wear two condoms.
- I know.

653
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:51,907
You'd rather have somebody else's sperm
than mine?

654
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:53,159
No, no, no.

655
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:56,603
It's not just any sperm bank.
I mean, it's really...

656
00:33:56,723 --> 00:34:00,602
This is a really, really great place.
It's amazing, actually.

657
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:03,727
I'm gonna bring you the catalogue.
You should look through it. It's...

658
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:07,798
And it's a fact, it's right next to that
little breakfast place that you like

659
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,852
in the city where you can
draw on the tables.

660
00:34:09,972 --> 00:34:10,842
Ihop.

661
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:12,386
Ihop.

662
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:15,231
If I was 22 and I had lots of time

663
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:19,051
to have lots of children, then sure,
let's let Michael have a shot at one.

664
00:34:19,171 --> 00:34:21,228
But honestly, I need
to make this one count.

665
00:34:22,022 --> 00:34:24,400
That's really good.
I feel so much better.

666
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,608
I just needed to get
all of that out onto the table.

667
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:28,229
I'm glad you told me.

668
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:30,381
I don't know what you're gonna
be doing tomorrow,

669
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,781
but I have my lamaze class
in Allentown.

670
00:34:32,974 --> 00:34:33,998
And...

671
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:35,535
you could come.

672
00:34:36,223 --> 00:34:40,455
I usually, you know, use
a foam noodle instead of a partner.

673
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:46,670
I've to think about it.

674
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:49,414
Okay.

675
00:34:51,664 --> 00:34:53,550
My whole life, I...

676
00:34:54,723 --> 00:34:56,107
have known two things.

677
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:59,171
I love sex,
and I want to have kids.

678
00:35:00,038 --> 00:35:03,427
And I always thought that those
two things would go hand in hand.

679
00:35:04,163 --> 00:35:06,913
But now, I think it might be
one or the other.

680
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:09,813
Oh, look they're starting.

681
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:29,713
Well, I hope you had fun today.

682
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:32,132
'Cause you're never ever
throwing a party again.

683
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:59,075
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

684
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,480
<i>I was waiting for
the right time to do this,</i>

685
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:06,416
<i>and I can't think
of a better time than right now,</i>

686
00:36:06,855 --> 00:36:10,129
<i>with the music playing,
and all our friends around,</i>

687
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:12,590
<i>and the fireworks going off.</i>

688
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:14,794
<i>My parents are here...</i>

689
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:16,612
<i>Andrew and Ellen Bernard.</i>

690
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:19,221
<i>Thank you for sharing
in this joyous moment.</i>

691
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:23,225
<i>Miss Angela Martin,
will you please join me onstage?</i>

692
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:28,318
<i>Okay, then I will
come to you, my flower.</i>

693
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,171
Damn it!

694
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:35,667
<i>Angela...</i>

695
00:36:37,354 --> 00:36:39,714
<i>Will you do me the honor...</i>

696
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:44,057
<i>Of giving me your tiny hand...</i>

697
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:46,167
<i>in marriage?</i>

698
00:36:54,794 --> 00:36:55,794
Okay.

699
00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:57,926
<i>Into the mike, sweetie.</i>

700
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,809
<i>I said okay.</i>

701
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:01,618
<i>She said yes!</i>

702
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:05,959
<i>And the crowd goes wild!</i>

703
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:19,885
I've been carrying that ring around
in my wallet for six years.

704
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:22,864
Because you don't know
when you're gonna meet the right girl

705
00:37:22,984 --> 00:37:24,922
and the moment's gonna be right.

706
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:26,481
And tonight,

707
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:29,663
with the fireworks and the music

708
00:37:30,021 --> 00:37:32,753
and everything...
it was right.

709
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:34,928
Can I be your bridesmaid?

710
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:36,048
No.

711
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:43,921
Well...

712
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:47,398
It's my own fault.

713
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:51,236
Tuna!

714
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,471
I'm engaged!

715
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:56,735
I know. That's awesome, man.
That's great.

716
00:37:56,986 --> 00:37:59,711
Mr. Andrew Bernard.

717
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:03,398
It's got a nice ring to it.

718
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:05,361
Hey.

719
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,624
Hey, you know, I just realized...
I don't have a picture of the two of us.

720
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:11,554
Oh, yeah...

721
00:38:11,674 --> 00:38:12,918
- Yeah. Could we?
- Sure.

722
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:15,003
Meredith, do you mind?

723
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,756
- This one right here.
- Okay.

724
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:21,243
One, two, three.

725
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,140
Oh, let's do it again.
Pam, your smile is weird.

726
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:28,899
It's digital, so just
take as many as you want.

727
00:38:30,823 --> 00:38:32,282
One, two, three.

728
00:38:33,863 --> 00:38:35,358
One, two, three.

729
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:36,995
I don't know, I just...

730
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,965
I really thought Jim
was gonna propose tonight.

731
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,660
- Hey there.
- Hey.

732
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:47,867
- So, you missed something really big.
- Yeah?

733
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:50,181
Andy proposed to
one of your accountants.

734
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:53,660
I'm not so specific as I can be
on my first day, but...

735
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,056
Well, I can see Andy
proposing to Angela.

736
00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:57,837
I can also see him
proposing to Oscar.

737
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:00,925
So...

738
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:05,576
You know, somehow, after all those ribs,
I'm still really hungry.

739
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:09,182
I don't know, I was thinking of maybe
going off-campus somewhere

740
00:39:09,302 --> 00:39:10,558
and getting some dessert.

741
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:15,679
Well, you know what?
You should go to the Glider Diner.

742
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,269
Ask Stanley about that.
He practically lives there.

743
00:39:19,784 --> 00:39:20,694
Okay.

744
00:39:20,856 --> 00:39:22,612
I'll go to the diner with you.

745
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:24,739
That would be great.

746
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:26,992
Yeah, we can go eat pie.

747
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:28,556
I love pie.

748
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,658
- Me too.
- Okay.

749
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:33,991
- Have a good night.
- Okay. Good night.

750
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:45,644
Yeah, it was a good day.

751
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:48,581
I mean, first day's are
always the hardest, right?

752
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:50,342
Well, I should go.

753
00:39:50,495 --> 00:39:52,045
I gotta buckle him in.

754
00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:57,596
Well, this is it.

755
00:39:57,716 --> 00:40:00,026
- I am here to see you off.
- Thanks.

756
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,607
Really, Michael?

757
00:40:02,727 --> 00:40:04,029
Sorry, corporate policy.

758
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:06,543
- It's not.
- You might take something.

759
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:09,827
- Don't think he's gonna take anything.
- Okay, security guard.

760
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:14,235
Oh, some kind of... alarm.

761
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:15,315
Okay.

762
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:18,586
Hi, Jan, it's Michael.

763
00:40:19,354 --> 00:40:20,404
I just...

764
00:40:21,478 --> 00:40:24,648
I just want to let you know
that I am going to go to your...

765
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,793
lamaze class tomorrow.

766
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:32,141
And if there is any details
you need to fill me in on, like...

767
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:36,359
what, exactly, lamaze is,
that would be great.

768
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:39,363
And I will see you
tomorrow morning.

769
00:40:44,515 --> 00:40:46,332
I am going to be...

770
00:40:47,097 --> 00:40:48,491
kind of a daddy.

771
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:57,277
Party planning's a real high.
Like a runner's high.

772
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:13,562
- Oh, my god!
- What?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
