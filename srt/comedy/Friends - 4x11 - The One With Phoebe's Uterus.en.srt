1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:07,675
I can't believe
my little brother's married!

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,470
Why didn't you tell me
you were eloping?

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,431
Well, we were at court,
eating lunch...

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,725
Why were you at court?

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,728
Lunch.

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,062
We were like...

7
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:25,442
...we're here, we're having lunch.
Let's get married! Right?

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:31,573
A year ago, I didn't know I had
a brother. Now I have a sister!

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:36,662
Oh, it's so great.

10
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,129
Stop it! Don't!

11
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,173
I'll get you a gift now.

12
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,009
Is there anything you need?

13
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:58,642
We've been trying to get pregnant.
Thought we'd get a jump on things.

14
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,187
No one's getting any younger.

15
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:06,900
Because the thing is, we're not
able to, you know, conceive.

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,444
We've seen a bunch of doctors.

17
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,740
They say that our only chance
to have a baby...

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,120
...is that if they take my sperm,
her egg, put it together in a dish...

19
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,330
...and put it into another girl.

20
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:25,836
We were wondering
if you could be that girl.

21
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,842
That's a really nice gift.

22
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:36,305
I was thinking of a gravy boat.

23
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,766
The One with Phoebe's Uterus

24
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:30,901
Check it out!
Guess what job I just got.

25
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:37,532
I don't know, but Donald Trump
wants his blue blazer black.

26
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,996
Blue blazer back.
He wants it back.

27
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:48,544
You said "black". Why would he
want his blue blazer black?

28
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,629
Well, you know what I meant.

29
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,757
You messed it up.

30
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,177
You're stupid.

31
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,514
So what job'd you get?

32
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,517
Tour guide at the museum.
Ross got it for me.

33
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,979
Don't you have to be
a dinosaur expert?

34
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,565
They give you
all the information.

35
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,151
It's like memorizing a script.

36
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,822
On your left, tyrannosaurus rex,
from the Jurassic Period.

37
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,699
Very nice.

38
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:24,037
Yeah, actually, Joey,
it's the Cretaceous Period.

39
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:28,000
But I can pronounce Jurassic.

40
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,879
Frank Jr. And Alice got married!

41
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,547
Oh, my God!

42
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,758
They're having a baby!

43
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:41,931
They want me to grow it
for them in my uterus!

44
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,353
- My God!
- Are you serious?

45
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:52,608
You're thinking of
having sex with your brother?

46
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,820
Ew! And, oh no!

47
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,197
They want me to be the surrogate.

48
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:05,079
It's her egg and his sperm.
I'm the oven. It's their bun.

49
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,496
What did you say?

50
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,668
I had to think about it,
but what is there to think of?

51
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,213
I'll be giving someone
the greatest gift.

52
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:19,885
You'll carry their child,
and get them a Sony PlayStation?

53
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,596
This is an incredible thing to do.

54
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,515
But there are things to think about.

55
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:29,436
Yeah, you'd be pregnant.
I mean pregnant.

56
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,147
I know.

57
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,442
You'll put your body
through an awful lot.

58
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,029
I mean, morning sickness, labor.

59
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,822
It's all for somebody else.

60
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,450
Yeah. What's your point?

61
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,454
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.

62
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,039
I couldn't do that.

63
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:54,002
I figure, the first time I had a baby,
it'd be with someone I love.

64
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,963
And that baby was, you know...

65
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,215
...a keeper.

66
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:02,928
You were more supportive when
I wanted to make denim furniture.

67
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,973
If you decide to do this,
we'll be supportive like crazy.

68
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,642
Just think it through.

69
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,104
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.
Like your mom.

70
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:18,694
My mom never gave birth.
Oh! But my birth mom did!

71
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:27,661
I love this tushy!
Can I take it to work with me?

72
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:33,417
Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway.
It came with the pants.

73
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,505
I am so jealous.

74
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,801
You guys are just right there.

75
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,013
Right where?

76
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:50,184
The beginning, where
it's all sex and talking...

77
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,103
...and sex and talking.

78
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,898
You got to love the talking.

79
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:57,858
And the sex?

80
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,402
We haven't had sex.

81
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,904
What's the big deal?
This is special.

82
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:07,159
I want our love to grow
before moving to the next level.

83
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,578
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.

84
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,621
That is really nice...

85
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,500
...lying!

86
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,461
- No way is that the reason.
- Why?

87
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,672
You're not mature enough
to understand that!

88
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,552
He's right. I'm totally lying.

89
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,222
Then what is it?

90
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,809
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

91
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:38,691
And you're afraid you won't
be able to fill his shoes?

92
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,945
I'm afraid I won't
make love as well as him.

93
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,030
I was going for the metaphor.

94
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,742
I was saying the actual words.

95
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,746
He's had girlfriends.
It doesn't mean he's great in bed.

96
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,999
We share a wall.

97
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,922
Either he's great, or she liked
to agree with him a lot.

98
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:08,345
It'll be different. The sex will be
great because you are in love.

99
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,764
Just go for it.

100
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,140
Yeah, you should.

101
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,228
All right. I'll sleep
with my girlfriend.

102
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,357
But I'm just doing it for you guys.

103
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:27,948
Now, the mastodon is from
the semi-late Jurassic Period.

104
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,244
Isn't the mastodon
from the Pliocene Epoch?

105
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,289
This is a museum. No talking.

106
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,917
Right down here we have...

107
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,213
...a large foot.

108
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,175
And over here we have Ross Geller.

109
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,470
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.

110
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,433
Ross is one of our scientists.
Look at him hard at work.

111
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,896
Okay, moving right along.

112
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,067
Come on.

113
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,030
It's open. Come in.

114
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,324
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

115
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:14,078
I had time to finish
glazing my nipples.

116
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:18,249
You go all out
when you're expecting company.

117
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,459
I was working on my pottery.

118
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:27,800
Oh! I didn't know
that you did pot.

119
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:33,055
Mostly nudes. It combines
my two passions: Pottery and erotica.

120
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,183
Erottery!

121
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,102
Thanks for coming out to see me.

122
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:45,526
I thought it'd be a good idea to
talk about this baby stuff in person.

123
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,904
I don't think it's a good idea.

124
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,864
Why not?

125
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,033
You'd be giving up a baby.

126
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,035
And I really don't...

127
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,245
I don't know if anything I say...

128
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:02,918
...would make you understand the pain
of giving up a baby.

129
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:10,551
No, no, I understand the pain.
Don't hurt the puppy!

130
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,678
No, no. The puppy is yours.

131
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,055
I get a puppy?

132
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,057
But for only three days.

133
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,101
Why?

134
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:27,609
I realize I don't have any right
to start getting parenty on you now.

135
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,618
Look at me and not the puppy.
It's very important.

136
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,497
I know what I'm talking about.

137
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,748
I gave up two babies.

138
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:46,754
I only wish I had someone
who'd given up babies that told me...

139
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:50,424
...how terrible it is.

140
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:56,471
It'd be something you'd regret
every day for the rest of your life.

141
00:09:56,722 --> 00:10:00,851
So however hard it is for you
to give up this puppy...

142
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:06,523
...it'd be a million times harder
to give up a child.

143
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:12,571
I shouldn't have given you
the puppy first.

144
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,369
Could you sit there? I'm saving
this seat for my friend Ross.

145
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,080
You mean Dr. Geller?

146
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,459
Doctor? I didn't know
he had a nickname.

147
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,502
Oh, he won't sit here.

148
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,838
Only people in white coats
sit there.

149
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,592
Only people in blue blazers
sit here.

150
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,093
How come?

151
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,929
That's how it is.

152
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,472
That's crazy.

153
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:43,936
It's crazy in a perfect world:
A world without lab coats and blazers.

154
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:49,024
But you not in a perfect world.
You in a museum now.

155
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,652
See that scientist?

156
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:57,032
He and I used to play together
in grade school, but now...

157
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,494
Peter! Hey, Peter!

158
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,790
It's me, Rhonda from P.S. 129?

159
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,835
I shared my pudding with you, man!

160
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:12,965
I gave you my snack pack!

161
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:18,178
See? He pretend
he don't even hear me!

162
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:22,682
Everyone's pretending
they don't hear you.

163
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,478
I don't know about your jackets
and separate tables...

164
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,230
...but Ross is my friend.

165
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,068
And if I save him a seat,
he will sit in it.

166
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,615
Here! I saved you a seat!

167
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:45,372
I'm cool here.
I'll catch up with you later.

168
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,419
This is saved.

169
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,591
Gift shop.

170
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,726
I'm sorry about
what happened today.

171
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,188
You do what you got to do.

172
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:15,235
The scientists and the tour guides
never sit together.

173
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,614
It's like that everywhere.
Mon, back me up.

174
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,993
Where you work, the waiters
eat with the waiters.

175
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,787
And the chefs eat
with the other chefs?

176
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:31,877
I eat by myself in the alley,
because everybody hates me.

177
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,713
Look, Ross.

178
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,006
It's no big deal.

179
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,717
You wear a white coat.
I wear a blue blazer.

180
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,596
If that means we can't be
friends at work, so be it.

181
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,348
I understand, you know?

182
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:49,978
When I'm in a play and you're in
the audience, I don't talk to you.

183
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,565
So it's, you know, it's cool.

184
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,859
I'll see you tomorrow.

185
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:01,990
When we're in the audience,
he does wave.

186
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:17,548
Why's Phoebe singing
to Karl Malden?

187
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,842
I think it's time for puppy
to go out again.

188
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:23,262
Come on, let's go to the balcony.

189
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,765
The street.
Come on, let's go to the street.

190
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:31,937
Don't go on the balcony
until after I get back.

191
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,523
So, did you do it?

192
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,526
Yes, yes, we had the sex.

193
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,403
It was bad?

194
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:45,993
It was fine, but she didn't agree
with me as strongly as with Joey.

195
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:51,540
She was like, "I see your point.
I'm all right with it."

196
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,460
There's not always a lot of agreement
the first time.

197
00:13:55,711 --> 00:14:00,257
Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.
Guys agree like that.

198
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,634
Look, you have to help me.

199
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,011
I mean...

200
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:08,766
I know what to do with a woman.
It's always nice.

201
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,267
I need to know...

202
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,519
...what makes it go from nice to...

203
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,273
..."My God! Somebody's killing her
in there!"

204
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:21,319
I'll show you something
a lot of guys don't know.

205
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,780
All right.

206
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,323
Now.

207
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:29,620
You don't have to draw an actual...
Whoa, she's hot!

208
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,164
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.

209
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,458
You got one, two, three...

210
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,376
...four...

211
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,547
...five, six and seven.

212
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,965
There are seven?

213
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:45,344
Let me see that.

214
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,682
That's one?

215
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,560
Kind of an important one.

216
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,354
I was looking at it upside down.

217
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,818
Well, you know sometimes that helps.

218
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:11,786
Most guys will hit one, two, three
and then go to seven and set up camp.

219
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,622
That's bad?

220
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:18,001
At Disneyland, you don't spend
the whole day on the Matterhorn.

221
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:22,047
You might if it were like seven.

222
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,593
The important thing is
to take your time.

223
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,471
You want to hit them all...

224
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,014
...mix them up.
Keep them on their toes.

225
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,934
Oh, toes!

226
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,857
For some people.

227
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,568
All right.

228
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,280
You could start out
with a little one.

229
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,823
A two.

230
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,117
A one, two, three.

231
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,160
A three.

232
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,538
A five.

233
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,998
A four.

234
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,624
A three, two.

235
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,586
Two. A two, four, six.

236
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,546
Two, four, six.

237
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,756
Four. Two.

238
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,302
Two. Four, seven!

239
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,013
Five, seven! Six, seven!

240
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,225
Seven! Seven!

241
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,163
Dr. Geller?
There's a seat here.

242
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,916
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.

243
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,793
But I'm having my lunch...

244
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,713
...at this table.
Here in the middle.

245
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,047
I'm eating...

246
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:50,594
...right here
with my good friend, Joey.

247
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,889
If he'll sit with me.

248
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,480
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.

249
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,276
You know...

250
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:10,406
...we work in a museum
of natural history.

251
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,741
And yet, there is something...

252
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,494
...unnatural...

253
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,997
...about the way we eat lunch.

254
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:23,335
I look around, and you know what I see?
I see division.

255
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:28,590
Division between people in white coats
and people in blue blazers.

256
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:32,595
I ask myself, "My God, why?"

257
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,306
Now, I say we shed these coats...

258
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,018
...that separate us.

259
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:43,981
And we get to know
the people underneath.

260
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,151
I'm Ross!

261
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:51,780
I'm divorced and I have a kid!

262
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,329
I'm Joey! I'm an actor!

263
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,876
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!

264
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:10,048
I'm Ted, and I just moved here,
and New York really scares me.

265
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:14,261
- There you go!
- Hang in there, Teddy!

266
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,304
I'm Andrew.

267
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:20,476
And I didn't pay for this pear.

268
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,395
Okay. Good for you.

269
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:29,442
I'm Rhonda!
And these aren't real!

270
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,574
Wow, Rhonda.

271
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,286
- I'm Scott.
- Yeah, okay, Scott!

272
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:43,999
I flip the light switch on and off
17 times when I leave a room...

273
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,252
...or my family will die.

274
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,590
My mom will be here soon.

275
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,052
I can't. I can't give him up.

276
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,346
Yes, no. I can.

277
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,306
I don't want to.

278
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,476
But I can.

279
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:08,065
I can't watch this.
It's like "Sophie's Choice".

280
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,275
You know, I never saw that.

281
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,738
Oh, it was only okay.

282
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,281
I can't do this.

283
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:20,161
My mom was right.
If I can't give him up...

284
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,496
...there's no way
I can give up a baby.

285
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,875
Frank and Alice
are going to be so crushed.

286
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:32,297
What else can I give them?
A kidney!

287
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,886
We were in the neighborhood.

288
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:42,390
We want to let you know that
there's still no pressure.

289
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:48,605
If there was something you wanted
to say, we'll be right there.

290
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,442
Who's this little guy?

291
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,825
He's so cute! He reminds me
of my old dog, Tumor.

292
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,372
You are so precious,
I'd take you home.

293
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:06,874
Why don't you?

294
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,668
Are you serious?

295
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:12,963
Thanks.

296
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,718
- What are you doing?
- I'm okay with this.

297
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,179
You know why?
Because look at them.

298
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,264
Look how happy they are.

299
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:26,935
And I made that, so you know...

300
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:31,899
...it'll be a million times harder
to give up a baby. But God!

301
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:36,403
It'll feel a million times
better, right?

302
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:40,866
I'll do this.
I want to carry your baby.

303
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,246
Thank you so much!

304
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:50,500
You don't know what this means to us.

305
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:54,338
I think I'm going to cry!

306
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,762
It's going to be so great.

307
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,933
- What's going on?
- I gave them the puppy.

308
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:10,479
It made them so happy,
I decided to carry their baby.

309
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,606
- Phoebe...
- No, I know.

310
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,524
We're different, though.

311
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:17,027
This is a different situation.

312
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,988
I am not going to regret this.

313
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,908
I understand all that.

314
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,953
It's just, that was my puppy.

315
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,835
Would you ever be a surrogate?

316
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,879
Depends who asked.

317
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,672
What if I asked?

318
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:40,050
Oh, Mon, sure!

319
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,095
- Really?
- Yes.

320
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,809
You're not asking me, are you?

321
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:52,354
Yes. Totally.

322
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,984
Thank you! Thank you!

323
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,278
Thank you!

324
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:02,865
Yes, thank you!
