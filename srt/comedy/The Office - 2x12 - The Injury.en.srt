00:00:00,702 --> 00:00:02,224
<i>...But the Lord of the Rings trilogy,</i>

2
00:00:02,254 --> 00:00:03,493
if you see it back to back...

3
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:05,944
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam.

4
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:08,536
<i>Pam, it's Michael. Help me,
I need help right now !</i>

5
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:11,389
- Michael, what's wrong ?
- <i>I'm hurt, I have hurt myself.</i>

6
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:13,937
- <i>Oh my God ! </i>
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait !

7
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:15,698
<i>This is not looking good Pam !</i>

8
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:17,863
Michael, do you need me
to call you an ambulance ?

9
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,110
<i>No, I want you to pick me up.</i>

10
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:20,280
- Okay.
- What's going on ?

11
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:21,944
I thought you said
that you were hurt.

12
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:24,701
- <i>I am hurt. I hurt my foot.</i>
- I'm sorry ? Pam, what's going on ?

13
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:27,427
<i>I want to come to work...
...but I need you to come pick me up.</i>

14
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,691
- <i>Ohh, God !</i>
- Hey, whoa ! Michael !

15
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,983
- <i>Oh, God !</i>
- It's okay. It's Jim.

16
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:35,701
Just say again, really loudly,
uh, what happened.

17
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,051
<i>Okay, Buhh !
I burned my foot.</i>

18
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,632
<i>Very badly on my Foreman grill</i>

19
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:43,371
<i>and I now need someone to come
and bring me into work.<i>

20
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:46,523
You burned YOUR foot
on a Foreman grill ?

21
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:48,632
I enjoy having breakfast in bed.

22
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:51,320
I like waking up with
the smell of bacon. Sue me.

23
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:54,330
And since I don't have a butler,
I have to do it myself.

24
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,982
So, most nights before I go to bed,

25
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,470
I will lay six strips of bacon out
on my George Foreman grill.

26
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,470
Then I go to sleep.

27
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:04,833
When I wake up, I plug in the grill.

28
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:06,610
I go back to sleep again.

29
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:10,773
Then I wake up to the smell
of crackling bacon.

30
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:13,062
It is delicious, it's good for me.

31
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:14,991
It's a perfect way to start the day.

32
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:18,382
Today I got up,
I stepped onto the grill

33
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:20,162
and it clamped down
on my foot, that's it.

34
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:22,642
I don't see what's so hard
to believe about that.

35
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:24,561
<i>Pam, could you come get me ?</i>

36
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,393
Uh, I have to stay here
and answer the phone.

37
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,833
Okay, could someone come
and get me, please ? Ryan ?

38
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,650
Michael, you should stay home and rest.

39
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:33,503
<i>There's no toilet paper here.
Could Ryan...</i>

40
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,072
<i>Tell Ryan to bring toilet paper !</i>

41
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,341
<i>Could you tell him that ?</i>

42
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:37,462
Can you hop ?

43
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:39,042
<i>I tried hopping Kevin,</i>

44
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:41,630
<i>and I bumped my elbow
against the wall,</i>

45
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:44,922
<i>and now my elbow
has a "protruberence".</i>

46
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:48,513
<i>No one wants to pick me up ?!<i>

47
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:51,640
What is going on ?

48
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:53,923
What is going on ?

49
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:55,581
Michael is, um, sick.

50
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,212
And he wants one of us
to rescue him.

51
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:59,210
- <i>I'm not sick, I'm...<i>
- I'm coming, Michael !

52
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:01,510
- I'm going to save you !
- <i>Don't ! Is that Dwight ?</i>

53
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:04,122
- <i>I do not want Dwight.</i>
- Hold on Michael, I am coming !

54
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:05,891
- Wait there !
- <i>I do not want Dwight !</i>

55
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,451
Michael, why don't you call
your girlfriend ?

56
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:09,632
<i>I don't have a girlfriend.</i>

57
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:11,833
But you said you went out
with her this weekend.

58
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:13,791
<i>It was all made up.
Just, someone come, okay ?</i>

59
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:15,370
<i>Anyone. Anyone but Dwight.</i>

60
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:18,940
- What was that ?
- What WAS that ?

61
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,603
He hit the pole.

62
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:29,220
- It's broken, right ? He can't...
- Oh my gosh.

63
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:34,952
- Oh my God.
- Oh my Gosh.

64
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:36,172
Is he okay ?

65
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:37,871
He's still driving.

66
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:42,052
Dwight... you forgot your bumper !

67
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:44,083
<i>Hello ?</i>

68
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:45,862
<i>Please don't send Dwight.</i>

69
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:48,793

72
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:24,222
Morning everyone.

73
00:03:25,577 --> 00:03:26,292
Don't freak out.

74
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,361
I forbid anybody to freak out.

75
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:31,520
Clearly I have had a very
serious accident.

76
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,012
But  I will recover.

77
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:34,443
God willing.

78
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,653
I just wanna be treated
normally today.

79
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:38,313
Normal would actually be good.

80
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:40,472
Considering the trauma
that I've been through.

81
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:43,112
You missed two big conference
calls today. One with corporate.

82
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:44,750
Did you explain why ?

83
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:47,770
No, I didn't mention that
you cooked your foot.

84
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:49,070
Burned my foot, Pam.

85
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:52,780
Please stop popping my cast.

86
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:54,741
Thank you.

87
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,181
So where are you
shipping your foot ?

88
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:00,690
So where are you shipping...

89
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:03,761
Your foot.

90
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:06,980
Thank you.

91
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:09,831
Pam, messages please.

92
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:12,250
- You didn't have any.
- Really ?

93
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:15,980
Well, seemed, uh, very important
to you earlier,

94
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,023
that you needed to stay and..

95
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:19,711
- Do my job ?
- No.

96
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:21,951
Your job is being my friend, Pam...

97
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:23,090
and...

98
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:24,742
- God !
- It slipped.

99
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:26,632
- What did...
- Sorry.

100
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:27,661
It's just that before,

101
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:29,701
you said you didn't want
any special treatment.

102
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:31,651
I don't want any special
treatment, Pam.

103
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:34,301
just want you to treat me
like you would

104
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:38,681
a family member who's undergone
some sort of serious physical trauma.

105
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:40,313
I don't think that's too much to ask.

106
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,792
Do you want some aspirin ?
Because you seem a little fussy.

107
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,853
No, I don't want some aspirin.
Yeah, I am fussy.

108
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:46,430
Asiprin's not gonna do
a damn thing.

109
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:48,973
I'm sitting here with a bloody
stump of a foot.

110
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,431
Pam, I am Assistant Regional Manager.

111
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,043
And I can take care of him.

112
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,480
Part of my duties are to...

113
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:03,642
What ?

114
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:06,403
- Part of your duties are to what ?
- What ?

115
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,181
You just said part of your duties
are to something.

116
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:10,693
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

117
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,402
- What is wrong with you ?
- What is wrong with you ?

118
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:29,362
- Where is my cornbread ?
- Here you go.

119
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,120
Thank you. Did you get all
dark meat like I like ?

120
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,482
Yes, I ordered three full rotisserie
chickens worth of all dark meat.

121
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,630
Where are the yams ?

122
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,170
They were out of yams.
I got you creamed spinach.

123
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:40,831
Did you go to the one
in Stroudsburg ?

124
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:43,380
- And they had no yams ? 
- They had no yams.

125
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:45,330
How strange.
Because they always have yams.

126
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,963
Oh, man, is that
a Prism Duro Sport ?

127
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,073
You've seen one of these ?

128
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:54,881
Yeah, they're like an iPod,
only they're better.

129
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:56,751
'Cause they're chunkier
and more solid.

130
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,913
Roy gave it to me for Christmas.

131
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:00,961
I'm trying to figure out
how to put songs on it.

132
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,492
Oh, no, no, no. Don't go there.

133
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:04,852
I know this Russian website,

134
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,403
where  you can download songs
for two cents a piece.

135
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,873
- Really ?
- Yeah,

136
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,582
I'll write down the address for you.

137
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,081
Only, the only thing is...

138
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:14,640
is that all the songs,

139
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:15,861
are in Russian.

140
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:19,702
Kidding !

141
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:24,812
Why would they all be...

142
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:29,470
Okay, see you later, Pan.

143
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,490
Pam ?

144
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,984
Pam ? Pam !

145
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,421
Oh, God.

146
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:46,187
What ?

147
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:47,562
<i>Come here, please.</i>

148
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:49,072
Tell me before I come there.

149
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:52,201
<i>I want you to rub butter
on my foot.</i>

150
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:53,812
- No.
- <i>Pam, please.</i>

151
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:55,942
- <i>I have Country Crock.</i>
- No.

152
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:03,161
Ryan !

153
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,061
Ryan !

154
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,431
Ryan !

155
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:09,193
These covers...

156
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:11,373
are totally indestructable.

157
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:12,342
- Really ?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:14,133
Throw it. I promise it won't break.

159
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:15,531
Chuck it.

160
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,312
- Oh, no, it's broken.
- What ?

161
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,560
No, it's fine.

162
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:28,291
I told you it wouldn't break.
You could throw it all day long.

163
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:29,521
That is so cool.

164
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,212
- Thanks Dwight.
- You're welcome.

165
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:37,380
So, I guess Pam and Dwight
are friends now.

166
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,003
Oh, God, no.
Dwight isn't my friend.

167
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:45,291
Oh my God...
Dwight's kind of my friend.

168
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:49,831
No, no, no one is helping me out
at all, Mom.

169
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:53,453
No, I'm not gonna call Jan.

170
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:54,920
She'd just worry.

171
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,980
Drive down here and
make a big thing.

172
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:00,312
Who told you that ?

173
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,113
No, it was mutual.

174
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:06,653
What is Pam doing chatting
with you ?

175
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,503
Do you like candy ?

176
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:17,493
It's alright.

177
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,771
'Cause you're sweeter than candy.

178
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,111
What is wrong with you ?

179
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:25,751
Hey, cut...

180
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,442
Wow, you just dive right in.

181
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:57,472
You know, around age 12,

182
00:08:57,528 --> 00:08:59,280
I just started going for it,
you know ?

183
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:04,361
<i>Oh, help !</i>

184
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:05,970
<i>Help me !</i>

185
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:07,622
What happened ?

186
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:08,972
<i>I fell of the toilet.</i>

187
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:12,503
<i>I'm caught between the toilet
and the wall.</i>

188
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:16,072
- What do you need ?
- <i>Not you.</i>

189
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:18,230
<i>Someone  else. Get Pam.</i>

190
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:20,752
I don't think Pam's gonna want to
come into the men's room.

191
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:23,080
<i>Get Ryan.
He needs to lift me.</i>

192
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:25,632
<i>And he needs to 
clean me up a little bit.</i>

193
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:27,123
<i>Bring a wet towel.</i>

194
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:30,161
Ryan is, uh...

195
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,661
- dead.
- <i>No he's not.</i>

196
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,861
- Dead.
- <i>I just saw him.</i>

197
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,270
He's...
can you just get up yourself ?

198
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:38,603
I... you only grilled your foot.

199
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:39,843
Oh, forget it.

200
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,940
I'll just get up myself.

201
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,401
<i>Ow, God !</i>

202
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:53,782
Do you think Dwight's being 
a little weird today ?

203
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:54,880
No...

204
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,101
He's actually been really
nice and helpful.

205
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:59,263
And that isn't weird ?

206
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:01,973
Well...

207
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:05,802
Can I have everyone's attention,
please ?

208
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:07,283
Phyllis...

209
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:08,501
Oscar...

210
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:10,612
Ryan, who is supposed to be dead.

211
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:13,282
Can  I ask you all a question ?

212
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,230
Do you know what it's like
to be disabled ?

213
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:17,490
Oscar  ?

214
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:19,592
I had scoliosis as a girl.

215
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:20,983
Never heard of it. No...

216
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:23,412
a real disability.
Not a woman's trouble.

217
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:26,552
When I was a teenager,
I was in an iron lung.

218
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,202
What... how old are you ?

219
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:30,073
No, it... Look,

220
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,260
the point is...

221
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:37,002
I am the only one here who has
a legitimate disability.

222
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,700
Although I'm sure Stanley has had
his fair share of obstacles.

223
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:45,003
I'm not disabled,
and neither are you.

224
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:46,083
Okay.

225
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:48,461
What does this look like
to you, Stanley ?

226
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:51,203
Mail Boxes, Etc.

227
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,392
Shut...it.

228
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:55,231
Okay. Well...

229
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:57,271
Well, you know what ?

230
00:10:57,398 --> 00:11:01,031
Disabilities are not things
to be laughed at,

231
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:02,990
or laughed about.

232
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:05,051
You people are jerks.

233
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,892
Imagine if you had left
Stevie Wonder

234
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,182
on the floor of that bathroom
instead of me.

235
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,542
Oh, we wouldn't.
We love Stevie Wonder.

236
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:17,542
I burned my foot !

237
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:21,591
Okay, 20 minutes, conference room.

238
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,173
Everybody's in there !

239
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,031
Dad ?

240
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:34,412
While we are waiting for
our special guest to arrive,

241
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,143
I wanted you all to take a look
at a few of the many,

242
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:40,992
many disabled icons who have
contributed so much to our society.

243
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:42,743
- Quick question.
- Yeah ?

244
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:45,483
- Why is Tom Hanks on the wall ?
- Twice.

245
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:47,032
Good question.

246
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:49,281
Forrest Gump, mentally challenged.

247
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:51,593
Philadelphia... AIDS.

248
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:53,551
I think that's from Big.

249
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:56,570
I don't think so, no.

250
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:59,220
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano
with Robert Loggia.

251
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:00,711
He grew into a man overnight.

252
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,913
A rare disability. It still works.

253
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:06,722
A crossword puzzle Stanley ?

254
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:09,010
Seriously, are you learning
nothing here ?

255
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:11,812
What do you mean, "Mm-hmm" ?

256
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:14,000
- I mean I'm learning nothing.
- Okay.

257
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:16,010
Michael Scott.
I'm looking for Michael Scott.

258
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:17,810
Yes, right in here.

259
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,221
- Good.
- Come on in..

260
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,272
Great.

261
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:21,770
This ladies and gentlemen,

262
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:23,472
is our special guest.

263
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,653
Sorry I'm late. Somebody parked
in the handicapped parking space.

264
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:32,060
Hey, everyone.
I'm Billy Merchant.

265
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,940
You may have seen me
around here before.

266
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:36,691
I'm the properties manager
of this office park.

267
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,981
You are so brave.

268
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:39,560
You are so brave.

269
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:41,270
Thank you.
Actually, I've been meaning

270
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:42,643
to come by here or a long time...

271
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:45,461
But it's hard for you, right ?
Because you're in a wheelchair.

272
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:48,111
No, I just have a lot of properties
to manage.

273
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:49,671
Let me ask you something.

274
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:52,113
How long does it take you to do
something simple ?

275
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,910
Everyday, like...
like brush your teeth in the morning.

276
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:56,843
I don't know, like, 30 seconds.

277
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:58,111
Oh, my God.

278
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:00,443
That's three times as long as
it takes me.

279
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:03,731
How did you,
get in your wheelchair ?

280
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,102
This morning ?

281
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:07,273
Just like every other morning.
Just climbed on in.

282
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,392
Hey, hey, hey, hey !
Not funny, not funny !

283
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:12,960
Hey, hey, relax just, uh..
joking around here.

284
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:15,833
Well, that's good.
He still has a sense of humor.

285
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:19,151
Listen, I've actually used a chair
since I was four years old.

286
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,590
- I don't really notice it anymore.
- Well, they do.

287
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:23,451
They notice it. Don't you ?
You notice it.

288
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:26,613
It's the first thing you saw when
he rolled in here, isn't it ?

289
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,891
I wanna clamp Michael's face
in a George Foreman grill.

290
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,031
So there are jsut a couple things
I wanted to remind everybody of.

291
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:34,500
- Okay.
- First is parking.

292
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,000
You can't block the freight
entrance with your car,

293
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:40,010
even if your blinkers are on.
Does anybody have any questions ?

294
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:42,240
Yes ?

295
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,901
Yeah ?

296
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:46,782
Yes ?

297
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,520
Dwight, you have your hand up.

298
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:53,540
Ignore him.

299
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:55,161
You know what ?

300
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,523
We're not that different,
you and I.

301
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:01,183
When I clamped my foot
into a non-stick...

302
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:02,713
- You know what, Michael ?
- Yeah ?

303
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,671
- Let me stop you right there...
- Okay.

304
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:05,743
and leave.

305
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:08,193
Did you see
"Born on the 4th of July" ?

306
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:11,803
I was under the impression that
Billy would be more like that guy.

307
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:13,432
What's wrong with that guy ?

308
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:15,740
You mean today ?
He stepped on a George Forman grill

309
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:16,982
and he burned his foot.

310
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:18,113
No, not Michael.

311
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,771
The moon-faced kid who crashed
into the pole.

312
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,130
He looks like he has a concussion.

313
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:30,761
Hey !

314
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:33,392
I found the pudding cups
you wanted at a gas station

315
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:34,530
in Carbondale !

316
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,760
You did it.
Look at you !

317
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,900
And with the plate and the napkin.

318
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:40,501
Very nice. Thank you, Ryan.

319
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,700
- You're very welcome.
- Did you get the yams ?

320
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:46,100
No, the gas station in Carbondale
did not have fresh yams.

321
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:49,431
Okay.
I'll just have the pudding.

322
00:14:49,507 --> 00:14:50,562
- You sure ?
- Yeah.

323
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:51,713
Okay.

324
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:53,382
You know what ?
I feel better.

325
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,942
Ryan brought me some
chocolate pudding

326
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:58,080
and his kindness healed my foot.

327
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:03,162
Yeah, baby !
I am feelin' better.

328
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,122
My body's literally healing itself.

329
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:07,283
It is amazing what the human body

330
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,532
is capable of when you have
a powerful brain.

331
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,342
I ground up four
extra strength aspirins

332
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:13,972
and put them in Michael's pudding.

333
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,070
I do the same thing for my dog

334
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:18,092
to get him to take his
heartworm medicine.

335
00:15:19,077 --> 00:15:23,000
Ohh, finally feel the blood coursing
through my foot veins.

336
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:29,073
Okay, I think we need to take him
to the hospital, because...

337
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,881
I'm pretty sure he has
a concussion.

338
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,280
Oh, now you feel some
compassion for him.

339
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,832
He needs to go right now.
And you're his emergency contact.

340
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:38,480
- I think you should go with him.
- Why don't you go with him ?

341
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:40,611
- I barely know him.
- I want Michael to take me.

342
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:42,302
I can't take you.
I don't have my car.

343
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:43,901
- Please ?
- And yours is all vomity.

344
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,921
- You can take my van !
- Oh, okay.

345
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:48,772
That's great. No, I can't drive.
Jim, why don't you drive ?

346
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,161
- Fine.
- We'll go.

347
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:51,951
I'm still recovering.
So let's just...

348
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:53,390
Ryan, can you get my coat please ?

349
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,972
Slowly. 'Kay ?
Let's just get to the elevator.

350
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:58,132
- What are you doing ?
- Vietnam sounds.

351
00:15:58,177 --> 00:15:59,931
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

352
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:03,111
- Tired. Can't lay down.
- Just take a rake...

353
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:04,451
Wake up !

354
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:05,980
Wait, here, let me help you Dwight.

355
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,241
- Come on. Get up.
- Thanks.

356
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:08,821
- Get up.
- You're the best.

357
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,090
- Just keep him awake.
- It smells like chicken soup.

358
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:12,963
- I know.
- I have to go to the hospital.

359
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:15,092
- I know.
- Where are we going ?

360
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:17,733
- I just wanna say good-bye, okay ?
- I'll be back, I mean...

361
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,511
Yes, I know.
But it's gonna be different.

362
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:20,570
Why ?

363
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:22,082
It's just hard to explain.

364
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:24,031
Oh, Pam, you're adorable.

365
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:26,131
Oh, my goodness.

366
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,370
- Come here.
- Ohh. Huggy hugs.

367
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:31,550
Shotgun !

368
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:34,432
You don't think you should sit
in the back with Dwight ?

369
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,730
The rules of shotgun are
very simple and very clear.

370
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,713
The first person to shout shotgun

371
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:43,091
when you're within the sight
of the car gets the front seat.

372
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:45,132
That's how the game's played.

373
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:47,782
There are no exceptions for someone
with a concussion.

374
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:49,203
Oh, God, a minivan.

375
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:52,142
What is Meredith's problem ?

376
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:54,003
Well, I think she has a kid.

377
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,642
Yeah, she has one kid
and no husband.

378
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:57,962
She's not going to find one
driving this thing around.

379
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,853
- Where are we going ? 
- Come on.

380
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,071
- Get inside.
- Where are we going ?

381
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:04,521
- We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
- Chuck E. Cheese ?

382
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,323
Oh, God. I'm so sick of
Chuck E. Cheese.

383
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:08,631
We're going to the hospital,
Michael.

384
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,342
I know. I'm just sayin'...

385
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:15,450
- Dwight, what are you drinking ?
- I found it under the seat.

386
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:16,313
Oh, my God. Dwight.

387
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:18,013
-  I'm thirsty.
- Put that down.

388
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:20,111
Give the bottle to Michael.

389
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:21,812
- I'm thirsty.
- Just give it to me...

390
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:24,702
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Give me the bottle or you're fired.

391
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:26,662
You can't fire me,
I don't work in this van !

392
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:28,240
- Give it to me, Dwight !
- No, stop.

393
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:29,941
- Give me the bottle !
- Will you stop ?

394
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,992
- Give me the bottle, Dwight !
- Michael, stop !

395
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:33,432
- Just give it !
- Michael, stop !

396
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:35,663
- Just stop it !
- Stop spraying ! Gimmme the bottle.

397
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,053
- Stop !
- Stop spraying me !

398
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:38,400
Gimme the bottle !

399
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:40,922
Dwight, what is your middle name ?

400
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:42,443
Danger.

401
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:44,521
Something with a "K."

402
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:45,640
It's Kurt.

403
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:48,003
Wow, I'm so sad that I know that.

404
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:50,802
What do I write under
reason for visit ?

405
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:52,542
Concussion.

406
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:56,583
What did you write ?

407
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:58,433
Nothing.

408
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:01,533
I wrote
"bringing someone to the hospital."

409
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:04,613
So you thought they meant your
reason for coming to the hospital.

410
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:07,141
You know what, Jim ?
This isn't about me anymore.

411
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,312
I made a miraculous recovery,

412
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,161
which is more than
I can say for him.

413
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:12,460
Come on, Dwight.

414
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,313
- Hi, Michael.
- Hi, Dwight.

415
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:24,353
Doctor, what is more serious,
a head injury or a foot injury ?

416
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:25,390
A head injury.

417
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,211
Well, you don't have
all the information.

418
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:28,722
The foot had been severly burned,

419
00:18:28,785 --> 00:18:30,491
and, uh, healed quickly.

420
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:31,690
Very quickly.

421
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:34,152
Actually,
like suspiciously quickly.

422
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:35,533
So I'm ordering a CAT scan.

423
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,262
What is that ?

424
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:39,831
Look, since you have the machine
up and running,

425
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,133
can I just stick my foot in ?
We can take a look....

426
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,591
Well...for a burn,

427
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:45,963
you really just need to look
at the outside of the foot.

428
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:47,710
Okay, what kind of
machine is that ?

429
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:49,760
Does the skin look red
and swollen ?

430
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:50,991
That's what she said.

431
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,351
That's my joke. Damn it, Dwight.

432
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:58,101
Okay, no electronics past this point.

433
00:18:58,206 --> 00:19:00,542
- Camera, sound equipment.
- It's okay, they're with me.

434
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:02,403
No metal of any kind.

435
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:04,962
All right, well, I guess this is
where we leave you off.

436
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:06,531
I don't wanna do this.

437
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,170
Well, you should have
thought of that

438
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,833
before you crashed your head
on your way to pick me up, so...

439
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,692
we'll see you when you get out.

440
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:20,561
Fine, fine.

441
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:37,801
- Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
- Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.

442
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:40,450
Oh, my God, what's going on ?
Is Dwight okay ?

443
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:42,393
<i>He should be fine.
But they brought him in</i>

444
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:43,433
<i>for a CAT scan.</i>

445
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:45,302
I can't believe he's getting
a CAT scan.

446
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:47,092
<i>Michael went in there with him too.</i>

447
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,492
<i>- It's pretty sweet.
- Really ?</i>

448
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:50,180
<i>Michael went in with him ?</i>

449
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:52,642
<i>But they shouldn't be
much longer now.<i>

450
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:53,671
<i>So we'll be back soon.</i>

451
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,363
Okay, that's...
...good news.

452
00:19:56,316 --> 00:19:58,510
- Uh, yeah, no. I'll let you go.
<i>- Okay.</i>

453
00:19:58,665 --> 00:19:59,320
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Bye.

454
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:00,300
<i>Bye.</i>

455
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:09,860
- Hey, Oscar ?
- What's up Pam ?

456
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:13,352
I just wanted to let you know
that Dwight's gonna be okay.

457
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:16,303
The doctor said there's a really
simple treatment for a concussion,

458
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:18,430
so he'll probably even be back
at work tomorrow.

459
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,520
Okay.

460
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,020
I just, uh, thought you'd
wanna know that.

461
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:30,201
Okay, Mr. Schrute, inhale
with me on three.

462
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:31,580
One,

463
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:32,451
two...

464
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:33,510
Sir,

465
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:35,150
Sir, stop that. Stop...

466
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:36,900
Stop that.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
