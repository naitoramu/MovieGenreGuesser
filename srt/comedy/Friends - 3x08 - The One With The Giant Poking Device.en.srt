1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,310
Here you go, Pheebs.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,030
Who wants one of my
special home-baked brownies?

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,220
I'll have one.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,630
-That's okay.
-I'm not having one.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,220
No, no. It's just my tooth.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,230
-All right.
-I'll have one.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,750
So you need a dentist?
I've got a good one.

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,030
Thanks. I have a good one too.
I just can't see him.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,950
See, that is the problem
with invisible dentists.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,860
Why can't you go to him?

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,790
Because every time I go
to the dentist, somebody dies.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,790
That's so weird.
Every time I go to the dentist. . .

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,030
. . .I look down the hygienist's blouse.

14
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,420
What?

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,230
First it was my Aunt Mary.

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,750
And then there was John, my mailman.

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,550
And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,830
And all these people actually died?

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,020
Yes. While I was in the chair.

20
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,350
That's why I take care of my teeth.
It's not about oral hygiene.

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,500
I floss to save lives.

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,270
Come on, you didn't kill anybody.

23
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,030
These people just happened to die
when you went to the dentist.

24
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,630
It's just a coincidence.

25
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,470
Tell that to them.
Oh, you can't! They're dead!

26
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,260
The One With the Giant Poking Device

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,540
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

28
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,190
Thanks, Gunther.

29
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,630
Can I get a napkin too?

30
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,430
Oh, like you don't already
have everything.

31
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,950
You're in pain. Would you just
go to the dentist? Just go.

32
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,070
Fine. But if you're my next victim. . .

33
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,590
. . .don't come back as a poltergeist
who sucks me into the Tv set.

34
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,340
I promise.

35
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,390
Although, don't feel
like you can't visit.

36
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,590
Hey, is Chandler here?

37
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,030
No. No, he's not.

38
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,910
You guys, Joey just saw
Janice kissing her ex-husband.

39
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,150
What?

40
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,230
What are you gonna do?
How are you gonna tell Chandler?

41
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,550
I was thinking about that.
I think the best way would be. . .

42
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,670
. . .to not.

43
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,670
Joey, if you know about this,
you have to tell him.

44
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,030
It'll kill him.
It'll just kill him.

45
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,990
Wait till I go to the dentist.
Maybe I'll kill him.

46
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,230
I think Naked Guy's using a hammock.
It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

47
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,060
I'm going to the dentist.
So listen. . .

48
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,230
. . .just be on the lookout for anything
that you could fall into. . .

49
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,940
. . .or that can fall on you. . .

50
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,990
: : :or: : : :

51
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,030
All right, just look out!

52
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,510
And I also just want to. . . .

53
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,910
I just want to tell you all that. . . .

54
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,230
I have a problem. I have to go
into work for a few hours.

55
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,110
Some kids messed up
the Homo sapien display.

56
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,220
What did they do?

57
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,390
They painted over the word
"sapien," for one thing.

58
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,900
Then they rearranged the figures.
Let's just leave it at that.

59
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,270
Do you want me to watch Ben for you?

60
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,420
That's what I was gonna ask.
Thank you.

61
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,510
Wait, hello!
What about me?

62
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,990
You. You want to watch Ben?

63
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,630
That would be great!
I just asked Monica. . .

64
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,910
. . .because I know how empty
her life is.

65
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,670
I got a science question.

66
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,620
If the Homo sapiens were, in fact,
"homo" sapiens. . .

67
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,230
. . .is that why they're extinct?

68
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,950
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

69
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,420
Hey, I'm not judging.

70
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,790
Look, Benny! Spoon!

71
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,780
Spoon!

72
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,830
Come on. All right, you know what?
I think he's bored.

73
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,430
Here. You wanna play
the airplane game?

74
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,350
You wanna show Rachel?
Come here.

75
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,710
You wanna do something fun? Okay.

76
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,430
You're so brave.
You're so brave! Yes, you are.

77
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,430
-You're so brave.
-You're okay.

78
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,740
He's fine.
Let's just put him down.

79
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,670
Come here, babe.
Yes, you're such a good boy.

80
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,950
How could you do that to him?!
Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?

81
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,070
Nothing, because we're not
telling him.

82
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,270
-We're not?
-No.

83
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,950
All right, I like that.

84
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,270
So we're okay.
We're okay, aren't we?

85
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,630
No, we're not okay.
There's a bump.

86
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,870
What bump?

87
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,630
Oh, my God! Well, push it in!
Push it in!

88
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,980
I cannot push it in!

89
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,220
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.

90
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,550
That's it.

91
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,750
I got it!

92
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,630
The second Ross walks in. . .

93
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,430
. . .take him to your bedroom
and do whatever you do. . .

94
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,500
. . .that makes him go "rheeeee! "

95
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,270
Or. . .

96
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,150
. . .we could put a hat on his head.

97
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,990
A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where
are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

98
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,670
I'll get Rainy Day Bear!

99
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,030
Because he'll know what to do?

100
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,070
Oh, my God.
You're a genius!

101
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,950
It's kind of sewn on.

102
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,310
Give it. Give it.

103
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,030
It's just like a bloodbath
in here today!

104
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,550
Hey, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

105
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,110
Do you think these pearls are nice?

106
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,030
I'd prefer a mountain bike.

107
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,020
Janice's birthday's coming.
I wanna get her something special.

108
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,900
-Come in here with me.
-Wait!

109
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,860
You wanna get her something special?
Get her flowers.

110
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,470
Get her candy. Get her gum.
Girls love gum.

111
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,460
That's a good idea. "Dear Janice:
Have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. "

112
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,260
I'd like to get her something serious.

113
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,500
You want something serious.

114
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,750
You know what you should do?
You should get her one of those. . .

115
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,510
. . .barium enemas.

116
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,350
Those are dead serious.

117
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,950
Look, I'm gonna go in here.
And you don't buy me anything, ever!

118
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,630
You can't! You can't.
You can't buy her pearls.

119
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,180
You just can't, you can't,
you can't!

120
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,510
Why not?

121
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,340
Oh, God.

122
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,580
Here's the thing.

123
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,670
This is the thing.
Okay, the thing is--

124
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,110
What is the thing?

125
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,830
I went down to the
Mattress King's showroom. . .

126
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,870
. . .and I saw Janice kissing
her ex-husband.

127
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,630
What?

128
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,830
They were in his office.

129
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,630
She wouldn't do that.
She's with me.

130
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,430
I'm telling you, I saw it.

131
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,430
Well, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

132
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,110
I'm not wrong.

133
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,790
I wish I was.

134
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,390
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,030
Bet that barium enema
doesn't sound so bad now.

136
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,220
It makes more sense as an ensemble.
And it takes the focus off the hat.

137
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,710
Oh! You're alive!
You're alive!

138
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,740
I promised you no one
would die, didn't l?

139
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,270
We'll see about that. Can I use your
phone to call everyone I know?

140
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,660
Sure. We have no money. Go ahead.

141
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,030
Hey, you're not dead!
Okay, see you.

142
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,070
Monica.

143
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,820
Oh, my God! He just said my name!

144
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,390
Did you hear that?

145
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,230
Monica bang!

146
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,950
Okay, I heard that.

147
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,860
Did he just say, "Monica bang"?

148
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,830
Oh, my God! He's gonna rat me out!

149
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,030
Monica bang!

150
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,620
Sweetie, you need to stop
saying that now.

151
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,220
It's no big deal.
It's not even worth mentioning.

152
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,430
You see? We all do it all the time.

153
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,950
See? Watch this.

154
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,550
Monica bang!
Everybody bang!

155
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,820
Ben bang!

156
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,390
Rachel bang!

157
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,820
Bang, Rachel! Bang!

158
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,700
-Oh, isn't it fun?
-Look at that!

159
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,060
We all do it!

160
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,100
-Okay, I'm stopping now.
-Are you okay?

161
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,110
You know, if it's not
a headboard, it's just not worth it.

162
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,790
How's my Bing-a-ling?

163
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,550
I don't know.

164
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,590
You tell me.

165
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,020
Anything you want to tell me?

166
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,310
Because if you. . . .
You should--

167
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,540
You would tell me.

168
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,870
Why are your eyes so wide?

169
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,660
You tell me.

170
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,630
Maybe it's because I was just
fooling around with my ex.

171
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,590
Oh, no. That was you!

172
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,870
Oh, my God!

173
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,870
-All right!
-How did you know?

174
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,260
Joey told me. He saw you two kissing.

175
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,270
In the park?

176
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,670
No. In his office.
How many kisses were there?

177
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,870
Just those two!

178
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,470
Why?

179
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,310
Why was there kissing?
There should be no kissing!

180
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,590
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I'm so, so. . . .

181
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,300
I'm so, so sorry. I just. . . .

182
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,910
What happened was l. . . .
I can't breathe.

183
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,830
Can you get me a bag or something?

184
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,910
Here. Here.

185
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,500
It's the receipt.

186
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,660
I'll take it.

187
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,950
Look, I've got to know.

188
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,270
Are you finished with me?

189
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,710
Are you finished with him?

190
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,630
Do you still love him?

191
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,070
Do you still love me?

192
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,180
All right, look. . .

193
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,670
. . .I'm gonna need an actual
answer here, okay?

194
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,550
So which is it?

195
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,430
Him or me?

196
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,750
I don't know.

197
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,190
Okay, if you're alive,
you answer your phone!

198
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,990
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy
that you had ice cream before dinner. . .

199
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,830
. . .if you won't tell him about
our little bonking incident.

200
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,230
Number one, I don't think Ben
understands the concept of bribery.

201
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,230
And number two, l--

202
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,150
What?

203
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,630
You said "number two. "

204
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,830
I also said "number one. "

205
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,510
I know.

206
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,350
Hey, everyone!

207
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,630
How's my little boy?

208
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,430
He's perfect.
Aren't you, Ben?

209
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,220
-He's never been better.
-What did you do, take him whaling?

210
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,270
Monica.

211
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,830
Oh, my God! He just said your name!
That's great! Good job, Ben!

212
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,780
Monica bang!

213
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,020
That's right.

214
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,030
That's what I'd sound like
if I exploded.

215
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,350
The curse is broken!
I called everybody I know. . .

216
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,420
. . .and everyone is alive!

217
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,110
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

218
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,710
My God, I killed another one!

219
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,790
The curse is getting stronger too,
to bring down something that big.

220
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,940
Maybe he's just taking a nap.

221
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,630
I'm telling you,
he hasn't moved since this morning.

222
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,270
We should call somebody.

223
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,550
Tell them the naked guy we stare at
isn't moving?

224
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,860
We've got to find out if he's alive.

225
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,420
How are we gonna do that?
There's no way.

226
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,230
Well, there is one way.

227
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,150
His window's open.
I say. . .

228
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,540
. . .we poke him.

229
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,550
You know how we save
all those chopsticks. . .

230
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,230
. . .for no reason
when we get Chinese food?

231
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,510
Well, now we got a reason.

232
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,590
What?

233
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,710
We're fashioning a very long
poking device.

234
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,630
All right.

235
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,110
Hey, what's the matter?

236
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,670
I talked to Janice.

237
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,550
Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?

238
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,750
She doesn't know.

239
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,390
Says she loves us both.

240
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,590
I woke up this morning, I was in love.

241
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,430
I was happy!

242
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,750
It serves me right for buying
that 1 2-pack of condoms.

243
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,620
And now I can't even return them,
because she choked on the receipt!

244
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,860
What are you gonna do?

245
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,710
I don't know.

246
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,820
You know? What would you do?

247
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,950
It doesn't matter what I'd do.

248
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,870
Come on. Come on. Tell me.

249
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,110
All right. . .

250
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,340
. . .you probably won't want
to hear this. . .

251
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,590
. . .but if it was me,
and this is just me. . .

252
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,950
. . .I'd bow out.

253
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,950
What?

254
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,310
What are you talking about?

255
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,030
They have a kid together. . .

256
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,350
. . .you know?

257
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,510
They're, like, a family.

258
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,070
And if, I don't know. . .

259
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,540
. . .if there's a chance
they can make that work. . .

260
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,510
. . .I wouldn't want to be the guy
who stood in the way.

261
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,180
You okay?

262
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,830
You wanna come poke a nude guy?

263
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,270
Well, he's finally asleep.

264
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,670
About that bump on his head. . . .

265
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,140
Are you sure it's a new bump?

266
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,430
No offense, but I've always thought
of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

267
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,070
It's okay if he bumps his head.
Kids bump their heads all the time.

268
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,110
It was your first time babysitting.
You did your best.

269
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,620
I did!

270
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,630
I know.

271
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,030
You just have to watch them
all the time.

272
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,870
I did! I watched! I watched!

273
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,190
I watched Monica bang his head
against that thing!

274
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,180
Monica did it?

275
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,420
Did you notice anything weird
about Ben today?

276
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,630
No, why?

277
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,630
I was just playing with him, and we
were doing the "Alphabet Song" . . .

278
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,630
. . .which he's good at.
But he left out "E" and "F. "

279
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,390
It's like they just, I don't know,
fell out of his head.

280
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,830
Really?

281
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,070
Oh, and also, he's walking. . .

282
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,750
. . .kind of funny.

283
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,630
It's like his left leg is moving
a lot faster than his right leg.

284
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,550
Yeah, he's in there, just. . . .

285
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,950
Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!

286
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,150
I hope it's still funny
when you're in hell.

287
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,580
You jerk!

288
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,420
-You know how much I love that kid!
-Monica bang! Monica bang!

289
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,950
I'll get the hat.

290
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,070
I have something to tell you.

291
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,430
And I want you to let me
get through it. . .

292
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,950
. . .because. . .

293
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,270
. . .it's not gonna be easy.

294
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,540
I think you should go back with Gary.

295
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,230
I don't want to be the guy
that breaks up a family.

296
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,340
You know, when my parents split up,
it was because of that guy.

297
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,660
Whenever I'd see him,
I'd always think. . .

298
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,270
. . . "You're the reason.
You are why they're not together. "

299
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,580
And I hated that guy.

300
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,110
And it didn't matter how nice he was
or how happy he made my dad.

301
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,990
It's the right thing to do.

302
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,310
You're right.

303
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,990
Oh, God.
But before I can say goodbye. . .

304
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,430
. . .there's something I really
need you to know.

305
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,430
The way I feel about you. . .

306
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,670
. . .it's like I finally understand. . .

307
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,140
. . .what Lionel Ritchie's
been singing about.

308
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,430
You know?
I mean, what we have. . .

309
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,470
. . .it's like movie love.

310
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,500
You're my soul mate.

311
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,630
I can't believe we're not gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

312
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,990
Then don't leave me.

313
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,150
What?

314
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,230
Forget what I said! I was babbling!
Pick me!

315
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,950
No, you were right! I gotta give
my marriage another chance.

316
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,990
No, you don't!

317
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,830
I say you have to give your divorce
another chance!

318
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,910
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,300
Don't go.

320
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,590
No, I gotta go.

321
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,190
Honey. Honey.

322
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,350
-People are looking.
-I don't care.

323
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,750
I don't care!

324
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,670
Yeah, okay.

325
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,300
I'm leaving now.

326
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,500
You can't leave! I have your shoe!

327
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,340
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

328
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,030
Rachel has those in burgundy.

329
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,190
Remember, something this big and long
will be very difficult to maneuver.

330
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,030
Fortunately, I have
experience in that area.

331
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:51,260
Can we please focus here? A naked
man's life hangs in the balance.

332
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,830
I'm telling you, he's dead.

333
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,340
What we're about to have here
is a dead fat guy on a stick!

334
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,030
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's poke.

335
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,060
Steady.

336
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,430
Steady.

337
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,390
Okay, a little higher.

338
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,790
Careful of the angle.

339
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,550
Okay, okay.
We're approaching the window.

340
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,750
Thread the needle. Thread the needle.

341
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,790
He's alive! He's alive!

342
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,020
And yet we're still poking him.

343
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,830
Okay, retract the device!
Retract the device!

344
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,230
He does not look happy.

345
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,990
Now he's showing us his poking device.

346
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,620
Hey, that's never gonna make it
all the way over here, buddy!

347
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:52,270
I'll hold you close in my arms

348
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,550
I can 't resist your charms

349
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,030
And love

350
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,030
Love

351
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,140
I'll be a fool for you

352
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,510
I'm sure

353
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,750
You know I don 't mind

354
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,550
Oh, you know I don 't mind

355
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,630
Yes

356
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,830
You mean the world to me

357
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,430
Oh, I know
I know

358
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,140
I've found
I've found

359
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,710
In you

360
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,550
My endless love

361
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,070
My endless love
