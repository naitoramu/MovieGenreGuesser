1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,160
Okay, pick a card.
Any card.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,840
All right, now memorize it.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,240
Show it to everybody.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,280
Got it?

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,440
All right.
Give it back to me.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,750
Five of hearts.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,840
Real magic does exist.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,840
Joey, how do you do it?

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,400
I can't tell you that.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,440
Somebody's at the door on the ceiling.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,720
That's our unbelievably loud
upstairs neighbor.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,480
He took up the carpets,
and now you can hear everything.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,070
Why don't you go ask him
to just, "Step lightly, please?"

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,960
I have, like five times.
But the guy is so charming. . .

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,240
. . .I go up there to yell,
then I end up apologizing to him.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,320
That is silly!

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,080
I'll go up and tell him
to keep it down.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,120
-All right, be my guest.
-Good luck.

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,280
All right, all right. . .

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,040
. . .if you wanna know how I did it,
I'll show you.

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,920
When you handed me back the card,
what you didn't see was. . .

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,480
. . .I looked at it so fast,
it was invisible to the naked eye.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,640
I just did it.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,560
Just did it again.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,040
Here, I'll slow it down
so you guys can see it. Ready?

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,720
-I got it now!
-Okay.

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,670
Thank you.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,840
The One Where Chandler
Can't Remember Which Sister

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,070
Czech Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,440
Anybody got a length of rope about
6 feet long, with a noose at the end?

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,640
-Honey, what's the matter?
-I just saw Janice.

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,800
She was at Rockefeller Center, skating
with her husband. She looked so happy.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,240
I almost feel bad for whipping
that kid's pretzel at them.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,680
I remember the first time I saw
Katherine after we broke up.

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,680
She was walking and talking
with her friend, Donna.

36
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,320
God, it killed me!

37
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,600
But you ended up having sex
with both of them that afternoon.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,560
Sorry, I just--
Any excuse to tell that story.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,840
There's a party tomorrow.
You'll feel better then.

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm gonna be okay. You don't
have to throw a party for me.

41
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,440
It's Joey's birthday.

42
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,040
Then if anybody should have a party,
it should be him.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,240
I cannot believe
she's still up there.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,280
Well, he totally
screwed up the punch line.

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,280
You know, it's supposed to be--

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,080
How's that coffee coming, dear?

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,800
Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,600
I'm not suppose to drink it.
It makes me gassy.

49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,440
I know.

50
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,040
I'll bet you're thinking,
"What's an intelligent girl. . .

51
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,920
. . .who wants to be in fashion
doing making coffee?"

52
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,230
You got me.

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,080
Don't think I haven't noticed
your potential.

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,280
I've got a project for you
that's a lot more related to fashion.

55
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,870
-How does that sound?
-That sounds great!

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,080
-Come on over here, sweetheart.
-Thank you so much.

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,920
I need these hangers separated
ASAP.

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,230
You're welcome.

59
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,990
Oh, God, I hate my job!
I hate it.

60
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,680
I know, honey. I'm sorry.

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,160
I want to quit, but then I think I
should stick it out.

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,390
Then I think:

63
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,680
"Why would a person stay
in such a demeaning job. . .

64
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,240
. . .just because it's remotely related
to the field they're interested in?

65
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,360
Gee, I don't know, Rach.

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,280
Order up! Yentl soup, James Beans,
and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

67
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
Come on, I'm sorry.
I didn't--

68
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,680
I don't mind paying my dues.

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,000
But how much
will I learn about fashion. . .

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,430
. . .by walking Myra,
the arthritic seamstress. . .

71
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
. . .to the bathroom?

72
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,280
Hi.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,400
Is my misery amusing to you?

74
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm sorry, I was just. . . .

75
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
It's not funny.
This is actually my job.

76
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,080
Believe me, I've been there.

77
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,840
I had to sort mannequin heads
at that Mannequins Plus.

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,840
I'm just gonna go back
to talking to my friend here.

79
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,840
You can go back to enjoying
your little hamburger.

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,520
Just one other thing.

81
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,040
I work at Bloomingdale's.

82
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,440
I might know of a possible job,
if you're interested.

83
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
Do you want my pickle?

84
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,280
Hey, guys.

85
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
-Hey, Gunther.
-Hi.

86
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,390
You're going on a date
with the noisy guy upstairs?

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,640
Well, he's very charming.

88
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,040
He's too charming!

89
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,400
But if you go out,
it'll be harder for me to hate him.

90
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,280
You'll just have to try.

91
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,360
Joey? Where are the Jell-O shots?

92
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,640
I don't know. Chandler's
supposed to be passing them--

93
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,440
Chandler!

94
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
Hello-dee-lo!

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,040
Well, somebody's feeling better.

96
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,470
-Stick out your tongue!
-Take off your shirt!

97
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
-Oh, my!
-Oh, my God!

98
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,550
How many did you have?
They're pure vodka.

99
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,440
Yeah, Jell-O.
Just like Mom used to make.

100
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,630
The most unbelievable thing
happened today.

101
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,670
I had lunch at Monica's
and met a guy. . .

102
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
. . .who works for a buyer
at Bloomingdale's.

103
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,670
There's an opening there!
So I gave him my phone number. . .

104
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,230
. . .and he'll call me this weekend
to get me an interview!

105
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,230
So this guy's helping you
for no apparent reason?

106
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,270
And he's a total stranger?

107
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,280
Yeah. His name is "Mark" something.

108
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,830
Sounds like "Mark Something"
wants to have some sex!

109
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,880
What?

110
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,640
Why else would he swoop
in out of nowhere for no reason?

111
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,390
To be nice?

112
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,350
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice
to strange women for no reason?

113
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,000
-No, only for sex.
-Thank you.

114
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,990
So did you tell
"Mark Something" about me?

115
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,840
I didn't have to.
I was wearing. . .

116
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,430
. . .my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board
and ringing my bell.

117
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,200
Joey!
Happy birthday!

118
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,920
How many of that girl are you seeing?

119
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,080
How hammered are you?
These are Joey's sisters.

120
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,880
Hi, Joey's sisters!

121
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,960
What're we drinking over here?

122
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,240
Well, I have a vodka
and cranberry juice.

123
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,240
No kidding?

124
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,160
That's the same drink I made myself
right after I shot my husband.

125
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,760
Okay, I don't know how
to talk to you.

126
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,680
What are you doing?

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,630
I'm taking my ex-girlfriend
off my speed dialer.

128
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,160
No, it's a good thing.

129
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,680
Why must we dial so speedily anyway?
Why rush through life?

130
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,840
Why can't we savor
the precious moments?

131
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,520
You have some huge breasts!

132
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,640
-Hi.
-Hi.

133
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,240
So I heard about this Mark guy
that Rachel met today.

134
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,470
Isn't it great?

135
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,040
Yeah, pretty good.
He sounds like a nice, good guy.

136
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,160
Oh, he is.
And he is so dreamy!

137
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,040
I mean, when he left,
I actually used the phrase:

138
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,120
"Hummina, hummina, hummina. "

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,440
That's excellent.

140
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,640
So he's "just a nice guy. "

141
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,790
Do you really think this Mark
doesn't want anything for helping you?

142
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,960
Well, I assume I'll
have to take showers with him.

143
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,680
But that's true of any job.

144
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,630
How you feeling?

145
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Well, my apartment isn't
there anymore. . .

146
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,840
. . .because I drank it.

147
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,760
Where'd you go? We lost you
after you opened up all the presents.

148
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,040
I ended up in the storage room,
and not alone.

149
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,830
No "woo-hooing. " No "woo-hooing. "

150
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,160
Why, what happened?

151
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,040
I fooled around with Joey's sister.

152
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,960
That's not the worst part.

153
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,680
What is the worst part?

154
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,840
I can't remember which sister.

155
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,470
You see what men do?
Don't tell me men are nice.

156
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,360
This is men!

157
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,150
Are you insane?

158
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,200
Joey will kill you.
He'll actually kill you dead.

159
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
You don't think I thought of that?

160
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,080
-How can you not know which one?
-That's unbelievable.

161
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,120
-Was it Gina?
-Which one's Gina?

162
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,560
The dark, big hair,
with airplane earrings.

163
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,840
That's Dina, not Gina.

164
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,440
See? You can't tell
which is which either!

165
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,840
We didn't fool around
with any of them.

166
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,440
It's got to be veronica.
The girl in the red skirt.

167
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,440
I definitely stuck my tongue
down her throat!

168
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,840
That was me.

169
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,360
When I drink, sometimes
I get overly friendly. . .

170
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,240
-. . .and I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

171
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,240
-That's all right.
-That's okay.

172
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,240
Can I talk to you for a second?

173
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,040
Hey, Joey!

174
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,430
Come on.

175
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,040
Why can't we talk in here. . .

176
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,640
. . .with witnesses?

177
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
I just got off the phone
with my sister.

178
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,640
Which one?

179
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,110
-Mary Angela.
-Mary Angela.

180
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,400
Now which one is she again?

181
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,960
Ask Chandler.
He fooled around with her.

182
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,480
She told me you said
you could really fall for her.

183
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,600
Is that true, or are you just getting
over Janice by groping my sister?

184
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,240
It's gotta be the first one.

185
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,270
Really?

186
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,320
That's great!

187
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,840
You and my sister, sitting in a tree!

188
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,840
Yep, I'm in a tree.

189
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,760
Did he call? Did Mark call?

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
I'm sorry.
But the weekend's not over yet.

191
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,160
Oh, my God! ls that Phoebe?

192
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,600
Guess they're back from their date.

193
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,040
Music!

194
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,640
very nice!

195
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,320
Oh, my God!

196
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,600
So how are you?

197
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,760
-I am good. I finished my book.
-What's it about?

198
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,640
I don't remember.
Do you want to take a walk?

199
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,400
"Dear Mary Angela:

200
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,560
Hi, how's it going?

201
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,070
This is the hardest letter
I've ever had to write. "

202
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,360
What the hell's the matter with you?

203
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,240
How will Joey react to you
blowing off his sister with a letter?

204
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,080
That's where you tell him
that I moved to France. . .

205
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,960
. . .when actually I'll be in Cuba.

206
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,920
Look, you've got to do this
yourself in person.

207
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,160
You know her name.

208
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,960
You just go to the house
and ask for Mary Angela.

209
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,430
When whichever one she is
comes to the door. . .

210
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,030
. . .take her for a walk
and let her down easy.

211
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,360
What if she comes to the door
and I ask for her?

212
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,640
Where in Cuba?

213
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,720
What are you doing here?

214
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,880
Waiting for my grandma
to do my laundry.

215
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,160
What about you?

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,120
I'm here to see Mary Angela.

217
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,110
You are so the man! Come on.

218
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,560
Now look, listen.
Listen. . . .

219
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,840
Be cool, because Grandma
doesn't know about you two.

220
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,640
You don't want to tick her off.

221
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,040
She was, like, the sixth person
to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

222
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,750
Where's Mary Angela?

223
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,640
She's right in there.

224
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,640
-Hey, Chandler!
-Hey, Chandler!

225
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,560
I can't believe Mark didn't call.

226
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,480
It's Sunday night and he didn't call.

227
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,870
Bummer.

228
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,120
Yeah, right. Look at you.
You're practically giddy.

229
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,680
I'm genuinely sorry
the Mark thing didn't work out.

230
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,960
Look, Rach, I want
only good things for you.

231
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,350
Wait a minute.
Why don't you just call Mark?

232
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,070
Who says you have to sit
and wait for him?

233
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,920
You've got to make stuff happen!

234
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,920
Yeah, but you don't
wanna seem too pushy.

235
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,240
It's not pushy.
He gave her his home number.

236
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,560
He gave you his home number,
as in, to his home?

237
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,480
And you don't mind if I call,
because you want good things for me.

238
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,240
That's right, good things.
That is what I said.

239
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,440
Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Greene.

240
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,640
Oh, no.
Don't you apologize.

241
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,280
Yeah, I'll hold.

242
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,280
He left my number at work.

243
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,560
Then he had to help his niece
with her report on the pioneers.

244
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,640
That is so made up!

245
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,440
Oh, my God! Tomorrow?

246
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,280
That's--
No, it's perfect.

247
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,640
Oh, God!
Thank you so much!

248
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,280
Great.

249
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,800
I got the interview!

250
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,640
There you go!

251
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,760
He even offered to meet me for lunch
and prep me for it.

252
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,960
That is amazing!

253
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,840
Well, if I know Mark,
and I think I do. . .

254
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,240
. . .I'd expect nothing less.

255
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
I gotta figure out what to wear.

256
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,240
High collar and baggy pants say,
"I'm a pro! "

257
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,070
Yeah, right.

258
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,240
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

259
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,240
You go get them!

260
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,840
What did I do to you?
Did I hurt you in some way?

261
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,280
What?

262
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,630
"Why don't you call him?"

263
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,350
Thank you very much.
Now he's gonna prep her. . .

264
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,400
. . .as in what you do before
you surgically remove the boyfriend!

265
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,750
Are you crazy?

266
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,240
Am l? Am I out of my mind?
Am I losing my senses?

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,280
This dreamy guy's taking my girlfriend
out for a meal!

268
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,200
This isn't even about you!

269
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,920
It's about something wonderful
happening for Rachel.

270
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,040
Even if you're right,
and he wants to sleep with her. . .

271
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,840
. . .does that mean he gets to?

272
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,080
-No, but--
-Don't you trust her?

273
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,040
Then get over yourself!
Grow up!

274
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,640
You grow up.

275
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,320
This tiramisu is excellent.

276
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,760
Did you make it, Mary Angela?

277
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,240
No, I did.

278
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,040
Well, it's yummy.

279
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,920
So. . . .

280
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,640
Mary Angela, do you like it?

281
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,030
Of course.
It's her favorite.

282
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,430
So. . . .

283
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,760
Mary Angela, what's
your second favorite?

284
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,440
More of Grandma's tiramisu.

285
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,830
Oh, would you just please. . .

286
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,430
. . .give me your recipe, because
this is great! It's topnotch!

287
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,790
That dies with me.

288
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,230
So will l.

289
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,470
Excuse yourself
and go to the bathroom.

290
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,000
I was just squinting.
It doesn't mean anything.

291
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,430
Just do it!

292
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Will you excuse me, I have to. . . .

293
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Finally! I thought we'd
never be alone.

294
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,840
Can I just tell you something?

295
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,920
I have not stopped thinking about you
since the party.

296
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,080
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.

297
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,680
I just got out of a relationship.

298
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,720
And I'm not really in a. . .

299
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,680
. . .in a commitment kind of place.

300
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
So? Me neither!

301
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,280
God, Mary Angela was right.
You do have the softest lips.

302
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,520
You're not Mary Angela?

303
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,680
No! I'm Mary Therese!

304
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,840
This is so bad.

305
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,960
If you're not Mary Angela,
then who is?

306
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,230
I am.

307
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,440
Oh, it's so bad.

308
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,310
No, Joey! No, Joey!

309
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,440
What's going on?

310
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,880
You're it!
Now run and hide!

311
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,640
It's no big deal.
Chandler was just kissing me. . .

312
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,680
. . .because he thought
I was Mary Angela.

313
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,760
What? How could you
think she was Mary Angela?

314
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,880
I wasn't sure which one
Mary Angela was.

315
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Look, I'm sorry.
I was really drunk. . .

316
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,750
. . .and you guys
all look really similar.

317
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,600
-I say punch him, Joey!
-Yeah, punch him!

318
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,070
We should all calm down. . .

319
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,630
. . .because your brother's
not gonna punch me.

320
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,640
Are you?

321
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,080
That's usually what I'd do.

322
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,630
But I never thought you'd be
on the receiving end.

323
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,400
How could you do this?

324
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,830
If you wanna punch me, go ahead.
I deserve it.

325
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,240
But I want you to know that I'd never
soberly hurt you or your family.

326
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,160
You're my best friend.

327
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,040
And I'd never do anything
like this, ever again.

328
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,880
So what?

329
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,880
-I say punch him!
-Yeah, punch him!

330
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,560
No, I'm not gonna punch Chandler.

331
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,920
-I'll do it.
-No, you won't!

332
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,040
He knows he did a terrible thing,
and I believe him. He's sorry.

333
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,240
But you got one more apology to make.

334
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,480
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

335
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
-Absolutely. You got it.
-All right.

336
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
-Cookie, now you can punch him!
-What?

337
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,640
What are you doing here?

338
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,760
You know, this building's
on my paper route, so. . . .

339
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,950
How did it go?

340
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,670
The woman I interviewed with
was pretty tough. . .

341
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,720
. . .but thank God Mark coached me.

342
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,560
Once I talked about the Fall line,
she got all happy.

343
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,040
-I'm so proud of you.
-Me too!

344
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,470
Listen, I'm. . . .

345
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,840
I'm sorry I've been
so crazy and jealous and. . . .

346
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,070
It's just,
I like you a lot, so. . . .

347
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,230
I know.

348
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,520
-Hi.
-Hi, Mark.

349
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,320
I just talked to Joanna,
and she loves you. You got the job.

350
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,270
I did?

351
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,320
Oh, my God!

352
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,920
Congratulations. . . .

353
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,070
So, Phoebe?

354
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,390
How was your date?

355
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,120
Oh, well, you know. . . .

356
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,640
Yeah, I do know.

357
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,510
You were eavesdropping?

358
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,510
Eavesdropping? Pheebs, the ceiling
tiles were falling down.

359
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

360
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,760
But I really like this guy
and I think he really likes me.

361
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,960
Maybe he's just. . .

362
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,280
. . .jumping on a pogo stick
and he really likes it.

363
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,800
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

364
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
All right, that's it.
He cannot do this to Phoebe!

365
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,480
This guy's gonna get
the butt-kicking of a lifetime!

366
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,840
But is he a big guy?

367
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,270
We'll all go. Come on.

368
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,040
Thanks, you guys.
Thank you!

369
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,040
Don't worry!

370
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,600
God!
I hope they kick his ass!

371
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,160
Honey, I'm sorry.

372
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,920
If it's any consolation. . .

373
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,840
. . .he sounded like
he had more fun with you.
