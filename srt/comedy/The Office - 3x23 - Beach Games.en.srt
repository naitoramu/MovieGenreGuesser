1
00:00:02,674 --> 00:00:04,271
Okay. Where does it hurt?

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:05,293
Just-

3
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:06,377
All over.

4
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:09,373
I- don't wanna do anything,

5
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:10,969
- I'm dying... 
- No. that's not how it works.

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,221
You have to point 
a specific part of the body.

7
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:15,242
Right there.

8
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:16,975
Abdomen.

9
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,374
- Menses. 
- Maybe.

10
00:00:19,374 --> 00:00:21,782
The uterus contracts after 
your egg passes through it.

11
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:23,225
Not it. I don't have eggs.

12
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:24,275
So, when it did start?

13
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:26,295
About 10 minutes ago. I-

14
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:27,859
When I came in with the paper work?

15
00:00:28,923 --> 00:00:31,318
About 40 times a year, 
Michael gets really sick,

16
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:32,669
but has no symptoms.

17
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:35,433
Dwight is always gravely concerned.

18
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,971
Oh, is it possible you ate food 
that contained animal waste?

19
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:42,051
- It's possible. 
- Michael?

20
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,279
David Wallace is on line one.

21
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:45,334
The CFO?

22
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:49,207
Alright. Everybody out, out, out!

23
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:53,891
To what do I owe this 
great honor, David Wallace?

24
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:56,194
- Michael, I'm calling... 
- And Gromit?

25
00:00:58,544 --> 00:00:59,296
Jan?

26
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,440
Is Jan there?

27
00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:03,169
Jan is out of town right now.

28
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:04,906
Oh, you sigh like Jan.

29
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:09,955
I broke Jan's heart, David. 
And I feel awful. It was-

30
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:13,475
It was never my intention to ruin a life.

31
00:01:14,128 --> 00:01:15,458
But, you know what?

32
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:18,449
- Sometimes- 
- Michael?

33
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:20,612
You just gots to get your freak on.

34
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:21,560
- Michael? - Yeah.

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,578
- Michael?

36
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:27,725
I'm calling to see if you would 
come down and interview for job.

37
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:29,301
We have an opening up in corporate.

38
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:30,920
Really?

39
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,130
Week from today,

40
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,546
Bring your first quarter stat,

41
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:36,454
your recommendation for who 
would take over the Scranton Branch.

42
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:37,445
Wow

43
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:41,204
I wish I had prepared 
something to say.

44
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:42,308
That's not necessary.

45
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:45,760
May God guide you in your quest.

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,688
Yes.

Original Air Date: May 10, 2007 (NBC)

49
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:24,783
Okay, everybody have 
their towels and swim suits?

50
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:26,077
We have about an hour and half.

51
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:28,730
I suggest that you all go potty now

52
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,754
and then we will be congregating 
on the partay bus.

53
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:33,872
I'm excited. Today is Beach Day.

54
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:36,175
Michael is taking 
the whole office to the beach.

55
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:39,117
So, I'm wearing my bathing suit 
underneath my shirt.

56
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:42,027
I packed it in my purse.

57
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:45,064
Oscar, you brought 
your Speedo, I assume?

58
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,550
I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.

59
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:49,282
You can't swim in other pants.

60
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:52,809
I'm just yanking your chain.

61
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,383
Not literally.

62
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,268
Anybody needs sun block?

63
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:57,509
Got SPF 30.

64
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:59,619
Oh, you know what,

65
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,020
You're not going.

66
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,175
It's Beach Day.

67
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,582
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby.

68
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:05,528
We- um,

69
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,503
Somebody has to stay here.

70
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,679
I want today to be 
a beautiful memory,

71
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:12,554
that the staff and I share

72
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:15,693
after I have passed on to new york.

73
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:19,236
And if Toby is a part of it,

74
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:20,886
then it'll suck.

75
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,983
Hey, you want my sunscreen?

76
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:26,574
Oh, great.

77
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,962
I forgot mine, and 
I'm wearing two pieces.

78
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:31,260
Thanks, Toby.

79
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:36,385
Hey, Pam.

80
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,552
I have a very important 
job for you today.

81
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,458
I thought we're just 
having fun at the beach.

82
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,541
We are. We are.

83
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,419
But, I would like you to take notes.

84
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,514
And, I want you to find out 
about people's character.

85
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:50,498
You know, not there hotness, per se.

86
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:53,625
But, their humor 
and their charisma,

87
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:58,273
and the indefinable quality 
that makes you all glad to follow me.

88
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,394
What happens to a company 
if somebody takes their boss away?

89
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,818
I will answer your question 
with a question.

90
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:07,764
It's like what happens to a chicken,

91
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,033
when you take its head away.

92
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:11,731
It dies.

93
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,046
Unless you find a new head.

94
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,395
I need to see which one of these people

95
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:22,420
have the skills to be a chicken head.

96
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:25,464
You want me to right down 
people's indefinable quality.

97
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:28,661
I want you to right down everything 
that people are doing all day.

98
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,922
And then, type it up. 
In a way that is helpful.

99
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,038
I have the most boring job in the office.

100
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:39,165
So, why wouldn't I have 
the most boring job on Beach day?

101
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:43,132
This way to the party bus.

102
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
I just wanna lie on the beach,
and eat hot dogs.

103
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:48,657
That's all I've ever wanted.

104
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:52,035

106
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:58,216

¢Ý You got to know when to hold 'em ¢Ý

109
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:05,569

¢Ý know when to fold 'em ¢Ý

111

¢Ý when the dealin's done ¢Ý

117
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:31,622
Everybody, may I have 
your attention, please?

118
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:37,349
Today, we are not just 
spending a day at the beach.

119
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,142
Oh, sweet mother of God.

120
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:41,347
If you don't like it Stanley, 
you can go to the back of the bus.

121
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:42,592
Excuse me?

122
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,022
Or the front of the bus.

123
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:45,484
Or drive the bus.

124
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:47,612
Just-

125
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:53,016
We are all participating in 
mandatory fun activities.

126
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:55,623
Funtivities!

127
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:58,664
And there is a special 
secret prize for the winner.

128
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:00,075
Yes! Funtivities!

129
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:01,575
I knew it wasn't 
just a trip to the beach.

130
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:02,592
Okay, you know what?

131
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:04,448
Your enthusiasm is turning people off!

132
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:06,848
I hope they'll be the management parables.

133
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:08,785
Well- Hey, Pam.

134
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:10,202
Did you get that down?

135
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:11,802
Like what?

136
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:13,966
Like everything I said, 
and everything they did and...

137
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:17,381
- Write it down before you forget it. That's... 
- I don't know exactly what-

138
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,005
You've just been drawing pictures.

139
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:23,914
I can't stay mad at you.

140
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:26,839
Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.

141
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:28,318
Everybody ready?

142
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,970
Last one down is a rotten egg.

143
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,805
Watch out for snakes!

144
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:36,165
Everybody put on sunscreens.

145
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:38,618
Alright. Find a cozy spot.

146
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,247
Everybody settle in.

147
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:47,446
Okay, everybody up!

148
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:49,221
Circle 'round.

149
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:51,598
Let us play some games.

150
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:57,213
We are situated on the northeast 
corner of scenic Lake Scranton.

151
00:06:57,536 --> 00:07:01,361
America's 8th largest indigenous body of water.

152
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:07,554
It is here that a group of Americans 
will undergo the ultimate challenge.

153
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:08,719
One day,

154
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:12,054
14 strangers,
who worked together,

155
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,923
but only one survivor.

156
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,375
- What? 
- Just Words.

157
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:17,861
Inspiring words.

158
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:19,271
Not a contender.

159
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:22,928
For the competitions,
You'll be divided into 4 tribes.

160
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:24,630
Each tribe will have a leader.

161
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,974
But I will pick randomly,
off the top of my head, Without thinking.

162
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,412
Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.

163
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:33,010
- Yes!
- Choose your tribes.

164
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:34,374
Except for Pam. Not Pam.

165
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,737
Jim Halpert.

166
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:38,858
- Karen 
- Pros.

167
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:39,942
Smart,

168
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,432
Cool,

169
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:42,843
Good looking,

170
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,729
Remind you of anybody you know,

171
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:47,729
Cons.

172
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,118
Not a hard worker.

173
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,850
I can spend all day on a project,

174
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,189
and he will finish 
the same project in a half an hour.

175
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:55,698
So, that should tell you something.

176
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,703
I choose Michael!

177
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,750
I'm not playing.

178
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:01,695
Okay, Temp.

179
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:05,752
Dwight, is an obvious 
candidate for my job.

180
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,169
He has the best 
sales record in the office.

181
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:10,291
He loves to work.

182
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:13,825
He is however, an idiot.

183
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,995
We're going to choose 
team names. Dwight.

184
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,419
We'll be called Gryffindor.

185
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:18,989
Really? Not Slytherin?

186
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,192
- Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim. 
- I know

187
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:23,965
Okay, we'll be Voldemort.

188
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,952
He who must not be named. 
I wouldn't do that.

189
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:30,138
- Voldemort! Voldemort! 
- Seriously!

190
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:32,230
You really shouldn't be saying that.

191
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:34,146
Hey! Thse guys're idiots.

192
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:37,217
Okay, Stanley, 
your team name.

193
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,135
I don't care 
what you call my team.

194
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:41,148
Then I'll name your team, 
the Red team.

195
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,311
No, the Blue team.

196
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,373
I am also considering Stanley

197
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:51,430
Because of all the good that 
black people have done for America.

198
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:54,230
We will be Team USA.

199
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,982
Very good.

200
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:57,528
Pam, please take a note that 
Andy is patriotic.

201
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:00,202
Andy Bernard. Pros.

202
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,332
He is classy.

203
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,022
He gets me.

204
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:04,408
He went to Cornell.

205
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,188
I trust him.

206
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:08,084
Cons.

207
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:09,957
I don't really trust him.

208
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,185
It is time for the great spoon and egg race.

209
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,875
This one is a little twist.

210
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,816
There's already a twist, 
you're carrying an egg on a spoon.

211
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:21,015
The person carrying the egg 
will be blindfolded

212
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:22,368
Please put on your blindfolds.

213
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,704
That person caring the egg will go down,

214
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:28,267
Circle a torch, come back,
deposit their egg in the pail.

215
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:29,913
First team back is the winner.

216
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:31,606
Alright, ready.

217
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:33,914
Set! Go!

218
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,153
Come on Phyllis, you can do it.

219
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,202
Oh, thank you so much.

220
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:40,650
Phyllis is out. Yes!
Follow my voice.

221
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:43,932
Yeah, keep it moving. 
Keep it moving right this way.

222
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,446
- Looking good! 
- I don't wanna hit the big rock!

223
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:47,088
Don't worry. You're not-

224
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,029
I know I'm near the big rock. 
I just know it.

225
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,170
No where near the big rock.

226
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,666
- I just don't want to get hit by it...
- What're you doing! No!

227
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:55,800
See, now we're disqualified.

228
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:57,428
I am okay,

229
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:01,074
if I lose every single contest today.

230
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:02,491
Honestly.

231
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:06,939
Because I see these contests

232
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:11,017
as an opportunity for me to 
demonstrate what a good sport I am.

233
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:11,911
Mallard!

234
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,945
Woah, stop, stop, stop! 
There's a hole.

235
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:17,113
Step over the hole.

236
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:18,758
<i>Come on! Lazy Bum!

237
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,211
Move it!

238
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:22,530
- Perfect. Ooh, just made it. Turn left.
- <i>Come on, temp! Move it!

239
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,148
Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!

240
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:25,155
Could you stop this right now?

241
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:26,267
I'm not gonna do this anymore.

242
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:27,121
What're you saying?

243
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:28,945
You have to stop yelling at me 
or I'm not gonna do the egg race.

244
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:31,507
- Okay, I apologize for yelling at you.
- That's what being a good captain is about.

245
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,315
- I am trying to bring team spirit!
- It's about listening to the members of your team.

246
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:35,503
Oh, stop. Another hole. 
Take a big step.

247
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:37,469
Yeah!

248
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,098
Oh my God! You ass!

249
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:44,987
There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach.

250
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:48,116
Filled with sun, surf, and uh-

251
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:50,135
diligent note taking.

252
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:52,161
Pam, you're missing things.

253
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:06,766
Let's go! Let's go!

254
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:09,447
Come on! Mush! Mush!

255
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:11,092
Come on you bastard! What the-!

256
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:13,725
Damn it, Temp!

257
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:18,304
Great job, everyone. That was fantastic.

258
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:25,223
Okay Pam, I have another
little project for you.

259
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:27,544
Does it have to do with these 
shopping bags filled with hot dogs?

260
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:28,996
Smart as a whip! Yes!

261
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:30,422
These are pre-cooked.

262
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:32,321
So it's not absolutely necessary.

263
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:35,091
But I would appreciate 
if you can heat up 800 hot dogs

264
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:37,121
for a little contest 
I'm going to be having.

265
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:38,754
I would greatly appreciate it.

266
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:39,856
When's the contest?

267
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:41,856
Like-um- 10 minutes?

268
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:43,506
- How am I supposed to get these-
- Thanks a bunch!

269
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:49,489
A good manager 
has got to be hungry.

270
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,571
Hungry for success.

271
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:52,913
Okay, who's hungry!

272
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,220
No, no, no, do not touch 
your food, please! Not yet!

273
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:56,970
That is our next event.

274
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,983
A hot dog eating contest.

275
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:01,240
For those of you who're curious.

276
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,578
The world record is 54 
and one half hot dogs.

277
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:07,575
Wow! And you know what?

278
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:09,979
I personally have cooked up enough.

279
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,236
so that each and every one 
of you could break that record.

280
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:13,622
So shoot for the stars, okay?

281
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:17,138
Alright, the team that eats 
the most hot dogs in 10 minutes

282
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:18,738
will be declared the winner!

283
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:19,974
On your mark!

284
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,324
- Get set! 
- Can I have a turkey burger?

285
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,012
No, I have the only one. I claimed it.

286
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:25,666
Ready!

287
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,718
- Turkey is a healthy meat. 
- It's very good for you.

288
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:31,010
Can I skip this game, Michael?
I'm not gonna eat this.

289
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,115
Get Set! Come on!

290
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:34,744
Please! Let's just-

291
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:38,885
Okay, it's very important today that 
you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can.

292
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,906
On your mark!

293
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:41,999
Get set!

294
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:43,148
Eat!

295
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,282
Is there any mustard?

296
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:45,848
No mustard! No mustard!

297
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,327
Just eat it! Eat it, Phyllis.

298
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,804
Dip it in the water, so it'll 
slide down your gullet more easily.

299
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,695
Come on, the winner 
gets a big, big prize.

300
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:54,404
What is that?

301
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:55,599
I can't say.

302
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:57,564
You can't say? 
Or you can't pronounce it?

303
00:12:57,564 --> 00:13:01,368
The winner gets reginal manager's 
salary for a year and a Sebring,

304
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:03,468
And the feeling that they're 
making differences in the world.

305
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,822
Can we just take 
those first two things?

306
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:07,564
The winner of today gets my job!

307
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:10,585
Okay?

308
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:12,909
I'm interviewing for a job at corporate.

309
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:15,904
And they're only interviewing 
a handful of people

310
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:18,735
and I'm the most qualified 
and I'll probably get it.

311
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:19,741
Alright?

312
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:21,614
You're leaving?

313
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:22,943
I didn't wanna tell anybody.

314
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:25,630
I didn't want to cast a pall 
over our fun beach day.

315
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:27,440
But you know what? 
I don't know who to recommend.

316
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,028
because frankly nobody is stepping up.

317
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:31,606
I am SO hungry!

318
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:33,549
Do you expect me to believe that

319
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:36,509
you're truly making 
your recommendation on this basis?

320
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,355
Word.

321
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,364
There we go!

322
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,299
Let's see it!

323
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:46,327
I would rather work for an upturned broom 
with a bucket for a head

324
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,547
than work for somebody else 
in this office, besides myself.

325
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,177
Game on.

326
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:52,778
4 seconds,

327
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:57,283
3, 2, 1. Stop your eating!

328
00:13:57,607 --> 00:13:59,882
And the winner is Andy Bernard!

329
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,631
- With 14 hotdogs!
- Team USA!

330
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:06,136
- One came up.
- 13 hotdogs, everybody!

331
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:06,764
Damn it!

332
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:09,999
Nobody told me 
we're gonna have hotdogs!

333
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,452
Sabotage!

334
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:17,811
What? What're you saying?

335
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,835
- You just said sandwich?
- No

336
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:22,031
I was saying that before.
Not now.

337
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,778
Now I am saying sabotage.

338
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,452
The ancient Dutch art of 
screwing up your own team.

339
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:31,453
I knew you were saying sabotage.

340
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,601
I was giving you an example of it.

341
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:37,134
I will misunderstand 
everything that Andy says,

342
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:38,753
until he goes insane.

343
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,430
If Michael organizes 
some kind of group hug,

344
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,831
Stand next to me.

345
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:47,008
Very simple. 
There are only 3 rules.

346
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:49,747
You must not touch the ground,

347
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:52,397
You must not step outside of the ring,

348
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:55,706
And you must always wear 
the safety mittens.

349
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:57,721
We don't have any safety mittens.

350
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:59,263
Probably left them 
in the trunk of my car.

351
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:00,600
It's alright. It's alright. 
Here we go.

352
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:01,759
Get'em big boy!

353
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:04,938
And! Go!

354
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:06,380
<i>Come on, Jim!

355
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:08,439
What're you doing?

356
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:14,485
Nice, Stanley!

357
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:15,844
Sorry about that.

358
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:17,956
It's all about taking 
points away from Dwight.

359
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:20,092
- Yeah, no, good. - Okay

360
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:21,211
Oh my God!

361
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,243
I've never seen that look 
in a man's eyes ever.

362
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,356
I thought that I might die.

363
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,235
On beach day.

364
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:40,007
If either of these guys is 
putting charge of the office,

365
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,149
I will transfer to Albany. 
Gil can come if he wants.

366
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:45,080
I'm kinda of looking the way 
out of the relationship anyway.

367
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,248
I think I might try girls for a while.

368
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:49,845
Angela thinks I can cross over.

369
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:51,187
We'll see.

370
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,165
One, two, three!

371
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:57,355
Excellent!

372
00:15:58,217 --> 00:15:59,706
Gryffindor!

373
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:02,330
I didn't win.

374
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,162
But the only reason I didn't win was

375
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:08,968
because I recently learned that 
it's better to work thing out with words.

376
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,150
That's not why you lost.

377
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,808
Yeah, it is.

378
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:13,826
I totally could have 
kicked your butt so bad.

379
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:15,397
- Yeah, right?
- Yeah, right.

380
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:23,754
How do you like that!

381
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:39,870
Help!

382
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:42,692
Angela, Angela! Hey!

383
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:44,861
Thanks God. Please, please tell somebody.

384
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:48,267
What Andy? 
Andy, what should I tell them?

385
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,499
Go tell them 
I'm floating away, obviously!

386
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,162
I don't understand 
what you want from me.

387
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,168
Angela! It's pretty simple!

388
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:58,343
Look at what I'm doing, 
and go tell somebody it!

389
00:16:59,044 --> 00:16:59,998
Sorry!

390
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:02,810
Bye Andy!

391
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,276
Angela!

392
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:07,310
I knew that finding a successor 
would be difficult.

393
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,050
I did not know that 
it would be impossible.

394
00:17:10,468 --> 00:17:13,730
Thus far the candidates 
have been wildly disappointing.

395
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,990
Jim is not taking this seriously,

396
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:17,866
Stanly is having a stroke,

397
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,392
And, Andy. Where is he? 
Where the hell is Andy?

398
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:23,047
Where is he Pam?

399
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:24,233
Do you know?

400
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:27,119
Who's ahead in points?

401
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:28,713
I think they're even.

402
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:31,964
At various times 
you gave Jim, 10 points.

403
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:34,876
Dwight, a gold star. 
And Stanley a thumbs up.

404
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:37,478
And I don't really know 
how to compare those units.

405
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,613
Check to see if there is 
a conversion chart in that notebook.

406
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:41,549
- I really doubt it, Michael. 
- Please just check.

407
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:44,001
Great.

408
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:45,478
Yeah, I'll see you next week.

409
00:17:46,202 --> 00:17:48,399
Thank you. 
And, here is Karen Filippelli.

410
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:49,663
Bye.

411
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:51,881
Hello?

412
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,694
Yeah, hi David.

413
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,673
Yes, I would like to be considered 
for the corporate position in well.

414
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:59,319
- In well?
- As well.

415
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,133
How would that work, "in well?"

416
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:03,437
- I just wanna know.
- Yes.

417
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:05,133
Wait a minute.

418
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:08,153
- That would be fine. 
- If this Job is in a well, I don't want it

419
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,623
- Cut it out!
- I don't

420
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:13,630
What does a great manager need most of all?

421
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,039
Courage?

422
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,310
How so?

423
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:20,969
I mean, sure thing. 
That sounds smart-

424
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,302
I can't do this anymore.

425
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,919
I'm going to sit in the bus.

426
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,113
Your loss, Stanley.

427
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:29,750
Meanwhile the rest of us 
will have a super fun time

428
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,087
defeating our fear,

429
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,410
and creating a lasting memory.

430
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,641
walking through fire!

431
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,770
Who among you has 
the guts to replace me?

432
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,635
Let him walk across these coals.

433
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,052
Are you gonna try it?

434
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:56,093
I'm not going to talk through the fire

435
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,047
after your disgusting feet 
have gone through.

436
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:00,469
Angela, it is a million degrees.

437
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:03,581
I'm gonna do it.

438
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,748
And I fully expect to burn 
my feet and go to the hospital.

439
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:10,220
That's the right spirit 
when doing a coal walk, right?

440
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:14,619
No, no. Not you, Pam.
You keep scores.

441
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,109
- I'd like to try it. 
- Pointless.

442
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:16,936
And I'm not kidding,

443
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:18,380
- I really wanna do it.
- Okay?

444
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,138
This is about guts!

445
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,699
It takes a gut to be a regional manager.

446
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,014
Jim, you're up.

447
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:28,677
- Nope. 
- Just- Why not? come on.

448
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:30,059
¡®Cause I don't want my feet to get burn.

449
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:36,490
You do not have what it takes 
to be a regional manager.

450
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:37,884
That's harsh.

451
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,639
Who's next? Andy.

452
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:40,544
Where's Andy?

453
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:42,855
<i>Andy is never here today.</i>

454
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:46,619
Hello?

455
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:47,771
Who's there?

456
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,110
My name is Andrew Bernard.

457
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,003
I was with a group 
called Dunder Mifflin.

458
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,260
Hello?

459
00:19:57,885 --> 00:19:59,334
Why don't you go, Michael?

460
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,162
Because I already did.

461
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,775
Remember? I burned my foot.

462
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,396
on a George Foreman grill.

463
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:07,889
That is not the same at all.

464
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,755
If you're gonna ask other people 
to do it, you should do it yourself.

465
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:12,107
Alright, okay. Alright.

466
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:36,464
The mind has to wrap around the foot.

467
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:02,599
Do you want us to count to three?

468
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:04,605
Yes, count to three, please.

469
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:07,416
Three, two, one!

470
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,707
Count the other way!

471
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:11,277
no, no, count one, two, three, 
not three, two, one.

472
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,664
- One, two, three! 
- Go! / Do it! / Go Michael!

473
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:18,948
Wait! Am I going on go? 
Or am I going on three?

474
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,011
On the go that's after three.

475
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:21,832
Okay.

476
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:25,853
One, two, three! GO!

477
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,654
No! It's okay!

478
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:37,330
I'll do this Michael!

479
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:40,574
I'll walk and stand on the coals

480
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:44,517
Until you award me 
the position of regional manager!

481
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:52,965
Dwight, keep moving and walk there

482
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:58,162
Give me the Job!

483
00:21:58,162 --> 00:21:59,608
I'm not going to give it to you.

484
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,169
Don't kneel on the coals!

485
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:05,827
Michael! Do something!

486
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:07,939
God! That stings!

487
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,887
Being a boss is also about image.

488
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:18,084
I never look like that.
That was gross.

489
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:23,655
I just- I don't see the connection 
between a firework and management.

490
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:25,636
Worst 75 bucks I ever spent.

491
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,621
You know what, if I had to pick 
my replacement based on today,

492
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:33,063
It would be Mr. Outside Hire.

493
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:34,647
Or Mrs. Outside Hire.

494
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:37,560
Yeah. True.

495
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:42,224
Look, I don't wanna leave 
this branch that I love,

496
00:22:42,747 --> 00:22:43,979
to an outside hire.

497
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:49,806
Therefore, we're going to have 
a 100 point winner take all

498
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:52,769
sudden death tribal council round.

499
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,879
To test the aspect of my job 
that I think is most important

500
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:01,037
something I call the Bob Hope factor.

501
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:02,189
Who's Bob Hope?

502
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:05,388
God! He's- he's a comedian.

503
00:23:05,911 --> 00:23:06,952
Oh my God! Like Amanda Bynes.

504
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,324
Who's Amanda Bynes?

505
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,972
She's from What a Girl Want.

506
00:23:10,316 --> 00:23:11,493
Oh I love that movie.

507
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,882
Yes, Kelly is right.

508
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:18,966
The person to replace me has 
to have a great sense of humor.

509
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:24,267
And they have to possess the leadership 
qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.

510
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,201
So, without further adieu,

511
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,593
Jim and Dwight,

512
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:37,793
show us what you've got.

513
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:41,505
Hey, I- I know what you're looking for.

514
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:44,504
But um- I gotta be honest.

515
00:23:44,504 --> 00:23:47,279
I really don't think I should be 
considered it as your replacement.

516
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,189
You are being too modest.

517
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:53,536
Michael, on Thursday, I'm gonna 
drive down and interview with David

518
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:54,989
for the open position in New York.

519
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:00,727
Okay. That is not funny.

520
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,878
I am deducting 60 points for the Voldemort.

521
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:07,883
For false pretenses.

522
00:24:07,883 --> 00:24:09,447
Okay, Dwight, your turn.

523
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:10,340
Wow us.

524
00:24:11,913 --> 00:24:12,990
The Aristocrats.

525
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:15,777
A man and his wife and his children

526
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:17,912
go into the offices of a talent agency.

527
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:25,080
And the talent agent says,

528
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:27,074
"Describe your act"

529
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:32,057
And the man says something 
really really raunchy.

530
00:24:32,653 --> 00:24:34,263
and the talent representative says,

531
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:36,171
"What do you call yourselves?"

532
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:39,140
And the man says, "The Aristocrats!"

533
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:51,608
I mean truly repulsive acts.

534
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:54,098
That is a very, very funny story.

535
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:56,399
Hey, I wanna say something.

536
00:24:57,721 --> 00:24:59,750
I've been trying to be 
more honest lately.

537
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,699
And I just need to say few things.

538
00:25:01,856 --> 00:25:03,085
I did the coal walk!

539
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:04,440
Just- I did it.

540
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:07,209
Michael, you couldn't even do that.

541
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:09,261
Maybe I should be your boss.

542
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:12,843
Wow, I feel really good right now.

543
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:17,423
Why didn't any of you 
come to my art show?

544
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,111
I invited all of you.

545
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,432
That really sucked.

546
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:25,260
It's like sometimes some of you 
act like I don't even exist.

547
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:32,453
Jim, I called off my wedding 
because of you.

548
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:34,976
And now we're not even friends.

549
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:39,629
And things are just weird 
between us. That sucks.

550
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:41,663
I miss you.

551
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:45,234
You were my best friend 
before you went to Stamford.

552
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,643
I really miss you.

553
00:25:49,701 --> 00:25:50,817
I shouldn't have been with Roy.

554
00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:54,762
There were a lot of reasons 
to call off my wedding.

555
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,308
But the truth is I didn't 
care about any of those reasons

556
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,214
until I met you.

557
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:01,133
And now you're with someone else.

558
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,764
And that's fine.

559
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,162
It's- whatever- that's not what I'm-

560
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:07,998
I'm not- 
Okay, my feet really hurt.

561
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:10,789
The thing that I'm just trying 
to say to you, Jim,

562
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,724
And to everyone else in the circle, I guess,

563
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,753
is I miss having fun with you.

564
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:20,267
Just you. Not everyone in the circle.

565
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,838
Okay. I am gonna go walk 
in the water for now,

566
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,798
Yeah. It's a good day.

567
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:37,148
Pam, that was amazing!

568
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,445
But I am still looking for 
someone with a sales background.

569
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,036
<font color=gray>Flinstones Theme Songs</font>
