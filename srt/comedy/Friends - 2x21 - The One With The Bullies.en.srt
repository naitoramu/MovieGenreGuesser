I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,588
<i>Stocks and bonds are moving higher...</i>

4
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,257
Why are we watching
the Business Channel?

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:12,346
Because the other day I saw there was
a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,307
Sometimes it takes two or three hours
before it comes up again.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,685
But when it does, it's exciting.

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,440
Okay, honey, you really need a job.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,442
Dad says he knows someone
you can call for an interview.

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,197
Right there! That's the third
sign today. Right there.

11
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,242
On behalf of everyone,
I'd just like to say, "Huh?"

12
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,871
No, you just said "dad".
And everywhere I go today...

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,582
...I keep getting signs
telling me to go see my father.

14
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:45,670
Like when I was walking over here
and I passed a buffet.

15
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,383
Which is my father's last name.

16
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,468
And they were serving franks...

17
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,722
...which is his first name
minus the "s" at the end.

18
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,810
And there was a rotisserie
with a spinning chicken.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,646
His Indian name?

20
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:07,734
No. Because I chickened out
the last time...

21
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,530
...when I tried to meet him.
So coincidences? I don't think so.

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,949
- Very freaky.
- Eerie.

23
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,951
Who wants the last hamburger?

24
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,537
That's it.
Now I have to go see him.

25
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,579
Why?

26
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,875
Hamburger? McDonald's?

27
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,630
Old McDonald had a farm.
My dad is a pharmacist.

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,425

00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,056
Man, I am so beat.

31
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,433
You wanna forget racquetball
and hang out?

32
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,603
Yeah, all right.

33
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,608
- Hey, you're in our seats.
- Sorry, we didn't know.

34
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,735
We were sitting there.

35
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,779
Okay.
There is one more way to say it.

36
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,158
Who knows it?

37
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:42,747
- Was that supposed to be funny?
- Actually, I was going for colorful.

38
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,248
- What's with this guy?
- What's with you?

39
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,543
Nothing. Nothing's with him.

40
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,796
Enjoy your coffee.

41
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,012
What just happened?

42
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,641
I just took your hat.
See, I can be funny too.

43
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,769
My joke is that I took your hat.

44
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,022
That is funny.

45
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,942
Can I have it back?

46
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,660
You know what?
I think you're very funny.

47
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,039
Kudos on that hat joke.

48
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,127
But come on, guys,
just give him back the hat.

49
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,254
Why should we?

50
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,382
Because it's a special hat.

51
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,385
He bought it because
he was feeling down one day.

52
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,928
So he got the hat...

53
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,765
...to cheer himself up, you know?

54
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:47,811
- Chandler...
- Stop talking. Stop talking now.

55
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,397
Let me get this straight.
You're stealing my hat?

56
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,565
You got a problem?

57
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:56,194
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

58
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,448
How'd the interview go?

59
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,867
It bit.

60
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,119
It was a '50s theme restaurant.

61
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,956
I'd have to cook in a costume
and dance on the counter.

62
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,380
How can I take a job where I have
to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?

63
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,466
- Don't do it.
- How can I not do it?

64
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,509
I have $ 127 in the bank!

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,680
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

66
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,181
I don't want a beer.

67
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,434
Who said it was for you?

68
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,859
What's the matter?

69
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,279
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse
took my hat.

70
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,198
- No!
- You're kidding?

71
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,825
It was ridiculous.
These guys were bullies.

72
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,036
Actual bullies.

73
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:51,750
We're grownups. This kind of stuff
isn't supposed to happen anymore.

74
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,381
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I have no one.

75
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,177
Let's go down there
and get your hat back.

76
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:08,099
Forget it. It's probably stripped
and sold for parts by now.

77
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,685
- I went up!
- What?

78
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,148
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

79
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:18,569
Do you realize that if I'd invested
my $ 127 in myself yesterday...

80
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,615
...that I'd, like, have
a lot more than that today.

81
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,285
You know what?
I'm going to do it.

82
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,746
- Do what?
- Put all my money in me.

83
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,749
You don't know a thing
about the stock market.

84
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,127
What's to know?
Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

85
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,170
Yes, Manhattan.

86
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,840
Telephone number for the stock...

87
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,427
...selling store.

88
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,606
See? I told you these pillows
would be a good idea.

89
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,608
Oh, God.

90
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,902
Here we go.

91
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:04,490
For the first time in my life,
I'm gonna say, "Hi, Birth Father!"

92
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,367
- We love you. We're here for you.
- Good luck.

93
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,328
Thanks.

94
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,041
Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?

95
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,793
What is in that?

96
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,212
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

97
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:22,883
No, because mayo,
that would make it gross.

98
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,972
- Run, Phoebe, run!
- No, no, doggy, please!

99
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,851
I do so want to love all animals.
Please, no. Back off!

100
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,102
- You got a bone?
- Are you kidding?

101
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,231
Look, kibbles! Bits!

102
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:42,236
Get the hell off my leg,
you yippity piece of crap!

103
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,577
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

104
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,705
Why don't you take his trampoline?

105
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,501
Okay, here, I know what we can do.

106
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,630
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!

107
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,717
Go get the sandwich!
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

108
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:09,638
The dog will lick himself
but he will not touch your sandwich.

109
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,057
What does that tell you?

110
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,936
- Lf he's not going to eat it, I will.
- Are you crazy?

111
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,439
He's just a little dog.

112
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,863
- Hey.
- What?

113
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,867
Do you have to be a Century 21
real-estate agent...

114
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,996
...to get to wear those cool jackets?

115
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,793
Do you say this stuff to girls?

116
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,046
Isn't that the guy
who used to wear your hat?

117
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,717
And look where they're sitting.

118
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:52,431
You're joking, right?
You guys just walked through the door.

119
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,892
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.

120
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,728
This couch belongs to us.

121
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,482
I'll tell you what,
you call the couch...

122
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,569
...and then we'll call the couch...

123
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,656
...and we'll see who it comes to.

124
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:12,576
You know, I keep wondering
why you two are still sitting here.

125
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,828
All right, that's it.

126
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,122
I have had enough of this.

127
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,541
Gunther.

128
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,461
These guys are trying
to take our seat.

129
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,881
Fellas, these guys were here first.

130
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,175
Oh, sorry, didn't realize.

131
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,426
There you go.

132
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,221
Thank you, Gunther.

133
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,684
We didn't want to have
to go and do that.

134
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,271
He told on us?

135
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,731
You told on us?

136
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,443
Well, pal, you didn't
give me much of a choice.

137
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,530
- Don't play with his thing.
- I know.

138
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,992
All right.

139
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,537
Let's take this outside.

140
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:02,167
"Let's take this outside?"

141
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,295
Who talks like that?

142
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:09,884
The guy who's about to kick your ass
talks like that.

143
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,261
You had to ask.

144
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,808
Okay, okay, look. See...

145
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:23,021
...the thing is, we're not gonna
fight you guys.

146
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:24,440
Here's the deal.

147
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:31,197
You won't have to, so long as you
never ever show your faces here again.

148
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:39,330
I think you played
the Gunther card too soon.

149
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,795
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

150
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,839
Yeah, I don't know.

151
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,342
What's the matter?

152
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,428
I just think that this was
a really bad sign.

153
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,932
Like the beast at the threshold.

154
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:03,979
It's just I have no family left,
except for my grandmother.

155
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,232
But let's face it, she's not
gonna be around forever.

156
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,443
Despite what she says.

157
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:16,617
And I have a sister who I've barely
spoken to since we shared a womb.

158
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,911
I don't know. This is my real father...

159
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,456
...and I want things to be,
like, just right.

160
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,333
I completely understand.

161
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,252
Whatever you need.

162
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,129
Hey, you want to go home?

163
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,091
Okay, thanks. Sorry, again.

164
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:54,196
What was that?

165
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,369
I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

166
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,084
I want to buy five shares of SGJ.
Now.

167
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,795
Come on, time is money, my friend!

168
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,673
Thank you!

169
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,842
"Time is money, my friend?"

170
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,219
You missed
"Takes money to make money"...

171
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:21,807
...and "Don't make me come down there
and kick your Wall Street butt."

172
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,394
I made $ 17 before breakfast.
What have you done?

173
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:30,482
I had breakfast here,
so technically I saved $3.50.

174
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,150
How did you make $ 17?

175
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,695
Well, my financially
challenged friends...

176
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,949
...I split my money and I bought
some shares of CHP and ZXY.

177
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,409
How come those?

178
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:46,039
Well, CHP because I used to have a
crush on Erik Estrada.

179
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,461
And ZXY because I think
it sounds "zexy".

180
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,671
What happened to MEG?

181
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,340
MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

182
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:59,845
My motto is, "Get out
before they go down."

183
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:04,474
That is so not my motto.

184
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,689
How's the dog?

185
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,317
Okay. I talked to the vet.
People are so nice upstate.

186
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:18,197
He said the little fella's gonna be
okay, and I can get him tomorrow.

187
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,032
- Good.
- Thank God.

188
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,993
But he did have to have
a bunch of stitches.

189
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,581
And he said that only once in a blue
moon does a dog's ear grow back.

190
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,543
So still hoping.

191
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:37,382
Now are you going to call your dad
to let him know that his dog is okay?

192
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:41,137
I don't want to meet my father
over the phone.

193
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,930
What will I say,
"Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned."

194
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,518
"Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."

195
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,855
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

196
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:56,318
Listen, just don't say anything
about me, okay?

197
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,154
Don't...

198
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,282
...be too long with the phone.

199
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:07,288
She'll be a much better friend
once the market closes.

200
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,664
It's a woman.

201
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,751
So talk to her.

202
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,673
Hello, Mrs. Buffay.

203
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,676
I know where your dog is.

204
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:25,556
I want you to know he'll be returned
to you almost as good as new...

205
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,558
...within 24 hours.

206
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,853
Goodbye.

207
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,778
- Why the voice?
- Hard to say.

208
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,198
Your cappuccino, sir.

209
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,284
Thank you.

210
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:53,166
- This is better than the coffeehouse.
- Absolutely.

211
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,051
How come it's not mixing
with the water?

212
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,763
The package says to keep it moving.

213
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:09,934
Stir and drink, never let it settle.

214
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,730
This is ridiculous.

215
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,692
After I get back from
my niece's christening...

216
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:23,321
...I'll go to the coffeehouse with you
and we'll have a cup of coffee.

217
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:27,493
No problem. Joey's there.

218
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:36,043
I don't want to have to have Joey with
me every time I want decent coffee.

219
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,797
And I don't want to drink
cappuccino with a "k".

220
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,092
I say you and I go
and stand up to those guys.

221
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:47,304
All right, hang on
a second there, Custer.

222
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,765
Ross, have you ever
been beaten up before?

223
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,141
Yeah, sure.

224
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,020
By someone besides Monica?

225
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,104
So what?

226
00:14:56,355 --> 00:15:00,317
So we get beaten up. Maybe that's
something a man has to go through.

227
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,570
Like a rite of passage or something.

228
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,741
Couldn't we just lose
our virginities again?

229
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:12,287
Because I think actually
mine's growing back.

230
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,248
- I need $ 100.
- What?

231
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,459
Welcome home.

232
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,127
- I need $ 100.
- For what?

233
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,839
- To get back in the game.
- When did you get out?

234
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,925
I lost it all. I lost it.

235
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:29,971
I've come to terms with it,
you have to, too.

236
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,727
Look, Mon, I'm really sorry.

237
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,604
Where are we on the $ 100?

238
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,064
I don't have it.

239
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,482
But I need it!

240
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,109
Otherwise, I'll have to
take that diner job.

241
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,116
You know, with the dancing
and the costumes.

242
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:54,746
I don't want to have to wear
flame-retardant boobs.

243
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:59,084
Nobody does, honey.

244
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,754
Noodle!

245
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:07,384
Oh, my God. What the hell
happened to my dog?

246
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,718
It was an accident.

247
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:12,264
And the woman who did this
would never hurt a dog on purpose.

248
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,225
She's a vegetarian.

249
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,643
Are these stitches?

250
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:21,148
Yeah, eight of them.
That's 56 to him.

251
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,151
If it's raining, you can't
let him look up...

252
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:28,071
...because that cone
will fill up fast.

253
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,115
Thanks for bringing back
what's left of him.

254
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:33,451
- Is Frank home?
- How do you know Frank?

255
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:38,290
Just from a long time ago.
Is he here?

256
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,088
What?

257
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,048
I mean Frank Senior.

258
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,009
He went out for groceries.

259
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,761
Will he be back soon?

260
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:55,933
He left four years ago.
We're expecting him back any minute.

261
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,768
I'm gonna go.

262
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,354
I'm sorry about the dog.
Everything.

263
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,147
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,648
Hey, lady!

265
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,069
Hey, wait up!

266
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:13,784
- How do you know my dad?
- Well, I don't really.

267
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,120
Just genetically.

268
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,832
He's kind of my dad too.

269
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,668
Heavy.

270
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,255
So did he ever talk about me... Phoebe?

271
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:31,635
No, but he didn't really talk
about anything.

272
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,596
Except stilts.

273
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,350
- Stilts?
- Yeah, he loved stilts.

274
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,895
One time, I was upstairs stealing
cigarettes out of my mom's purse...

275
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,522
...and all of a sudden I look over...

276
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:49,152
...and there's Dad's head,
bobbing past the window.

277
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,447
He just had this big smile on his face
and he was waving...

278
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:57,036
...because he was happiest
when he was on his stilts.

279
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,207
I don't know what to do with that.

280
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,377
Me neither.

281
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:10,424
So are you, like, my big sister?

282
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:14,344
This is huge. You can buy me beer!

283
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,680
I'm not gonna.

284
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,642
But you know what's cool? If you had
a friend named Pete, I could say...

285
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,938
..."I know Pete.
He's friends with my brother."

286
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:27,066
- I got a friend named Mark.
- That'll work too.

287
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,984
Cool. All right.

288
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:33,989
So maybe, you know,
I could give you a call sometime.

289
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,824
We could talk or something.

290
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,368
- Yeah, that'd be okay.
- All right.

291
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,747
I'm in the book.

292
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,294
So stilts, huh?

293
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:53,508
If you want, I can show you where
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

294
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,184
We did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.

295
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:07,189
- How long does coffee take?
- Would you come on? Come on!

296
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,358
Thank you.

297
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:24,247
- There we go.
- I think we proved our point.

298
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:29,170
- You burn your mouth?
- Cannot feel my tongue.

299
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,174
Bullies! Big bullies!

300
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:39,095
Look who's here.
It's the weenies.

301
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,974
Did we not make ourselves clear
the other day?

302
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,600
That's why we're here.

303
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,395
Yes, we're standing our ground.

304
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,605
Apparently.

305
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,399
Let's do this already.

306
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,609
You got a weapon?

307
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,613
A nice watch.
I don't want to break it on your ribs.

308
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,657
All right, let's do this.

309
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:03,495
Question: If I don't care about
my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

310
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,914
- What do you mean?
- It's sharp, it's metal.

311
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:09,501
I think I can do some
serious damage with it.

312
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:13,129
No, you can't use your watch.

313
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,424
Or your keys.

314
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,092
Here's what we'll do.

315
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:20,971
We'll put all keys and watches
in the hat over there.

316
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,807
All right?

317
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,810
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

318
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,564
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

319
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,607
Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

320
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:37,154
I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.

321
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,365
Actually, I gotta show
this apartment tomorrow...

322
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:44,912
...and this no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.

323
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,040
Nothing from the neck up.

324
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,793
Or the waist down.

325
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:54,964
- Dana's ovulating.
- Really? You guys trying again?

326
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:58,259
Let me get this straight.
We're talking about the middle?

327
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,552
Come on!

328
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:05,015
You want a piece of this?
I'm standing here!

329
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:08,852
Those guys are taking our stuff!

330
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:14,567
God, that was amazing.
That was incredible.

331
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,610
- You guys kicked butt!
- Us? What about you guys?

332
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,697
You really gave it to
old Mr. Clean back there.

333
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,659
- He was a big guy.
- Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

334
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,911
I wouldn't know,
having missed everything.

335
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,205
Don't do that to yourself.

336
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:33,794
Any one of us could have tripped
over that little girl's jump rope.

337
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:38,340
So listen, guys...

338
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,384
...are we okay here?

339
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,553
We're okay.

340
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:47,099
