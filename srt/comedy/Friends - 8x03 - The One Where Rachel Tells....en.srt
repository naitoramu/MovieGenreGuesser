1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:05,422
- Are you excited about our honeymoon?
- Yeah, I am.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,513
Get it out of your system
while we're alone.

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:16,642
- We came to say goodbye.
- Have a great honeymoon.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,643
- Thanks.
- I'll go pack.

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:23,315
I already packed.
But I couldn't find your Speedo.

6
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,488
Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:34,201
I'm gonna go pack
my regular, long bathing suit.

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,247
Good, you're still here!
Have a good honeymoon.

9
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,333
Oh, thank you!

10
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,837
And I wanted you guys to know
I am telling the father today.

11
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,760
What? What? What?

12
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,807
- We know it's Ross.
- How? How do you know?

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,852
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

14
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:04,523
I wanted Ross to know first.
But I'm relieved!

15
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,568
- I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
- I know.

16
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:13,699
- Me too!
- I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

17
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:19,288
- You'll all be aunts and uncles.
- But I'm the only one related by blood.

18
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:25,544
Now that you all know, you can give
me advice on how to tell Ross.

19
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,295
What'll you say?

20
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,800
That I'm having it. And he can be
as involved as he wants.

21
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,677
That sounds good.

22
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:38,808
Yeah, but how do I start?
What's the first thing that I say?

23
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:45,355
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Hey, good luck.

24
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,858
Yeah, bye.

25
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,568
What was that about?

26
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:54,531
No harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are having a baby.

27
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,788
What? I didn't even know!
Why didn't you tell me?

28
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,041
Why am I talking like this?

29
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,628
I didn't think
you could keep it a secret.

30
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,091
I'm an excellent secret-keeper.
I've kept all our secrets.

31
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,052
- What secrets?
- No, no, Joey.

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,098
I'm not gonna tell you because
I am an excellent secret-keeper.

33
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,729
- You'll tell me later?
- You already know.

34
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,149

37
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,359
It's so romantic to send people off
on their honeymoon.

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,530
You know, they're married.
Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

39
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,869
- Maybe you and I should do something.
- All in good time, my love.

40
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:28,751
I left my guitar in their apartment.
You can let me in, right?

41
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,420
They took my key to give to you.

42
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:36,633
- What? They took mine to give to you.
- Why would they take our keys?

43
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:41,430
- Maybe they don't trust us.
- They let me keep my key last time.

44
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:46,852
When you broke the ketchup bottle
and cleaned it with Monica's towels?

45
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,604
- I washed those.
- No, you didn't.

46
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,316
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

47
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:57,237
- I really need my guitar.
- I have stuff in there too.

48
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:01,951
- What stuff?
- Monica's chicken parm. I'll fix it.

49
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:10,208
Mr. Treeger? I need to get into
Monica's apartment. It's an emergency!

50
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:15,213
Gas leak.
Oh, and bring garlic bread.

51
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,345
- Did Rachel find you?
- No, why?

52
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:26,683
- She was looking for you.
- I guess I'll catch up with her later.

53
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:33,149
- She really wanted to talk to you now.
- Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

54
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,945
- Oh, no.
- What?

55
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,907
I think I might know
what this is about.

56
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,827
Really?

57
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:51,500
Yeah. We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody this...

58
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,420
...but a month ago,
Rachel and I slept together.

59
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,090
And?

60
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:07,557
- Wow, I thought you'd be more shocked.
- Oh, sorry. And?!

61
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:15,900
Well, we said we'd just
do it that one time...

62
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,861
...but now I think she may
wanna start things up again.

63
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,532
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

64
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:29,037
- Why? What else could it be?
- Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

65
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,418
I'm telling you,
that's what it is.

66
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,421
No wonder she was looking
at me funny at the wedding.

67
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,175
She didn't say anything to you?

68
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,428
Maybe it's something you ate.

69
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:49,266
- Please, just go and talk to Rachel.
- Yeah, I guess I should.

70
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,604
You know what I have to realize?

71
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:58,859
I'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.

72
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,906
They always seem to want
a little bit more.

73
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,452
I should remember that.

74
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,713
Next.

75
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,801
- They're kissing, let's go around.
- They're in love.

76
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,387
I'm in love too.
But in an orderly fashion.

77
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:33,310
- Next.
- Hi. Can you do that and walk?

78
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,981
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.

79
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:44,238
Let me see what I can do.
There are some first class seats.

80
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:50,202
They bumped them up to first class!
Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.

81
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,871
We are on our honeymoon.

82
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,916
- Grab my ass.
- Next.

83
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:02,505
Sorry, I almost didn't hear you.
I'm so in love with my new husband.

84
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,675
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Congratulations.

85
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:11,014
Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

86
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:15,853
We're on our honeymoon, so can you
bump us up to first class?

87
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,732
I'm sorry, that couple
got the last two seats.

88
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,696
If we'd gone around them like I said,
she'd have given us those tickets!

89
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:30,200
25J and K, any chance
those aren't together?

90
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:34,705
They took my key.
You trust me with yours.

91
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,874
Of course, and I'll give it back...

92
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,878
...when they're done
at the key shining place.

93
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,426
What the hell is that?

94
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:52,139
- What are you doing?
- You said there was a gas leak.

95
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:57,227
- Why don't you use your key?
- I won't find it before it explodes.

96
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:03,316
If that happens at another building
I manage, people will ask questions.

97
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,780
We could have done that.

98
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,286
They're going into
the first class lounge.

99
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,705
- You know what's in there?
- No.

100
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,499
Me neither. We have to get in!

101
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,838
- Just act like you belong.
- Oh, my God! Oranges!

102
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,928
- Nice to see you again.
- May I see your tickets, please?

103
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,805
Yes, of course.

104
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,518
I can't see the seat number.

105
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:41,563
That's all right.
I have it memorized. It's 1 A.

106
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:47,403
- This isn't first class, sorry.
- Apology accepted.

107
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:52,366
Sir, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

108
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,576
Fine.

109
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:58,622
Go, go, go!

110
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,266
I think there's something that
we really need to talk about.

111
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:23,856
I think we do.
Why don't we go inside?

112
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:33,073
- Look, I know why you're here.
- You do?

113
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:40,121
Yeah, and to save you from any
embarrassment, I should talk first.

114
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:56,597
Ross and Rachel.
Rachel and Ross.

115
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:01,602
It's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?

116
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,645
What?

117
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:10,569
I mean, look, that one night we had
was fun and certainly passionate.

118
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:15,782
But don't you think it's better
if we just stay friends?

119
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,577
Seriously, what?

120
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,331
Okay, okay. You know what?

121
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,920
If you want to,
we can do it one more time.

122
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:35,845
I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now.

123
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,391
- You know what? Can I talk now?
- Oh, sure.

124
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,732
I'm pregnant.

125
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,571
Ross?

126
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,827
Ross?

127
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,414
Okay, whenever you're ready.

128
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:15,008
And you're the father, by the way.

129
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:31,107
- Can I get you some water?
- I'm good, I'm good.

130
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:37,739
Ross, there is no pressure on you.
You can be as involved as you want.

131
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:47,541
Yeah, I... I'm just, I don't know.
I don't understand...

132
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,504
...how this happened.

133
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,925
- We used a condom.
- I know.

134
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:02,181
But you know, condoms only work,
like, 97%"%" of the time.

135
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,641
What? What?

136
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,603
What?!

137
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:13,275
Well, they should put that on the box!

138
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:19,532
- They do.
- No, they don't!

139
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:28,374
Well, they should put it
in huge block letters!

140
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:34,213
- Let's just forget about the condoms.
- Well, I may as well have!

141
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:42,429
- I was really freaked out too when...
- Freaked out? I'm not freaked out.

142
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,225
I'm indignant as a consumer!

143
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,313
- You know what? Let's talk later.
- No, I wanna talk now.

144
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:58,362
In fact, I wanna talk to
the president of the condom company.

145
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,573
Okay, maybe I should come back...

146
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,118
Yeah, I'll press one!

147
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:14,253
- I looked everywhere. No gas leak.
- So now I can heat this up?

148
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,047
I'll get moving on that door.

149
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:22,219
Great. Could you not tell
Chandler and Monica about this?

150
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,889
They don't have any kids
of their own...

151
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,560
...and this door was
like a child to them.

152
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,648
I have to put in a new lock.
They'll find out anyway.

153
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:40,654
This looks like an all-day job.
I'll have to cancel my yoga class.

154
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:44,325
Could you tell Jasmine
I can't make it to yoga?

155
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,661
- Sure.
<i>- Namaste.</i>

156
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,377
- What happened to the door?
- So it's noticeable?

157
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,173
- Is Rachel here?
- Didn't you two already talk?

158
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,633
Yeah, but...

159
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:07,889
You guys know Rachel and I slept
together, but there's something else.

160
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,976
Rachel's pregnant.

161
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,605
- Holy mother of God!
- I can't believe it!

162
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:22,488
- With my child.
- That is brand-new information!

163
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,828
- You already know, don't you?
- A little bit.

164
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,790
- How you doing?
- Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

165
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,460
I didn't handle it well.

166
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,795
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

167
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:43,759
But the complaint department
at the condom company got an earful.

168
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,970
Then when I turned around,
she was gone.

169
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:52,810
But in my defense, I found out
that condoms are only 97%"%" effective.

170
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,687
- What?
- I gotta go find her.

171
00:14:55,896 --> 00:15:02,528
Hold on! Are you serious? So, like,
3%"%" of the time they don't even work?

172
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:07,283
They should put that on the box!

173
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,202
- Evidently, they do.
- What?!

174
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:22,840
- I can't believe we're here.
- You've gotta be kidding.

175
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,717
What?

176
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:30,347
As a wedding gift, we're
giving you the Honeymoon Suite.

177
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:34,018
No! You have been screwing us all day!

178
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,313
- Who are you?
- We're you. Just 10 seconds later!

179
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,861
You got first class, the lounge.
We need free stuff!

180
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,156
You're not the only ones
on your honeymoon!

181
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:52,620
You can have the suite.
We don't care where we stay.

182
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:59,668
We're here to celebrate our love.
We just want to be together.

183
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,090
We need the stuff.

184
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:11,097
Hey, it's Joey. We smell gas
from your apartment.

185
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:16,393
- Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
- What else is new?

186
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:21,398
- We'd check it, but you took our keys.
- Do something. Get in!

187
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:25,986
- How? I could break down your door.
"- Yeah", "do that."

188
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:30,323
- You won't blame us for any damage?
<i>- No.</i>

189
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:36,121
- Are you doing it? I can't hear.
- Okay, I'll break it down.

190
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,046
He's doing it,
he's breaking down the door.

191
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,927
Okay, we're in.

192
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:58,185
- Rachel, are you comfortable?
- Lf I said I was, would you judge me?

193
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,856
The doctor'll be here in a minute
to do your sonogram.

194
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,781
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold
these at Pottery Barn...

195
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,952
We need to talk.

196
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:21,416
Right now? I kind of got an alfresco
situation going on over here.

197
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,587
I want to apologize
for the way I acted earlier.

198
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:29,550
- Can you stay up near my head?
- Yeah, sorry.

199
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:35,472
I went crazy. I was thinking about me,
and I should've thought of you...

200
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,933
- Head, Ross! Head!
- Right.

201
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:42,646
I want you to know that I'll be
there through this whole thing.

202
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:47,943
Doctor's appointments, Lamaze classes,
baby-proofing the apartment.

203
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,696
- We can do that after we get married.
- Married?

204
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,573
We should get married.

205
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:57,703
Because that's your answer
to everything?

206
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,707
No, it's the right thing to do.

207
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:07,504
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
But we are not in love, are we?

208
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:13,302
No, but still, I mean,
you can't possibly do this alone.

209
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,012
Excuse me?

210
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,975
Come on, you can't even eat alone
in a restaurant.

211
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:24,814
- What?
- How can you have a baby by yourself?

212
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:28,567
- I can too eat by myself!
- When have you ever?

213
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:33,405
When certain people leave the table
and I am not finished!

214
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:37,076
Certain others take two hours
to eat soup!

215
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,536
Please, you inhale your food.

216
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:44,416
I grew up with Monica. If you
didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

217
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,462
Am I interrupting?

218
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:52,257
No, Dr. Long, come in.
This is Ross, the father.

219
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:56,512
But not the husband,
because she can do this alone.

220
00:18:56,762 --> 00:19:00,891
Nice to meet you.
I'll get started on this.

221
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:07,981
- Why can't you admit you need me?
- I need you to stay near my head!

222
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:14,487
Okay. Everything looks good.
Here it is on the screen.

223
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,532
There's your uterus...

224
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:21,787
...and right here is your baby.

225
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,916
Oh, my God.

226
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,797
Wow! There it is, I see it.

227
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,967
Congratulations.
I'll give you two a minute.

228
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,303
Thank you.

229
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,646
Pretty amazing, huh?

230
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,149
I don't see it!

231
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:02,661
- What? What?
- I can't see it.

232
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:06,206
- You just said you did.
- I know, I lied.

233
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:10,460
I didn't want her to think
I was a terrible mother.

234
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:16,633
Come here. Sure you can.
Come here. Look, it's right there.

235
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,142
Oh, it's beautiful.

236
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,270
I see it now.

237
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,315
- Do you really?
- No, I don't see it!

238
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:35,194
Come on. All right. Okay. Okay.

239
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:41,408
You see this tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?

240
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,746
Sweetie, that's it.

241
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:51,001
That's it? Well, I saw that.

242
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:59,343
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

243
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:07,267
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

244
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:13,107
Yeah, that's our baby.

245
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:26,078
- So how was the doctor?
- It went great.

246
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:30,081
- Good.
- Show them the picture of your uterus.

247
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:37,506
I don't see the baby.

248
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:42,302
I couldn't see it either
at first. But it's right...

249
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:46,264
Ross, I lost it again.

250
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:53,314
