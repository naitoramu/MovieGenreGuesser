1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,838
So what is this?

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,382
Googlie Worm.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:08,717
And this?

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,636
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:15,682
It's so funny!

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,559
What's this?

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,937
A hunk of sandwich from last year.

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:25,859
Geller's got one hooked!
Looks like a big one!

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,405
It's the classic struggle
between man...

10
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:35,077
Someone knocked over a lamp.

11
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,205
You know what'll be great
about the fishing trip?

12
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,125
When my Dad asks, "What are you
doing with your life?"...

13
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,629
...I can say, "I'm doing a movie
with Charlton Heston."

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,882
"What about you?"

15
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,888
Don't stop having fun
just because I'm here.

16
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,100
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.

17
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:03,063
Well, except you.

18
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:14,992
You shouldn't leave Chandler alone.
They broke up only two days ago.

19
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,994
Go fishing next week.

20
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,913
There's nothing I can do.
He's still in his sweats.

21
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,708
That's only phase one.

22
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,171
I'll be back for phase two.
I'd never miss that.

23
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,464
Phase two?

24
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:32,635
Getting drunk
and going to a strip club.

25
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,304
How does going there
make him better?

26
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,973
There are naked ladies there.

27
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,976
Then to phase three:
Seeing yourself with other women.

28
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:45,188
There are naked ladies there too.

29
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,985
Would you give me one minute, please?

30
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,363
The One with Joey's Dirty Day

31
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,956
These match the jacket
you picked out last week?

32
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,875
There we go.

33
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,544
There it is.

34
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,839
You know what I need?
Gloves.

35
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,550
Brown leather dress gloves.

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,635
Well, let's see...

37
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,220
This one is large.

38
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,430
And this one...

39
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,933
Also a large?

40
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,937
Two larges coming right up.

41
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,232
Could I have a moment?

42
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,777
My niece, you see,
is in town from London.

43
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,654
Shropshire, but you know.

44
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,948
She's about your age, I'd say.

45
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,035
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.
<i>Die Fledermaus.</i>

46
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,663
Would you like to keep her
company tonight?

47
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,415
Sure. You got it!

48
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,626
Count me in. Me.
"Fledermaus." Great!

49
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:34,256
Yes, of course.
Thank you so very much.

50
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,342
So?

51
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,518
- Gloves?
- Sorry, I'll be right back.

52
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,895
Actually, I got to take off.

53
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,358
I was curious.
Do you have plans tonight?

54
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,193
No, nothing!

55
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:57,363
I invested in a nightclub.
It opens tonight. Want to come?

56
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,532
That would be great!

57
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,868
You're into hard-core S and M, right?

58
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,370
Well, I guess.

59
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,666
I'm kidding.

60
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,544
I'll put you on the V.I.P. List.
Look for me.

61
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,795
Great! You bet.

62
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:17,216
I'll see you tonight.

63
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,677
- I almost forgot the tickets.
- What?

64
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:25,266
For you and Emily. Tonight.
<i>Die Fledermaus.</i>

65
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,475
Oh, right.

66
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:31,605
You'll like it.
It has two out of the three tenors.

67
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,446
I can't believe
Kathy did this to me.

68
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,073
I really thought she was the one.

69
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,450
I'll tell you what.

70
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,328
I'm not getting out
of this chair. Ever!

71
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,456
From now on, this chair is the one!

72
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,043
You know what else is the one?
My sweatpants.

73
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,379
Just take the sweats off, okay?

74
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,551
Take them off
and we'll have some fun.

75
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,015
Did you catch any fish?

76
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,184
You guys have no idea.

77
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,061
- You stink!
- Are you kidding?

78
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:17,776
Three days without a shower.
Plus, I fell in a big tub of worms!

79
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,486
How's he doing?

80
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,197
He hasn't left
that chair in two days.

81
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:26,034
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

82
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,292
You see? He just needed
his pal to come home.

83
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,461
I got to memorize my lines.

84
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:40,966
Me and Charlton Heston,
bright and early tomorrow, baby!

85
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,348
What's the matter?

86
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:52,436
Joshua invited me to this
fancy club opening tonight.

87
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,730
But I already told Mr. Waltham...

88
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,526
...that I would take his niece
to the dumb old opera.

89
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,154
So what are you going to do?

90
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,782
- I don't know.
- No! Help me!

91
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,619
- I can't. I have to work.
- Phoebe?

92
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,373
I would, but I get
my morning sickness in the evening.

93
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:16,669
Unless she wants to spend the night
holding my hair back for me.

94
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,588
You guys, come on!
I have to meet Joshua.

95
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,466
It's my chance for him
to see the "fun" Rachel.

96
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:28,222
The "wouldn't it be great
if she were my wife?" Rachel.

97
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,474
Are Joey and Chandler back?

98
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:36,563
Chandler's still in phase one,
and Joey's that thing you smell.

99
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,284
So...

100
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,040
Come on!

101
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,625
- She's here.
- Wait, wait.

102
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,794
Ross, please?

103
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,881
You want me to take some girl
I've never met to the opera...

104
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,093
...so you can go to a club
and flirt with some guy?

105
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,555
That is a toughie.

106
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,641
She's looking down the hall.

107
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,935
She looked right at me.

108
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,898
You can't see people
through that hole, can you?

109
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,365
I'll be right there!
Okay, Ross, please.

110
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,116
I thought we had moved on.

111
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,244
I thought we could be happy
for each other.

112
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,706
I mean, was that just me?

113
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,124
All right, I'll do it.

114
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,168
Thank you, thank you.

115
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,338
Emily.

116
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,798
I'm Rachel.

117
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,590
Thank goodness!

118
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,720
There's been a teeny change of plans.
I'm not free tonight...

119
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,097
Really?

120
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:56,518
I must've missed your call, though
I didn't leave the flat all day.

121
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,811
Well, I...

122
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,730
That's not rude.
It's in keeping with the trip...

123
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,651
...where I've been run down
by one of your wiener carts...

124
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,530
...and been strip-searched
at the airport.

125
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:14,327
Apparently, I look like someone who's
got cocaine stuffed up their bum.

126
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,665
I think you look great.

127
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:23,129
Good night.
It was very nice to meet you.

128
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,090
I'll get her.

129
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,594
Please, hurry.

130
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:34,973
Don't you just love
the way they talk?

131
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,985
- What?
- The baby kicked!

132
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:52,282
No, wait. The elastic
in my underwear busted.

133
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,702
Oh, my God! I overslept!

134
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,247
I was supposed to be
on the set half an hour ago!

135
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,749
You can't go like that!
You stink!

136
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,793
I fell asleep.
Now I don't have time!

137
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,380
Just 10 blocks away.
If I run, I'll make it.

138
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,633
Run 10 blocks.
That'll help the smell.

139
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,594
Slow down!
No, keep moving.

140
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,764
How did it go last night?

141
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,891
Well, I didn't see Joshua.

142
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,977
But I did punch a girl in the face.

143
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,897
The whole night was horrible.
It was pouring.

144
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,943
There was no Rachel Greene on the list.
But there was a Rachel Greep.

145
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:33,365
So did you get to meet her?

146
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,703
There is no Rachel Greep.
But this girl overheard us.

147
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,290
And she said, "I'm Rachel Greep!"
And he let her in.

148
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,875
So you hit her?

149
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,501
No, she was already in.

150
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,629
This big bitch behind me
tried to steal my umbrella...

151
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,800
...so I clocked her.

152
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,510
All I wanted was a few hours...

153
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,680
...outside of work to see Joshua...

154
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:02,144
...so he could go ahead and
start falling in love with me.

155
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,523
Pheebs.

156
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,818
Honey, that's your name.

157
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:15,740
That's short for Phoebe? I thought
that's what we called each other.

158
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,369
- You're wearing pants!
- That's right.

159
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,749
Where are the guys? I'm ready
to get drunk and see strippers.

160
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,042
It's 9:30 a.m.

161
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,837
They got a breakfast buffet.

162
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,674
Let me talk to him!

163
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,219
- Oh, my God!
- Can't I just...

164
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,721
- It's my phone and she's shush...
- Please!

165
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,639
What's he saying?

166
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,142
He's with Emily in Vermont.

167
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,102
What? Oh, my God!

168
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,106
Who's Emily?

169
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:54,613
They're in Vermont?
How did this happen?

170
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,866
How'd he end up in Vermont
with that witch?

171
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,745
Maybe she doesn't hit him
all the time.

172
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:02,871
<i>When we met her...</i>

173
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,958
...she was soaking, her feet were wet.
Who wouldn't be miserable?

174
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,463
With a dry pair of shoes,
she was a totally different person.

175
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:15,050
There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard!

176
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,764
I got to go! There's a deer
eating fruit from the orchard!

177
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:27,020
He had to go. There was a deer
eating fruit from the orchard.

178
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,231
I don't get this.
She was horrible!

179
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,068
I'm going to go stand over there.

180
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,237
Why do you care?

181
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,448
I don't care.

182
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,994
I'm just upset that
I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.

183
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:46,248
You do not just meet someone
and go flitting off to Vermont!

184
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,918
When you first met Barry,
you flitted off to Vail.

185
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,338
Could you, just for once...

186
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:57,051
...not remember every little thing?

187
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,179
So you know, when's he getting back?

188
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,472
A couple of days.

189
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,225
I knew something
like this would happen.

190
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,519
What are you doing?

191
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,896
You can't go back a phase!

192
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:14,985
You're thinking about time.
You can't go back in time.

193
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:19,906
Why don't you do your phase two
strip club thing with us?

194
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,784
We can be guys!

195
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,328
No, you can't.

196
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,247
Let us be guys!
Maybe we want to be guys.

197
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:32,252
No, you don't. You'd be all
hairy and wouldn't live as long.

198
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:36,799
Would you just stop being
such a wuss and get those off?

199
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:41,470
And come with us
and watch naked girls dance!

200
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,934
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,190
Joey Tribbianni.
I'm here.

202
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,945
Calm down, we got time.
We're running late.

203
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:07,830
Look at that.
Charlton Heston eating licorice.

204
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,460
Yeah, he loves them.
I've never seen him with...

205
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,882
What the hell is that?
What smells so bad?

206
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,051
You.

207
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:26,097
I could see why you would think that.
But you know who it is?

208
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,641
You?

209
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,603
No, no. It's Heston.

210
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,521
What?

211
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:38,735
He reeks like he went on a three-day
fishing trip, then ate licorice.

212
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:43,324
No way. He's the only one
with a shower in his dressing room.

213
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,326
Really? A shower?

214
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,079
Which room might that be?

215
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,832
The one with "Heston" on it.

216
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,502
Interesting.

217
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,476
I got some ones.
You want to put them in her panties?

218
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:14,480
No, thanks, Mom!

219
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,941
That.

220
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,861
You have to put that out
because I'm pregnant.

221
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:25,490
Maybe you and your baby
ought to go to another strip club.

222
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:29,453
It's not my baby.

223
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,957
Very good.

224
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,795
Really good. I enjoyed it.
Very exotic.

225
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,258
I just checked our messages
and Joshua didn't call.

226
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,928
You'd think he'd be worried
about me not showing up.

227
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,971
You know what makes it worse?

228
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,725
Ross is all happy in Vermont.

229
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:55,145
Come on, look where you are!

230
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,189
Another round.

231
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,066
Virgin for me.

232
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,569
Don't let me leave without
the name of that carpet guy.

233
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,030
Come on!

234
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,241
You know what?
I'll go home and call Kathy.

235
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,868
If it'll help.

236
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,954
That was a test.
In a few hours, I'll be drunk.

237
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,624
I'll want to call her.
You'll have to stop me.

238
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,585
Then I'll be so drunk,
I'll want to call Janice.

239
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:22,048
You should! How is she?

240
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:27,260
I think somebody needs
another lap dance.

241
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:46,655
Who's in there?

242
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,536
How you doing?

243
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,955
Who in the hell are you?

244
00:15:55,205 --> 00:16:00,001
Would you believe me
if I said I was Kirk Douglas?

245
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:04,256
Put some pants on, kid,
so I can kick your butt.

246
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,634
No, wait. You don't understand.

247
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,513
I'm an actor.

248
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,723
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm doing a scene with you today.

249
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,018
And I stink!

250
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,145
You're in this picture?

251
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:22,024
I'm a cop who won't work with you
because you're a loose cannon.

252
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,942
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

253
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,612
But I stink.

254
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:30,449
Joey, right?

255
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,415
Every actor, one time or another...

256
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,751
Every actor thinks he stinks.

257
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,463
Even Laurence Olivier
sometimes thought he stank.

258
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,132
Bob Redford won't even watch himself.

259
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,341
You don't understand.

260
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,720
Listen to me.

261
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,514
I don't know one actor
worth his salt...

262
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:58,560
...who, one time in his career,
didn't say, "God, I stink!"

263
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,816
I just did a scene out there.
First take, I stunk the place up.

264
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,903
The important thing,
and you must remember...

265
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:12,074
...no matter how badly
you think you stink...

266
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:18,080
...you must never, ever bust into
my dressing room and use my shower!

267
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,915
Do you understand me?

268
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,251
- Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
- Wait a minute!

269
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:26,964
Take your pants.

270
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,384
We did okay
at the strip club, right?

271
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:35,222
Great. Thanks to you,
the hottest waitress is quitting...

272
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,183
...to teach the third grade!

273
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,226
He still hasn't called.

274
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,436
Who, Josh?

275
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:42,688
It's Joshua.

276
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:46,859
- He doesn't like "Josh"?
- No, I don't.

277
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,319
I'm going to put my sweats back on.

278
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,155
You know what?
You were right.

279
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,325
We weren't great at being guys.
You know why?

280
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:58,245
Because we're girls.

281
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,913
You know what girls are good at?

282
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,957
Stripping!

283
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,877
No, listening!

284
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,545
Sit.

285
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:11,550
Maybe it would really, really help
if you would just talk.

286
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,263
Yeah, come on.
What's going on in there?

287
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:21,894
And you know, if you want to cry,
that's okay too.

288
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:26,398
I'm going to have
to ask you all to leave.

289
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:30,861
Forget it. We tried,
but phase three is a lost cause.

290
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:37,242
Those strippers were hot, and I
couldn't picture myself with them.

291
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,788
They really were pretty,
weren't they?

292
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,458
- I liked that fighter pilot one.
- Candy?

293
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,462
She was so spunky!

294
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:52,883
I think if I were going
to be with a woman...

295
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,512
...it'd be with someone
like Michelle.

296
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:59,098
She was just so petite.

297
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:03,227
For me, it would have to be Chantal.

298
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,814
She had the smoothest skin.

299
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,819
When I stuck that dollar in
her G-string and grazed her thigh...

300
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:17,199
Phase three!
I just achieved phase three!

301
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:21,328
I am totally picturing you
with all those women!

302
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,954
That's not phase three.

303
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:26,625
Well, I'm there too!

304
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,585
Are we all together in a group?

305
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,005
Stop it, you're killing me!

306
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,090
I think I moved on to phase four!

307
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,008
What is that?

308
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,178
I don't want a relationship ever!

309
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:42,098
I just want sex
with strippers and my friends!

310
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,768
Come on.

311
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,020
Let me see that smile.

312
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,064
I don't want to.

313
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,816
Please?

314
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,944
I wanted to go to the strip club!

315
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,904
You'll have plenty of chances.

316
00:19:56,154 --> 00:20:01,159
There are thousands of women out there,
just waiting to screw me over.

317
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,622
Yeah, all right.

318
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,666
How was Vermont?

319
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,127
Emily is...

320
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:14,047
...incredible. There are
no words to describe her.

321
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:19,136
The whole weekend was like a dream.

322
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:22,014
And you! Rach!

323
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,724
You were so right.

324
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:24,933
What?

325
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:28,437
What you said about us
finally being in a place...

326
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,441
...where we could really
be happy for each other.

327
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,986
I admit, I wasn't quite there.

328
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,197
The thought of you
and that Josh guy...

329
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,450
Joshua.

330
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,537
- Joshua guy at that club,
dancing, having a good time.

331
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,415
And the thought of it kind of...

332
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,625
You know? But now!

333
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,670
But now, I'm totally there.

334
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,048
I'm finally where you are.

335
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,510
Thank goodness!

336
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,636
And thank you for Emily.

337
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:05,224
No problem.
I'm so glad I could help, you know?

338
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,101
I'm happy for you.

339
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,311
Happy for you.

340
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:13,023
Oh no, happy for you.

341
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,779
All right. Here's what we'll do.

342
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,532
You are going to take off
my clothes.

343
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,742
You two, go get the oils.

344
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,119
And you, just constantly scream...

345
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,248
..."Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king!"

346
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,500
I want to be with her.
I like her.

347
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,670
That's fine.
Go with your instincts!

348
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,255
What am I doing again?

349
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:39,216
Pay attention.
I could wake up at any moment.

350
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,969
I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.

351
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,680
That's not Joshua.

352
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,016
What do you want from me?
I never met the guy.

353
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:50,060
I'm sorry you can't stay.

354
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:55,148
The rest of us
have a lot of work to do.

355
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,570
What are you doing?

356
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,490
All right, listen.
I got to wake up.
