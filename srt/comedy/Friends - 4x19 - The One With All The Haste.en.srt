1
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:11,512
<i>Morning's here</i>

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,056
<i>The morning's here</i>

3
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,725
<i>Sunshine is here</i>

4
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,393
<i>The sky is clear</i>

5
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,896
<i>The morning's here</i>

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,399
<i>The morning's here</i>

7
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,987
Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!

8
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,573
Oh, come on!

9
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,034
Morning's here!

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,090
I hate this apartment!

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,762
I hate this wall color!
I hate that it still smells like bird!

12
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,097
I hate that singing guy!

13
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,601
Are you kidding? I love that guy!

14
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,314
<i>Morning's here</i>

15
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,317
Stop it!

16
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,194
I will kill you.

17
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,781
I hate that my room is so small.

18
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,700
I have all the space I need.
Do what I did.

19
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:21,331
You don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!

20
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,001
I am tired of your bellyaching.

21
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,755
I've worked hard to make this
a nice place for us.

22
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,798
I know.
I'm so sorry.

23
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,841
I'm sorry, okay?

24
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,343
It's a great apartment!

25
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,014
Shut up!
This place is a hole!

26
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,309
The One with All the Haste

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,196
I still can't believe
you've got an earring!

28
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:39,117
I know, I know.
Who am I? David Bowie?

29
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,910
He does that?

30
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,455
I don't know. Whatever.

31
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,374
I think it makes you look
really dangerous.

32
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,253
Oh, I know.

33
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,629
You know what?

34
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,716
I never would've gotten this
if it weren't for you.

35
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,303
When I'm with you, I'm like...

36
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,347
...this whole other guy.
I love that guy!

37
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,641
I mean, I love you too.
A lot.

38
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,018
But that guy!

39
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,562
I love that guy!

40
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,149
I love both of you.

41
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,444
I wish I didn't have to go.

42
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,905
Then don't.

43
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,782
Stay here.
Don't go so soon to London.

44
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,534
Just one more day.

45
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,245
Please don't do this to me again.

46
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:27,582
I'd stay, but I've already missed
so much work. They'll fire me.

47
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,587
So? Then you could stay
as long as you want.

48
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,797
I wish I could.

49
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,634
Oh, no. Don't start packing.

50
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,471
Come on!

51
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,642
I don't think you understand packing.

52
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:50,981
I don't want to leave it till last.
Last time, I left my knickers here.

53
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,526
Yeah, I know.
I tried them on.

54
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,111
You didn't!

55
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,365
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy".

56
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:14,713
Excuse me?

57
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,548
Your pants.

58
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,883
Oh yeah! You like them?

59
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,512
I went to a used-clothes store
and got maternity stuff.

60
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,725
These are so comfortable.

61
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:33,231
Pheebs, those are Santa pants.

62
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,651
Santa pants.

63
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,946
Santa Claus' pants.

64
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,532
No. They're maternity pants.

65
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,202
They even came with
a list of baby names. See?

66
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,665
These names are good,
and these are bad.

67
00:04:56,672 --> 00:05:00,176
So, how are the elves?

68
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:05,181
I don't know.
How are the... you know?

69
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,477
Your clothes aren't funny.

70
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,521
What should I wear to a Knicks game?

71
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,858
A T-shirt that says,
"I Don't Belong Here"?

72
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,611
You have tickets?

73
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:23,032
Mom got Dad's season tickets in
the divorce, so she gave them to me.

74
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,451
Apparently, they're good seats.

75
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,037
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!

76
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,372
Do you guys want these?

77
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,916
Yeah, we do!

78
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,169
Well, you got them!

79
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,298
Just give us our apartment back.

80
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:44,387
Oh, I didn't see that coming.

81
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,720
Are you serious?

82
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,683
Come on.
We know what these are worth.

83
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,060
Do you think we're stupid?

84
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:56,106
Not stupid.
You're meaner than I thought.

85
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,274
What do you say?

86
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:02,112
Forget it. I'm not giving up my
bachelor pad for basketball seats.

87
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,656
Your "bachelor pad"?

88
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:08,452
Have you even had a girl here?

89
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,830
No.

90
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,877
But Joey has, and I usually
talk to them in the morning.

91
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,839
Yeah, you do!

92
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:26,846
Come on!

93
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,473
Gunther, can I get
two cups of chino, please?

94
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,976
Good one.

95
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,770
Come on.
Season tickets!

96
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,147
Season tickets!
You know what that means?

97
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,858
I'm not giving up the apartment.

98
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,321
When I was a kid, my dad's company
gave season tickets...

99
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,617
...to the No. 1 salesman
every year. My dad never won.

100
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:53,830
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
But still, I never forgot that!

101
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,917
Hey guys!

102
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,795
Oh, my God!

103
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,215
We don't make enough
fun of you already?

104
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,259
Oh, yeah.
Emily convinced me to do it.

105
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,889
You do know that Wham broke up?

106
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,188
I like it. Emily likes it.
That's what counts.

107
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,814
So, how are you guys doing?

108
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:24,319
Don't try and talk all normal
with that thing in your ear.

109
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,238
Where's Emily?

110
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,281
She's saying goodbye
to her uncle.

111
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:32,161
Didn't she, like, just get here?

112
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,954
Easy, tiger.

113
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,997
I just hate this so much.

114
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:40,127
Every time I go pick her up at
the airport, it's so great.

115
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:45,299
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back
in a couple of days, dropping her off."

116
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,968
- So what'll you do?
- There's nothing to do.

117
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,011
She lives there.
I live here.

118
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,639
She'd have to move here.

119
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,226
She should move here.

120
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,518
What?

121
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,229
- I can ask her to live with me.
- Are you serious?

122
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,691
- I mean, why not?
- You've only known her six weeks!

123
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:07,863
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge
I've had a longer relationship with.

124
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,366
Look, guys, when I'm with her,
it's like...

125
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:14,995
She brings out this great side of me.

126
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,706
I mean, I love her, you know?

127
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,542
And I love the milk!

128
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:25,588
But I won't ask some British girl
to move in with me.

129
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:32,179
Joey, you say things now.

130
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,182
Look, Ross. He's right.
Emily's great.

131
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,350
She's great!

132
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,020
But this is too soon.
You'll only scare her.

133
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,605
I don't want to do that.

134
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,192
You don't want to wreck it.
Don't go too fast.

135
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,736
No. You're right.
I know, you're right.

136
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,697
I'm not going to do it.

137
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,492
- Thanks guys.
- No problem.

138
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:58,080
Just remember to wake us up
before you go-go.

139
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,218
It's too hard. Too hard!

140
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,762
All right.
Last chance for the tickets.

141
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:19,142
Otherwise, I give them to my
new boyfriend, Joshua.

142
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,936
No, thank you.

143
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,356
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!
Let's trade.

144
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:29,152
The timing's perfect!
I just clogged the toilet!

145
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:34,032
I want those seats. But we can't live
in the small apartment...

146
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:38,788
...after living here!
Ever read "Flowers for Algernon"?

147
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,791
Ever read "Sports Illustrated"?

148
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,127
No, I didn't read yours!

149
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,045
We can go to the game tonight!

150
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,507
The only way I'll consider this is...

151
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,217
...if they offer more
than just season seats.

152
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,259
It's the Knicks!

153
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,430
Screw the Knicks!

154
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,687
I didn't mean that.
I just meant that...

155
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:07,482
...the apartment is worth
so much more.

156
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,069
And the Knicks rule.

157
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,240
Yeah, the Knicks rule!

158
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,117
So? Are you going to do it?

159
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,495
No, we're not going to
because it's not an even trade.

160
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:21,705
All right, look.

161
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,000
What if you could keep the apartment
and the tickets?

162
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,835
Done!

163
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,380
Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.
Winner takes all.

164
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,799
We could get nothing.

165
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,300
Or everything.

166
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,511
I like that.

167
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,388
What do you say?

168
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,598
Just do it!

169
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,934
Oh! I'm convinced!

170
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,647
Come on, man!
You know I'd do it for you.

171
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,900
Because you're my best friend.

172
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,321
All right. But you can't
use that again for a whole year.

173
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,239
I'm in.

174
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,576
This is so exciting!
What are you going to bet?

175
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,911
We should let Phoebe decide...

176
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:07,751
...because she's the only one
who's impartial, and she's so pretty.

177
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,839
I have a game!

178
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,592
- This is great!
- What's the game?

179
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:19,430
It doesn't have a name.
No, okay. Phoebe Ball!

180
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:23,392
No, it doesn't have a name.

181
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,065
What is your favorite thing
about trees?

182
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:34,528
- They're green?
- Good! Five points!

183
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,995
Same question.

184
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:48,542
- They're tall.
- Three points!

185
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:55,674
Both fine answers, but we were
looking for leafy. Leafy.

186
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,759
That's not even a game.

187
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,639
Shut up. We're winning!

188
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,392
You want to finish this?
We get a deck of cards.

189
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,309
High card wins.
What do you say?

190
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,771
- Let's do it!
- Oh, I have cards!

191
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,481
Yeah. Here.

192
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,525
No, these are the trick deck.

193
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,610
Here, yes.

194
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:19,698
Okay, you guys pick first.

195
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,955
- Four.
- That's a low one!

196
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,292
You look.
I can't do it.

197
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,046
What makes you think I can?

198
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,799
Ace!

199
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,095
Why are you hugging?

200
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,888
We won our apartment back!

201
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,350
What? Ace is high!
Jack, queen, king, ace!

202
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,854
No! Ace is low!
Ace, two, three, four!

203
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,946
I don't know.

204
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,743
Look it!

205
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,539
Come on, pick again!

206
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,671
Come on, apartment!
Come on, apartment!

207
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,675
I know queen is high!

208
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,428
Not as high as...

209
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,890
It worked! King!

210
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,018
We pick again!
We pick again!

211
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,271
- Why?
- I don't know.

212
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,649
Tickets, please.

213
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,027
Courtside, baby!

214
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:43,949
Seriously, good game, though.
Good game.

215
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:48,203
What are they so mad about?
They got the apartment back.

216
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,289
No, they didn't.

217
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,259
Packed while you were gone.

218
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,304
I left knickers under your pillow.

219
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,932
Move in with me?

220
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:09,975
What?

221
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,896
Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,
and people will say it's too soon...

222
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:21,487
...but just think.
Think how great it would be.

223
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,699
I don't know.

224
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,701
Leaving London...

225
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,953
My whole family lives there...

226
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,915
- My job.
- You'll get a job here.

227
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:37,169
I always hear about them foreigners
stealing American jobs.

228
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,463
That could be you.

229
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,466
Yeah, but it's my whole life.

230
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,967
You come to England.

231
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,179
I would. I really would.
But my son is here.

232
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:52,935
I can't leave him.
You don't think there's any way?

233
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,937
I don't think so.

234
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:59,400
It would be different if it was
way into the future...

235
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,027
...and we were getting married.

236
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,112
What?

237
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:10,244
Right. I shouldn't have said "married".
Please don't go freaky on me.

238
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,705
I didn't mean it.
I take it back.

239
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,791
No. Don't.

240
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,585
Why don't we?

241
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,630
Why don't we what?

242
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,426
Get married.

243
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:26,635
You are mad!

244
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:31,723
No, I'm not! It's perfect.
It's better than you moving here.

245
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:35,060
It's us together forever,
and that's what I want.

246
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,771
- We've known each other six weeks!
- I know.

247
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,650
So what? Who's to say?
Does that mean we can't do it?

248
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,071
Look. I was with Carol for
four years before we got married...

249
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:51,117
...and I wound up divorced
from a pregnant lesbian.

250
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,038
I mean, this...

251
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:57,666
This makes sense for us.

252
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:02,546
Our first date, we ended up
spending the whole weekend in Vermont.

253
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:07,384
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced.
Me!

254
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,803
This feels right.

255
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,556
Doesn't it?

256
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,267
My parents will be really mad.

257
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,770
Are you saying, "Yes"?
Is that "Yes"?

258
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,398
Yes.

259
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,904
- We're getting married!
- Oh, my God!

260
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,699
We're getting married!

261
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,910
Come here, come here.

262
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,797
Emily, will you marry me?

263
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,848
It's a bit small.

264
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:58,602
Damn! I thought that'd be
romantic as hell.

265
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,148
It was.

266
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,996
Those were, like,
the best seats ever!

267
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,876
Should we give these to the girls?
Like a peace offering?

268
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:26,838
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.

269
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,846
Oh, God!

270
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,895
Hey, you want a beer?

271
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,942
I know!

272
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:52,031
Open up! Open up! Open up!

273
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:55,951
We'll discuss it in the morning.

274
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,709
What the hell is going on?

275
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,339
We took our apartment back!

276
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,636
I had nothing to do with it.

277
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:21,560
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.

278
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,982
We are switching back right now.

279
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,984
No, we're not.
We're not leaving!

280
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,278
You'll have to.
You both have jobs.

281
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,990
As soon as you do, we'll switch back!
You can't stop us.

282
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,491
Right, Joe?

283
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,370
I don't know.

284
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,123
What?

285
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:47,377
I don't want to move again, with...

286
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,672
This is our apartment
and they stole...

287
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,050
You stole!

288
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,303
Our apartment!
We won it fair and square. Twice!

289
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:01,975
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!

290
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,977
All right.

291
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:08,733
We figured you might respond
this way, so we have a backup offer.

292
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,985
No more offers.
You can't offer anything to us!

293
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:18,033
- Let us keep the apartment and...
- As a thank you...

294
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:24,289
...Rachel and I will kiss
for one minute.

295
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,461
- Totally worth it!
- That was one good minute!

296
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,297
Good night.

297
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,221
- Men are such idiots.
- I know.

298
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:44,059
Can you believe something that stupid
actually got us our apartment back?

299
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,521
If you had just done that
after the last contest...

300
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,608
...no one would have
had to move at all.

301
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:57,031
Let's pretend that's not true.

302
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:01,869
Scarf's done.

303
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,124
Come on, come on!

304
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:09,877
What's going on?

305
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:14,340
Ross has some big thing
to tell everyone.

306
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,428
Emily and I, we decided...

307
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,472
...to get married.

308
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,642
What?

309
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:29,772
Oh, are you pregnant too?

310
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,985
When did...
How did you...

311
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,988
We just decided to go for it.

312
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,283
We know it's a bit hasty...

313
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:45,245
...but it just feels so right.

314
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,583
I was just telling the guys...

315
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:54,379
Yeah, I heard.

316
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,470
I think it's great!

317
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,096
I'm so happy for you!

318
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,767
Well, yeah!
Congratulations!

319
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:17,945
I can't believe
you're getting married!

320
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:24,034
Monica and Rachel made out.

321
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:37,214
<i>Morning's here</i>

322
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,008
<i>The morning's here</i>

323
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,803
<i>Sunshine is here</i>

324
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,513
<i>The sky is clear</i>

325
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:47,182
<i>The morning's here</i>

326
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,727
- Hey, you're back!
<i>- Hey, get into gear</i>

327
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,730
<i>Breakfast is near</i>

328
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,027
<i>The dark of night has disappeared</i>

329
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:02,406
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
