1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,250
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,170
"Say, Rachel...

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,340
...l was wondering if you'd
go to a movie with me sometime...

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,020
...as my lover. "

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,370
Too out there.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,300
"Maybe you'd like to have
dinner with me sometime...

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,580
...as my lover. "

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,380
All right, let's go shopping.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,180
Before we go, there's something
I need to say.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,060
I've kind of had this crush on you.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,860
Since you were with Ross,
I didn't do anything about it.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,860
Now that you're not, I'd really
like to ask you out sometime.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,460
So that's what I'm doing. . .

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,610
: : :now:

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,580
I dropped a cup.

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,460
The One With the Tiny T-Shirt

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,690
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

18
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,540
So within a few years,
voice recognition. . .

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,780
. . .will be standard
on any computer.

20
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,500
You know, so you could be, like,
"Wash my car. " "Clean my room. "

21
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,330
It won't be able to do any of those
things, but it'll understand.

22
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,970
Oh, this was so great.

23
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,460
Yeah, it was.

24
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,210
All right, then.

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,060
Bye.

26
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,140
Hello, people who do not live here.

27
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,370
I gave you a key for emergencies.

28
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,620
We were out of Doritos.

29
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,740
Hey, how'd the date go
with Mr. Millionaire?

30
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,940
"Mr. Millionaire.
New, from Snooty Playthings.

31
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,580
Third wife sold separately. "

32
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,260
He's great. We have such
a good time together.

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,340
He's so funny and so sweet.
And I'm not attracted to him at all!

34
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,730
Still?

35
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,130
It's driving me crazy. In every
other way, he's the perfect guy.

36
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,180
He has everything.
Plus, he actually has everything.

37
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,780
Life-sized lmperial Storm Troopers
from Sharper lmage?

38
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,420
Two.

39
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,050
Can Joey and I put them on and fight?

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,460
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy

41
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,740
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy

42
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,620
I guess he must've gotten the part
in that play.

43
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,740
Either that, or Gloria Estefan
was right.

44
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,340
Eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you.

45
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,980
-Joe, how's it going?
-Good.

46
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,860
So you're playing Adrianne?

47
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,490
Yes. Are you one of the
retarded cousins?

48
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,060
No. I'm playing your husband, victor.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

49
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,530
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Kate Miller.

50
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,530
So the play's pretty great, huh?

51
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,140
Oh, yeah.
I love Jennifer Banberry's work.

52
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,340
She's so incisive when it comes
to deconstructing the middle class.

53
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,690
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!

54
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,140
Where do I know you from?

55
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,220
Dr. Drake Ramoray?

56
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,820
Days of our Lives?

57
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,980
voted most datable neurosurgeon
by Teen Beat?

58
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,820
No, that's not it.

59
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,540
So you're a soap actor.

60
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,860
This must be exciting for you,
being in a real play.

61
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,740
Hey, I've done plays before.
I'm a serious actor.

62
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,180
That infomercial!

63
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,180
For the milk-carton-spout thing!

64
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,890
You're the guy who doesn't
know how to pour milk!

65
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,500
I actually can pour milk. But I got
you believing that I couldn't.

66
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,260
Now, see, that's acting.

67
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,540
Right. At the end, you choked
on a cookie.

68
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,860
That was real.

69
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,180
-I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
-I know.

70
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,140
What are you gonna tell him?

71
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,180
I told him I would think about it,
but I'm gonna tell him no.

72
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,940
I think I'd say no
to anybody right now.

73
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,180
But it was so strange.
I mean, I'm standing there. . .

74
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,540
. . .with this charming, cute guy
who's asking me to go out with him. . .

75
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,540
. . .which I'm allowed to do. . .

76
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,570
. . .and I felt guilty, like I'd be
cheating on Ross or something.

77
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,180
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means. . .

78
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,140
. . .you're not over Ross yet
and you have issues with your father.

79
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,580
-I don't have issues with my father.
-So it's just the Ross thing.

80
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,740
I hate this woman! I hate her!

81
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,330
She told everyone
about that infomercial. . .

82
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,540
. . .and now they all keep asking me
to open their drinks!

83
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,860
And whenever I can't do it,
they're all, like, laughing at me!

84
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,500
So Rachel called.

85
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,100
Wants to see me.

86
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,020
Going over in a minute.

87
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,140
-What do you think she wants?
-Maybe the crazy fog has lifted. . .

88
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,300
. . .and she realizes that life
without me. . .

89
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,580
. . .sucks.

90
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,530
It's possible. You are very lovable.
I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

91
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,220
Just trying to be supportive.

92
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,100
Be supportive like a guy.

93
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,540
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.

94
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,180
You wanted to see me?

95
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,530
Here's a box of your stuff.

96
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,700
It's just hats and a shirt and CDS.
Just stuff that you've left here.

97
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,540
What are you doing? Are you trying
to hurt me or something?

98
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,130
It just seems that, you know,
it's time we move on.

99
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,780
I mean, don't you think?

100
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,660
-Yes, I do.
-Good.

101
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,860
I really do.

102
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,460
This was a gift.

103
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,540
You got that for free
from the museum gift shop.

104
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,540
It's still a gift.

105
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,170
I got it from the "gift" shop.

106
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,740
Okay! All right! Give me the mug!
I'll keep the mug!

107
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,380
Don't do me any favors.

108
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,980
In fact. . .

109
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,260
. . .where's the rest of my stuff?
Like my. . . .

110
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,140
This book is mine!

111
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,860
And that T-shirt you sleep in?
I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.

112
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,940
You know how much I love that T-shirt.
You never even wear that T-shirt.

113
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,660
I'm just trying to help you "move on. "

114
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,060
Oh, you are a petty man.

115
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,340
You are a petty, petty. . .

116
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,940
-Petty. . .
-. . . petty, petty. . .

117
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,380
-. . .small. . . .
-. . .small. . . .

118
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,340
You are so just doing this
out of spite.

119
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,380
I'm gonna wear this all the time!
I love this shirt!

120
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,890
You haven't worn it since you were 1 5!
It doesn't even fit you anymore!

121
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,930
If you don't mind, I'm gonna
take the rest of my stuff. . .

122
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,020
. . .and "relax" . . .

123
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,260
. . .in my favorite shirt.

124
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,140
You have a pleasant evening.

125
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,340
So you're, like, a zillionaire.

126
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,260
And you're our age.
You're our age.

127
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,450
You know what?
You should buy a state. . .

128
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,820
. . .and then just name it
after yourself.

129
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,700
Like, "Pete Dakota"?

130
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,940
Or "Mississi-Pete. "

131
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,220
I got it: "Pete Chicago. "

132
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,980
That's not a state, Joe.

133
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,730
Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

134
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,100
I gotta go.

135
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,140
I'll see you guys later.

136
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,860
You're our age.

137
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,860
So are we on for tomorrow?

138
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,330
Absolutely.

139
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,340
Now, get out of here, you!

140
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,340
Okay, I'm running out of places
I can touch him.

141
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,420
Is something wrong with me?

142
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,260
Why am I only attracted to guys
with no future?

143
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,020
Either they're too old,
or they're too young.

144
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
And there's Pete,
who's crazy about me. . .

145
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,740
. . .and he's absolutely perfect,
and there's zip going on!

146
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,060
Does it sound like
something's wrong with me?

147
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,420
Yeah, kind of.

148
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,340
Happy? ls that what I'm
supposed to be, vic?

149
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,780
Happy?

150
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,540
Why don't you tell me what
you're supposed to be?

151
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,940
Because I sure as hell can't
figure it out!

152
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,340
I talk to you, and nothing!

153
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
You look at me, and it's nothing!

154
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,250
Nothing.

155
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,810
Tasty.

156
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,420
I'm really starting to feel like
you guys have a history. It's nice.

157
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,580
I have a question about this scene.

158
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,220
I don't understand why Adrianne's
attracted to victor.

159
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,140
Peel the onion.

160
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,100
First of all, he's good-looking.

161
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,580
My character needs a bit more
of a reason than that.

162
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,980
Hey, how about this one?
It says so in the script!

163
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,540
I don't know why my character
likes you either.

164
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,540
I mean, it says in the script
that you're a bitch.

165
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,540
-It doesn't say that in the script.
-It does in mine.

166
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,980
I can blow-dry it, gel it.
It doesn't matter.

167
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,940
I still wind up with this little. . .

168
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,380
. . .cowlick-y thing on the middle part
of my head. It's so annoying.

169
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,700
-Does it bug you?
-You bug me.

170
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,300
Is there any chance
you didn't see that?

171
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,930
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

172
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,940
You can't stare through
the peephole for three hours.

173
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,060
You're gonna get peep-eye.

174
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,940
I knew it. I knew it.
I always knew she liked him.

175
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,740
She'd say no, but here we are. We just
broke up, first thing she does!

176
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,380
You didn't "just break up. "

177
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,380
It's been, like, three weeks!

178
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,380
You slept with somebody three hours
after you thought you broke up.

179
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,820
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

180
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,020
Here they come! Here they--

181
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,020
If she kisses him good night,
I'll kill myself.

182
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,700
I can't watch.

183
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,860
Come on.
Date over! Date over!

184
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,740
Here we go. She's going in.

185
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,530
She's going in.

186
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,540
Wait! He's going in!

187
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,940
He's going in!

188
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,140
The door's closed! I can't see
anything with the door closed!

189
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,940
And the inventor of the door
rests happily in his grave.

190
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,730
I have to do something.
I have to stop it!

191
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,780
-Stop what?
-I don't know.

192
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,490
But I have a feeling
my being there will do it.

193
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,980
I'll go over and I will
borrow something!

194
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,980
Juice! I need juice!

195
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,100
You can't!

196
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,370
-They must be stopped!
-I am your friend. . .

197
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,460
. . .and I won't let you do this!

198
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,890
You are surprisingly strong!

199
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,140
-I need juice! People need juice!
-Look, man. . . .

200
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,220
-People need juice!
-Listen to me!

201
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,860
She's moving on. If it's not
this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

202
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,940
And unless you're thinking about
subletting my peephole. . .

203
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,220
. . .you'll have to get used to the fact
that it's over!

204
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,060
Okay, man? It's over.

205
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,820
It's just I miss her so much.

206
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,290
I know.

207
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,170
Why do your coffee mugs have numbers?

208
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,940
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

209
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,730
So if one of them's missing,
she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

210
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,380
You know what?

211
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,220
No, and I don't think
I'm gonna want to.

212
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,420
-I can't do this.
-That's what I didn't want to know.

213
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,580
Oh, I'm just doing this
for the wrong reasons, you know?

214
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,700
I'm doing it to get back at Ross.

215
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,370
I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

216
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,940
Fair, shmair. You know?

217
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,180
You wanna get back at Ross,
I am here for you.

218
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,420
Really.

219
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,140
I say we get back at him right here
on this couch. Right here!

220
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,780
Oh, my God.

221
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,940
I'm sorry about this.

222
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,490
That's okay.

223
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,340
You sure?

224
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,380
I can just go home and get back
at him by myself.

225
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,860
--and should become the penicillin
of the 2 1st century.

226
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,730
And so today, this hospital
is about to take major steps. . .

227
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,290
. . .toward leading that revolution.

228
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,460
Can I ask you something?

229
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,250
Where are we?

230
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,340
Well, with all these doctors
and nurses. . .

231
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,460
. . .I'm gonna say, "Midget Rodeo. "

232
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,860
Just tell me the truth.

233
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,740
You know, I don't think
I told you this. . .

234
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,180
. . .but I just recently got out
of a serious relationship.

235
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,620
Oh, right.
Wasn't that a year ago?

236
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,140
So I did tell you.

237
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,780
That's not really the thing.

238
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,810
I'm just in a place in my life
where I need to focus on me.

239
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,380
-Do you know what I mean?
-Oh, I know.

240
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,780
-I so want to be attracted to you.
-But you're not. Okay. Good.

241
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,170
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,340
You know what? Don't be.

243
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,370
Don't be, because it's not so bad.

244
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,940
It's not?

245
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,580
Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

246
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,210
Or someone you find attractive.

247
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,180
I just think, you know. . .

248
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,890
. . .that you might end up
feeling differently.

249
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,980
I don't want this
to come out wrong. . .

250
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,970
. . .but you're awfully confident for a
guy I said I wasn't attracted to.

251
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,340
Stupidly charming, isn't it?

252
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,690
You wanna get something to eat?
This place is kind of depressing.

253
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,490
Now the man who made all of this
possible, Mr. Peter Becker.

254
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,100
One second.

255
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,060
I don't think this town is big enough
for the both of us to relax in.

256
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,330
Draw!

257
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,580
I wasn't doing anything.

258
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,180
What did she do now?

259
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,940
Just because she went to Yale, she
thinks she's the greatest actress. . .

260
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,290
. . .since sliced bread.

261
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,340
Ah, Sliced Bread.
A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

262
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,570
I hate her. I hate her
with her "Oh, I'm so talented" . . .

263
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,530
. . .and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"
and "Oh, I smell so good. "

264
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,730
I think somebody has a crush
on somebody.

265
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,860
Can we please try and stay focused
on my problem here?

266
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,300
I'm talking about you,
you big, big freak.

267
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,140
You're out of your mind!

268
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,980
You've done nothing but talk
about her for 48 hours.

269
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,740
If you were in school, you'd be pulling
her pigtails and pushing her down now.

270
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,170
Then how come I keep thinking
about her. . .

271
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,180
. . .in all these sexual scenarios
and stuff?

272
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,180
Happy? ls that what I'm
supposed to be, vic? Happy?

273
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,180
Why don't you tell me what
you're supposed to be, huh?

274
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,650
Because I sure as hell can't
figure it out.

275
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
I talk to you, and it's nothing.

276
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,650
You look at me, and nothing.

277
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,650
Nothing.

278
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,090
You guys make me fly!

279
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,900
High!

280
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,740
Okay, we're gonna pick it up
here, tomorrow.

281
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,180
-Well, that was. . . .
-Better?

282
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,450
Yeah, it was definitely. . .

283
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,180
. . .an improvement.

284
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,460
-Good night.
-Kate.

285
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,770
You forgot your shoes.

286
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,690
I'm probably gonna need those, huh?

287
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,700
Hey, listen. . .

288
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,940
. . .you feel like getting
a cup of coffee?

289
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,330
Kate. . .

290
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,450
. . .you ready to go?

291
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,380
very nice. very nice.

292
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,180
-See you tomorrow?
-Yeah. Sure.

293
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,740
-Right.
-Good night.

294
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,300
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

295
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,660
Like Goldman, Silverman?

296
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,740
Because it's not his last name.

297
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,020
It isn't?

298
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,940
It's not, like. . .

299
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,740
. . .Phil Spiderman.

300
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,740
He's a Spider-. . .

301
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,540
: : :man:

302
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,460
You know, like, Goldman
is a last name.

303
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,090
But there's no Gold Man.

304
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,220
There should be a Gold Man!

305
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,940
-How was work?
-Oh, great.

306
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,940
Although I did sit down
where there wasn't a chair.

307
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,130
By the way, Ross dropped by
a box of your stuff.

308
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,300
Oh. Well, I guess I had
that one coming.

309
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,220
I'm just gonna throw it out.
It's probably just shampoo and--

310
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,220
Something wrong?

311
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,820
No. Nothing.

312
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,140
So what kind of powers
would "Gold Man" have?

313
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,340
Okay. Well, he would turn things
to gold.

314
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,900
-And things that are already gold?
-His work is done.

315
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,650
Let's play my game.

316
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,570
All right, you yellow-bellied,
lily-livered--

317
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,780
Draw!

318
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,210
Yeah, it's fun.
