1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,500
-Does everybody hate these shoes?
-Yeah.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,700
But nobody will focus on that
if you wear that towel-dress.

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,460
Tell him.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,740
It's her first day at this new job.
You shouldn't start with her.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,090
All right.
I suppose I can wait a day.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,900
-What are you doing Friday?
-Why?

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,710
Come to my weird cousin Albert's
bachelor party.

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,660
You know, he's the botanist?

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,130
Oh, God!

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,180
Botanists are such geeks.

11
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,130
Is that a dinosaur tie?

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,980
Morning!

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,530
Rach, I'm here with the purses!

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,660
It must take you forever
to find your keys.

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,460
Thank you, Pheebs.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,700
You're welcome. Please want the one
with the turtles.

17
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,180
No, turtles scare me.
I don't need that today.

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,980
Honey, just relax.
It's gonna be fine.

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,660
Why don't I come
and take you to lunch?

20
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,370
Thank you!
But Mark's taking me out.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,020
Mark? ls that the same Mark
that helped you get the job?

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,790
It's like a "good luck on your
first day" thing.

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,170
Is this a lunch box?

24
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,500
No, a purse.
And there's a thermos in it.

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,340
-So can you make it on Friday?
-What?

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,010
I think so.
Why am I invited to this again?

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,780
Apparently, Albert has no friends.

28
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,860
He's excited about the bachelor party.

29
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,260
He's only getting married
so he can see a stripper.

30
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,940
Why don't you guys get a magician?

31
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,340
If he can open my beer
with his butt-cheeks, then all right.

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,060
The One With All the Jealousy

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,290
Czech Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

34
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,980
She's having lunch with him?
Lunch with him?

35
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,860
You should've seen him hug her
when she got the job!

36
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,860
And he's really good-looking.

37
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,370
-What am I gonna do?
-You don't do anything.

38
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,060
Keep it inside.
Learn how to hide your feelings.

39
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,860
Don't cry out loud.

40
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,900
Guess who has an audition
for a Broadway musical?

41
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,460
I wanna say you, but it seems like
such an easy answer.

42
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,860
It is me!

43
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,740
It's a musical version
of A Tale of Two Cities.

44
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,300
So I think I'm gonna sing
"New York, New York" . . .

45
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,060
. . .and "I Left My Heart
in San Francisco. "

46
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,220
Joey, I don't think
you get to pick the cities.

47
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,780
What?

48
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,940
Mr. Dickens gets to pick them.

49
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,100
Who?

50
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,860
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.

51
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:26,980
The what?

52
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,380
The abridgment.

53
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,250
The what?

54
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,260
Then the style number. . .

55
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,860
. . .the invoice number
and the shipping date.

56
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,860
Good. Any questions so far?

57
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,940
What kind of discount do we get?

58
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,580
Twenty percent.

59
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,260
I love this job!

60
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,260
-My first call!
-Here, let me.

61
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,900
Rachel Greene's line.
May I help you?

62
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,250
Hi, is Rachel there?

63
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,380
-And who may I say is calling?
-This is Ross.

64
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,500
Ross of. . .?

65
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,700
Of "Ross and Rachel. "

66
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,020
Hi, it's Mark.

67
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,100
-Hey, Mark.
-Hey.

68
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,940
Hold on a second.
It's Ross.

69
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,260
Hi, honey.

70
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,970
What's Mark doing
answering your phone?

71
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,900
Oh, he's just goofing around.

72
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,450
Oh, that's funny.

73
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,900
Why isn't he goofing around
in his own office?

74
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,020
This is his office too. I told you,
we're Joanna's two assistants.

75
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,380
Why does Joanna need two assistants?

76
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,540
How lazy is she?

77
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,740
Oh, my God! What did I just do?

78
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,060
I just shipped 3000 bras to Personnel!

79
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,900
I gotta go!
Mark, I need you!

80
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,860
Okay! Bye-bye!

81
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,860
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I was just trying to--

82
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,900
I was dialing another number.

83
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,300
I got changed in 30 seconds
so you could be alone with him.

84
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,770
You better go for it.

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,940
I'm not going for anything.

86
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,540
Well, if you don't, I will.

87
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,380
Would you please go?

88
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,260
'Night, Mon.

89
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,020
'Night, Julio.

90
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,020
Someone left their book here.

91
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,700
Actually, that is mine.

92
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,500
What are you reading?

93
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,450
Flowers of Evil, by Baudelaire.
Have you read it?

94
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,660
Have I read it?

95
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,060
No. Are you enjoying it?

96
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,140
I thought I would,
but the translation's no good.

97
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,140
You're a poet
and you don't know it.

98
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,500
Actually, l. . . .

99
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,980
I am a poet.

100
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,860
So you do know it.

101
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,060
So what kind of things
do you write about?

102
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,660
Things that move me:

103
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,980
The shadow of a tree. . .

104
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,170
. . .a child laughing. . .

105
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,180
. . .or this lip.

106
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,860
Mine?

107
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,860
Right here?

108
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,660
I could write an epic poem
about this lip.

109
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,660
How would that go?

110
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,660
Well, it didn't rhyme. . .

111
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,890
. . .but I liked it.

112
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,660
You've got to pick a pocket or two...

113
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,180
...boys

114
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,460
You've got to pick a pocket...

115
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,580
...or two

116
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,340
Lovely.

117
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,060
Just lovely.

118
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,740
Really? Thanks.

119
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,300
We definitely want to see you
for the callback on Saturday.

120
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,700
Excellent!

121
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,500
I'll be there.

122
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,020
Don't forget to bring your jazz shoes
for the dance audition.

123
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,220
My agent said that
it wasn't a dancing part.

124
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,100
All the roles gotta dance a little.

125
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,340
But with your dance background,
it'll be a piece of cake.

126
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,660
"Three years of modern dance
with Twyla Tharp"?

127
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,460
"Five years with
the American Ballet Theatre"?

128
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,250
I wasn't one of
the Zoom kids either.

129
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,380
Well, can you, like, dance at all?

130
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,660
Yeah, I can dance.
You know. . . .

131
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,100
What is that?

132
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,060
Sure, it looks stupid now.
There's no music playing.

133
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,860
I have to get that.
But, no, no.

134
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,060
Hi.

135
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,260
Listen, I'm in need of a stripper
and I was told that you do that.

136
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,860
Let me ask you this. What do you do
for the extra hundred?

137
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,460
So would I have to provide the grapes?

138
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,220
Hi.

139
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,900
How was last night
with Julio, se~norita?

140
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,580
It was amazing. He's sexy and smart,
which makes him even sexier.

141
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,260
Last night we were fooling around. . .

142
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,340
. . .and all of a sudden he stops
to write a poem.

143
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,940
Get out! I couldn't stop
if a meteor hit me.

144
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,460
We have our stripper,
a "Miss Crystal Chandelier. "

145
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,180
Name a kid that, what do you
expect them to grow up to be?

146
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,100
But he forgot
to take the poem with him.

147
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,660
I am totally dense about poetry,
but I think this is pretty good.

148
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,050
Check it out.

149
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,060
"The Empty vase.
Translucent beauty--"

150
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,500
To yourself.

151
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,770
You know, that's pretty good.

152
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,740
Yeah, I think so too.
Phoebe?

153
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,580
Great!
I'm so glad you guys like it!

154
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,060
-I gotta go to work.
-I'm not done.

155
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,020
Give it back when
you're through.

156
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,660
-See you guys.
-Bye-bye.

157
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,380
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Poor Monica!

158
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,730
What? What? What?

159
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,140
He was with her
when he wrote this poem!

160
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,180
"My vessel so lovely,
with nothing inside"?

161
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,100
"Now that I've touched you,
you seem emptier still"?

162
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,100
He thinks Monica's empty.
She's the empty vase!

163
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,380
You really think he meant that?

164
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,500
Totally.

165
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,340
Oh, God!
And she seems so happy too.

166
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,860
Done.

167
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,580
Do you have the Ralph Lauren file?

168
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,380
Oh, yeah, sure! It's right--

169
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,940
What's that?

170
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,820
It's from Ross. It's a Love Bug.

171
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,860
Somebody wants people to know
you have a boyfriend.

172
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,460
That's not what he's doing.

173
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,060
He's just really romantic.

174
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,060
Excuse me. Are you Rachel Greene?

175
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,260
One, two, three.

176
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,300
Congratulations on your first week
At your brand-newjob

177
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,900
It won 't be long
Before you're the boss

178
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,860
And you know who will be there
To support you

179
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,380
Your one and only boyfriend

180
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,060
It's nice to have a boyfriend!

181
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,980
Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross!

182
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,900
I'm hurt!
I'm actually hurt. . .

183
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,850
. . .that you'd think I'd send those
things out of anything but love.

184
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,060
Hurt!

185
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,930
All right, I get it. You're hurt!

186
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,260
Can't a guy send
a barbershop quartet. . .

187
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,740
. . .to his girlfriend's office anymore?

188
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,270
Oh, please!
It was so obvious. . .

189
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,770
. . .Iike you were marking
your territory.

190
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,660
You might as well have just come in
and peed around my desk!

191
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,100
I would never do that.

192
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,700
Look, I know what's going on here.

193
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,020
Mark explained it all to me.
He said this is what you guys do.

194
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,850
Well, if Mark said that,
then Mark's an idiot.

195
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,300
Mark's a genius.

196
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,500
Why? How?
How is he a genius?

197
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,260
Don't you see what's happening?

198
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,460
Instead of hitting on her now,
he's becoming her confidante.

199
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,860
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes to,
to complain about you.

200
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,090
What am I gonna do?

201
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,100
Why don't you send her a musical bug?

202
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,620
No, you already did that.

203
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,310
You're gonna have to go
there yourself now.

204
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,020
Make a few surprise visits.

205
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,100
I don't know, guys.

206
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,500
Fine, don't do anything.
Sit and talk to us.

207
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,210
Meanwhile, she is talking
to him about you.

208
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,900
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive.

209
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,060
She's thinking, "Maybe he's the guy
for me because he understands me. "

210
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,180
And before you know it,
she's with him.

211
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,460
And you'll be all, "Oh, man! "

212
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,300
And he'll be all, "Yes! "

213
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,940
And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude! "

214
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,250
And pretty soon you'll be like:

215
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,690
"Hi. "

216
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,540
And, "Well, I can't go.
Rachel and Mark might be there. "

217
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,100
And we'll be like, "Man, get over it!
It's been four years! "

218
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,450
He paints quite a picture,
doesn't he?

219
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,780
Here's the Shelley Segal stuff
for December.

220
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,060
Wait, I've got something for you.

221
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,780
It's okay. Rachel knows.

222
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,860
Yeah, but even so--

223
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,260
I can't help it.
I'm just crazy about you.

224
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,340
Oh, that is so sweet!

225
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,100
I know I'm Mr. Inappropriate today,
but it's just so tough.

226
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,380
I see you walking around,
and I want to touch and hold you. . . .

227
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,180
Come on, no one's around.
Just kiss me.

228
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,500
All right, that's it!
Get off of her!

229
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,810
What is going on?

230
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,700
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on!

231
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,380
I have been down in your store
for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.

232
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,860
What do I have to do
to get some service?

233
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,860
Hi, Rach.

234
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,500
Joey Tribbiani?

235
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,060
I've got a problem.

236
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,300
I just got a call
from my dance captain.

237
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,460
He's having a relationship crisis
and can't leave Long lsland.

238
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,660
Does that mean the audition's off?

239
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,180
Seeing as you've got
the most experience. . .

240
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,180
. . .I want you to teach these dancers
the combination.

241
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,300
What?

242
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,570
Come on, it's easy.
You know, it's hand, hand. . .

243
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,460
. . .head, head. . .

244
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,100
. . .big turn here, rond de jambe. . . .

245
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,420
Slide, step, step. . .

246
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,100
. . .and jazz hands!

247
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,020
So that's, "Steppity-step
and jazz hands. "

248
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,450
Have fun.

249
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,300
Bye.

250
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,900
What are you wrapping?

251
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,060
Look what I got Julio.

252
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,260
It's a vase.

253
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,660
Just like the one in the poem.

254
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,250
Not exactly like
the one in the poem.

255
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,300
What do you mean?

256
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,580
Remember how you said you were
really dense about poetry?

257
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,900
So I'm just an empty vase?

258
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,300
What?

259
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,090
So, I don't read as many
important books as you do.

260
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,580
And I don't write trick poems
that aren't about what they seem.

261
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,170
And I get excited about
stupid stuff. . .

262
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,900
. . .Iike when my
People magazine comes. . .

263
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,450
. . .and the new
"Hold Everything" catalog.

264
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,740
But that doesn't mean I'm empty. I
care about things. Friends and family.

265
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,650
You have no right to judge me!
You don't even know me!

266
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,300
The poem is not about you.

267
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,300
What?

268
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,260
"The Empty vase" is not about you.

269
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,380
My baby preciosa....

270
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,740
You make me so sad
that you would think this.

271
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,660
I'm sorry. It's. . . .

272
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,450
My friend Phoebe said--

273
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,260
It's about all women.

274
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,900
Well. . .

275
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,220
. . .all American women.

276
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,340
You feel better now?

277
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,300
All right, let's do it.

278
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,290
What was that?

279
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,460
It's the best
I could get out of them.

280
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,500
Well, people!

281
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,740
People, people, people!

282
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,940
Let's try it again. And this time,
everybody watch Joey.

283
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,860
Show 'em how it's done.

284
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,850
Count it off, Mack.

285
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,460
Did you have fun at
the bachelor party last night?

286
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,500
Look what I got!
See, she's dressed, right?

287
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,060
And then you click it,
and uh-oh, she's naked!

288
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,340
And then you click it again
and she's dressed.

289
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,780
She's a business woman
walking down the street.

290
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,450
She's window shopping,
and oh, she's naked!

291
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,740
I'm gonna spend some alone time
with the pen.

292
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,070
I'm sorry. I was an idiot.

293
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,900
A big idiot.

294
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,460
A big idiot.

295
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,970
It's just,
you have to realize. . .

296
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,980
. . .this Mark thing is hard for me.

297
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,700
Why is it hard? We've been together
for almost a year now.

298
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,780
Well, I was with Carol
for, like, eight years.

299
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,660
And I lost her.

300
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,620
And now, if it's possible,
I think I love you even more.

301
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,260
So it's hard for me
to believe I'm not gonna. . .

302
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,090
. . .well, that someone else isn't
gonna take you away.

303
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,870
Let it be me. Let it be me!

304
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,820
Honey, that's very sweet.

305
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,650
It just seems to me, though,
that if two people love each other. . .

306
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,260
. . .and trust each other,
like we do. . .

307
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,500
. . .there's no reason to be jealous.

308
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,090
I gotta get going.

309
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,460
Bye, Chandler.

310
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,530
This pen's getting kind of boring.
Can you pick me up some porn?

311
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,340
Where you going?

312
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,180
I've gotta go pick up Ben
for a play-date this afternoon.

313
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,930
With who?

314
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,610
Just this woman I met last night
at the party.

315
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,460
There was a woman at--?

316
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,810
The stripper?

317
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,820
You have a play-date with a stripper?

318
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,860
Man, I gotta get a kid!

319
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,310
We started talking
after she did her thing. . .

320
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,580
. . .and she's got a boy
about Ben's age.

321
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,860
So we're gonna take the kids
to a Gymboree class.

322
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,500
-Is that okay?
-Sure. Is she married?

323
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,580
Are you jealous?

324
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,460
I just don't see why she has
to play with you.

325
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,460
I mean, doesn't she have any other
stripper-mom friends of her own?

326
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,980
You are totally jealous!

327
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,650
I'm not jealous.

328
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,500
This is about. . .

329
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,300
. . .people feeling certain things. . .

330
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,060
. . .you know, about. . .

331
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,860
. . .strippers. And, you know. . . .

332
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,220
I love you too.

333
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,620
Bye.

334
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,130
Wait, wait, wait!

335
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,460
What?

336
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,060
Well, there's a kiss he won't forget
for a few hours.

337
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,460
Either that or you just turned him on
and sent him to a stripper.

338
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,260
Is there a Julio here?

339
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,180
I am Julio.

340
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,500
Mr. Pretentious

341
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,100
You think there's no one finer
Your poems are unpublished

342
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,060
And you work in a diner

343
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,500
You're no God's gift to women
That's all in your head

344
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,500
You are just a butt-munch

345
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,820
No one likes a butt-munch!

346
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,220
And you're also bad in bed
