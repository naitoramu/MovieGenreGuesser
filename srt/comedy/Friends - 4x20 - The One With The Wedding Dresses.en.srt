1
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,640
Are you kidding me?

2
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,977
Joey?

3
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,922
Did I wake you?

4
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,843
The One with
All the Wedding Dresses

5
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:40,225
Gunther, could I get
another cup of coffee?

6
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,104
So what do you do when
you're not working here?

7
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:49,442
- You don't need to fill these silences.
- Okay, thanks.

8
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,112
That's your fourth cup of coffee.

9
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,074
I'm exhausted because
Joey started snoring.

10
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,410
He's in a different room.
He's that loud?

11
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,454
You should hear me.

12
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,958
It's nothing to be proud of.
Go to a sleep clinic.

13
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,670
I'm not going to any clinic.

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,464
I don't have a problem.
You have the problem.

15
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,760
You should go to a "Quit-being-
a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.

16
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,887
- They don't have those.
- Yeah, they do.

17
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,264
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!

18
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,643
There, you just had your first class.

19
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,229
I used to date a light sleeper.

20
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,690
Whenever I snored,
he rolled me over...

21
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,152
Oh, yeah!

22
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,489
He'd roll me over,
and I'd stop snoring.

23
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,700
Next time you snore,
I'm rolling you over!

24
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:43,497
I gotta do what I gotta do.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

25
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,541
Hey, guys.

26
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,339
Oh, the Olympics!

27
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,009
Have you picked a date?

28
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,260
No. Not yet.

29
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,097
I still cannot believe
you're engaged.

30
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:05,185
Because it's so fast.
Not because you're a loser.

31
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,772
Thanks.
Has anyone seen Rach?

32
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,940
She's upstairs not doing the dishes.

33
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,569
I won't do them this time.
Even if they sit there until...

34
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,949
I'll do them when I get home.

35
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,661
Emily found this
wedding dress in London...

36
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,787
Already?

37
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,080
But it didn't fit.

38
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,291
There's a store here
with one left in her size.

39
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,752
But the groom can't see...

40
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,837
- I'll pick it up for you.
- Thanks.

41
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:36,258
She's got you running errands,
picking up wedding dresses...

42
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,511
Wah-pah!

43
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,681
What's wah-pah?

44
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,641
You know. Whipped.

45
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,686
Wah-pah!

46
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,855
That's not whipped.

47
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,443
Whipped is...

48
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,238
That's what I did.

49
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,411
You can't do anything!

50
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,511
Hey, Mon.
I was just doing these dishes.

51
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,056
Do you have a minute?

52
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:28,727
I was just about to
take a break anyway.

53
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,939
So listen...

54
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,274
...I know we haven't had
a chance to talk...

55
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,403
...since Emily and I
decided to get married.

56
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:41,866
And I was just wondering
how you were.

57
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:48,121
If you were getting married,
I would feel kind of...

58
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,791
You know?

59
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:56,171
It definitely took me by surprise.
But, you know...

60
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,049
...I'm okay.

61
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,968
I just wanted to check.

62
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,805
That's sweet. Thank you.

63
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:05,972
You're great.

64
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:11,270
And I know someday this will
happen for you too.

65
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,190
You just hang in there.

66
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,860
"Hang in there"?

67
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,778
No, I didn't mean...

68
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:25,951
You haven't heard of a serious
relationship called "me and Joshua"?

69
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,413
I thought you had
just been on four dates.

70
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,292
I didn't realize that had
become anything.

71
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,545
Oh no, it has become.

72
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:41,174
Oh no, those were four great dates.

73
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,303
I mean, and the connection!

74
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,890
Emotionally, mentally.
You know?

75
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,101
Physically.

76
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,728
- That's incredible.
- I know, isn't it?

77
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,524
I'm right there with Joshua.
You are right there with Emily.

78
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:02,487
And it's kind of like it's a tie.

79
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,992
I gotta get back to my dishes.

80
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,162
I gotta get to work.

81
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,585
You know what would
make me happy?

82
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,587
You know, what's that?

83
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,674
If the four of us could all,
you know, hang out together.

84
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,177
Emily's coming into
town this weekend.

85
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,764
Why don't we all
have dinner Sunday night?

86
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,308
That would be great!

87
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,144
All right. It's a date!

88
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,857
"Hang in there."
You hang in there.

89
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:43,487
- Did you say something?
- No, just singing.

90
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,870
Oh, my God!

91
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,666
Look at this one!

92
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,794
It's so beautiful.

93
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:03,924
About half of these will
end up getting divorced.

94
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,467
May I help you ladies?

95
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,220
I'm here to pick up a dress on hold.

96
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,721
What's the name?

97
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:14,518
- Emily Waltham.
- Yes, I have it right here.

98
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,485
Would you like to try it on,
Miss Waltham?

99
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,458
You're the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

100
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,879
I am, aren't I?

101
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,548
Miss Waltham?

102
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,342
We're closing.

103
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,054
All right.

104
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,766
And could I get my ring back?

105
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,988
All right, buddy.
Time to roll over.

106
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:18,540
You are going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic!

107
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,961
And a pajama store!

108
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,007
Does she use the cups?

109
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,927
Yes, I believe she does.

110
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:36,350
Does she use the plates?
Yes, I believe she does!

111
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,568
Thank you.

112
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,948
Thank you very much.

113
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,827
Thank you for coming.

114
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,999
- Just a second.
- No, no! Let me in!

115
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,418
Can you hold on a minute?

116
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:07,006
No! You have to
let me in right now!

117
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,674
Are you alone?

118
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,803
All right.

119
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,977
This sucks.

120
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:25,232
I have to stay up all night
before I go to the stupid clinic.

121
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,402
I'm so tired.

122
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,988
It's six o'clock.

123
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,826
I hear you and Joshua are
going out with Ross and Emily.

124
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,161
I think that's really cool.

125
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,290
I think you're handling
that really well.

126
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,042
"Handling it"?

127
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,336
There's nothing to handle.

128
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:50,007
Maybe I'd have a problem with this
if it wasn't for me and Joshua.

129
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,635
They're not going to
get married anyway.

130
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:57,807
They rushed into this thing
so fast, it's ridiculous!

131
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,767
They'll be engaged for like what?
A year?

132
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,771
One of them will realize
what they've done...

133
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,272
...and call it off.

134
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,984
You'll be dancing at my wedding
before you dance at theirs.

135
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,695
You know, I don't dance at weddings.

136
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:12,737
Why not?

137
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,491
Weddings are a great place
to meet women.

138
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,869
When I dance,
I look like this.

139
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,215
Hey, man.

140
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,009
What are you doing
four weeks from today?

141
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,469
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

142
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,597
I am...

143
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,350
...free.

144
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,729
Because we're getting
married in a month.

145
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:48,733
In a month?

146
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,651
You mean 30 days?

147
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,779
From now?

148
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,323
That's great!

149
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:00,327
She always wanted to get married
where her parents did...

150
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,038
...but it's getting torn down.

151
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,083
I know it's crazy,
but everything's been so crazy...

152
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,294
...and it just feels right.

153
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:14,550
Hey, that's the day after
I start menstruating!

154
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:27,063
This isn't mine.

155
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,157
What's up?

156
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:42,244
Your voice sounded
all squeaky on the phone.

157
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,746
Nothing.
I just wanted to see you.

158
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,625
See you and hug you.

159
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,126
See you...

160
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,129
Great!

161
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,007
Sit.

162
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,593
You okay?

163
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:05,184
I'm more than okay.
I am really, really happy.

164
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,103
Want to know why?

165
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,063
Do I?

166
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:13,442
Because I am really happy about us.

167
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,903
I think we are so
on the right track.

168
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:20,366
I think we are working.
I think we are clicking.

169
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,618
- You know?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

170
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,536
We're clicking.

171
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,205
If there was just
one little area where...

172
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,376
...I think we need to work on,
I would think...

173
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:35,005
...it's that we're
just not crazy enough.

174
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,384
I got to say, I'm not too sure
I agree with that.

175
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,762
You know, yeah, you're right.

176
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:45,182
We have our fun. Yeah?

177
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,854
I mean, like crazy!
You know?

178
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,273
All right.

179
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:57,319
This is going to sound, you know,
a little hasty.

180
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,906
But just go with me.

181
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,871
What if we got married?

182
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,501
Oh, I know. It's so totally like...

183
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,796
..."Whoa, can we do this?"
You know?

184
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,341
But it just feels right.
Don't you think it does?

185
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:23,845
I mean, it just feels right.
Don't you...?

186
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,975
Rachel...

187
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,935
...you're...

188
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,645
...a real...

189
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,273
...special lady.

190
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,278
But my divorce isn't final yet...

191
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:43,240
...and we've been on four dates.

192
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,660
So I'm thinking: No...

193
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,453
...but...

194
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,207
...thanks.

195
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:55,252
You idiot!

196
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,634
- Your name, please?
- Joey Tribbiani.

197
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:06,347
Did you stay up all night
in preparation for your study?

198
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,016
Sir?

199
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,018
Yes, he did.

200
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,899
All right. We'll call you
in a few minutes.

201
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:23,197
Check out that girl.
She's really hot.

202
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,408
Yeah, she is.

203
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,248
How you doing?

204
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:39,254
- What?
- You're coming on to the entire room.

205
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,262
- I'm Chandler.
- I'm Marjorie.

206
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,347
- Do you mind if I sit?
- Please.

207
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,015
So what are you in for?

208
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,975
I talk in my sleep.

209
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:56,021
What a coincidence!
I listen in my sleep.

210
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,983
So why don't you give me your number?

211
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,779
Are you ready?

212
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,659
I got it! Mine!

213
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,790
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

214
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,668
My turn, my turn!

215
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,255
Okay, ready?

216
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,181
That was a terrible throw!

217
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,602
I won't throw it right to you.
That's not real.

218
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:40,357
Look at me. My big concern
is what's real?

219
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,528
Oh, my God!

220
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,198
We're really sad, aren't we?

221
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,410
Yeah, I think we are.

222
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,246
This isn't even my dress.

223
00:15:54,496 --> 00:16:01,086
At least you didn't rent yours from
a store called "It's Not Too Late."

224
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,595
- I'm changing out of this.
- Me, too.

225
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,013
In half an hour?

226
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,348
Me, too.

227
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,977
All right, now throw it
straight this time.

228
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,188
I'm getting married!

229
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,363
I hate my regular clothes now.

230
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,657
I look down and I know...

231
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:34,245
...this won't be the most
special day of my life.

232
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,539
I mean, it was kind of
fun for a while...

233
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,749
...but didn't you feel kind of silly?

234
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,794
I guess.

235
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,131
Oh, my God!

236
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,343
You're such a cheater!

237
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:52,346
Hello, little ones.

238
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,348
- So, is Joey going to stop snoring?
- Yep!

239
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,434
And a beautiful woman
agreed to go out with me.

240
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,897
Joey wanted to ask her out,
but, you know, she picked me.

241
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,775
How'd that happen?

242
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,653
Because I'm cooler.

243
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:10,364
No, seriously.

244
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:16,203
She's the kind of girl...
Joey was unconscious.

245
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,582
Hey, you guys!
What's happening?

246
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,042
Oh, my God!

247
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,251
What is that?

248
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:26,046
They gave it to me
at the sleep clinic...

249
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:30,091
...and it's going to help me
not to snore.

250
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:33,428
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?

251
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,140
You don't have to
wear it unless you are.

252
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,851
I know I don't have to.

253
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:42,021
It tastes good.

254
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,566
Plus, you look cool.

255
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,364
I just called Joshua.

256
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,865
How'd it go?

257
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,660
I did my best to
convince him that I'm not...

258
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,454
...some crazy girl who's
dying to get married.

259
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,373
And I'm going through
a hard time.

260
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:02,499
What'd he say?

261
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,920
His answering machine
was very understanding.

262
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,926
I feel blue.

263
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,388
I bet you anything
he'll call you again.

264
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:20,767
Yeah, maybe. But, you know,
I don't think I even care.

265
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:25,648
I don't think he's
the one I'm sad about.

266
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:29,735
I know I said I'm totally okay
with Ross getting married.

267
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,820
But as it turns out...

268
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,365
...I don't think I'm handling it
all that well.

269
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,202
Yeah, maybe.

270
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,787
And I'm just trying to
figure out why.

271
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,623
Any luck?

272
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:48,295
You know how Ross and I have
always been on again, off again?

273
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,715
I guess I just figured,
somewhere down the road...

274
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,925
...we would be on again.

275
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,428
Again.

276
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,557
You know what?
I think we all did.

277
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,985
I got us reservations
for Sunday night.

278
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:12,945
How about Ernie's at 9:00?

279
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,782
Well, you'd better make it for three.

280
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:21,912
I don't know if we're
going to be hungry at three.

281
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,873
Three people.

282
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,083
Joshua's not going to be there.

283
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,418
What happened?

284
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,797
Well, I think he broke up with me.

285
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,466
No. Why?

286
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,928
Apparently, he scares easy.

287
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,972
Rachel, I'm sorry.

288
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,684
It's okay.

289
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:50,441
Sometimes things don't work out
the way you thought they would.

290
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,401
Come here.

291
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:02,995
Don't you have to go pick up Emily?

292
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,622
Are you okay?

293
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:09,126
I got my girls.

294
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,481
Hey, you know what might
cheer you up?

295
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,150
What?

296
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,196
I got to tell you...

297
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:41,825
...this really does put me
in a better mood.

298
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,496
I wish there was a job where
I could wear this all the time.

299
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:50,209
Maybe someday there will be.

300
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:54,630
Chandler's coming by to borrow
candles for his big date.

301
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,674
Rachel, don't get it!
He'll see us!

302
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,885
The groom cannot see the bride.

303
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,970
I'm not going to marry Chandler.

304
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:05,599
Not after this!

305
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,770
Okay guys, just relax.

306
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:16,068
I do!

307
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:22,032
I got to go.

308
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:30,457
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.

309
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:36,171
Food's here. Fair enough.

310
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,966
Fifteen-minute warning.

311
00:21:55,065 --> 00:22:00,237
Dude, I am trying to sleep!
