00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,360
where we delve into
each other's personal lives?

159
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,926
I like Donna.

160
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,400
Is it wrong to
keep seeing her?

161
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,138
Depends on who you ask. I
mean, if you ask her husband

162
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,347
or you took a random poll,
yeah, it's wrong.

163
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,950
That is something
I would never do.

164
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,349
Well, I think we all know what
you're capable of, Meredith.

165
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,821
Hey, I have never cheated on, been
cheated on or been used to cheat with.

166
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:36,225
I ask everyone in the room,
"Are you in a relationship?"

167
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,024
People, this is Scranton

168
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,429
and many people
consider that to be

169
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,730
the Paris of
northeastern Pennsylvania.

170
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,669
And in Paris, it is rude for a
woman to have less than four lovers.

171
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,937
Ugh! Ryan, I do not want you
hanging out with Michael anymore.

172
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,132
Okay.

173
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,836
Okay, I will have you know
that I asked Donna about this

174
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,173
and she is fine with it.

175
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,874
And just to be sure, I asked
her again afterward, same answer.

176
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,244
How does he feel about it?

177
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,113
He is never gonna find out.

178
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,880
He is a high school
baseball coach,

179
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,319
he wakes up early,
he goes to bed early.

180
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,991
Look at how long it took
for him to find out.

181
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,391
It was right under his nose.
I had to tell him.

182
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,929
Okay, now you're
just being hurtful.

183
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,294
I'm sorry.

184
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,592
Why is it okay for Stanley to
cheat? Or for Phyllis to cheat?

185

So, you're just making a giant
assumption. You don't even know the guy.

192

You know what?
You know what?

193
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,243
I am declaring a moment
of silence right now.

194
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,118
Ten minutes of silence
honoring Michael Jackson.

195
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,057
Just sit there and think
about Michael Jackson.

My name's Andy Bernard
and I am a cuckold.

197
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,925
For those of you unfamiliar
with William Shakespeare,

198
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,488
a cuckold is a man whose
woman is cheating on him.

199
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,531
I've lived the part.

200
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,663
And let me tell you, I would so
much rather play the part on stage.

201
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,843

When are you people going to
stop casting the first stone?

204
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,378
I am not in the wrong here.
I am the good guy.

205
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,350
How does that work?

206
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,424
Do you think this husband
is a super sweet, nice guy?

207
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,892
Do you think he's an angel?
I don't think so.

208
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:19,489
Why is his wife going off and having
a little something-something with me?

209
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,229
There has to be
a problem with him.

210
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,303
In any cheating movie, the person
getting cheated on is the hero.

I can't wait to see this jerk who
is making me cheat on his wife.

00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,625
I should punch him
in the nose

making me do to her.

Kind of hoping

00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,832
what is the best way to

266
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,803
Right. So let's...

267
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,839
Finally, there's a provision
here in the occurrence

274

275

...unless we're unplugged...

...equivalent to a donor

...and wake up in the future.

...which is
actually pretty common.

280
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,530
So, I have to tell you that
this is a solid contract.

What?

282

have a child with anyone else.

this comes down to damages.

for the range of $30,000.

287

I don't have
$30,000 lying around.

he's paying their salary.

00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,872
"rendered at my discretion."

314
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,413
Look, I don't think
that's actually legal.

315
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,776
Agreed.

316
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:35,685
Five times for $30,000?
Not a bad stud fee.

317
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,484
Better than most horses.

318
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,415
But not on your bed.
It's lumpy.

319
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,585
Those lumps are cats,
and those cats have names,

320
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,424
and those names are Amber,
Milky Way, Dianne and Lumpy.

321
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,228
Fine, five times.

322
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,357
Look, I can't legally
watch this unfold.

323
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,561
It's coming a little dangerously
close to prostitution.

324
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,098
I want eye contact.

325
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,263
No.
Yes.

326
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,204
Do you understand how rare
that is in nature?

327
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,707
I'm not some farm animal.

328
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,004
ANDY: Great game, Coach.
Shh.

329
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,810
Okay, all right,
don't, don't, don't.

330
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,516
You guys are awesome. Best
game I've ever seen in my life.

331
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,654
Yeah, right. You must be
rooting for the other guys.

332
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,519
Ha! The other guys
can go die.

333
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,579
Okay.
Baseball!

334
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:13,682
Go talk to him.

335
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,192
No, God,
you go talk to him.

336
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,893
Shane, great game, man.

337
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,290
Do I know you?

338
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,391
No, just big fans.

339
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,999
Both of us.

340
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,263
Are you somebody's
parents?

341
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,705
Are you guys Kenny's dads?

342
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,245
(LAUGHS) No, no,
but we're gay for baseball.

343
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,776
Okay.
But I have a wife, actually,

344
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,577
who I really love a lot.
Yeah.

345
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,810
Okay.

346
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:39,908
Let's go!

347
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,782
I am so into the
institution of marriage.

348
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,219
Isn't marriage the best,
you know?

349
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,947
Two good people
finding each other,

350
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,016
getting all committed to
each other.

351
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,156
You love baseball,
what else do you love?

352
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,958
Let's round you out
as a person.

353
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,828
Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just
trying to focus here on the game.

354
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,802
I get it, man. I love it. That's
what makes you a good coach.

355
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,138
You know, but as a fan, it just
helps me enjoy the game better

356
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,699
if I know
the coach loves his wife.

357
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,704
Of course. Okay, I've
got to get back to this.

358
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,838
Of course.
All right.

359
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,712
But real quick, I want you
to meet my associate. Sheldon!

360
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,479
No, no, no. I'm good.
ANDY: Come on, get over here.

361
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,315
ANDY: Get over here.
Oh, my God. All right.

362
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,514
Sheldon, say hi
to the nice coach.

363
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,852
Sorry, I've got
some stomach cramps.

364
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,853
SHANE: It's all right, it's
all right, just keep it going.

365
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,951
Well, that was not at all
what I expected.

366
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,820
(LAUGHS IN RELIEF)

367
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,524
My heart's still racing.

368
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,529
<i>I just looked a man in the
eyes and I shook his hand.</i>

369
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,696
<i>All the time I was thinking,
"I'm sleeping with your wife."</i>

370
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,830
You know who does that?
James freaking Bond.

371
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,009
Okay, orange slices.

372
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,546
There you go.
Thanks, Michael.

373
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,276
Don't thank me,
thank Dylan's mom.

374
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,510
There you go.

375
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,811
(MICHAEL LAUGHING)

376
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,553
Why would you throw
something wet at me?

377
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,713
MICHAEL: You love it.

378
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,982
There you go.

379
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,850
Now, were those
for the team?

380
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,793
No. They didn't say "team,"
they just said "Coal Hawks."

381
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,690
I don't think those
were yours to take.

382
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,253
Well, then, it wouldn't
be the first time

383
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,265
I stole something
away from Coach Shane.

384
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,828
ANDY: I just want to
go on record as saying

385
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,132
that I do not
condone this affair.

386
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,967
And I even went so
far as to force Michael

387
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,166
to confront
the victim of his behavior.

388
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,266
Did you talk to him?
I did.

389
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,244
You talked to the man whose wife
you're having an affair with?

390
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,008
Wow, that is crazy.

391
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,139
Was there a fist fight?

392
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,741
No, we just talked.
He's very nice.

393
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,012
And it didn't
change your mind?

394
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,178
It did not.

395
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,277
Michael, that's awful.

396
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,344
Isn't it?

397
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,720
PHYLLIS: Yes.
I'm awful, aren't I?

398
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,883
Yeah, that's pretty...

399
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,358
I'm an awful guy. Ooh!

400
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,655
How can you
live with yourself?

401
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,628
I am what I am, Oscar.

402
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,423
And I want what I want. And
right now I want a piece of cake.

403
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,665
From now on, when I'm hungry, I am
going to eat whatever I am hungry for.

404
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,400
That is
a dangerous game, friend-o.

405
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,072
Well, because
I thought that it was

406
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,701
a book about Anthropologie,
the store.

407
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,678
I don't know why you were in
that part of the bookstore.

408
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,236
Because it's next to
the baby section, okay?

409
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,715
Well, that makes more sense. You
should have said that at the beginning,

410
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,445
when you said, "I read a
book about anthropology."

411
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,350
KELLY: I don't even know why
you're screaming at me right now.

412
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,683
I'm not screaming.
I'm not screaming.

413
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,987
That's Meredith's cake.
It's her birthday.

414
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,582
I don't care.

415
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,059
I have an appetite for life.

416
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,024
Mmm.

417
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,131
God, that's lemon.

418
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,832
Good for you, man.
Good for you.

419
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,744
He takes what he wants.

420
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,571
You know what?

421
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,379
I think you're attractive
and I want to sleep with you.

422
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,710
What about Kelly?

423
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,618
You read my mind.

424
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,249
Is this a joke?

425
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,186
Yep.

426
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,025
It's hard to
live that way, man.

427
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,860
You gotta really not care what
people think about you, right?

428
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,233
I don't know how you do it,
Michael. I can't be that cold.

429
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,165
You'll learn, baby,
you'll learn.

430
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,005
<i>DWIGHT: I am an honorable man
and I will honor the contract.</i>

431
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,312
But I don't have to
give her the good stuff.

432
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,152
<i>Schrute sperm are strong, but they're
no match for a grown Schrute man.</i>

433
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,279
(SCREAMING)

434
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,720
<i>(CHUCKLES)
Let's see what she gets.</i>

435
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,450
(SCREAMING)

436
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,622
Boss, we're out of paper.

437
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,756
Yeah, I noticed that.

438
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,732
Aren't you gonna add any more? Nope.

439
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,431
He don't give
an F about nothing.

440
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,932
I have got big balls.

441
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,697
I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

442
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,505
(YAWNING) What about an
energy drink or something?

443
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,245
It gets in the breast milk. If I drink
it, Cece drinks it six hours later.

444
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,676
Well, it doesn't mean
I can't drink it.

445
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,114
Well, it does and it doesn't.

446
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,382
I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

447
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:39,151
but a lot guys in the
warehouse work multiple jobs,

448
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,282
so we have a place.

449
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,882
A place?

450
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,086
A restful location.

451
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,663
Talk to Glen, he'll
take you up in the lift.

452
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,532
You sleep in the warehouse?

453
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,163
Light bulb's burned out,
so it's dark.

454
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,098
And the heat from the backup
generator keeps it nice and warm.

455
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,542
Sometimes I think about it when
I'm trying to fall asleep at home.

456
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,069
But as far as the rest of the
office goes, it doesn't exist. Okay?

457
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,410
Okay.
Pam?

458
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,843
Okay.

459
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,510
For your signature.

460
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,611
Okay.

461
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,516
Phyllis?

462
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,689
Okay, look at me.

463
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,868
Phyllis, look at...
Okay, that's...

464
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,199
All right, all right, you
know what? I'm sick of this.

465
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,176
I'm sick of the little
disapproving head shakes.

466
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,736
If you think that's going
to have any effect on me,

467
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:36,940
it will not.

468
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,917
I am going to leave right now
and go to a motel to meet Donna.

469
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,582
Why not your condo?

470
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:46,450
Because a motel is dirty,
and it is sexy.

471
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,156
Like me and like Donna.

472
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,755
And frankly, the stuff that we're
into isn't very condo-appropriate.

473
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,526
Michael, will you drop it?

474
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,398
Everybody's spoken their mind
and no one's changing their mind.

475
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,231
Okay, Morgan Freeman
narrating everything.

476
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,068
Do you want someone to stop
you? Because no one's going to.

477
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,336
Nobody better try to stop me.

478
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,234
Good.

479
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,176
I could have stopped him.

480
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,011
(CAR LOCK BEEPING)

481
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,721
Are you warmed up?
No.

482
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,916
God, Angela, why is that
always my responsibility?

483
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,756
ANGELA: What did you
do to yourself?

484
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,388
DWIGHT: Never mind.
Just... Never mind.

485
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,033
ANGELA: Well, it better
work. DWIGHT: Lt'll work.

486
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,896
Stop kissing me.
(ANGELA SCOFFING)

487
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,130
It's not in the contract.

488
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,101
<i>MICHAEL: How do I feel about
breaking up with Donna?</i>

489
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,607
<i>Good. Moral.
I feel proud.</i>

490
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,310
<i>Like a grown-up.</i>

491
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,408
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

492
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:24,114
<i>That was not easy because
I really liked her a lot.</i>

493
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,385
<i>I'm a little bit
emotional right now</i>

494
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:31,054
<i>because I know that I absolutely
made the right decision.</i>

495
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,331
<i>At the end of the day,
we have to do what's right.</i>

496
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,893
And it was either
living with myself

497
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,638
or being happy.

498
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,342
And I picked

499
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,167
the

500
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,270
former.

501
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,217
Michael Scott?
Yes?

502
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,550
Do you want to make
a comment on the rumors?

503
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,886
(SIGHING) Um...

504
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,285
I have done some
very bad things.

505
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,962
Things of which
I'm not proud.

506
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,827
I would like to
publicly apologize

507
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,327
to the coach
and the players,

508
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,633
and I vow to never

509
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:20,304
listen to my bodily
instincts ever again.

510
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,878
I'm talking about the Sabre
printers that catch on fire.

511
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:28,610
Oh! Okay, I was talking
about... What's going on?
