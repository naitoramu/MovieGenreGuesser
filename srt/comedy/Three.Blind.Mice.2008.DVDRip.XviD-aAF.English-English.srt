HARRY: I'll give you a head start.

166
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,093
Oh, and he takes it!

167
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,217
Hi.
How are you?

168
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,937
HARRY: I'm good. How are you?

169
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,697
What are you up to?
Oh, you know.

170
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,057
Looking for somewhere to drink.
I was drinking over there.

171
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,937
I'm now heading back to my hotel.
Your hotel? Where are you staying?

172
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,497
The dirty, stinking one up the road.
Oh, really?

173
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,577
What room number?
Can't remember.

174
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,217
Oh, you can!
(LAUGHS)

175
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,977
SAM: Dean!
HARRY: You can. What room number?

176
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,977
No, it's not... No. It's not
glamorous. It's not glamorous.

177
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,577
Yeah, well, what room number?
Um, 3... 1... 4.

178
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,977
That is so... I'm gonna be knocking
on the wrong door.

179
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,537
No.
I'm gonna be...

180
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,137
What's your name?
Sue.

181
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,897
Harry. Lovely to meet you.
Hi, Harry.

182
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,057
You're gorgeous. You're beautiful.

183
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,297
See ya. 314, yeah?

184
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,177
OK.
OK.

185
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,377
Room 314.

186
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,857
Mum.

187
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,735
Mum, it's me.
Turn down the Cilla Black.

188
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,650
Hey.

189
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,376
Yeah, and I love you too.

190
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,130
Oh, Mum, come on.

191
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,817
Mum, don't cry. Come on.

192
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,808
Shh.

193
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,850
I got promoted.

194
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,976
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm an officer now.

195
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,537
(LAUGHS)

196
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,732
Not a gentleman. Very funny.

197
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,177
Nothing. I miss you too.

198
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,610
How's Pop?

199
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,296
Really?

200
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,415
I'm sure it'll be fine.

201
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,530
Mum, I... Can you stop crying
for a sec? Mum?

202
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,013
Mum, they're sending us over there.

203
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,568
In the morning, first thing.

204
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,137
I don't... I really don't know, Mum.
They don't...

205
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,207
They don't tell us that stuff
until we're actual...

206
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,697
No, Mum, you can't tell...

207
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,857
Mum, you can't tell anyone.
I'm not even supposed...

208
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,735
For Christ... goodness sake,
don't tell Pop. OK?

209
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,577
Mum, just...

210
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,647
Mum, I need you to listen
just for one sec.

211
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,210
I'm not going.

212
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,690
I'm not going back.

213
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,815
No, you... you don't understand, Mum.
They almost killed me out there.

214
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,409
No. No, I've decided.

215
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,135
I guess not.

216
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,777
Alright, well, you know what?

217
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,486
I'm... I'm sorry I'm such a fucking
embarrassment. (ENDS CALL)

218
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,417
You should absolutely talk to her.

219
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,897
He talked to her already.
When he ordered, he talked to her.

220
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,897
She's out of his league, man.
Talk to her properly.

221
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,297
Sorry, Sammy, but look at her.
Exactly. Look her in the eye.

222
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,777
Don't do it.
And tell the truth.

223
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,497
Sammy! Sam.
He's trying to embarrass you.

224
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,057
Shouldn't you be
in the honeymoon suite?

225
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,817
Isn't that why we evacuated
the fucking room?

226
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,857
They just texted, by the way.
They're stuck in traffic.

227
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,097
They're probably avoiding you.
'They'?

228
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,297
I told you, her parents are coming.

229
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,177
You're bringing your girlfriend's
parents to our hotel?

230
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,817
Fiancée's. No, we're
all going out to dinner.

231
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,537
With her fucking parents.
Fiancée's.

232
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,577
I can't guarantee
what state I'm gonna be in.

233
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,457
Come on, guys.
I want her to meet you.

234
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,297
Jeez, how are we gonna eat more food?

235
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,577
We have to go to dinner with
his girlfriend's fucking parents.

236
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,777
Fiancée's.
You know, her old man.

237
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,257
Some people like
their parents, Harry.

238
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,257
Don't do it, Sammy.

239
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,057
HARRY: Let rip, Sammy. Let rip.

240
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,446
Excuse... excuse me, ma'am.
WOMAN: Yes?

241
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,697
Could, um...

242
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,897
Could we have some water, please?
Sure.

243
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,137
(HARRY SIGHS)

244
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,937
DEAN: Wise move, mate.

245
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,137
Go fire a fucking cannon
or something, Dean.

246
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,777
Look, mate, I don't want to do this.
No, you do want to do this.

247
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,177
You want to do this.
Believe me, you want to do this.

248
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,737
You're never gonna
see this girl again.

249
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,577
You're never gonna see her again.
Here she comes.

250
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,897
SAM: Thank you.

251
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,737
Beautiful meal.
Ta.

252
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,126
Anything else?
Yeah.

253
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,817
I, um... I just... I just wanted
to tell you something.

254
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,337
Sure.

255
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,897
You are the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

256
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,652
Truly, truly. The way you move,
the poise, the whole, um...

257
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,377
I... I was... You know, I was
gonna say aura, but I don't even...

258
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,257
OK. You know. OK.

259
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,337
Hey, look, this...
this isn't a pick-up.

260
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,857
Look, I'm actually gonna pay the bill
and I'm gonna go.

261
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,297
MAN: Emma, what are you doing?
EMMA: Uh...

262
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,777
Wiping tables.
Look after everybody else.

263
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,377
Leave the boys alone. Stop flirting.
We've got customers.

264
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,577
I couldn't leave without telling you
that you absolutely devastated me

265
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,097
the second I saw you.

266
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,328
And... you've made my night.

267
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,813
Thanks.

268
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,057
What in blue Jesus was that?

269
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,057
No, that was good.
'Devastated' was an odd call.

270
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,057
You just made a fool out of her.
He didn't.

271
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,057
She thought he was pulling the piss.
No, she didn't.

272
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,937
I wasn't.
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

273
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,777
EMMA: Hey, Shakespeare.
Yeah.

274
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,217
My cousin has a friendly poker game
round the back

275
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,697
if you guys want to play.

276
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,937
DEAN: Ah...
SAM: Oh...

277
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,257
Some of my friends
are coming down too, so...

278
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,537
A... bonus. That sounds like a winner.
I'm Sam.

279
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,897
Emma.
This is Harry and this is Dean.

280
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,297
We can't actually stay, ma'am.
We're running late.

281
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,969
Ignore him. Call your friends.
We're staying.

282
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,257
EMMA: Sure. Well, the game's
straight through the kitchen, boys.

283
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,497
HARRY: Awesome.
Alright.

284
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,257
Sit the fuck down. Sit the fuck down.
McCabe.

285
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,690
Come on. Leiberman, move.

286
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,257
DEAN: We're not staying long.
HARRY: Oh, we're staying long.

287
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,257
Hi.
Hi. I'm Harry.

288
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,537
Straight through the back, boys.
Thanks. This is my friend Dean.

289
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,528
Straight through the back.
DEAN: How you doing, pal?

290
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,697
Ooh!

291
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,897
SAM: Great rooftop.

292
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,934
Yeah, you get over it after a while.

293
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,337
Have you worked here long?

294
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,777
If I gave you three questions,
is that what you'd ask me?

295
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,377
Uh... (LAUGHS)

296
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,810
Yep.

297
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,817
OK, since I was 12.

298
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,137
I live with
the Italian boys downstairs

299
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,017
that your friends
are playing poker with.

300
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,657
They're very protective,
so you'd better play your cards right.

301
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,097
Yeah, no, I'm kind of hoping

302
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,057
that my friends
are playing their cards right.

303
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,057
(BALL BOUNCES)

304
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,057
Ooh.

305
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,775
Ah!

306
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,450
Pretty good.

307
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,177
That was my boob.
Was it?

308
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,246
Yep.

309
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,017
OK, second question.
Where are your parents?

310
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,737
They live in England.

311
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,170
My dad's a pilot.

312
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,537
Why didn't you go with 'em?
Fuck living in England.

313
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,495
I've never been.
Mmm.

314
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,137
OK, I'll give you another question,
'cause the first one...

315
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,537
It's kind of like backyard cricket.
You got out for a golden duck.

316
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,970
Alright.

317
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,657
So how long have you been
on the ship for?

318
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,017
For six months.
No sex for six months?

319
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,097
(LAUGHS)

320
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,055
That's a bit of
a personal question, isn't it?

321
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,177
I'm an open kind of person
to questions like that.

322
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,257
Six months. No, um...

323
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,097
No sex.

324
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,697
What's your favourite position?

325
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,857
On top, 'cause there's more con...
I like to be in control.

326
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,377
Yeah, right.
You?

327
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,537
Um...
Behind for sailors, wouldn't it be?

328
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,537
Oh, come on.

329
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,057
No, I like to definitely
be on the bottom.

330
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,537
Yeah?
Yeah.

331
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,457
What's the most unusual place
you've ever had sex?

332
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,817
Um...
Hopefully, not on the ship.

333
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,977
That means you'd swing both sides.
Probably...

334
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,937
In my mum's bed, I would say.
Not with my mum, though.

335
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,132
Yeah. I hope not.
Yeah.

336
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,257
OK, my first question. That wasn't
counted. That was a warm-up.

337
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,617
Um...

338
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,617
Well, how long, um...
When do you ship out?

339
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,016
Tomorrow morning.

340
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,133
But I'm... I'm... I'm not.

341
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,737
So you're stationed here?

342
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,728
Nah, I'm just, um...

343
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,457
I'm not going.

344
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,057
You were meant to say,
"At first light."

345
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,897
And then I say,
"Well, let's not waste time."

346
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,657
I'm not a... I'm not a coward.
Who said you were a coward?

347
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,417
No, I know.
I'm just saying that I'm...

348
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,977
I'm saying I'm not...
OK, well, my third question.

349
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,209
If you're not such a coward,
why haven't you made a move?

350
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,130
Alright, uh...
I'm gonna take my third question.

351
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,617
You don't have another question.
I do. I had the cricket duck thing.

352
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,733
Do you want me to make a move?

353
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,697
Um, what are four things
you don't like in life?

354
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,537
Heights. I don't like...

355
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,457
No, no, fuck off. Don't do...
Don't do that. Don't do that.

356
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,657
Sorry. Sorry.

357
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,897
Um... Sharks.
But you're on a boat.

358
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,537
Yeah, I know. I'm on the boat.
I'm not in the water with...

359
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,417
Don't you go fishing?
You ever caught a shark?

360
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,657
No, I've never caught a sh...

361
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,217
Uh... spiders and...

362
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,857
This... this question, to be honest,
I really don't know what to say.

363
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,337
OK.
What about you?

364
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,097
Uh, chocolate cake. Overrated.

365
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,817
You don't like chocolate...
No. Not at all.

366
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,737
Everyone likes chocolate cake.
Yeah, no, not me.

367
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,777
Um, flowers. They're already dead
when someone gives them to you.

368
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,137
Just a boring present. Like,
I'd rather get something than flowers.

369
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,817
Um...

370
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,657
Olives.
Alright.

371
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,617
Acquired taste.
Alright. Well, I won't get you...

372
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,297
I won't get you, what, chocolate cake,
flowers and, um, olives.

373
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,857
And...

374
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,337
...weddings.

375
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,097
(LAUGHS) And I'll never
propose to you. There you go.

376
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,297
Don't fucking do that.

377
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,217
Don't. Seriously.

378
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,650
Sorry.

379
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,257
It's alright.
So you definitely won't propose now.

380
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,617
No, I'm not.

381
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,097
So, what's this?
What?

382
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,977
This.
Like... like, what?

383
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,137
Like, that. What,
do you take all guys up here?

384
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,777
What do you think I do,
bring guys here and...

385
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,857
...sit on top of them or something?

386
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,937
(LAUGHS) On top of them?

387
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,897
Is that what?
Have you taken me up here to?

388
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,615
Fat chance.
Alright.

389
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,729
Oh, that's a shame.
(LAUGHS)

390
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,010
(LAUGHS)

391
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,614
Oh, game over.

392
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,377
The food was great, by the way.

393
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,897
It was awesome.

394
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,377
That final truffle was just like...
when you think...

395
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,097
It's about layers. Should see
the food we eat on the fucking ship.

396
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,457
It was delicious food.
We call it scran.

397
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,137
"Shit cooked by
the Royal Australian Navy."

398
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,650
(MAN LAUGHS)

399
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,574
Come on, Lady Luck.
Yeah.

400
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,495
HARRY: OK.

401
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,295
It's alright. I'll lick it up.

402
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,932
Four for me, thanks, John.
Ahh!

403
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,337
JOHN: Here you go.
(HARRY COUGHS)

404
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,217
I'm fine.

405
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,492
JOHN: You want no cards?
I'm fine.

406
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,217
You want to keep going?

407
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,977
Put 50 on this hand.
Yeah.

408
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,977
Oh! You put this in?

409
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,537
OK.

410
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,137
Hang on.
I've got two fives.

411
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,857
What have you got?
You can't. You've got to go in.

412
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,927
Let's see what you've got.
Oh, OK.

413
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,249
Motherfucker.
Fucking...

414
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,057
Does that mean that's all mine?
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,297
Thanks.

416
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,256
First time I saw Harry do this,
I was like, "It's full-on."

417
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,497
DEAN: Mate, all we do out there
is play cards.

418
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,977
Is that right?
Yeah.

419
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,257
'Cause your mate looks like
he doesn't know what he's doing.

420
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,657
HARRY: I just watch.
I'm like the mascot.

421
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,537
Pour myself one first.
Oh, no, dickhead.

422
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,897
No, you pour everyone else first,
then you pour yourself.

423
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,137
Shut up, dickhead.
When you deal cards it's the same thing.

424
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,777
You deal everyone else
and then you deal yourself last.

425
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,217
You pour everyone...
Go and deal your mum one, alright?

426
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,254
HARRY: I'm not touching this one.

427
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,417
I'm growing a beard. Um...

428
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,257
Um... You have to ask for permission
to grow a beard.

429
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,817
And, um...
MAN: Yep?

430
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,457
Yeah, you go to the CO -
the commanding officer -

431
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,577
and you say, "Can I grow a beard?"

432
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,617
And they give you two weeks.
You stop shaving.

433
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,657
And then two weeks later,
you go to the CO and, uh...

434
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,577
They say, "Can you shave that
scraggly shit off your face, mate?"

435
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,010
Absolutely. Yeah. So...

436
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,137
Yeah, well, I actually just
asked permission two days ago

437
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,737
just so I could have the shadow
for the chicks.

438
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,657
I'm gonna shave tomorrow.

439
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,297
I want a break.
Top call.

440
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,137
I'm happy to push on through.
I'm not. Drink up.

441
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,254
(SLURRED) Are you trying
to get me drunk?

442
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,857
Occifer, I didn't mean it.

443
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,297
HARRY: Oh! Ah!

444
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,777
Who's dealing?

445
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,177
You can handle another one?
MAN: We're having a break, dickhead.

446
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,217
You shut up, dickhead.
HARRY: No, no, no, that's fine.

447
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,577
You can talk to me, alright?

448
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,091
MAN: Pathetic.
HARRY: Ooh, burns the lips.

449
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,609
MAN: Oh, beautiful.

450
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,608
It's good stuff - the best.
That went down pretty easy?

451
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,137
Can I pinch one of them?

452
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,617
When you're done?

453
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,050
Sure.

454
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,376
Here you go, mate.

455
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,457
What about your other mate?
He doesn't like poker?

456
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,977
DEAN: Sam? Nah, hates it.
No, he can't stand it.

457
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,537
His mum's a gambling addict,
actually.

458
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,617
Not cards. Yeah, like...
betting on the football, whatever.

459
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,257
Yeah?
It's tragic.

460
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,010
Do not talk about gambling around Sam.

461
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,177
MAN: Fair enough.

462
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,577
DEAN: Someone say there were
some girls coming or something...

463
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,297
Not that I'm...
I'm engaged, actually.

464
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,777
Not that that stops anyone.

465
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,617
But... Yeah, I'm not being...

466
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,777
Why are you so jumpy, mate?
HARRY: He's late.

467
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,617
He's late for
a very important date.

468
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,777
Ship's comedian, this one.

469
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,097
Grab some coffee, Dean.
WOMAN: Hello, boys.

470
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,417
Hey!
Ladies!

471
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,537
How are you?

472
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,777
JOHN: Esther and Kristy,
this is Dean and Harry.

473
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,297
Kristy? Esther?
Kristy.

474
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,777
Kristy.
WOMAN: Esther.

475
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,577
Esther! Hello, Esther.
Aren't you meant to stand up for us?

476
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,177
Sorry. You're right. We are.
Pleased to meet you, boys.

477
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,097
Do you want to sit down?
It's alright. I'll sit on your lap.

478
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,137
JOHN: So where's Emma?
Is that your hat?

479
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,817
You're not...
Where's Emma?

480
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,657
...attached to any of these...
KRISTY: Esther, where's Emma?

481
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,777
Illegal.
No, they're just the boys.

482
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,097
MAN: Oh, just the boys.
Just the boys, the boys.

483
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,737
KRISTY: Esther,
stop being such a hussy.

484
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,497
Where's Emma?

485
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,817
She's with the other one.

486
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,097
Where the fuck is she?

487
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,217
MAN: It's cool.
What do you mean, where is she?

488
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,697
MAN 2: Oi. Oi.
Don't fucking "oi" me.

489
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,177
I've been playing cards
here with you.

490
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,577
Oh, stop being such a hussy.
MAN: She's in the restaurant, John.

491
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,097
Look at you.

492
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,577
When he's looking at ya,

493
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,337
that's when he's interested
in what you're saying.

494
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,577
Was he looking at you?
Was I talking to you? No.

495
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,977
No. No. No.
No. Fucking dickhead.

496
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,537
Exactly. I don't know where Emma is.

497
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,457
Girls, want to find Emma, bring her
back in here, for just a minute?

498
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,737
Would you? Go find Emma,
bring her back in.

499
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,217
Dickhead.
JOHN: Thanks.

500
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,777
WOMAN: See you, boys.
Thanks.

501
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,977
HARRY: Ah!
DEAN: They'll be back, mate.

502
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,897
DEAN: Sam's a totally
respectable guy, John,

503
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,377
if that's, you know, what's...

504
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,537
He's completely honourable. Yep.

505
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,847
He might be a virgin, for all I know.

506
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,217
So are you guys
going to the Gulf or what?

507
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,537
Par 40.
Pass by it. Yeah.

508
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,337
MAN: You see some action?
Yeah, a bit.

509
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,817
Yep?
MAN 2: What sort?

510
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,617
Skirmishes, mainly. Pirates.
We saw a fucking fishing boat, Dean.

511
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,337
He was so excited. This is
his most exciting day on the ship.

512
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,297
...to talk about it.
We saw a boat.

513
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,137
That he thought was a pirate boat.
He ordered the side-arms out.

514
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,737
Basically, things
that the militia can't handle...

515
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,537
...falls to us.

516
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,209
HARRY: Like fishing boats.

517
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,457
MAN: No pirates, huh?
They're out there.

518
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,097
And it's part of our job
to keep our eyes peeled for 'em.

519
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,251
Yeah, yeah, Captain Bluebeard,
Yellowbeard, Blackbeard...

520
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,377
Yeah, I could have
gone over there too, yeah.

521
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,897
ASIO, they wanted me.

522
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,697
Where? ASIO doesn't go to war.

523
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,137
How do you know
ASIO wanted you exactly?

524
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,377
Because they came to our school.
Came to your school?

525
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,777
High school, yeah.
ASIO came to your high school?

526
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,497
When was that?
'92.

527
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,217
'92, was it?

528
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,457
Well, it was right after
Gulf the prequel, yeah.

529
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,697
(MEN LAUGH)

530
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,335
Episode one.

531
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,537
Exactly.

532
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,977
So, you know, they were
talking about spies in Australia

533
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,817
and what to look out for and whatnot,
and this ASIO dude told me

534
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,017
that I had the right kind of profile
to be a political assassin.

535
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,537
Dickhead. Dickhead.

536
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,337
ASIO don't have assassins.

537
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,417
Who you calling dickhead, dickhead?
You.

538
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,697
ASIO don't have assassins?

539
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,457
That's what they
want you to believe.

540
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,817
I was fucking in every fucking class
you were in, Tony.

541
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,217
I never saw any ASIO dudes. Bullshit.
Bullshit, bullshit.

542
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,817
He told me if I channelled myself
into some kind of focus,

543
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,977
I could have been
one of the best ever, in the world.

544
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,577
That's pretty good.
Thank you.

545
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,337
There was no fucking ASIO dude,
dickhead!

546
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,977
Fucking drop it!
Told me that if I channelled...

547
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,457
Fucking drop it!

548
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,177
Settle the fuck down,
will you, please, for fuck's sake!

549
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,057
Maybe Tony wanted to play
with the ASIO dude's Glock.

550
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,412
(MEN LAUGH)

551
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,497
I didn't... (MUMBLES)

552
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,177
It's fucking true.
HARRY: Yeah. I'm...

553
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,817
Not that part.
No, no, no. I was more...

554
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,017
Nothing.

555
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,977
So did you guys ever kill anybody?

556
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,737
It's not something we talk about.
What's the matter? You get like?

557
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,337
Bad flashbacks or...
Shut the fuck up, Tony.

558
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,497
Hey, hey, hey.
That's a legit question.

559
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,417
MAN: Sorry, bad question.

560
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,497
Bad question.
HARRY: It's cool, man.

561
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,657
No, no, 'cause my grandfather
was in the Italian army.

562
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,217
Oh, really?
Yeah.

563
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,977
Like 50 million years ago. But...
I won't go into the boring details.

564
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,297
(COUGHS) Bullshit. (SNIFFS)
Shut the fuck up, Tony.

565
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,457
Oh.

566
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,137
No, no, but, you know.

567
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,177
50 medals later, he did alright.

568
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,337
Did really well.
(TONY COUGHS) Bullshit.

569
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,097
But he never wanted to talk about it.
Can we just play cards?

570
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,897
Do you mind, mate?
It didn't fucking happen.

571
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,017
It fucking happened, mate.
You just need to shut the fuck up!

572
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,497
Will you shut the fuck up?!

573
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,697
(SILENCE)

574
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,977
What have you got?
My 50's in.

575
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,737
Can I borrow another 50?

576
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,057
OK. It's in the ledger.
Thanks.

577
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,137
So are you sober enough
for this, Tony, or what?

578
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,217
JOHN: Want two?

579
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,577
Don't need to be, playing you, V.
Hey. At least I've got some left.

580
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,897
Yeah? Dickhead.

581
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,857
Four for me, John.
How many do you want?

582
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,817
Uh, no.
MAN: I'll get off your mum later.

583
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,297
You're fine?
I'm right.

584
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,777
I betcha.
You what?

585
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,577
How many do you want?

586
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,377
Fuck it! Three.

587
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,414
That's a wicked poker face he's got.
Mate, I'm jinxed. I'm telling you.

588
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,097
You're on.

589
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,214
Not yet. Gotta wait for Tony
to bet, check or fold.

590
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,097
What are you gonna do?
Come on, dickhead. Good game.

591
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,577
Quick game.

592
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,737
Tony folds. I fold.

593
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,777
HARRY: I'm going to raise...

594
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,297
Bet.
Bet?

595
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,527
I'm gonna bet the three.

596
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,737
JOHN: 300?
Mm-hm.

597
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,497
You got a streak on, do you?
Is that alright?

598
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,097
Are you kidding me?
What about you, sunshine?

599
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,537
Fucking out.

600
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,137
Owe you 50, owe you 250.
Do you need to borrow it?

601
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,657
I'm right, mate.
I'll win it back in a sec.

602
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,457
OK.
Let's see ya.

603
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,925
Let's see, mate.

604
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,377
Fuck me.

605
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,737
I'm getting sick of this shit.
I'm getting really pissed off.

606
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,257
How the fuck did you do that?
Is that good?

607
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,248
That'll be a flush.

608
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,687
That is fucking bullshit.
OK.

609
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,857
Hey, Johnny. I can't find her.

610
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,457
I'll just be back in a sec.
I'll come with you.

611
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,130
No, it's alright. You stay here.
I wasn't asking permission, mate.

612
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,337
I hope you and I
can stay friends, Harry.

613
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,097
With that in mind,
I think I'll pick up my winnings.

614
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,257
TONY: You can't just call it quits.
No, no, bullshit.

615
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,297
Mate, you're fucking ahead.
Bad sportsmanship. You know it.

616
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,537
Wait, you're leaving the table?
Are you going to the toilet?

617
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,897
If you are, you can leave the table.
If not, then you can't if no-one...

618
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,857
Is that right? You making
the fucking rules, are you, sunshine?

619
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,897
Harry, for Christ's sake.
Leave the money. Let's go find Sam.

620
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,097
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want
any trouble, but... You understand?

621
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,937
Yeah, no, fair enough.
OK. He's got a point.

622
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,297
No, it's alright. It's alright.
You can take the fucking money.

623
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,537
You won it fair and square.
I just want to know how you did it.

624
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,697
You weren't cheating.
I can tell that.

625
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,415
What were you doing?
You were counting them?

626
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,577
Magician never tells.

627
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,657
Well, you can tell me.

628
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,577
Some people just win at cards.

629
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,697
I don't think you understand.

630
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,777
See, I'm seriously asking you
to tell me.

631
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,377
It's fine. You won the money.

632
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,977
You can walk out of here,
both of you, no problem, no trouble.

633
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,050
Just tell me how you did it,
that's all. What is it?

634
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,177
Luck.

635
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,097
I found her. Fucking the other sailor
up on the roof.

636
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,577
You fucking arsehole!
Where's my other 100?

637
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,377
(BOTH ARGUE)

638
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,737
Whoa! Hey, yo!

639
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,657
Here we go.

640
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,897
Oi!

641
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,097
Arggh!

642
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,577
Jesus!

643
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,215
Shit!

644
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,250
Sammy!

645
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,537
Sam! Fuck!

646
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,017
Shit!

647
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,008
Wait, stop, stop, stop.
Wait, wait, wait.

648
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,213
Ow!
Arsehole!

649
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,736
Shithead.

650
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,537
Hey!

651
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,537
(SHOUTS)
Hey!

652
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,257
Ow!

653
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,577
(YELLS)

654
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,177
Go! Go!
Fuck!

655
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,777
Shit!
Go, go, go!

656
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,457
Shit!

657
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,057
JOHN: Hey, come here...
Taxi! Taxi!

658
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,297
Shit!
Emma!

659
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,457
Hey! Emma!
Get in! Get in! Get in!

660
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,817
Give him the money!
Give him the money!

661
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,377
Come here! Come here!

662
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,413
Fuck!

663
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,137
HARRY: Dean the ma-fucking-chine.

664
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,217
I did not think
we were gonna make it, man.

665
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,817
HARRY: Cheers, brother.
DEAN: No sweat.

666
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,137
HARRY: You should have seen him,
Sammy. Fists of steel.

667
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,977
So was the little waitress
worth all that, Sam?

668
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,857
EMMA: Oh, well, you'd hope so,
wouldn't you?

669
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,657
What the fuck's she doing here?

670
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,137
Hi. Sorry, ma'am.
Hi.

671
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,537
What the fuck's she doing here?
Poor Johnny's such a wannabe.

672
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,777
Can my jaw disagree with you?
DEAN: What is she doing here?

673
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,177
SAM: Have a small adventure
until we ship out in the morning.

674
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,537
A small adventure?
Fisher!

675
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,057
I shouldn't have told you guys.

676
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,297
Jake-O told me 'cause he was pissed
and you guys took it seriously.

677
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,417
Stole over a grand off 'em.
Stole over a grand off your cousin.

678
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,057
Just keep it on the hush-hush.
I'll make it worth your while.

679
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,337
I knew I shouldn't
have told you guys.

680
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,217
You should ignore him, by the way.
Well, am I in the way?

681
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,737
No, hardly, ma chérie!

682
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,577
And don't trust this one at all.

683
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,377
No, I don't think I should.

684
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,457
DEAN: We're supposed to meet them
at a Japanese restaurant.

685
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,377
HARRY: The gang, are they?
DEAN: Sally, Fred and Kathy.

686
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,977
Can you drop us
in the city somewhere?

687
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,417
Can you fuck them off for a while?
My fiancée.

688
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,057
HARRY: For Sammy. For an hour.

689
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,897
Guy fun, Dean.
HARRY: No, OK, for me, then.

690
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,537
Please don't leave me with Prince
and the fucking showgirl back here.

691
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,257
Oh! I got a better idea, Harry.
Why don't you go with Dean?

692
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,657
And Sam and I can go back
to his hotel room.

693
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,057
I think that's a terrible idea.
That is a great idea.

694
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,417
Sounds like the plan, Stan.
Your vote doesn't count, sweetheart.

695
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,697
Says who?
DEAN: Sammy, I want you to meet her.

696
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,217
Oh, for fuck's sake, Dean!

697
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,777
Why would it be necessary

698
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,007
for me to meet your fiancée
and her fucking parents?

699
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,134
Why would I need to do that?

700
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,457
How about this?

701
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,097
How about we all get out in the city,

702
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,937
Dean goes and has
the Partridge Family wet dream

703
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,017
and you, me and the delectable Emma

704
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,017
all go have really fancy
motherfucking cocktails.

705
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,457
HARRY: How does that sound?
SAM: Cocktails it is.

706
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,890
Cocktails it fucking is.

707
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,137
Friend of mine got beaten up
in Hyde Park, by 15 guys.

708
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,937
A friend of mine did.
Yeah, right.

709
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,177
1515-year-olds.
They asked for his wallet.

710
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,537
He gave them his wallet.
Then they beat the shit out of him.

711
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,777
Doesn't matter if they're 15.
If there's 15 of them, you're rooted.

712
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,052
You don't get that in Perth.

713
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,969
How was Sam in the taxi?

714
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,257
Never seen him like that before.
Yeah, it's good.

715
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,329
Something's up, I reckon.
Yeah, his dick.

716
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,137
Speaking of which, do I have you
as my wingman later this evening,

717
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,857
or are you being all dedicated?

718
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,017
I'm always dedicated.
What was Tokyo?

719
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,292
Shut the fuck up about Tokyo.
It was fun.

720
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,617
Be nice to have one last hurrah.

721
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,857
Yeah, it would,
with my fucking girlfriend.

722
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,973
Fiancée.
Shut up.

723
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,857
Harry.

724
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,495
EMMA: Come on! Catch up to me!

725
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,257
Heh-hey! Are you OK
running in those shoes?

726
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,777
Yeah, they're flat but hard.

727
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,417
If I had flat shoes on
like you, though...

728
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,137
Well, I'm not carrying you.

729
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,297
How much fitness
do you have to do in the...

730
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,497
Well, it obviously hasn't paid off.

731
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,700
What the fuck am I doing?

732
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,377
What the fuck am I doing?

733
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,254
Let's go faster.

734
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,297
Did you see a navy guy come down
here, an officer? Brown hair?

735
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,817
Yeah, running.
With a blonde girl?

736
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,417
Where? This way?

737
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,897
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

738
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,617
Have you seen, like,
another officer anywhere?

739
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,737
About this tall, with a blonde girl?

740
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,617
No.
No?

741
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,097
OK. Thanks anyway.
MAN: We'd see a uniform, though.

742
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,977
Yeah, good point.

743
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,897
Fucking arsehole.

744
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,377
Sammy!

745
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,297
Emma!

746
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,617
Who's Emma?
Who's... The fucking waitress. Emma!

747
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,497
What part of Scotland are you from?
Glasgow.

748
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,737
OK. Cool. I'm not
walking with you at all. You...

749
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,331
Have a good night. See ya.

750
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,057
Not at all? OK. Thank you very much.

751
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,977
Excuse me.
If you see him, his name's Sam.

752
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,457
Have you seen
another navy officer around?

753
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,257
Tell him he's in big trouble.

754
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,017
Thank you very much.
Sort of Italian-Iooking.

755
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,817
No.
Alright. Cheers.

756
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,297
I'd do her, but...

757
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,257
What, the Scottish one?
No.

758
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,897
I mean even the kind of
50s blonde bob one.

759
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,697
You're nuts.

760
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,737
He's off fucking someone.
What we should be doing.

761
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,337
Sammy!

762
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,373
Are you off fucking someone?
Dean.

763
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,857
He's scarpered. He's bolted.

764
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,177
You keep saying that
like it's a new idea.

765
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,537
Bad-bad or just bad?

766
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,528
Um...

767
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,490
Oh, alright.

768
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,537
I cried in f...

769
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,528
I cried in front of the whole crew.

770
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,217
Well, everyone.

771
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,497
Oh, that's bad.
Yeah, I know.

772
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,297
I cried like a little girl.
Baby.

773
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,857
Like a baby girl,
in front of the whole crew.

774
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,817
That's not funny. That's sad.

775
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,457
Where do you, um...
where do you sleep on the ship?

776
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,657
Bottom or top bunk?
What's it to you?

777
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,337
I reckon you'd go bottom bunk.
Am I top or bottom?

778
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,817
Yeah, you'd be bottom bunk.

779
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,657
What about you?
What are you doing here? Huh?

780
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,977
What, lying in the middle of the park
with a sailor?

781
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,777
Yeah.
I don't know. Pretty cute.

782
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,457
Alright.

783
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,097
But I've never lied in a park
with a sailor before.

784
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,057
Well, that's good.
That's good to know.

785
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,697
Yeah.
Neither have I.

786
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,217
I can live with that.

787
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,685
The uniform's
actually quite nice. Yeah.

788
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,777
So you'll just go wherever...

789
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,457
Yeah.
Anywhere?

790
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,977
No.

791
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,057
Not Ukraine.
Yeah?

792
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,577
Uruguay.

793
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,737
Um... Yugoslavia.

794
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,737
OK.
Just all the 'U' countries.

795
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,097
Yeah, right.
Both of those.

796
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,577
What could you possibly
have against...

797
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,777
Nothing. I just don't... Yeah.
That's none of my business.

798
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,377
And also Rotorua, New Zealand.

799
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,337
I went there on a soccer tour,
and it...

800
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,657
It's, like, got egg gases.
Smells like fart.

801
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,257
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

802
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,137
What about you?

803
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,137
Do you speak any other languages?

804
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,571
No.

805
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,097
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

806
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,577
No?

807
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,137
Can you do that again?

808
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,697
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
What are you saying?

809
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,737
"What would you like me to say?"
Oh.

810
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,057
I was hoping... Yeah, OK.
Some dirty French?

811
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,446
Mmm.
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

812
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,417
Uh, that is really sexy.

813
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,217
Really?
Yeah. It's really sexy.

814
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,217
Well, I actually said...
No, I won't tell you.

815
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,457
What?

816
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,697
Ask me something
and I'll tell you how to say it.

817
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,697
And then you've got to say it
with a French accent.

818
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,217
Um...

819
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,095
"Will you..." (LAUGHS)

820
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,057
"Will you kiss me?"

821
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,337
Did you think I was gonna say that?
Yeah.

822
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,817
Est-ce...

823
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,250
No, um... Oh.

824
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,097
Uh... Well, 'je t'embrasse'
is to kiss.

825
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,697
Like, "I kiss you." So...

826
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,497
So... you'd say, "C'est possible,"
"It's possible,"

827
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,930
or... (SPEAKS FRENCH)

828
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,250
Dunno.

829
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,177
Did I make you up?

830
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,777
I mean... Am I... am I insane?

831
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,337
Two separate questions.

832
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,851
Probably... Yeah. No. Yes.

833
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,777
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

834
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,737
Sorry. That was really stupid.

835
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,137
Just 'cause I'm speaking French
that you can kiss me?

836
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,417
Oh, yeah. I wanted to
before that. But...

837
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,937
Really? When?

838
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,937
I think... like, a good...

839
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,088
...the kind of the second I, um...

840
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,055
Shut up. Shut up.

841
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,137
Mmm.
Mmm.

842
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,617
Mmm.

843
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,050
Awkward.
(LAUGHS)

844
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,937
What if it's more like a...

845
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,177
No, OK. That's it.

846
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,937
Two strikes.
That won't... That won't...

847
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,057
Well, I'm gonna save the last one
for the...

848
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,857
Yeah. So we'II... That batter
just didn't go up to bat.

849
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,577
OK.
Just went home.

850
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,697
So I got... one more go.
So two strikes.

851
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,617
Yeah.
OK.

852
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,937
OK.
You could bunt, though.

853
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,817
I could bunt?
Yeah.

854
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,097
I would really like...

855
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,697
You could do a Sax,
like running squeeze or push bunt.

856
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,894
I would love to bunt you.
Would you?

857
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,697
Anyway, I don't have any money.
I've only got, like, $40. So...

858
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,577
Maybe we might have to go down
to, like, Wollongong or something.

859
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,329
But I do have a car.

860
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,495
There...

861
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,377
There's something I have to do first.

862
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,817
About this tall. Brown hair.

863
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,297
With a blonde girl.

864
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,057
Looks a bit Italian-ish.
This kind of uniform.

865
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,937
No?

866
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,697
Could I wear your hat?

867
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,377
HARRY: No. Sorry,
that's against regulations.

868
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,857
Do you want a photo?
With you.

869
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,977
With me? You want a photo? OK.

870
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,497
Sure. We got time for a photo?

871
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,057
I'll definitely sign you.
BOTH: Me too?

872
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,577
Rose between two thorns?

873
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,017
Anywhere? On the fun stuff?
It's been six months.

874
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,217
OK.
You can't spell your name, Harry?

875
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,777
You've got to press it.

876
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,617
Oh, I was talking. Let's do it again.
What about kissing each cheek?

877
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,377
What about kissing each cheek?

878
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,697
Dean! Hello, Dean.
DEAN: Yeah, goodo.

879
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,297
You like a, um, s... sail man.

880
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,777
Hey. He's been on the ship
for six months. So...

881
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,377
Good work, guys. Keep on sailing.
Would you give him a kiss?

882
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,017
HARRY: You happy?
GIRL: Yep.

883
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,857
OK. You haven't seen our friend?
The navy guy?

884
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,857
GIRLS: No.
No. OK.

885
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,777
You're very pretty, by the way.
Thank you!

886
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,097
You really are. You're very pretty.
You're very handsome too.

887
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,617
Fucking hell. Did you see that?

888
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,857
Did you see that?
I took a photo of it.

889
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,937
(LAUGHS)

890
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,097
That was fun.
They were pretty cute.

891
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,577
They're 12.

892
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,577
Old enough to bleed,
old enough to butcher.

893
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,417
Grass on the wicket,
right to play cricket.

894
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,737
(SNORTS) You've got it in you. See?

895
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,217
You have got it in you.

896
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,017
Sorry to interrupt.
Sorry to... interrupt.

897
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,497
Excuse me. Have you seen
a, uh... a navy officer?

898
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,337
Brown hair.
With a blonde girl.

899
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,337
Not RAN?

900
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,097
Can you tell him
he's in big trouble?

901
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,657
So, what, you just sit down?

902
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,497
When you get dumped on
every single day, Dean,

903
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,249
you get real good
at making yourself invisible.

904
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,177
Where are we meeting your fiancée?

905
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,417
Um, Juju's.
Great.

906
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,137
No idea where it is.
Awesome.

907

SONG: # Don't hold back

00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,097

914
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,137
What are you doing?
It's the best song.

915
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,337
Turn it back up.
(TURNS MUSIC UP)

916

taking off your... #

917
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,377
(TURNS MUSIC OFF)
Well, go on, then.

918
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,857
Go on, what?

919
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,457
Tell me a story
if there's gonna be no music.

920
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,937
Um... Alright, uh...

921
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:52,537
Alright, um, can you slow down
just a tiny bit, do you mind? Cheers.

922
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:56,497
I worked with my grandad
until I signed up.

923
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:03,457
He's 84 and he still...
he still runs the local leagues club.

924
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,057
Uh, I managed...
Just a bit. Slow... Sorry. Sorry.

925
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,417
I managed... I managed
the bar there for a bit until, um...

926
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,577
...until I was fired
by my own grandad.

927
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,537
And... that's...

928
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,137
Dad. No, Dad fucked off
when I was two.

929
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,093
So it was just me, Mum and Pop.

930
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,057
That... that's kind of it. I'm sorry.
It's not very exciting.

931
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,297
Yeah, I think you should get out.

932
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,777
Are you serious?

933
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,257
Yeah.

934
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,690
OK, very funny. Come on.

935
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,537
Can we go, please?
No.

936
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,057
Come on.

937
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,537
Oh!

938
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,017
Oh.

939
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,857
Oh, come on, it wasn't that hard.

940
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,617
No, it's...

00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,257
MAN: What's all this bloody hoo-ha?
Oh, God.

1095
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,577
No bloody sleep as it is,
and when I finally bloody drift off,

1096
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,377
it's disturbed by bloody strangers.

1097
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,057
(LAUGHS)
Hey, Pop.

1098
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,537
Hey, Pop.
Oh! How are you? Good to see you.

1099
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,057
You too. You look great.

1100
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,977
Cover yourself up, Dad!
Oh, hello!

1101
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,657
Bob Fisher, Sam's feeble old
grandfather. Pleased to meet you.

1102
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,377
Pop, this is Emma.
Sorry it's so late.

1103
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,777
This isn't late.
You've come to a party house!

1104
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,497
BERNIE: Yeah, rage a minute.
(BOB LAUGHS)

1105
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,777
Come on.
(LAUGHS)

1106
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,417
Come on, Emma.
Help me with the drinks.

1107
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,497
It's a new millennium, Bern.

1108
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,897
Why don't you ladies
go and put your feet up

1109
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,177
while the men go hunt and gather?

1110
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,897
He's just trying
to impress you, Emma.

1111
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,047
Don't you burn down
my kitchen again, Dad.

1112
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,977
You what?
(SPEAKS CANTONESE)

1113
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,457
No, no, no, look.

1114
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,577
What I'm saying is, my name is
down there, and I'm ready to do it.

1115
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,657
I don't want to have
an argument with you. OK?

1116
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,897
No, no, no...
No, no...

1117
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,097
Do you think I need
to come and step in?

1118
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,697
Oh, my God.
I'm happy to.

1119
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,377
HARRY: Dean.
If you guys...

1120
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,897
HARRY: Yeah. I mean...

1121
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,977
He is so embarrassing.
I know.

1122
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,297
He's just so uncultural.

1123
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,337
Yeah, no, no. Speak English, OK?
(SPEAKS CANTONESE)

1124
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,177
Look. You...

1125
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,337
Watch it, now. Watch it.

1126
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,857
I'm sorry, but I think this is
getting a little bit out of control.

1127
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,897
I'm next on here, and I'm pissed off.

1128
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,617
Hey! Hey! Come over here.

1129
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,617
HARRY: Come. Come, come.
Come over here. Look. Look at this.

1130
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:58,057
I spoke to... Come here.
How you doing?

1131
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,577
SALLY: You know what?
HARRY: Can they squeeze in here?

1132
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,857
Oh, well, just...
Sorry. Sorry, no.

1133
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,257
KATHY: I'm sorry, girls.
HARRY: What is your name?

1134
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,257
Hang on. It's OK. What's your name?

1135
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,617
KATHY: I'm sorry, girls.

1136
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,617
Anna.
Anna.

1137
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,737
He's taking no notice.
His name's down there.

1138
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,537
And my name is next. OK?

1139
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,497
Excuse me. I'm quite
uncomfortable about this.

1140
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,697
With the contact?
She's got her hand on your leg.

1141
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,177
Anna! You...

1142
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,217
What, are you trying
to break up some...

1143
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,657
This is a beautiful relationship.
KATHY: I'm just having a hot flush.

1144
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,137
I love it, Anna. I love it.

1145
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,697
Yeah. You tell him to
go and sit down for a minute.

1146
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,337
Sorry? What language
are you speaking now?

1147
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,977
Can you show Dean...
show Dean your butterfly?

1148
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,977
Can you show your butterfly?
What butterfly?

1149
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,537
You know what butterfly.

1150
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,257
You know exactly what butterfly
I'm talking about.

1151
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,857
Show him the butterfly.
Dean. Check the butterfly out.

1152
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,817
KATHY: Oh!
DEAN: Oh!

1153
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,537
Do you know what?
It's quite beautiful.

1154
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,817
DEAN: Inappropriate.
Do you have any butterflies, Anna?

1155
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,897
(SPEAKS JAPANESE)
Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah.

1156
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,817
Well, I don't think
we'll be coming here again.

1157
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,657
Sally! Come on, don't play that role.

1158
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,817
That's not a fun... That's not fun.
That's not fun at the dinner table.

1159
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,497
KATHY: That's lovely.

1160
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,177
That's very attractive.
HARRY: I'll tell you what.

1161
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,417
I'll tell you what.
What if we got a little, like...

1162
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,457
Dean! Check this out.
See what I'm saying?

1163
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,577
OK.

1164
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:12,137
See how it feels?
Yeah, it's terrible.

1165
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,817
HARRY: It's all a little party.
You're not studying? What do you do?

1166
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,657
You just go over there,
sit down and wait,

1167
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,377
and I'll be a few minutes, right?

1168
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,017
OK, yep. See you. OK.

1169
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,657
Yep. Piss off. Piss off.

1170
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,488
Oh.

1171
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,417
I've been wanting a good burger
for six months, Pop.

1172
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,850
Uh-huh.

1173
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,576
How's the club?

1174
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,377
Mum said you might be expanding.

1175
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,049
(SNORTS)

1176
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,813
You still cleaning up after Simon?

1177
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,257
Simon's a good man.
Yeah, I know.

1178
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,857
Hard worker.
Yeah, but...

1179
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,497
You know, you always say that he's...
I know what I always say.

1180
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,965
I always say it.
But it's not for you to say, though.

1181
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,377
I'm probably gonna
be made petty officer, Pop.

1182
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,377
What's that?

1183
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,097
I'm... I'm gonna be made
petty officer.

1184
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,817
Probably.

1185
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,857
You're joking, mate.

1186
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,897
Nope.

1187
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,897
I was petty officer.

1188
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,137
I know. Why do you think
I requested the position?

1189
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,057
(LAUGHS) Hey, that's terrific.

1190
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,137
My boy the petty officer.

1191
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,777
Oh, they'll love that,
Simon and the lads.

1192
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,177
(LAUGHS) Really stick it to 'em.

1193
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,452
Don't... don't tell Mum
until it's all definite, though.

1194
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,290
You're a good kid.

1195
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,377
You've got a great smile.

1196
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,657
What are you talking about?
(LAUGHS)

1197
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,888
Get your hand off it
and pass me the bloody onions.

1198
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,497
So, what's this problem
with you, Fred?

1199
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,097
FRED: Just argumentative, you know.

1200
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,937
I mean, he can speak
perfectly good English,

1201
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:26,337
but it's that thing, he just wanted
to, um, make me think that, um,

1202
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,977
I couldn't understand him.

1203
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,457
I knew perfectly well that he was
trying to jump the queue there.

1204
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,817
SALLY: Dad! You're horrible!
FRED: Was I?

1205
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,617
Deano.

1206
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,857
Eye on the time, Harry.

1207
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,497
I think we should...

1208
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,777
What's going on with you two?
You got some...

1209
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,497
Couple of hot dates or something?

1210
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,337
Gotta go meet Monica and Anna.

1211
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,417
(HARRY AND SALLY LAUGH)

1212
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,337
DEAN: No, it's just, um...
HARRY: It's just... our friend.

1213
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,097
Yeah.
What?

1214
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,737
HARRY: Uh, he's with a girl.
Oh, who's with a girl?

1215
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,817
That's who I was talking to on the
phone before. He's gone somewhere.

1216
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,817
We've got to go
get him now, actually.

1217
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:04,137
DEAN: Going through a bit of a rough
time and they're strict on rollcall.

1218
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,937
He's a really great bloke, actually.
Wish you guys could have met him.

1219
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,417
But he's...

1220
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,817
Excuse the salty language.
He's a bit of a fucking drop kick.

1221
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,737
DEAN: He's had a rough time.

1222
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,457
Look, the XO took a... (COUGHS)
...dislike to him, and, um...

1223
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,977
Can leave it at that.
Yeah, well.

1224
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,537
FRED: What, a little man
with a big dollop of power?

1225
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,177
That's it, Fred.
Had one in the academy.

1226
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,937
The academy?
Fred wasn't a bang-bang copper.

1227
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,417
I was in records, actually.

1228
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,377
Uh! I didn't say that.

1229
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,297
(LAUGHS)

1230
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,257
Because of his hip.
Filing, mostly.

1231
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,977
It was his hip.
Yeah.

1232
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,097
Well, yeah, I have a wonky hip.
Thank you, Kath.

1233
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:42,217
No, there was this guy.
He was named Trevor Sinclair.

1234
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,897
Oh, God, Trevor Sinclair!

1235
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,137
Yeah, well, he was
the drill instructor.

1236
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,257
Can't remember anything about
the ugly-Iooking prick's face

1237
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,937
apart from the fact
that he had this great big vein

1238
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,537
that ran right down
the middle of his forehead, right,

1239
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,416
and it would pulsate
every time he screamed at me.

1240
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,617
You're being quite random, Fred.

1241
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,977
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

1242
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,857
OK. So, uh, yeah. Anyway.

1243
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,377
What's happened? Has your friend
gone AWOL or something?

1244
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,137
If you say that, he gets arrested.

1245
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,457
I don't think anyone can hear me.

1246
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,977
Is he in trouble or something?
What goes on at sea stays at sea.

1247
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:20,057
Oh, and other shite, Dean.
You know, I think you should tell us.

1248
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,137
Oh, come on. We want to hear it.
Come on.

1249
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,337
They want to hear it.
Shut up, Harry.

1250
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,737
Come on. They want to hear it.
We want to hear it.

1251
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,417
Yeah, you should tell them, actually.
KATHY: Who are we gonna tell?

1252
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,137
HARRY: Yeah, who are they gonna tell?
You tell us, then, Harry.

1253
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,537
Alright, fine, I will tell you.
I don't think you'll tell anything.

1254
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,017
Actually, I don't know what...

1255
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,257
I just don't think
it's dinner conversation.

1256
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,217
Oh, we've finished dinner,
so it doesn't matter. So just tell us.

1257
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,217
He's protecting me.
He's so predictable.

1258
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,057
We'll clear the table.
We're family, you know.

1259
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,257
You're related, almost.
Tell you one of the tamer ones.

1260
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,777
Uh... One of the ones I know, anyway.
KATHY: Good.

1261
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:56,457
DEAN: It was Easter Sunday.
Sam was on laundry duty that week.

1262
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,937
And he hadn't put the uniforms
in the dryer overnight.

1263
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,977
So when he did 'em...
WOMAN: Some more sake, sir?

1264
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,657
Yeah, bring it on.
Oh, great.

1265
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,137
Thank you.
Thank you.

1266
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,897
I might grab that.
Anyone? Anything?

1267
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,097
DEAN: So when he did the uniforms
in the morning,

1268
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,777
they all had that rotting damp smell.

1269
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,577
KATHY: Mmm. Oh, God,
I hate that smell.

1270
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,537
Right, and it's, like,
the officers' uniforms,

1271
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,777
so they were off-the-charts angry.

1272
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:20,257
And... Like, you have to ration,
you know, washing, showers, out there.

1273
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,577
So they're walking around
in these uniforms all week

1274
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,897
stinking like dead birds.

1275
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:28,097
So two of us were ordered
to take Sam into the bathroom...

1276
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,057
You?
HARRY: Deano? Mate.

1277
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,257
And we ordered him to strip,
which he did, quickly.

1278
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,017
And we cuffed him to the sink.

1279
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,977
And we were given steel wool
and deck brushes,

1280
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,497
which we used to scrub him down with
until he was bloody and raw.

1281
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,857
They were the exact orders.

1282
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,097
He didn't make a sound
the whole time.

1283
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:50,017
And when it was done,
Glenn, the executive officer, and I,

1284
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,857
urinated on the wounds.

1285
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,497
Then we hosed him off,
put his uniform back on him,

1286
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,977
took him back to his post.

1287
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,888
So...

1288
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,497
There. You happy now?
That's torture.

1289
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,097
You're given an order and you take it,
otherwise you're next.

1290
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,697
Dean did what any of us...

1291
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,617
I mean, that's disgusting.
That's torture.

1292
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,497
SALLY: Mum! Lay off him.
That's disgusting.

1293
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,577
Lay off him! He just
told us something full-on.

1294
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,177
He told us something disgusting.
That's absolutely disgusting.

1295
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,457
Yeah, OK, and he gets an order
and he takes it.

1296
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,577
That's an excuse. I'm sorry,
that is absolutely an excuse.

1297
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,577
SALLY: Mum! Shut up!
FRED: It's the navy.

1298
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:26,137
The navy, exactly.
It's the Royal... the Royal Navy!

1299
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,737
Yeah, well, she's a monarchist.

1300
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,257
Now, just settle down, Kath.
It happens everywhere.

1301
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,057
It's a bit like Janine, you know...
Janine?

1302
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,137
...when she was harassing you
at the pharmacy...

1303
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,737
Oh, for heaven's sake,
it's nothing like that.

1304
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,537
On a... you know,
on a different scale.

1305
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,137
It's nothing like that.
On a different scale.

1306
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,617
How can, um, we help, Deano?

1307
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,417
KATHY: You know what you do? You...

1308
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,417
You report him to the authorities
and you get him booted out quick smart.

1309
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,817
FRED: No, no, you don't do that.
That is what you do!

1310
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,857
That is what you do. Why not?
No, you don't.

1311
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,337
Because the navy's like the force.
The force?!

1312
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,457
Oh, God, give it a rest!

1313
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,697
You don't go dobbing somebody in.
Shut up about the force!

1314
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:02,337
Well, no wonder he's gone AWOL.
Don't fucking say AWOL.

1315
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,337
Sorry, Kath.
HARRY: He's with a girl.

1316
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:07,937
He's just... That's... the size of it.
He's with a girl.

1317
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,610
Let's shoot from the hip.
KATHY: Oh, what, your wonky hip?

1318
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,257
Your mate's a deserter.
Go look up the word 'torture', Fred.

1319
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,257
Look, I'm just saying, that's the way
he will be treated if he's convicted.

1320
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,452
Shit a brick, woman!

1321
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,777
FRED: Ju... Look.

1322
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,657
If he's gonna do the disappearing act,
he has to do it right, right?

1323
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,137
That's all I'm saying to them.
Right? Not just the state.

1324
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,217
He has to get out of
the whole bloody country.

1325
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,337
I mightn't know much,
but I know that much.

1326
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,297
Listen to Carl Bernstein over here.

1327
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,417
Yeah, well, I would prefer to
refer to myself as Bob Woodward.

1328
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,937
Thank you very much.

1329
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,609
Well, you can't be Woodward,
'cause he's dishy.

1330
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,577
KATHY: You get yourself
a top-shelf lawyer.

1331
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,457
Just do that. You deny everything
and you just hope for the best.

1332
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,937
That's what you do.

1333
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,416
I'm sorry, I'm just a little bit...

1334
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,885
I'm sorry, Dean, love, it's not
your fault. It's just that this...

1335
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,337
I'll say a prayer for your friend.
Look.

1336
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:08,257
I might be able to help him
get out of the country.

1337
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,057
You and your wonky hip are gonna help,
are you, Fred? Oh, my God.

1338
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,977
KATHY: Can we have the check?
HARRY: Let's get the check.

1339
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,097
KATHY: Get the check.
Check!

1340
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,417
The house is just getting
too big for us.

1341
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,297
Losing the garden's
gonna kill me, naturally.

1342
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,097
Are... are you gonna tell your mother?
Tell me what?

1343
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,377
Oh. No, I don't really
want to show off, Pop.

1344
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,971
He's been made petty officer.

1345
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,017
Is that right?

1346
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,337
It's not official yet.

1347
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,697
Isn't that amazing?
Amazing's the word.

1348
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,617
Hey, guess what. Did Sam tell you
when he caught a tiger shark?

1349
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,137
Emma!
What's this?

1350
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,977
Sam. Anyway, I'll tell the story,
'cause, you know, he's too modest.

1351
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,737
So the boys have the day off
and so they're on the boat fishing.

1352
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,417
And then after, like, an hour,

1353
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,097
he notices something
on the end of the fishing rod,

1354
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,617
like, pulling really hard.

1355
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,417
And so as he goes to wind it in,
everyone starts to look around,

1356
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,017
and it's a tiger shark.

1357
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,897
And then naturally,
all the guys gather around

1358
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,097
and try to, like, help him
and take the credit.

1359
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,337
And Sam, like, shrugs them off
and says - my favourite part -

1360
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:08,297
"No, boys, this is between
me and the sea."

1361
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,937
(LAUGHS) That's my boy.

1362
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,337
But I think they were kidding

1363
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,537
when they said the captain
had it mounted in his cabin.

1364
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:17,417
Emma!
You bloody dark horse!

1365
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,937
So...

1366
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,657
Tell me about you two.
SAM: Mum.

1367
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,177
Where did you meet?
Mum.

1368
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:26,177
A mother's entitled to know
about her son's love-life.

1369
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,294
And a father's entitled
to know about his daughter's.

1370
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,417
I like your hair.

1371
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,057
Wouldn't have been regulation
in my day.

1372
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,497
BERNIE: Better than the dreadlocks.
EMMA: Dreadlocks?

1373
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,976
(GROANS)

1374
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,417
She's very pretty.
Her name is Emma.

1375
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,897
She's sitting
next to you, Mum.

1376
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,617
Sam's pretty. Ha!

1377
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:48,937
Hey, guys can be pretty too.
Sam's got pretty eyes. Like Bob's.

1378
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:52,937
(LAUGHS) You can bring her again.
BERNIE: Oh, please!

1379
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,137
What about some Scotch to celebrate?

1380
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,617
Girls?

1381
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,697
A little dabble?
EMMA: Sure.

1382
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,574
Don't... don't go to any trouble.
No.

1383
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,577
What's this game
you're playing, Sam?

1384
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,337
Do you want to give him
another heart attack, do you?

1385
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,137
Trying to make life
difficult for me?

1386
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,173
Get back at me for something?
Come on, tell me!

1387
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,297
I just wanted to see him happy.

1388
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,257
For how long?

1389
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,857
And I wanted you to be happy
'cause he was happy.

1390
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,657
Happy for how long, Sam?

1391
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,217
What happens when he...

1392
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,094
You're a fool!

1393
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,537
And now you're a fugitive. Lovely.

1394
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,337
Bernie, you don't understand.
I don't like you.

1395
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:36,177
Let's get that clear from the outset,
Miss Tiger Shark.

1396
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,617
But, Bernie...
My name's Mrs Fisher.

1397
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,097
Mrs Fisher, they tortured him.
He needs a bit of discipline.

1398
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,577
Structure.

1399
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:44,937
This... this wasn't structure, Mum.

1400
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,974
When are you ever gonna finish
anything you start, Sam?

1401
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,617
(SIGHS)

1402
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,209
I'm not heartless.

1403
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,297
Some people even think
I'm quite nice.

1404
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,447
Well, that's not true,
but I can act nice.

1405
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:06,137
It's just that whatever
Sam's involved in is an ordeal.

1406
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:09,657
BOB: I've got the single malt.
EMMA: Wow!

1407
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,613
So we can have a taste test.

1408
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,537
No sex.

1409
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:22,297
Going to parties by myself.

1410
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,777
One email a month.

1411
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,457
You've got no idea what it's like.

1412
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,257
Yeah, it must be hard.
I feel terrible for you.

1413
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,294
Hey! You signed up, not me.
Yep.

1414
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,737
Just promise me
you'll be careful, yeah?

1415
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,217
Oh, yeah.

1416
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,697
Hey.

1417
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:46,017
Just... promise me
you'll remember me and...

1418
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:50,177
...you'll remember you have
this great life waiting for you.

1419
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:54,497
Life that's gonna be wonderful and...

1420
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,657
...lucky and... full of love.

1421
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,137
Mmm.

1422
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:01,337
Just promise me.

1423
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,089
Baby, I promise you.

1424
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,176
Mmm.

1425
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,050
I promise.
Yeah.

1426
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,609
It's a different world out there.

1427
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,617
It's like when you're at school,
you know -

1428
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,657
like, the whole universe crumbles

1429
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,657
if you haven't done
your French homework, you know?

1430
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,137
'Cause that's all you know.
It's the same out there.

1431
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,617
'Cause that's all you know.

1432
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:36,857
And when it's good...
baby, when they smile on ya,

1433
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:40,177
life is roses.

1434
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,697
Mmm.

1435
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,497
(MAN SHOUTS)

1436
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,817
(LAUGHS)
Alright. OK, kids. Alright, kids.

1437
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,377
We alright? OK.

1438
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:49,897
Uh! Uh! OK. Come on.

1439
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,657
How about you, Harry?
You got a girlfriend?

1440
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,807
No, thanks.
Mmm?

1441
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,737
No, thank you.

1442
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,257
What... what is it?

1443
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,457
You've been heartbroken?
Is that what it is?

1444
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:05,337
Mate, you're not. Are you gay?

1445
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,017
No, thank you.

1446
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,257
(LAUGHS) Oh, come on, tell us.

1447
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:13,097
Me and Kath, we're good.
Very good.

1448
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:17,017
Yeah, well, we're the leading lights
at our group therapy sessions.

1449
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,897
Oh, Fred, he doesn't know.
What?

1450
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,257
It's called couples rehabilitation.

1451
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,377
(LAUGHS)

1452
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,137
It's for people who've...

1453
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,577
...had emotional and sexual trauma
in their relationships.

1454
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:31,417
Yeah, OK. Look.
We started about six months ago.

1455
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,457
And you wouldn't believe what a world
of difference, Harry, it's made.

1456
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,577
Believe you me.
Good!

1457
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,057
So, what is it, darling?

1458
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,657
Once bitten, twice shy.
Is that it?

1459
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,617
A handsome man like you
should be, um...

1460
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,617
Kath!

1461
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,297
...getting as much as you can.

1462
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,497
OK, OK, OK.
Let's keep going. Keep going.

1463
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,657
It's alright, it's alright.
No, no. It's OK. It's OK.

1464
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,897
How far are we walking?
Just look at the fountain.

1465
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,817
Hey! That's a great fountain.
Isn't that beautiful?

1466
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:59,457
Those things that I did...
I don't care about what you did.

1467
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,497
Just... It doesn't matter
to me, alright?

1468
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,852
Yeah, babe...
Look...

1469
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,257
Just... go find your friend.

1470
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:10,737
OK?

1471
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,217
Really?
Yeah.

1472
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,696
I'II, um...

1473
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:17,177
I'll just... I'll meet you
at the docks in, like, five hours.

1474
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:18,657
Alright?

1475
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,217
That'll give us 45 minutes
for you and me

1476
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,493
plus, you know, 15 minutes travel time
to get you back for rollcall.

1477
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:29,177
I've kind of got it all worked out.
Oh, yeah?

1478
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:32,737
Yeah, there's this,
like, long, dark street

1479
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,617
two blocks over from
Harry's Cafe de Wheels.

1480
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:39,017
Hello!
And I am bringing the station wagon.

1481
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:41,057
I love you.

1482
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,577
Well...

1483
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:45,377
I just can't wait to see you
out of this uniform.

1484
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,857
Oh, oh, oh!

1485
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:49,537
OK, OK, OK.
Just a sec. I've got to throw up.

1486
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,337
Yep. No, don't. No, no, no.

1487
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,417
Let's keep walking.
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

1488
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,857
Oh, I feel great.

1489
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,577
Absolutely fine.
We can have a shower in the fountain.

1490
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,137
That'd be cool.
(LAUGHS)

1491
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,857
Yeah.
Cool. (LAUGHS)

1492
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,857
OK, OK. Alright.

1493
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,577
Do you want to shower with me?

1494
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:07,617
Uh, no.

1495
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:10,177
Would you like to lather me? (LAUGHS)

1496
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,577
Um, Deano, I think it's cab time
for these two.

1497
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:16,937
Yeah, but I heard
what you were saying.

1498
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,217
No.
What? I wasn't flirting!

1499
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,617
That's my arm, Fred, not hers.
I said there was chemistry.

1500
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,457
I didn't say we should
do anything about it.

1501
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:24,937
Oh!

1502
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,417
God! Oh!

1503
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,177
KATHY: Whoa!
FRED: Jesus!

1504
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,656
(LAUGHS)
Really sorry.

1505
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,217
You right? You right?
Fuck. Yep.

1506
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,417
HARRY: Fucking hell.
FRED: I thought it was funny.

1507
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,017
Oh, Jesus!
You right?

1508
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,897
DEAN: What have you done, McCabe?
HARRY: He's broken my fucking nose!

1509
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,697
FRED: Oh, you're alright.
Have you hurt yourself?

1510
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,377
(KATHY LAUGHS)
SALLY: Mum!

1511
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,857
Come on, Kath. Get up. Shut up, Kath.
DEAN: You OK?

1512
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,137
He's broken my fucking nose, man.

1513
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,497
What'd you do?
He's broken my nose.

1514
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,137
DEAN: Alright, Kath,
have you hurt anything?

1515
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:59,457
Harry, Harry, Harry.
Did you look up my dress?

1516
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,297
FRED: You right?
Here we go.

1517
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,457
Hey, can you get a cab?
Yeah, sure.

1518
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:04,937
KATHY: Leave me alone!
Mum!

1519
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,777
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
SALLY: Mum!

1520
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,893
Do you mind getting
a cab or something?

1521
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,697
SALLY: Fuck it.

1522
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,777
It's alright. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1523
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:16,777
I think... Jesus! Can we just not?

1524
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:20,053
Dad. Dad. Can you just
control Mum, please?

1525
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,737
SALLY: Dad!
DEAN: That's my mother-in-law.

1526
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,977
HARRY: Yeah, I'd love one.
SALLY: Mum, go home with Dad.

1527
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:29,457
You are embarrassing
the fuck out of me right now.

1528
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:30,977
KATHY: Where is he?

1529
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,137
You OK?
Can you just take Mum home?

1530
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,137
You're not on medication
or anything like that, are you?

1531
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,014
I have never been better.
I have never, ever...

1532
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,537
(HARRY LAUGHS)
See, this is what it's done for us.

1533
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,657
Watch this, now. You ready?
You watching?

1534
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,249
You ready?

1535
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,977
SALLY: Just leave them.
(LAUGHS)

1536
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,737
Are you watching? Hey, hey, hey.
Yep.

1537
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:53,457
FRED: This is how you do it.
Alright?

1538
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,812
Awesome to meet you. Thanks, Sally,
for tonight. It's been great.

1539
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,455
(GAGS AND RETCHES)

1540
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:04,937
Is my nose crooked?

1541
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:07,087
Please tell me
my fucking nose isn't crooked.

1542
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,210
Let's go to the hotel.

1543
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,297
Dean, this is the fucking end of
the monologue. Let's go to the hotel.

1544
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,137
OK, this might sound about...
a bit, you know.

1545
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,697
What if we go to shore patrol?

1546
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,177
Yeah, it sounds ludicrous.
Jake's a mate.

1547
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,697
Is anyone not your mate?

1548
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,257
He might do us a favour
and keep it quiet.

1549
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,217
Well, how is the weather
in Fools Paradise, Dean?

1550
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,897
We could explain it to them.

1551
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,817
Oh, we'd explain it to them? Great!

1552
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:38,137
What would we say?
What's the first thing you'd say?

1553
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,571
It's a thought.
Next thought, please.

1554
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,730
Mm-hm.

1555
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,217
No, here we go.

1556
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,977
OK, we can't dillydally.

1557
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,808
Dillydally?
What's wrong with dillydally?

1558
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:54,890
(LAUGHS)

1559
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:57,416
Mmm. (MUMBLES)

1560
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,777
(ENGLISH ACCENT) Hi.

1561
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:06,971
Hey.

1562
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,177
Goodnight.

1563
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,177
Got the time, mate?

1564
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,377
Uh... yeah, it's, uh...

1565
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,449
...2:27, on the dot.

1566
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,777
So it's not midnight?

1567
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,777
No. Nope.

1568
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,697
Yeah, my watch must be...

1569
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,177
Hang on, you're saying it's...

1570
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,977
You're saying it's exactly two hours
and 27 minutes after midnight?

1571
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:33,537
Yeah. (UNLOCKS DOOR)
Have a good one.

1572
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,017
Yeah, I'll try.

1573
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,017
Sam Fisher, yes?

1574
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,735
Yeah.

1575
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,977
We can do this out in the hallway
if you want, Sam.

1576
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,297
I run a legitimate business.
I'm not ashamed.

1577
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,857
No, mate. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1578
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,688
Let me explain.

1579
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,850
Come on.

1580
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,857
See, one of the girls
is taking it personally,

1581
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,897
like it's a rejection or something.

1582
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,897
Girls? What... what girls, mate?

1583
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,097
I mean, it's... That's just rude.
OK, look, you know what?

1584
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,297
I reckon there's been some sort
of misunderstanding here. We're...

1585
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,817
We're not the people you're after.

1586
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:14,377
There's been some sort
of misunderstanding.

1587
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:17,337
There's a cab as well. I mean,
you were supposed to pay for that.

1588
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,257
OK.
I get here, meter's up to 70 bucks.

1589
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,777
He's kept it running the whole time.
Can't blame him for that.

1590
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,337
Totally understand.
Where's it coming from?

1591
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,937
I reckon you've got
the wrong room.

1592
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:29,097
Well, we do a callback as soon as
the order's made, chummy, so...

1593
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:32,617
OK, look, you're out a lot of money.
I understand.

1594
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:35,257
This has to be some sort of mistake.
EMMA: Just go back.

1595
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:38,057
Emma, shut the fuck up, please,
please. You're not helping.

1596
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,457
There's...
Yeah, there's been a mistake, Sammy.

1597
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,617
(OPENS FRIDGE)
About 600 bucks' worth.

1598
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,937
Oh, just help yourself for a drink.
Hey, it's all good.

1599
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,657
You're not... You're not...

1600
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:50,937
600 bucks - I'll let you off for 50,
seeing as I'll give the girls a lift home.

1601
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:53,417
They won't need a cab. How's that?
Can't say fairer than that.

1602
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:55,537
Yep. It's Harry. It's my friend.

1603
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:59,577
It's my stupid fucking friend.
That's it. It's not me.

1604
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:02,057
Oh, well, your stupid fucking friend
isn't here now, is he, Sammy?

1605
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,617
Why don't you just go back?
Emma, it's all good.

1606
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,097
Just shut the fuck up.

1607
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,657
Just shut the fuck up, Emma.
Do yourself a favour.

1608
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,377
Go back to fucking England,
you wanker.

1609
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,697
I'll tell you what, you know,
for your information -

1610
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,217
future reference and all -

1611
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,417
uh, that pussy I was gonna get you
is far better than this.

1612
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:20,497
Ooh! You've got balls,
have you, Popeye?

1613
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,617
I'll tell you what,
you give me my 650

1614
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,697
and we'll get 'em out,
we can all see.

1615
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,817
Eh?

1616
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,694
Look, just go home, seriously. Whoa!

1617
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:41,697
I hope that wasn't your big guns.

1618
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,530
(GASPS)

1619
01:13:58,420 --> 01:13:59,452
Hey.

1620
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,091
Be a pal. Let me back in.

1621
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:25,617
Back off, Sam. It's no good.
No, it's still there. Hey, mate!

1622
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,217
(SLAPS)
No, Sam, go get a pillow.

1623
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:30,057
Hey.

1624
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,617
Hey, mate. Are you OK?
Tell me what to do.

1625
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:34,777
Where do I put it?
Just underneath. Here. Hold on.

1626
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,537
Mate, you OK?
Mmm.

1627
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,257
Can you move your neck?
Yeah.

1628
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:40,097
OK.
Sam, just calm down.

1629
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,817
You OK, mate?

1630
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:43,330
MAN: Yep.

1631
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:54,013
Hey, do you know where you are?

1632
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,777
Hote...

1633
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,529
Yep.

1634
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:01,657
No.

1635
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:03,457
Hotel.
SAM: Yeah.

1636
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,617
Yep.

1637
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,337
What... what's your name?
It starts with a 'W'.

1638
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:09,057
MAN: Warren.
Great. Fantastic, Warren.

1639
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:11,217
EMMA: First go.
I'm one of the Wombles.

1640
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:13,457
WARREN: Warren the Womble.

1641
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,097
SAM: You're not
one of the Wombles, mate.

1642
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,577
Who's your favourite Womble?

1643
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:19,737
What year is it?
Mmm... Tomsk.

1644
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:22,257
He's a big one.
SAM: What year is it, mate?

1645
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:24,657
EMMA: What year? Hey.
Warren, concentrate.

1646
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,377
Mmm... Orinoco?

1647
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:28,697
SAM: No, what year... what year is it?
Orinoco?

1648
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,377
Tobermory was clever
with his hands, wasn't he?

1649
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:36,017
He was the clever one.
Alright. We'd better get him up.

1650
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:38,057
EMMA: Let's see if you can sit up.
Hey, Warren.

1651
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:39,537
Yep.

1652
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,177
SAM: We're gonna get you up.
Alright, mate?

1653
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,657
OK.
Come on, Warren.

Come on, Warren.
Oh, fuck!

1656
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:49,257
Hey, it's OK, Warren. It's all good.
Someone hit me.

1657
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,377
Yeah, I had to hit you.

1658
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,657
Yeah, he's sorry. He didn't mean to.
SAM: OK, come on.

1659
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,537
Come on, let's get you
up into the bed.

1660
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:58,257
Sam, his neck.
I know. He's fucking heavy.

1661
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,930
Come on, Warren.
(MOANS)

1662
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,646
Hey, it's all good. Just over here.
Put him on the bed.

1663
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,497
Where am I?

1664
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,817
SAM: You alright, mate?

1665
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,457
Yep. (GROANS)
Hey.

1666
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,937
Hey, Warren.
Yeah?

1667
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,417
Look here.

1668
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,737

Hey.

1671
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,777
You're gonna be OK.
I'm OK.

1672
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,617
Yeah.

1673
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,448
Where's my dog?
SAM: You didn't bring a dog.

1674
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,217
Where's my dog?

1675
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:37,977
Do you remember
why you came here, mate?

1676
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:42,137
Yep. Came with a...
With t...

1677
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,617
The Wombles.
Two girls.

1678
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:46,057
SAM: The girls.
You made the Wombles cry.

1679
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,337
I didn't make... I didn't make the
Wombles cry. I made the girls cry.

1680
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,017
I'm really sorry.
Sorry.

Hey.

1682
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,697
I think we should get him...

1683
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,897
Warren, I think we're gonna
get you to a hospital, OK?

1684
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,617
I'm sweet. I'm sweet.
SAM: You sure?

1685
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,217
Mmm.

1686
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:04,977
Someone hit me.

1687

and do a check on your toes,

Ohh.

And what I did.
Oh...

1854
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,897
I... I don't want you to do that.

1855
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,127
I have to.

1856
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:50,770
I'm going back, Dean.

1857
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:57,170
No...

1858

No-one forced me into this.

And no-one's gonna force me out.

It'll happen again.

And I'll serve my time.

1864
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,573
What if they make you do it?

1865
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,137

Rollcall. Slack-arse.

You knew shit.

Can I ask you something?

1874
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:49,694
Can you hand me in?

Yep.

out on the harbour, mate.
