1
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,258
Climb!

2
00:00:22,258 --> 00:00:23,538
Yes, sir!

3
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:44,648
Hibito.

4
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:48,048
We need to conduct an in-depth investigation.

5
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:50,858
I hear and obey, Mu-chan.

6
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:57,068
<i>An older brother...</i>

7
00:00:57,978 --> 00:01:01,178
<i>must always walk in front of his little brother.</i>

8
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:14,408
July 9, 10:01 PM.

9
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:18,418
Discovered a Japanese tree frog in the grass behind the bamboo shoots near the Metro.

10
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:35,488
Mu-chan...

11
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:41,218
Mu-chan!

12
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:43,738
Mu-chan!

13
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:46,458
What are you doing?!

14
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,338
Mu-chan, over there!

15
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:49,438
What?

16
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:50,998
Hurry up!

17
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:52,738
What is it?

18
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,108
That, that!

19
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:02,428
What is that?!

20
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:04,858
I don't know.

21
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:29,288
It's flying to the Moon!

22
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,458
Hey, Mu-chan...

23
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,218
Yes?

24
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:44,798
I...

25
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,408
I've made up my mind.

26
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:49,428
I’m going to become an astronaut and fly to the Moon.

27
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:53,118
Huh?

28
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:55,108
Mu-chan, how about you?

29
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,268
Me?

30
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:02,508
I...

31
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,658
I think...

32
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:25,848
UCHUU KYOUDAI
SPACE BROTHERS

33
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:17,578
This fall, mission CES-51...

34
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:19,588
will leave for the Moon.

35
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:24,738
Our mission is to establish a habitable environment.

36
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:27,588
It'll make longer stays on the Moon possible.

37
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:33,638
As you know, the necessary modules and equipment have already been transported.

38
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:35,638
We are now ready,

39
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:41,118
to take the first real steps towards terraforming the Moon.

40
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:50,738
With the ability to stay there for an extended period of time,

41
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:54,848
the chances of an alien encounter is sure to increase too, wouldn't you say, Captain?

42
00:05:55,758 --> 00:05:59,888
That kind of question really should go to him. He's the expert.

43
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:05,538
Who? Me?

44
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:13,098
Well...

45
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:16,808
You are right, I saw an UFO when I was a boy...

46
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:20,898
Please. Don't hold the microphone.

47
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:24,538
Sorry.

48
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:29,778
That was just like the sound the UFO used to communicate.

49
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:32,728
No worries.

50
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:40,858
Anyway, of course the UFO I saw when I was a boy is one of the reasons I am here today.

51
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:46,548
But, on the Moon, I will be focused on our mission.

52
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:47,798
That's certain.

53
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,798
Here.

54
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:52,348
Mr. Hibito Namba.

55
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:56,058
On Japan's National Day, what would you say about becoming the first Japanese to land on the Moon?

56
00:06:56,568 --> 00:06:57,698
Yes.

57
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:01,798
The Japanese are particularly reverent about the Moon.

58
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:05,438
On behalf of my province, I am very proud.

59
00:07:06,618 --> 00:07:10,848
However, when I land on the Moon, then

60
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,668
I'll find the words to tell you. Now is not the time. Apologies.

61
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:18,718
This model is completely overturned. I’m baffled.

62
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,698
What's really the reason for this?

63
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:24,008
The performance and specifications of the design are optimal.

64
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:27,668
This is rotten, we have our hands tied compared to Namba's predecessors.

65
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:29,258
Namba,

66
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,028
your predecessors spent a whole five years on this design.

67
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:39,268
Well gentleman, do not pity me.

68
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:44,598
I was born on the cursed day known as the Agony of Doha.

69
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:55,808
The curse even extends to having a boss of limited flexibility and imagination!

70
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,368
The United States gives you head space to innovate...

71
00:07:57,368 --> 00:08:01,368
<i>The astronauts are so young these days.
The United States gives you head space to innovate...</i>

72
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:02,678
You don't know?

73
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:04,648
About Hibito Namba?

74
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:10,738
Although it's a secret.

75
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:12,178
The fact is that...

76
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,058
No way!

77
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:19,738
They're nothing alike!

78
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:22,778
What's the gossip?

79
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,208
What the hell is going on?

80
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:27,978
What is this?

81
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:31,398
The aerospace industry is simply a waste of the national budget.

82
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:36,018
Reads like a hippie propaganda piece.

83
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:39,778
Look at their idiotic smiles.

84
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,228
While they're playing Rocket-man, Japan's international competitiveness has stagnated.

85
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:44,998
Is it really necessary to go to the Moon?

86
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:49,558
This is the result of ill thought out plans from such a degenerate era.

87
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:51,488
These astronauts serve us better by being fireworks.

88
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:55,968
Director!

89
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:00,598
You're fired!

90
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:06,108
What's your problem? Get the hell out!

91
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:08,248
It hurts!

92
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:11,188
Dammit, it hurts!

93
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,968
Ah crap... I’m really screwed...

94
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:49,358
<i>31 years old, Mutta Namba.</i>

95
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:53,848
<i>I used to work in a concept car design company as a project team leader.</i>

96
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:55,738
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

97
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:58,298
<i>The design philosophy is contained in the TK-11.</i>

98
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:01,048
<i>The crappy boss slandered my name to the entire industry,</i>

99
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,668
<i>making it difficult to find employment.</i>

100
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:08,178
31 years olds aren't really spring chickens.

101
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:08,558
I understand.

102
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:08,958
What's with the funny afro?
I understand.

103
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,228
What's with the funny afro?

104
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:16,128
<i>It also doesn't help when I’ve inherited mom's quirks.</i>

105
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:20,148
Thanks. Hear from you soon.

106
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:42,688
Happy birthday to me.

107
00:10:58,588 --> 00:10:59,558
Where's Mutta?

108
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:01,448
Upstairs.

109
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:17,008
In the end...

110
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:23,098
What am I doing with my life?

111
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:33,998
Mutta.

112
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:36,108
What?

113
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:37,598
What are you doing?

114
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:44,008
I brought you cake.

115
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:47,598
Hey...

116
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:51,268
The acute angle is a little too narrow.

117
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:56,528
The eldest son should work harder than the father.

118
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:01,198
I'll find a job soon.

119
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:02,198
You've got to try harder!

120
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,248
Mutta, the unemployed.

121
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:10,138
You've got mail.

122
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:22,118
JAXA?

123
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,778
Why would JAXA send me a letter?

124
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:01,898
Hello.

125
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:05,258
He-llo?

126
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:09,388
Ah, Mu-chan, long time no talk.

127
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,698
So, how's it going?

128
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:18,018
I've got nothing.

129
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:23,388
Ah, could it be that they've screened your material?

130
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:25,278
Congratulations.

131
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,888
Just in time. Perfect.

132
00:13:27,888 --> 00:13:30,618
Man, after five years, they just fired you. That sucks.

133
00:13:30,838 --> 00:13:32,388
You're better than them, Mu-chan.

134
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:35,678
So it really was you, out of the blue.

135
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:39,038
You're destined for better things, Mu-chan.

136
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,088
Why did you do it?

137
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:46,118
What? I can't hear you.

138
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:53,098
I said, why this extra thing?

139
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:58,818
I know I’m a vagrant at the moment.

140
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:00,398
But being accepted to undergo astronaut exams is not funny.

141
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:02,818
Who's being funny?

142
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:08,458
Hey...

143
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,918
So...

144
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:13,508
I’m into vehicle development.

145
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:16,548
I've been doing it for almost ten years.

146
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:17,908
You know what I mean?

147
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:18,898
Cut the bullshit.

148
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,098
All in all.

149
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:28,898
Floating in the sky for work is your specialty.

150
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:31,368
My feet are firmly grounded.

151
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:35,838
You don't have to worry about me.

152
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:37,358
You've totally forgotten.

153
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:39,978
Our promise.

154
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:42,748
Promise?

155
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:46,458
Well, all right.

156
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:50,638
Do me a favor and listen to the tape of July 9, 2006.

157
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:51,618
Huh?
- Bye-bye.

158
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:52,548
Hey, wait...

159
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,538
Let's go!

160
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:06,318
Really, telling me to do stuff out of the blue.

161
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:28,388
July 9, 10:01 PM.

162
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:32,718
Discovered a Japanese tree frog in the grass behind the bamboo shoots near the Metro.

163
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:39,738
Mu-chan, over there!

164
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:46,408
What's the matter with the recording?

165
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:51,328
Could it be?

166
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:05,218
Coincidence?

167
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:08,228
Hey, Mu-chan.

168
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:11,558
I...

169
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:16,828
I've made up my mind. I’m going to become an astronaut and fly to the Moon.

170
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:18,698
Huh?

171
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,388
Mu-chan, how about you?

172
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:28,528
Me?

173
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:32,588
I...

174
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:36,178
I think...

175
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:48,918
If you’re going to the Moon,

176
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,878
then I would definitely have to go further!

177
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:55,038
I'm going to Mars!

178
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:57,708
Amazingly ambitious, Mu-chan!

179
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,538
There has to be a day

180
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,188
when the two of us become astronauts

181
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:07,728
and explore the universe together!

182
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:11,348
An excellent idea, Mu-chan!

183
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:14,668
Then, that will be our promise.

184
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,318
<i>I used to want to become an astronaut.</i>

185
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:41,138
<i>We used to go to lectures every day and fill our heads with the universe.</i>

186
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:45,928
<i>But, one day, I realized...</i>

187
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:52,398
<i>Only a small number of exceptionally talented people could be accepted.</i>

188
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:57,278
<i>Being completely ordinary, it was practically impossible for me.</i>

189
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:06,718
<i>This realization made me run straight back.</i>

190
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:10,958
<i>I made peace with myself</i>

191
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,388
<i>and decided to strive for something a little more realistic.</i>

192
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:16,628
Hurry, Hibito!

193
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:20,508
We have to photograph the UFO!

194
00:19:20,508 --> 00:19:23,738
Yeah! UFO! UFO!

195
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:31,018
<i>But...</i>

196
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:41,698
UFO! UFO! UFO!

197
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:42,918
<i>But...</i>

198
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,698
<i>I actually...</i>

199
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:12,048
I actually regret... not pursuing my dream.

200
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:45,708
Welcome.

201
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:51,278
Thank you everyone for participating in JAXA's Junior Tour.

202
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:54,028
Thank you "everyone".

203
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:56,828
Ha, that's including the lady up there.

204
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:04,538
Firstly, how about we start off with a little history about JAXA's Space Center.

205
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:09,308
The Tsukuba Space Center covers an area of 530,000 square meters.

206
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:12,208
That's equivalent to an area covering 12 Tokyo Domes.

207
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,958
In addition...

208
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:20,718
JAXA also has pilot training facilities in the International Space Station (ISS).

209
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:26,088
Japan plays a significant role in commanding and maintaining many cabins and facilities in the ISS.

210
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:32,638
Hey, who are the afro kid and the spiky kid?

211
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:36,098
They come all the time.

212
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:42,098
Next, please watch the history of space travel developed by VTR.

213
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:42,998
Okay.

214
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:47,568
Hey, you are not allowed to record in here!

215
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:53,638
But Miss, we want to be good knowledgeable adults.

216
00:21:53,638 --> 00:21:55,368
Perhaps, one day, we could even help JAXA.

217
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:56,928
Please, let us record it.

218
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:02,358
OK, just this one time. But don't tell anyone.

219
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:03,978
Great!

220
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:10,518
Oh, Yuri Gagarin.

221
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,008
Assist JAXA? What a joke.

222
00:22:18,118 --> 00:22:22,238
With their attitudes, I’m certain they can become astronauts.

223
00:22:23,998 --> 00:22:24,768
Yes.

224
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,338
I think that one must be physically and mentally resilient to become an astronaut.

225
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:35,718
I’m fit and learn quickly. If selected, I will give my all, for JAXA.

226
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:42,128
I stand corrected; for the world and the National Space Development Agency.

227
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:46,548
Good. Time's almost up.

228
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:50,508
If there are no other questions...

229
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:53,428
Forgive me, I have one more question.

230
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:57,348
I don't mean to be the bad guy but...

231
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:03,378
Hibito Namba is your brother.

232
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:08,538
He's considered extremely talented and charismatic.

233
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:13,948
It seems that you're trying to catch up. How do you see this playing out in the media?

234
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:18,328
Yes, in that regard.

235
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,778
I was certain people would ask me so I spent three days and nights thinking about an answer.

236
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:26,608
I wrote my answer down.

237
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:33,858
If it pleases you, may I read it?

238
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:40,978
Sadly, time escapes us.

239
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:44,098
Allow me to recommend a more efficient way of doing this.

240
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:47,358
That's a tad harsh, no?

241
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:52,688
The answers are a bit...

242
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:56,208
It goes against Japanese values.

243
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,088
He's filled with a sense of inferiority compared to his brother? Hmm...

244
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:01,038
Seems to be that he's running out of patience.

245
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:03,348
Wait.

246
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:04,908
The facts.

247
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,958
The bolt on the chair is tight again.

248
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,138
What's going on, Hoshika?

249
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:15,738
In the morning I loosened the screw.

250
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:18,428
I pulled a little NASA prank.

251
00:24:18,428 --> 00:24:20,518
I assumed this would go unnoticed by the participants.

252
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:24,348
During the interview, he was fiddling with the screw.

253
00:24:24,348 --> 00:24:25,738
Hmm, short attention span.

254
00:24:25,738 --> 00:24:27,318
Or you could interpret it as...

255
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:30,528
An excellent instinct for machinery.

256
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:32,698
Wouldn't you agree?

257
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:38,378
<i>I tip my hat to you, Mr. Suit.</i>

258
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:51,878
<i>Aerospace research and development institutions.</i>

259
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:54,598
<i>Commonly known as JAXA.</i>

260
00:24:54,598 --> 00:24:57,908
<i>After a lapse of five years, they placed an ad for recruitment.</i>

261
00:24:57,908 --> 00:25:02,558
<i>They managed to attract a total of 789 people; me included.</i>

262
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:08,018
<i>Through interviewing the applicants, they culled the numbers down to 45 people.</i>

263
00:25:08,018 --> 00:25:11,148
<i>Now, we're into the second round of exams.</i>

264
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:21,838
Good. Stop calculating.

265
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:46,678
Next, please wear the oxygen mask.

266
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:55,098
Excuse me.

267
00:25:56,998 --> 00:25:58,148
That's...

268
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:03,448
I’m sorry, I’m a little nervous.

269
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:04,318
No problem.

270
00:26:25,358 --> 00:26:27,848
Twenty-seven thousand feet above sea level.

271
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:36,828
Twenty-eight thousand feet above sea level.

272
00:26:49,348 --> 00:26:51,008
That's him.

273
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,318
My name is Mutta Namba.

274
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:54,348
Excuse me.

275
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:55,218
Yes?

276
00:26:56,018 --> 00:26:57,508
Are you Mutta Namba?

277
00:26:57,768 --> 00:26:58,618
Yes.

278
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:02,338
Your brother is Hibito Namba, the astronaut, right?

279
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,378
He's the brother of Hibito Namba?!

280
00:27:08,228 --> 00:27:09,978
You didn't know?

281
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:11,978
He's a very well-known candidate.

282
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,268
I see.

283
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:15,518
I see, indeed.

284
00:27:15,518 --> 00:27:19,708
Being the brother of the first Japanese going to the Moon is a big deal.

285
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:22,158
It's no big deal.

286
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:26,128
Must be nice to have an advantage.

287
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:32,098
You must have had some really handy tips on the exam content.

288
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:37,008
Your brother could probably influence the examiners.

289
00:27:38,648 --> 00:27:41,228
He would do no such thing.

290
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:43,618
How naive do you think we are?

291
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:48,048
This conversation is a bit rude.

292
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:58,218
In addition, I don't think these exams are easy.

293
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,108
You should play your games elsewhere.

294
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:04,168
Right? Mutta Namba.

295
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:11,428
My name is Makabe Kenji. I'm 31 years old. Nice to meet you.

296
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:16,808
We're the same age. Nice to meet you too.

297
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:19,868
Hey, Mu-kun.

298
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:23,068
Do you think that at this stage the best scores...

299
00:28:25,778 --> 00:28:28,468
Belong to the two impertinent youngsters?

300
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:31,138
No, I think it's the lady.

301
00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:33,258
Good call.

302
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:35,208
Serika Itou is her name.

303
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:39,238
Her physical fitness and English speech was ranked highly.

304
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:40,298
I think the examiners hold her in high regards.

305
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:41,898
Impressive!

306
00:28:42,628 --> 00:28:44,018
Anyway,

307
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:47,998
after the little breathing exercise, I suspect only 6-7 participants are left.

308
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:50,498
Talk about brutal.

309
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:53,258
Hey, Kenji.

310
00:28:53,258 --> 00:28:53,978
Yeah?

311
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:55,168
How did you answer "that" question?

312
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,698
Which one?

313
00:28:56,698 --> 00:28:58,928
The second interview.

314
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:01,878
"Tell us something new you've discovered about yourself"?

315
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:05,048
Oh, a tricky one.

316
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:08,718
It's like coming across a book I’ve never read.

317
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:12,638
A simple fictional storybook.

318
00:29:13,238 --> 00:29:16,638
However, when you read it with your two year old daughter,

319
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:21,268
you feel an opportunity to create something wonderful,

320
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:25,068
regardless of the story, you really start to get into it.

321
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:29,868
In short, as long as you're reading without prejudice.

322
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:33,078
The story and the task will bring new stimulation, perspective and experience.

323
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:37,078
I found the selection process to be very similar to this.

324
00:29:38,188 --> 00:29:40,778
Mu-kun, how did you answer it?

325
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:44,498
Well...

326
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:48,128
It was quite tricky.

327
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:52,658
Something new you've discovered about yourself?

328
00:30:03,188 --> 00:30:07,778
That using shampoo significantly reduces the itch on the scalp.

329
00:30:11,988 --> 00:30:13,248
See you later.

330
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:34,828
It's like being rejected by a girl.

331
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:39,278
Farewell, JAXA.

332
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,478
Speak of the devil.

333
00:31:50,818 --> 00:31:52,048
Hello.

334
00:31:52,048 --> 00:31:55,508
Hello Mu-chan, how goes the second round?

335
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:59,738
I think it's making my scalp itch.

336
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:01,478
How do you mean?

337
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:04,498
I’m sure you did well.

338
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:08,228
Well... ah...

339
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:14,188
If I fall, I shall rise again to fight twice as hard!

340
00:32:14,188 --> 00:32:16,728
Admirable words, Mu-chan.

341
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:22,478
Hey, do you want to come to NASA?

342
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:24,668
Huh, NASA?

343
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:26,658
Yeah, NASA.

344
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:04,458
So, this must be the famous Apo.

345
00:33:06,628 --> 00:33:07,628
Yes.

346
00:33:09,908 --> 00:33:11,058
A spiritual place.

347
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:13,278
Welcome to the sacred grounds.

348
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:26,988
You're living quite well.

349
00:33:26,988 --> 00:33:28,428
Well...

350
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:31,798
I'm only renting, so it may not feel the same as our home in Japan.

351
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:49,668
What's up?

352
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:51,638
Nothing.

353
00:33:54,518 --> 00:34:00,178
Was Apo's name taken from the Apollo missions?

354
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:01,218
Hey, Pup.

355
00:34:01,218 --> 00:34:02,678
Yes.

356
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:04,658
It must be nice,

357
00:34:06,328 --> 00:34:11,658
to grow up with such little stress.

358
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,188
A life untouched by the hands of a tragedian.

359
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:15,448
Let's hope so.

360
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,318
Apo, the adorable.

361
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:24,508
Hey... hey, come on.

362
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:28,238
The curtains are unhooked.

363
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:31,958
Twilight drops her curtain down, and pins it with a star.

364
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,208
What's this?

365
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:43,008
On the plus side, your saving on the water bill.

366
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:47,608
Hey, the price tag is still on this.

367
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:50,238
All fixed.

368
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:54,378
Very observant of you to instantly detect the defects, Mu-chan.

369
00:34:54,378 --> 00:34:56,858
You're too sloppy.

370
00:34:57,908 --> 00:35:00,068
Unbelievable,

371
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:04,428
this guy is going to the Moon in week and yet neglects his chores.

372
00:35:06,868 --> 00:35:07,798
Mu-chan.

373
00:35:10,888 --> 00:35:11,878
Heads up.

374
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:16,908
Impressive.

375
00:35:17,768 --> 00:35:21,318
It's beautiful out here.

376
00:35:23,278 --> 00:35:27,968
All you need now is a blond bombshell of a girlfriend.

377
00:35:29,028 --> 00:35:30,478
Love to but I’ve got no time to spare.

378
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:32,968
Such is life.

379
00:35:43,648 --> 00:35:48,378
How many years has it been since when we last observed the skies.

380
00:35:52,678 --> 00:35:54,098
Who knows.

381
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:05,818
What are you doing?

382
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:09,468
Imitating Tom Hanks.

383
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,168
He did it in Apollo 13.

384
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:16,458
Oh yeah, right!

385
00:36:21,798 --> 00:36:26,538
Three hundred eighty-four thousand kilometers from the Earth.

386
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:33,748
It's not a walk to the corner shop.

387
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:36,548
I can't believe my little brother is actually going.

388
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:42,088
It must be an incredible feeling.

389
00:36:44,398 --> 00:36:48,978
What are you talking about? You sound as if you didn't do too well in the exams, Mu-chan.

390
00:36:57,908 --> 00:36:58,858
Well...

391
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:05,138
To tell you the truth,

392
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:07,978
I’m predicting the demise of my space career.

393
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:12,588
In hindsight, there were things I could have done better.

394
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:17,288
As of late, I predict the probability of my going to the Moon

395
00:37:17,288 --> 00:37:20,048
to be less than 1/384,000.

396
00:37:20,688 --> 00:37:23,168
You may not realize.

397
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:27,008
But my space travel ambitions diverted years ago.

398
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:29,888
I’m beginning to suspect my fate has further distance itself from the Moon.

399
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:31,228
Enough of that, Mu-chan.

400
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:46,278
Let me find the words.

401
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,998
Hmm...

402
00:37:55,528 --> 00:37:57,468
You're strong.

403
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,108
But you don't seem to realize how strong you really are.

404
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:05,358
As a child.

405
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:07,248
What are you talking about?

406
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:09,368
The topics we had as kids are not the same as now.

407
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:10,508
Just listen.

408
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:13,488
You know, I’m here now...

409
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,298
because of you, Mu-chan.

410
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:28,408
You've been pushing me for 19 years.

411
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:32,198
The two of us observing the night sky.

412
00:38:44,628 --> 00:38:46,368
I know.

413
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:06,848
You're asking for a beating.

414
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:12,118
Our classmates have been saying that you've seen a UFO.

415
00:39:12,378 --> 00:39:15,858
They said you were bragging out loud with your afro swinging back and forth.

416
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:16,688
It's a lie, right?

417
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:21,518
Hurry up and answer!

418
00:39:21,518 --> 00:39:22,128
I was...

419
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:27,708
Say it already.

420
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:32,138
Was it not my friend who was talking about the UFO? I think there was a miscommunication...

421
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:37,078
I...

422
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:46,048
Mu-chan, you coming out?

423
00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:50,668
Not today.

424
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:54,278
Why not? We've got to take a photo of the UFO to prove it to our classmates.

425
00:39:54,488 --> 00:39:59,198
There's a chance our classmates will still not believe.

426
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:05,188
But... a photo doesn't lie.

427
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:13,268
Listen, Hibito.

428
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:16,968
On Japan’s national day, we undoubtedly saw a UFO.

429
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:18,928
Yes, I concur.

430
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,358
Hold this belief, tightly, in your heart.

431
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:25,528
Okay?

432
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:29,518
Okay.

433
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:34,738
15 minutes before depressurization.

434
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:41,298
The depressurized environment is stable. Get ready to work.

435
00:40:46,308 --> 00:40:47,548
We have a vacuum.

436
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:53,718
A vacuum is formed.

437
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,058
Okay, Hibito, Buddy.

438
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,658
Let's start the oxygen supply simulation.

439
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:02,618
Copy.

440
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:08,898
Checking Buddy's EMU operational conditions.

441
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:13,168
Main tank: Empty.

442
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:19,968
Back up tank: 2 minutes worth of oxygen remaining.

443
00:41:21,298 --> 00:41:25,208
Attempting connections between the two EMU's.

444
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:29,628
Okay, connect it from blue to red.

445
00:42:16,138 --> 00:42:18,818
Dammit!

446
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:46,078
What's this?

447
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:24,528
This is...

448
00:43:26,468 --> 00:43:29,138
<i>Although I am reluctant,</i>

449
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:33,338
<i>NASA has advised us to complete our will as part of protocol.</i>

450
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:38,758
<i>I want to tell to Mu-chan one thing.</i>

451
00:43:40,438 --> 00:43:47,518
<i>It took me 19 years to reach my goal.</i>

452
00:43:47,518 --> 00:43:48,938
<i>I am certain that you'll fly, too, Mu-chan.</i>

453
00:43:50,658 --> 00:43:54,078
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

454
00:43:54,078 --> 00:43:56,898
<i>it's seems I've died before you got this message.</i>

455
00:43:59,658 --> 00:44:01,038
<i>But, Mu-chan...</i>

456
00:44:02,688 --> 00:44:04,568
<i>even in death...</i>

457
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:08,788
<i>I'll be waiting in space for your arrival,</i>

458
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:14,868
<i>so that we can see the stars together again.</i>

459
00:44:15,848 --> 00:44:16,818
<i>Hibito.</i>

460
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:13,998
Today, we're about to witness a true leap for mankind.

461
00:45:13,998 --> 00:45:21,048
As everybody knows on the surface of the Moon, there is no air or water and certainly no chance of survival.

462
00:45:21,048 --> 00:45:27,788
The challenge of building any kind of Moon base is probably the most ambitious project in the history of science.

463
00:45:27,788 --> 00:45:31,528
In this mission, all our eyes are on Hibito Namba.

464
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:37,178
The samurai boy will be the youngest person ever to walk on the Moon and Japan's first.

465
00:45:37,178 --> 00:45:44,058
On this beautiful day in Florida, we are now together, the people here, in Japan and all over the world...

466
00:45:44,058 --> 00:45:45,568
Excuse me, excuse me.

467
00:45:53,828 --> 00:45:55,008
Mutta!

468
00:45:55,008 --> 00:45:57,038
Mutta! Mutta! Mutta!

469
00:45:59,448 --> 00:46:04,248
Hey hey, he told me to tell you that this spot is the best for the interview.

470
00:46:04,248 --> 00:46:06,678
Isn't that great, honey?!

471
00:46:07,988 --> 00:46:10,358
Hibito!

472
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:11,718
You are famous now.

473
00:46:15,298 --> 00:46:17,818
Hibito!

474
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:21,178
Hibito!

475
00:46:23,418 --> 00:46:25,268
Hibito!

476
00:46:25,268 --> 00:46:26,098
Thank you.

477
00:46:34,908 --> 00:46:37,028
Sorry, apologies.

478
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:38,808
Hibito!

479
00:46:41,408 --> 00:46:43,568
Dad, mom, I'll be back soon!

480
00:46:43,748 --> 00:46:46,648
You're going to be 11 stones on the Moon! Eat well!

481
00:46:46,648 --> 00:46:48,428
Don't forget it!

482
00:46:48,428 --> 00:46:49,988
Please, look after Apo!

483
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:52,638
Apo's a good dog!

484
00:46:52,638 --> 00:46:55,108
You're embarrassing us, dad.

485
00:47:10,418 --> 00:47:12,178
Mu-chan, don't forget.

486
00:47:16,778 --> 00:47:17,948
Forget?

487
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:20,228
Forget?

488
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:22,188
Of course I won't forget!

489
00:47:22,868 --> 00:47:24,018
So...

490
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:30,738
I’m just giving you a head start. I'll see you in space. Believe it!

491
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:41,958
Don't chip your tooth whilst on the ride!

492
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,238
100% for style.

493
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:51,848
My brother.

494
00:47:52,898 --> 00:47:54,368
Right, Apo?

495
00:47:55,268 --> 00:47:56,258
Dad, where's Apo?

496
00:47:59,658 --> 00:48:00,698
Apo, Apo!

497
00:48:00,698 --> 00:48:01,968
Apo!

498
00:48:01,968 --> 00:48:02,938
My dog!

499
00:48:04,078 --> 00:48:05,328
Hibito!

500
00:48:05,328 --> 00:48:08,188
Hibito, we'll take care of everything!

501
00:48:08,188 --> 00:48:09,128
Apo!

502
00:48:19,638 --> 00:48:21,208
Apo!

503
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:26,858
Wait for me!

504
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,248
Apo!

505
00:48:45,648 --> 00:48:47,148
What are you doing?

506
00:48:48,198 --> 00:48:50,138
Apo.

507
00:48:51,288 --> 00:48:54,158
Wait, Apo!

508
00:48:54,158 --> 00:48:56,108
Give me a break.

509
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,828
What's with the sudden walk! Let's go!

510
00:48:59,828 --> 00:49:00,708
Hey, you!

511
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:03,288
Come up here broccoli!

512
00:49:05,488 --> 00:49:06,998
Don't just stand there.

513
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,398
You want to see the lift off, right?

514
00:49:11,188 --> 00:49:13,298
Climb up the ladder, there.

515
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:15,778
What the hell?

516
00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:22,178
Mister!

517
00:49:23,048 --> 00:49:24,258
Old man,

518
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,768
I'm very sorry.

519
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:31,898
I don't have time to hang out with you.

520
00:49:31,898 --> 00:49:33,278
Just a minute

521
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:36,578
You know we live one life.

522
00:49:37,588 --> 00:49:40,578
You can't play around with two.

523
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:43,378
You follow me, broccoli?

524
00:49:52,148 --> 00:49:54,498
Now look at what you can see.

525
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:09,578
Amazing!

526
00:50:13,418 --> 00:50:18,958
This used to be the control tower way back, before the Apollo missions.

527
00:50:19,108 --> 00:50:23,458
In the beginning, it was just small unmanned rockets.

528
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:33,798
You just made a choice you'll never regret.

529
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:47,738
My little brother is in there.

530
00:50:52,138 --> 00:50:59,378
But I... I have so many different feelings.

531
00:51:01,528 --> 00:51:08,118
I just don't know how I should look up at that rocket.

532
00:51:15,468 --> 00:51:21,078
I've been feeling everything, looking at that guy.

533
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:29,158
So kid, tell me, that big rocket over there.

534
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:33,398
You know what powers it? What lifts it up?

535
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:42,078
The heart of the people. That's real power.

536
00:51:42,388 --> 00:51:49,638
It's the courage of the astronauts. Every rocket and every single mission,

537
00:51:49,638 --> 00:51:58,058
so full of passion and determination. And then, all the tireless people on the ground.

538
00:51:58,058 --> 00:52:01,308
Every single one of them, an expert.

539
00:52:01,308 --> 00:52:05,168
So proud. So full of knowledge

540
00:52:05,168 --> 00:52:09,218
Then think of all of those people out there watching.

541
00:52:09,218 --> 00:52:13,218
Full of hope and prayer. Respect.

542
00:52:13,218 --> 00:52:18,888
That's what ignites. That's what catches fire inside and then explodes

543
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:24,938
and lifts that 2000 tonnes of metal into space.

544
00:52:24,938 --> 00:52:31,458
So that thing that's bothering you, it's stirring inside. That confusion.

545
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,878
Well it's just helping lift that rocket a little higher.

546
00:52:39,918 --> 00:52:41,258
Do you feel better?

547
00:52:42,788 --> 00:52:44,268
I don't know.

548
00:52:45,728 --> 00:52:47,778
Thanks, I guess.

549
00:52:49,668 --> 00:52:52,958
So... who are you?

550
00:52:53,938 --> 00:53:01,428
I’m just an old man who took a stroll on the Moon a long long time ago.

551
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:05,918
Enough of that, it's about to lift off.

552
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,058
T minus 20 seconds and counting.

553
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:22,548
18... 17... 16...

554
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:26,928
15... 14... 13...

555
00:53:26,928 --> 00:53:30,308
12... 11... 10...

556
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:34,228
9... 8... 7... 6...

557
00:53:34,518 --> 00:53:35,958
Main engine start.

558
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:36,958
4...

559
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:37,958
3...

560
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:38,958
2...

561
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:39,908
1...

562
00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:42,588
And we have lift off!

563
00:54:36,048 --> 00:54:37,098
Go...

564
00:54:38,678 --> 00:54:39,768
Go...

565
00:54:42,258 --> 00:54:43,388
Go...

566
00:54:48,568 --> 00:54:50,898
Go!

567
00:55:35,728 --> 00:55:37,058
Congratulations...

568
00:55:38,198 --> 00:55:39,558
Hibito.

569
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:46,438
Deneb, this is Houston.

570
00:55:46,438 --> 00:55:49,238
2 minutes and all is going swift and smoothly.

571
00:55:49,238 --> 00:55:52,968
Roger. Ready for SRB seperation, over.

572
00:55:52,968 --> 00:55:54,128
Roger.

573
00:56:01,548 --> 00:56:02,828
Clear.

574
00:56:02,828 --> 00:56:03,458
Roger.

575
00:56:04,268 --> 00:56:06,038
EDS to manual.

576
00:56:06,698 --> 00:56:08,348
LES set.

577
00:56:11,638 --> 00:56:15,028
Third phase has been set. Brace yourselves, guys.

578
00:56:22,558 --> 00:56:24,898
Second engine cleared.

579
00:56:25,268 --> 00:56:27,858
Okay guys, are you ready?

580
00:56:27,858 --> 00:56:28,988
This is it.

581
00:56:28,988 --> 00:56:31,238
Alright, let's do it!

582
00:56:51,048 --> 00:56:52,758
Welcome to space, Hibito.

583
00:56:55,438 --> 00:56:57,448
Into...

584
00:57:01,448 --> 00:57:02,768
outer space.

585
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:06,638
Out of this world.

586
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:40,888
Okay everybody, let's go to the Moon!

587
00:57:52,748 --> 00:57:55,948
Hoshika, it's over.

588
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:57,448
I don't think so.

589
00:57:57,448 --> 00:58:02,938
Sawaki seems to have 2 more votes than Namba.

590
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,478
The discussion is over.

591
00:58:04,478 --> 00:58:07,598
It's just two votes. The candidates should be discussed further.

592
00:58:07,598 --> 00:58:10,168
Two additional votes is still a majority.

593
00:58:10,168 --> 00:58:13,348
Our data also highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate.

594
00:58:13,348 --> 00:58:15,418
Values processed by the computer doesn't guarantee the better candidate.

595
00:58:15,418 --> 00:58:18,598
After all, a program is limited by what it cannot measure, right?

596
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:20,678
Are you suggesting the programs we have used are all for naught?

597
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:23,268
Why are you so obsessed with Namba?

598
00:58:23,268 --> 00:58:25,818
It's something I can't clearly articulate...

599
00:58:28,948 --> 00:58:30,938
But it's almost destiny that it should happen.

600
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:34,278
Imagine, two brothers in space.

601
00:58:40,088 --> 00:58:42,118
Pardon the intrusion,

602
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:43,358
but I vote for him.

603
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:49,338
From my experience, Hibito's passion for space is insurmountable.

604
00:58:49,338 --> 00:58:52,758
As a child, he and Mutta would attend all of JAXA's presentations.

605
00:58:53,278 --> 00:58:55,098
Also, imagine the world's first space brothers,

606
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,268
exploring the Moon together; I vote for Mutta!

607
00:58:58,638 --> 00:58:59,468
All the way!

608
00:59:00,818 --> 00:59:02,468
Hey hey...

609
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:06,518
Sadly, she's not apart of this committee.

610
00:59:06,778 --> 00:59:10,108
Indeed. Ms. Yuan does not have the right to vote.

611
01:00:10,528 --> 01:00:13,418
Okay Hibito, it's rolling.

612
01:00:13,908 --> 01:00:15,038
You ready?

613
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:18,128
This is going out all over Japan.

614
01:00:18,508 --> 01:00:20,938
You'd better look cool coming down that ladder.

615
01:00:28,028 --> 01:00:34,038
That's one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind.

616
01:00:34,038 --> 01:00:40,108
Neil Armstrong proclaimed those famous words when he was on the Moon 56 years ago.

617
01:00:42,328 --> 01:00:46,218
Since ancient times, the Moon has held great reverence to the Japanese...

618
01:00:46,218 --> 01:00:50,118
I can't believe it...

619
01:00:57,098 --> 01:00:59,978
I've got to tell him the good news.

620
01:01:05,718 --> 01:01:08,108
It's starting.

621
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:10,398
Why is this camera so slow?!

622
01:01:10,398 --> 01:01:12,318
Apo seems optimistic about the news.

623
01:01:14,058 --> 01:01:17,398
You can use it as it is. Image reception is still good.

624
01:01:17,398 --> 01:01:17,928
Copy.

625
01:01:39,388 --> 01:01:40,338
Awesome!

626
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:51,198
Okay!

627
01:02:02,578 --> 01:02:06,698
Yay!

628
01:02:10,168 --> 01:02:11,748
Look at him go!

629
01:02:23,848 --> 01:02:25,908
Wait wait wait...

630
01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:28,488
Hell of an entrance. Yeah!

631
01:02:33,308 --> 01:02:36,188
Hibito's first step is well received.

632
01:02:37,198 --> 01:02:43,028
On the day of the first Japanese to land on the Moon, his entrance could be described as energetic and youthful.

633
01:02:43,028 --> 01:02:44,668
A bold entrance!

634
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:50,958
What was that?

635
01:02:53,328 --> 01:02:57,998
Our very own lunar rabbit is hopping around.

636
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:14,768
Excellent. Excellent!

637
01:03:15,488 --> 01:03:18,288
Excellent!

638
01:03:41,858 --> 01:03:44,358
Kenji Makabe (31)

639
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,958
Serika Itou (26)

640
01:03:49,138 --> 01:03:51,638
Yamato Mizoguchi (28)

641
01:03:52,908 --> 01:03:55,408
Naoto Fukuda (54)

642
01:03:56,538 --> 01:03:59,038
Yasushi Furuya (30)

643
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:02,988
Mutta Namba (31)

644
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:29,508
Please, enter.

645
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:43,198
Incredible.

646
01:04:55,548 --> 01:04:58,258
Hey, check it out.

647
01:04:58,258 --> 01:05:00,778
It's obviously a sealed environment but there are windows.

648
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:03,738
A nice touch.

649
01:05:03,738 --> 01:05:07,408
We're now floating in space.

650
01:05:07,408 --> 01:05:11,438
Yes, where there's a lack of oxygen and gravity.

651
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:18,948
You sound like a talkative fellow. And you wear your heart on your sleeve, too.

652
01:05:19,778 --> 01:05:21,578
Furuya's the name.

653
01:05:22,158 --> 01:05:26,148
We should be cautious of what we say.

654
01:05:26,868 --> 01:05:29,078
This is an exam.

655
01:05:29,078 --> 01:05:31,108
Our actions will be monitored by the command center.

656
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:33,918
That includes what we say.

657
01:05:44,168 --> 01:05:46,828
The test has begun.

658
01:05:46,828 --> 01:05:47,948
Please.

659
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:58,038
Let's give them the first challenge.

660
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,178
I concur.

661
01:06:02,988 --> 01:06:05,318
Your attention, please.

662
01:06:05,988 --> 01:06:08,428
Please observe the screen.

663
01:06:08,428 --> 01:06:14,528
This cabin is self sufficient and it is designed for long term space travel.

664
01:06:14,788 --> 01:06:21,518
You will spend ten days in here and undergo numerous tasks.

665
01:06:21,518 --> 01:06:29,168
A careful note, the air pressure in this cabin is set at 0.8 atm.

666
01:06:29,168 --> 01:06:32,058
Please pay attention to any abnormal physical conditions.

667
01:06:32,058 --> 01:06:37,848
The wrist bracelet you are wearing must never be removed.

668
01:06:37,848 --> 01:06:41,208
Consider it a lucky charm imbued with the power to guarantee your safety.

669
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:43,138
What the hell is this?

670
01:06:43,138 --> 01:06:46,188
It's recording our physiology

671
01:06:46,528 --> 01:06:48,968
and allows them insight into our psychology.

672
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:51,868
Lastly,

673
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:58,708
you will vote for the top three candidates at the end of this exercise.

674
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:01,798
Only three will be able to pass.

675
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:06,238
During your stay you will be given free time.

676
01:07:07,298 --> 01:07:11,608
Feel free to spend it any way you like.

677
01:07:11,608 --> 01:07:14,238
Hey, what the hell is this? We're being observed like chimps!

678
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:17,268
Guess that's the instructions.

679
01:07:17,268 --> 01:07:18,298
Let's formally introduce ourselves.

680
01:07:18,928 --> 01:07:19,798
Okay!

681
01:07:19,798 --> 01:07:22,188
An exceptional idea.

682
01:07:22,648 --> 01:07:27,118
By understanding each other, we can function better as a team.

683
01:07:28,158 --> 01:07:29,148
Let's start with Mizoguchi...

684
01:07:29,148 --> 01:07:30,798
It doesn't matter.

685
01:07:31,578 --> 01:07:32,408
Makabe-san...

686
01:07:32,498 --> 01:07:33,428
Yes?

687
01:07:33,998 --> 01:07:36,848
I'm not here to play games and make friends.

688
01:07:39,748 --> 01:07:44,448
I thought we all had an opportunity to win.

689
01:07:48,868 --> 01:07:51,588
He has a point.

690
01:08:01,108 --> 01:08:02,588
Do I look a little pale?

691
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:12,018
Delicious.

692
01:08:21,628 --> 01:08:22,798
What's up?

693
01:08:24,948 --> 01:08:26,528
Thanks for the meal.

694
01:08:26,528 --> 01:08:27,118
That was fast.

695
01:08:27,118 --> 01:08:29,988
A friendly reminder.

696
01:08:29,988 --> 01:08:34,418
You have 15 minutes to complete breakfast.

697
01:08:34,418 --> 01:08:40,158
At 0730 please be prepared to receive instructions on today's task. End of announcement.

698
01:08:42,468 --> 01:08:46,818
<i>A day in the confined capsule of M8,</i>

699
01:08:46,818 --> 01:08:50,818
<i>directives are being issued every 15 minutes.</i>

700
01:08:50,818 --> 01:08:52,878
<i>Talk about micro management.</i>

701
01:08:56,788 --> 01:08:59,278
Dude, it's all white!

702
01:09:00,578 --> 01:09:03,088
This puzzle is sadistic.

703
01:09:03,778 --> 01:09:10,868
Logical thinking, spatial cognition, reasoning analysis, they're all being tested.

704
01:09:12,508 --> 01:09:16,918
<i>Eat. Sleep. Work.</i>

705
01:09:16,918 --> 01:09:18,848
<i>It seems we're all keeping to ourselves.</i>

706
01:09:18,848 --> 01:09:21,288
<i>What a dreary state of affair.</i>

707
01:09:21,288 --> 01:09:24,778
<i>It seems the rules and tasks are intended to foster competition.</i>

708
01:09:24,778 --> 01:09:28,098
<i>Our results for each task were also recorded.</i>

709
01:09:30,928 --> 01:09:32,398
It's taxing my eyes.

710
01:09:32,948 --> 01:09:34,548
I know what you mean.

711
01:09:39,788 --> 01:09:43,108
Oh crap, I lost my position.

712
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:46,368
Dammit...

713
01:09:47,878 --> 01:09:52,798
<i>The most unbearable task is the log at the end of the day.</i>

714
01:09:56,978 --> 01:10:00,188
Good night.

715
01:10:00,188 --> 01:10:01,238
I'll turn off the lights.

716
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:02,048
Okay.

717
01:10:03,318 --> 01:10:07,108
<i>Let's see. Log column.</i>

718
01:10:07,108 --> 01:10:10,048
<i>I suspect the most intense moment will be when we have to collate the scores.</i>

719
01:10:30,808 --> 01:10:33,258
A group battle?

720
01:10:33,838 --> 01:10:35,948
Group A, please to work with you.

721
01:10:35,948 --> 01:10:37,398
Likewise.

722
01:10:37,398 --> 01:10:38,808
Pleased to be working with you.

723
01:10:38,808 --> 01:10:39,798
Let's work hard together.

724
01:10:40,548 --> 01:10:41,268
Pleased to be working with you.

725
01:10:41,268 --> 01:10:43,278
Likewise.

726
01:10:45,478 --> 01:10:46,558
Try your best!

727
01:10:46,558 --> 01:10:47,278
I will.

728
01:10:50,488 --> 01:10:52,268
What surprises are installed for us this time?

729
01:10:52,268 --> 01:10:53,548
What's inside?

730
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:54,788
Let's open it and see.

731
01:10:54,788 --> 01:10:56,318
Yes, let's open it!

732
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:00,238
What the...

733
01:11:01,308 --> 01:11:02,628
Hey, what's this?

734
01:11:02,628 --> 01:11:04,298
Model kits?

735
01:11:04,878 --> 01:11:07,438
There are heaps.

736
01:11:07,438 --> 01:11:08,618
Looks like fun.

737
01:11:08,618 --> 01:11:11,008
Today's task is as follows.

738
01:11:11,498 --> 01:11:17,348
As a group, design a 2035 lunar surface facility.

739
01:11:17,798 --> 01:11:23,798
Please draw on technical experience and imagination.

740
01:11:23,798 --> 01:11:29,668
The facility is designed to last over ten years.

741
01:11:29,668 --> 01:11:32,458
In addition, write an instruction manual for your design.

742
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:35,258
Be prepared to dedicate 1 to 4 hours a day on this task.

743
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:38,388
On the last day, you will be asked to give a speech on the designs.

744
01:11:40,078 --> 01:11:42,478
Firstly,

745
01:11:42,478 --> 01:11:44,978
let's have a look at our inventory.

746
01:11:47,418 --> 01:11:48,408
Let's do it.

747
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,358
We'll leave the box on the side of this table.

748
01:11:55,358 --> 01:11:56,568
Good.

749
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:00,038
A lunar surface facility, they say...

750
01:12:00,938 --> 01:12:02,958
I’m a little excited by this assignment.

751
01:12:04,938 --> 01:12:06,038
Agreed!

752
01:12:07,188 --> 01:12:10,338
Let's work together and make the best lunar surface facility!

753
01:12:10,338 --> 01:12:11,128
Agreed!

754
01:12:12,038 --> 01:12:13,038
Okay!

755
01:12:16,088 --> 01:12:19,468
Houston. Houston. This is Hibito.

756
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:24,248
KU activated, power unit exchanged.

757
01:12:25,348 --> 01:12:26,998
Now complete.

758
01:12:27,338 --> 01:12:31,498
Roger that. Hibito, always at full throttle.

759
01:12:32,288 --> 01:12:37,498
It's just that I really enjoy this.

760
01:12:37,498 --> 01:12:41,768
I've spent five years training for this moment.

761
01:12:43,488 --> 01:12:44,708
I hear you.

762
01:12:45,598 --> 01:12:49,008
The whole time we did emergency simulations, man!

763
01:12:51,588 --> 01:12:54,968
You know, I hope we get lost in space or something,

764
01:12:55,358 --> 01:12:57,658
that way, I can really test my skills.

765
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,448
Come on, Buddy. Bad joke!

766
01:13:00,448 --> 01:13:02,488
Yeah, of course it's a bad joke.

767
01:13:02,488 --> 01:13:07,248
The gravity up here makes it a real possibility.

768
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,408
Yeah!

769
01:13:17,468 --> 01:13:18,978
Yes.

770
01:13:33,438 --> 01:13:37,688
You've got to hurry up and see the scenery.

771
01:13:47,778 --> 01:13:51,358
Fukuda's meditating.

772
01:13:58,128 --> 01:13:59,878
It's been a week.

773
01:13:59,878 --> 01:14:02,698
The physiological readings are showing differences bit by bit.

774
01:14:04,218 --> 01:14:07,568
Must be tough to live with strangers for 24/7.

775
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:10,728
Let's not forget living through a heavily regimented routine.

776
01:14:10,728 --> 01:14:12,888
Stress was likely to build up.

777
01:14:13,468 --> 01:14:16,098
Communication is the key component.

778
01:14:17,858 --> 01:14:21,058
It was no mistake I was unsuccessful in my attempt.

779
01:14:22,198 --> 01:14:25,848
20 years ago, I was a touch too sensitive. Strange how we change.

780
01:14:26,288 --> 01:14:29,858
True that. Age and experience brings control.

781
01:14:29,858 --> 01:14:36,898
Regardless of the circumstances, I’m going to sleep well tonight with a clear conscious.

782
01:14:36,898 --> 01:14:40,738
The basic requirements for an astronaut cannot be measured with absolute certainty using test papers.

783
01:14:42,338 --> 01:14:47,748
Good to see an elevated level of stress in the capsule. Who's going to crack first?

784
01:14:48,418 --> 01:14:50,748
From studying the six candidates.

785
01:14:52,368 --> 01:14:54,898
I'm getting a sense on who would work well in teams.

786
01:14:54,898 --> 01:14:56,908
We're almost out of time.

787
01:14:56,908 --> 01:14:58,078
Time to play the green cards.

788
01:14:58,518 --> 01:14:59,258
Yes.

789
01:15:12,678 --> 01:15:15,838
For today, the diagnostic ends.

790
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:17,868
Good night.

791
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:22,458
Thank you.

792
01:15:25,328 --> 01:15:27,358
Just a moment, Namba-kun.

793
01:15:27,888 --> 01:15:29,508
This is Hoshika.

794
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:31,098
Yes?

795
01:15:31,518 --> 01:15:33,498
There's a question I want you to answer.

796
01:15:34,758 --> 01:15:35,598
Okay.

797
01:15:37,218 --> 01:15:40,158
Rest assured, everyone will eventually be asked to do this.

798
01:15:40,798 --> 01:15:44,678
Feel free to cut loose and state what is on your mind.

799
01:15:44,678 --> 01:15:49,248
Who do you think is suitable to become an astronaut?

800
01:15:52,538 --> 01:15:54,158
Answer with your gut instinct.

801
01:16:01,688 --> 01:16:04,638
The most suitable person is...

802
01:16:06,078 --> 01:16:08,398
Kenji Makabe and...

803
01:16:09,088 --> 01:16:10,388
Serika Itou.

804
01:16:11,298 --> 01:16:12,808
A combination of both would be perfect.

805
01:16:15,728 --> 01:16:19,968
Makabe-kun conducts himself with impeccable excellence.

806
01:16:20,468 --> 01:16:22,818
His weakness resides in respecting the views of others too much.

807
01:16:22,818 --> 01:16:24,508
He has a natural ability to lead. Extremely trust worthy
His weakness resides in respecting the views of others too much.

808
01:16:24,508 --> 01:16:24,528
He has a natural ability to lead. Extremely trust worthy

809
01:16:24,968 --> 01:16:27,478
As for the next...

810
01:16:29,898 --> 01:16:31,648
Itou-san, her beauty aside,

811
01:16:35,378 --> 01:16:39,088
she has a ravenous appetite but knows how to get people to act.

812
01:16:40,148 --> 01:16:44,148
Despite being the only female, she doesn't feel out of place nor is she easily irritated, if at all.

813
01:16:44,488 --> 01:16:50,028
The group works well together because of her cheerful disposition.

814
01:16:50,028 --> 01:16:51,308
Now, let's work.

815
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:52,738
Scary.

816
01:16:56,488 --> 01:16:57,428
But...

817
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,268
One moment...

818
01:17:03,568 --> 01:17:05,648
How to put this...

819
01:17:07,738 --> 01:17:09,198
It would appear,

820
01:17:10,068 --> 01:17:12,298
in my opinion,

821
01:17:12,298 --> 01:17:15,088
each person has their own charm.

822
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:18,268
Mr. Fukuda,

823
01:17:18,268 --> 01:17:21,378
may look a little frail,

824
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:23,608
but he is, in fact, in good health.

825
01:17:23,608 --> 01:17:27,238
After all, he did not come last in the squat exercises.

826
01:17:28,008 --> 01:17:29,758
As for Mizoguchi-kun...

827
01:17:30,338 --> 01:17:34,168
The first impression he gave was rather frosty.

828
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:39,848
If you look at his t-shirts, you'd realize he's a Gundam fan.

829
01:17:39,848 --> 01:17:41,588
Perhaps he's putting up a front like a character from the show.

830
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:44,688
Furuya-kun is...

831
01:17:45,108 --> 01:17:46,638
He's interesting.

832
01:17:47,438 --> 01:17:49,918
He may appear to be very opinionated,

833
01:17:49,918 --> 01:17:52,488
probably because he comes from Kansai.

834
01:17:52,488 --> 01:17:55,508
However, he is extremely meticulous,

835
01:17:55,508 --> 01:17:57,488
very clean by nature.

836
01:17:57,488 --> 01:18:00,608
Thanks to him, the cabin is spotless.

837
01:18:02,288 --> 01:18:04,768
Guess there's a lot of positive traits to consider.

838
01:18:06,118 --> 01:18:08,878
In the end,

839
01:18:09,628 --> 01:18:13,118
everyone has something that'll make them a suitable astronaut.

840
01:18:13,468 --> 01:18:14,868
I see.

841
01:18:15,088 --> 01:18:19,668
This may be slightly embarrassing...

842
01:18:23,898 --> 01:18:26,618
But what everyone here has in common is a strong desire to go to space.

843
01:18:26,618 --> 01:18:28,718
Especially me.

844
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:32,888
Got it, most appreciated.

845
01:18:32,888 --> 01:18:33,898
Okay.

846
01:18:38,018 --> 01:18:43,278
Allow me to give you a personal message.

847
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:46,178
Mutta Namba-kun,

848
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:50,698
you will receive a green card.

849
01:20:30,678 --> 01:20:32,928
Everyone come here now!

850
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:44,188
Who would do this?

851
01:20:46,038 --> 01:20:48,568
I’m wondering that myself.

852
01:20:52,618 --> 01:20:54,668
Could it be one of the crew members?

853
01:20:54,668 --> 01:20:57,598
Undoubtedly, it was from someone standing here.

854
01:20:58,138 --> 01:21:00,828
There are six members,

855
01:21:01,298 --> 01:21:03,248
most likely, it was someone from group B.

856
01:21:09,728 --> 01:21:11,468
Are you suspecting me?

857
01:21:12,068 --> 01:21:13,588
I can assure you, I’m innocent.

858
01:21:16,148 --> 01:21:17,698
It's certainly not me.

859
01:21:18,938 --> 01:21:20,138
and it's extremely unlikely it's Mr. Fukuda.

860
01:21:20,138 --> 01:21:21,018
What are your thoughts?

861
01:21:21,018 --> 01:21:24,338
How quick group B are to defend each other.

862
01:21:25,748 --> 01:21:27,718
Don't joke around.

863
01:21:28,098 --> 01:21:31,038
If you're going to accuse us you should, at least, show some evidence.

864
01:21:31,038 --> 01:21:32,028
Evidence?

865
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:39,908
Only our group's work was irrevocably damaged but group B's project remained miraculously safe.

866
01:21:39,908 --> 01:21:42,578
A rather interesting point to consider, don't you think?

867
01:21:42,578 --> 01:21:43,918
Hell, even a child could figure this one out.

868
01:21:45,428 --> 01:21:48,838
Despite that, you're still mistaken.

869
01:21:48,838 --> 01:21:50,688
There's only so much bullshit I can take!

870
01:21:50,688 --> 01:21:50,998
<i>Relax relax relax!
There's only so much bullshit I can take!</i>

871
01:21:50,998 --> 01:21:52,228
<i>Relax relax relax!</i>

872
01:21:52,228 --> 01:21:53,848
Let's cease this futile argument!

873
01:21:53,848 --> 01:21:54,918
Guys, you've got to cool down!

874
01:21:54,918 --> 01:21:56,188
I'm calm!

875
01:21:56,188 --> 01:21:58,208
Furuya-san, let's just cool off first.

876
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:01,858
Itou-san is good to speak.

877
01:22:01,858 --> 01:22:04,658
A week's worth of work, completely trampled.

878
01:22:04,658 --> 01:22:07,068
Hey, why don't you pipe up!

879
01:22:08,098 --> 01:22:08,928
Well...

880
01:22:10,108 --> 01:22:11,488
I guess...

881
01:22:13,068 --> 01:22:16,028
There's no point crying over spilled milk.

882
01:22:17,638 --> 01:22:19,328
Our only option is to rebuild it.

883
01:22:19,328 --> 01:22:23,708
Funny how exam conditions makes everyone so wholesome.

884
01:22:26,448 --> 01:22:27,348
Hey...

885
01:22:28,698 --> 01:22:32,458
I'll never forgive the scumbag who would stoop so low!

886
01:22:33,018 --> 01:22:34,668
That's the only consolation I have.

887
01:23:23,858 --> 01:23:27,368
Why put me in such a compromised position?

888
01:23:31,558 --> 01:23:32,438
Good morning, Mu-kun.

889
01:23:32,908 --> 01:23:35,548
Oh, good morning, Kenji.

890
01:23:38,468 --> 01:23:39,468
Thanks.

891
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:46,118
Today's the end.

892
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:48,078
True.

893
01:23:51,468 --> 01:23:52,848
Hey, Mu-kun.

894
01:23:56,118 --> 01:23:59,638
Do you think it's someone who undermined their own project?

895
01:24:02,988 --> 01:24:04,068
No idea.

896
01:24:05,568 --> 01:24:07,198
Absolutely no idea.

897
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:10,728
Oh, I see.

898
01:24:15,288 --> 01:24:19,588
Perhaps if the underminers should meet,

899
01:24:21,018 --> 01:24:21,948
they should shake hands.

900
01:24:30,808 --> 01:24:32,928
Group B's project has been vandalized.

901
01:24:38,908 --> 01:24:43,188
Merciless. Utterly merciless.

902
01:24:43,188 --> 01:24:44,658
How is this so?

903
01:24:44,658 --> 01:24:49,158
Based on yesterday's logic, it must be retaliation from group A.

904
01:24:49,558 --> 01:24:51,378
No doubt, Furuya.

905
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:52,388
What did you say?

906
01:24:52,388 --> 01:24:54,298
Don't deny it!

907
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:57,228
Venting your anger. Vengeance is yours, right!

908
01:24:57,228 --> 01:24:58,528
I see.

909
01:25:02,068 --> 01:25:06,288
One has to explore all the possibilities.

910
01:25:06,718 --> 01:25:09,038
Are you that bitter and self-centered that you had to do this?

911
01:25:09,038 --> 01:25:12,298
You're calling me self-centered, hypocrite.

912
01:25:12,298 --> 01:25:13,828
Let's stop this, guys!

913
01:25:16,018 --> 01:25:17,668
It's even be possible that the true culprit may not be from A or B.

914
01:25:19,308 --> 01:25:22,978
There are six of us in this team.

915
01:25:23,738 --> 01:25:26,158
Stepping in to play hero again, Makabe-san?

916
01:25:27,678 --> 01:25:31,828
Whether playing team leader or judge, you just want power.

917
01:25:31,828 --> 01:25:35,898
I never agreed that you were the head of our group.

918
01:25:36,248 --> 01:25:37,318
I...

919
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:39,658
I never realized.

920
01:25:39,658 --> 01:25:43,588
You keep to yourself and become a lone rebel.

921
01:25:43,588 --> 01:25:46,208
You're too immature to become an astronaut.

922
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:48,498
Right back at you, shorty.

923
01:25:56,588 --> 01:26:00,008
Doesn't matter how many times I see this,

924
01:26:00,008 --> 01:26:02,088
it's amazing.

925
01:26:02,898 --> 01:26:06,978
Could we see similar things on the Earth if there were no air?

926
01:26:06,978 --> 01:26:09,178
Like this? Sure.

927
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:12,318
But my eyes are getting pretty tired.

928
01:26:12,318 --> 01:26:16,038
Those mountains over there, they are so clear.

929
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:19,458
Well, if your eyes are tired,

930
01:26:19,458 --> 01:26:23,578
I'll wake you up with my U-F-O story.

931
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:28,378
Maybe I’m tired of hearing Hibito's UFO story, too.

932
01:26:28,378 --> 01:26:34,918
I know. But people say, my UFO story sounds better on the Moon.

933
01:26:35,818 --> 01:26:38,308
Alright, alright. I'll listen to it.

934
01:26:38,308 --> 01:26:40,908
But once we found the lost lunar probe, okay?

935
01:26:40,908 --> 01:26:42,238
Okay.

936
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:45,918
I'll look for the probe using the manual. Where is it?

937
01:26:46,538 --> 01:26:48,098
It's in the box under your seat.

938
01:26:48,528 --> 01:26:49,788
Oh, thank you.

939
01:26:55,528 --> 01:26:56,718
Damian, stop!

940
01:26:56,718 --> 01:26:57,628
What!

941
01:27:52,598 --> 01:27:57,018
Mutta Namba-san, please report to the video phone room.

942
01:28:23,678 --> 01:28:24,578
Namba-kun.

943
01:28:25,768 --> 01:28:26,578
Yes?

944
01:28:27,318 --> 01:28:29,008
Please remain calm and listen.

945
01:28:30,828 --> 01:28:32,548
While on a lunar rover assignment, Hibito-kun may have had an accident.

946
01:28:38,508 --> 01:28:40,078
We've lost contact with him and his partner.

947
01:28:43,288 --> 01:28:47,868
NASA and JAXA are pulling their resources together to find them.

948
01:28:48,638 --> 01:28:51,498
The intelligence is scant.

949
01:28:53,878 --> 01:28:58,058
We are currently reviewing our satellites to get more detail about the situation.

950
01:28:58,668 --> 01:29:00,138
That's the emergency.

951
01:29:00,318 --> 01:29:02,658
My apologies for interrupting your exam.

952
01:29:02,658 --> 01:29:04,518
If you pull out of the exam, your results will not be affected.

953
01:29:05,528 --> 01:29:10,688
The choice to stay in the capsule or not

954
01:29:11,368 --> 01:29:13,028
is yours.

955
01:29:16,708 --> 01:29:19,078
Do not think of the worst.

956
01:29:20,328 --> 01:29:21,768
If it's any comfort,

957
01:29:23,038 --> 01:29:24,878
JAXA is well prepared for dealing with this type of scenario.

958
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:02,208
Namba-kun...

959
01:30:06,028 --> 01:30:07,168
I don't know what to say.

960
01:30:07,848 --> 01:30:09,118
I can imagine.

961
01:30:10,908 --> 01:30:14,648
The suits they're wearing should keep them alive for 3 nights, at least.

962
01:30:14,648 --> 01:30:17,178
We'll be working closely with Houston on this.

963
01:30:20,198 --> 01:30:21,398
I'll stay on.

964
01:30:23,438 --> 01:30:25,398
Are you sure?

965
01:30:28,078 --> 01:30:29,308
I...

966
01:30:31,568 --> 01:30:33,648
I'll complete this exam.

967
01:30:38,748 --> 01:30:39,748
Besides,

968
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:43,898
even If I leave,

969
01:30:47,668 --> 01:30:49,988
there is nothing I can do.

970
01:30:51,748 --> 01:30:53,518
I'm powerless to do anything.

971
01:30:55,428 --> 01:30:57,008
As it stands,

972
01:30:59,458 --> 01:31:02,528
I can't even get into space, yet.

973
01:31:09,818 --> 01:31:14,188
I understand and respect your choice.

974
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:20,828
This matter must not be revealed to the other candidates.

975
01:31:22,038 --> 01:31:25,738
We will continue with the capsule test.

976
01:31:27,918 --> 01:31:28,818
Understood?

977
01:31:30,828 --> 01:31:31,608
Yes.

978
01:32:47,768 --> 01:32:50,168
Are you okay, Mr. Fukuda?

979
01:32:50,168 --> 01:32:51,728
I’m just a little dizzy.

980
01:32:52,568 --> 01:32:54,748
I need to rest a little bit.

981
01:32:54,748 --> 01:32:56,768
Hang in there, the exam is almost finished.

982
01:32:57,298 --> 01:33:01,698
Don't let Mr. Fukuda rest.

983
01:33:01,698 --> 01:33:04,288
After all, you cannot present work that's accidentally broken.

984
01:33:04,938 --> 01:33:06,848
Now's not the time, Mizoguchi-kun.

985
01:33:06,848 --> 01:33:07,388
<i>Oh look, the team leader has now become the teacher.
Now's not the time, Mizoguchi-kun.</i>

986
01:33:07,388 --> 01:33:07,898
<i>Oh look, the team leader has now become the teacher.</i>

987
01:33:07,898 --> 01:33:09,828
Knock it off guys.

988
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:11,658
I’m fine.

989
01:33:11,658 --> 01:33:12,678
You should rest.

990
01:33:12,678 --> 01:33:13,778
It's okay.

991
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:15,898
Time's up.

992
01:33:15,898 --> 01:33:19,898
Group A will give the first presentation.

993
01:33:19,898 --> 01:33:21,198
Game over!

994
01:33:21,488 --> 01:33:23,188
Namba-san, it's finished.

995
01:33:26,418 --> 01:33:28,258
Hey, can't you hear me?

996
01:33:43,498 --> 01:33:44,458
Enough...

997
01:33:45,778 --> 01:33:46,858
It's concluded.

998
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,598
It's over.

999
01:34:00,408 --> 01:34:01,568
I have something to say.

1000
01:34:06,368 --> 01:34:07,698
Mu-kun wait...

1001
01:34:09,078 --> 01:34:10,248
What is it?

1002
01:34:11,378 --> 01:34:12,618
Nothing, Kenji.

1003
01:34:13,658 --> 01:34:19,228
But, don't you think it's kind of bleak...

1004
01:34:20,058 --> 01:34:22,588
to let it end this way?

1005
01:34:23,498 --> 01:34:25,008
Don't say it, Mu-kun.

1006
01:34:25,838 --> 01:34:30,108
Don't mention anything about the green card or you're screwed.

1007
01:34:32,868 --> 01:34:33,788
Everyone...

1008
01:34:35,748 --> 01:34:36,358
in fact, I...

1009
01:34:36,358 --> 01:34:37,838
Shut up!

1010
01:34:55,858 --> 01:34:58,588
<i>Mu-chan, over there!</i>

1011
01:35:09,798 --> 01:35:11,138
What were you going to say?

1012
01:35:13,168 --> 01:35:14,228
I...

1013
01:35:17,868 --> 01:35:19,648
I once saw a UFO.

1014
01:35:21,578 --> 01:35:22,638
You saw a UFO?

1015
01:35:23,148 --> 01:35:27,748
It was on Japan’s national day that I saw it with my little brother.

1016
01:35:28,298 --> 01:35:30,668
How can I describe it...

1017
01:35:30,668 --> 01:35:34,238
It was round like this and flew ultra-fast in zig-zag.

1018
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:37,458
Kind of like a fire fly on steroids. It then flew to the Moon and disappeared.

1019
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:39,708
What are you ranting about this time?

1020
01:35:40,098 --> 01:35:43,978
After that, I fell in love with space.

1021
01:35:44,498 --> 01:35:48,348
I would often go to JAXA with my brother to watch the ISS.

1022
01:35:48,348 --> 01:35:51,218
As long as we looked up, we could probably see it again.

1023
01:35:52,828 --> 01:35:54,128
But...

1024
01:35:56,218 --> 01:35:57,308
a short time after,

1025
01:35:58,028 --> 01:36:04,208
when I started talking about the UFO with my classmates, they branded me a liar.

1026
01:36:07,058 --> 01:36:07,948
My point is...

1027
01:36:11,478 --> 01:36:14,208
I guess I really enjoyed this exam.

1028
01:36:17,548 --> 01:36:19,208
It was hard,

1029
01:36:20,948 --> 01:36:22,748
but it was nice to share this experience

1030
01:36:24,108 --> 01:36:29,128
with people who have a similar passion.

1031
01:36:32,388 --> 01:36:34,748
People who are enthusiastic about astronomy.

1032
01:36:39,828 --> 01:36:40,898
We...

1033
01:36:43,128 --> 01:36:45,898
We gel well through our love for space.

1034
01:36:57,808 --> 01:36:58,908
I’m sorry.

1035
01:37:01,288 --> 01:37:02,498
You know.

1036
01:37:04,348 --> 01:37:10,058
I also grew up being heralded as Frankenstein by my classmates.

1037
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:15,968
As a kid, I use to observe the ISS with my dad.

1038
01:37:16,318 --> 01:37:19,348
I always hoped to come across aliens, too. Good memories.

1039
01:37:20,538 --> 01:37:21,828
That's a nice story, Serika-san.

1040
01:37:22,278 --> 01:37:23,098
Yeah.

1041
01:37:24,078 --> 01:37:27,938
In fact, I came here with the intention of becoming an astronaut.

1042
01:37:30,538 --> 01:37:33,618
As I wish to conduct medical research on the ISS.

1043
01:37:35,178 --> 01:37:37,698
Some drugs are easier to produce in space due to weightlessness.

1044
01:37:37,698 --> 01:37:41,498
Who knows, the drugs produced may even save many people.

1045
01:37:42,868 --> 01:37:47,708
Unfortunately, it was too late for my dad.

1046
01:37:51,398 --> 01:37:53,548
I see.

1047
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:56,658
I want to go to Mars.

1048
01:37:56,658 --> 01:37:58,848
Oh, why?

1049
01:37:59,858 --> 01:38:03,208
A whole lot of reasons.

1050
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:05,188
The challenge, the discoveries, the adventure. But overall,

1051
01:38:06,768 --> 01:38:07,608
its bigness.

1052
01:38:08,818 --> 01:38:10,938
But Mars is smaller than Earth.

1053
01:38:10,938 --> 01:38:14,858
Yet when we get there,

1054
01:38:14,858 --> 01:38:18,628
we would see how Mount Olympus is 3 times taller than Everest.

1055
01:38:18,628 --> 01:38:23,038
In addition, Valles Marineris would make the Grand Canyon comparable to a crack on the road.

1056
01:38:24,158 --> 01:38:28,788
A landscape of red hues. I've got to see it in this life time.

1057
01:38:28,788 --> 01:38:31,968
I understand this simple mood.

1058
01:38:32,398 --> 01:38:35,008
Of course, we can't just ignore our desires and give up.

1059
01:38:36,568 --> 01:38:40,018
Unlike everyone else, I’ve attempted becoming an astronaut twice.

1060
01:38:41,758 --> 01:38:43,308
It was probably 20 years and 5 years ago

1061
01:38:46,858 --> 01:38:50,858
that I also participated in the astronaut selection test.

1062
01:38:53,788 --> 01:38:55,358
I've never made it this far before.

1063
01:38:56,608 --> 01:38:57,778
But,

1064
01:38:58,378 --> 01:38:59,948
really,

1065
01:39:00,838 --> 01:39:02,908
I've always wanted to go to space.

1066
01:39:04,368 --> 01:39:08,718
A dream I’ve harbored since I was a child.

1067
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,978
I used to work so hard, I’d neglect my family.

1068
01:39:13,688 --> 01:39:17,388
Eventually, my family just got up and left.

1069
01:39:20,148 --> 01:39:23,538
Now, I’m 54 years old.

1070
01:39:26,658 --> 01:39:31,748
Even facing death, I will not renounce my desire.

1071
01:39:33,078 --> 01:39:38,338
You still have a chance. John Glenn was 77 years old when he went to space.

1072
01:39:40,058 --> 01:39:43,238
So 54 years is young in comparison.

1073
01:39:45,758 --> 01:39:46,998
Mizoguchi-kun.

1074
01:39:48,658 --> 01:39:49,708
Thank you.

1075
01:39:51,608 --> 01:39:52,708
We understand, Namba.

1076
01:39:53,228 --> 01:39:55,848
You're here because you saw some stupid UFO as a kid,

1077
01:39:55,848 --> 01:39:58,778
you fluffy hair bastard. Hendrix called, he wants his hair back.

1078
01:40:01,528 --> 01:40:06,278
Despite going through his own personal adversity, he can do this?

1079
01:40:07,218 --> 01:40:09,598
Perhaps it's the adversity that's motivating him.

1080
01:40:10,408 --> 01:40:13,618
Think what you want.

1081
01:40:15,748 --> 01:40:18,168
This guy is incredible.

1082
01:40:22,878 --> 01:40:24,628
<i>Please,</i>

1083
01:40:26,198 --> 01:40:29,618
<i>be safe right there, Hibito-kun.</i>

1084
01:42:01,408 --> 01:42:02,468
Damian...

1085
01:42:09,848 --> 01:42:12,478
Houston. Houston. This is Hibito.

1086
01:42:16,698 --> 01:42:18,018
Houston. Houston!

1087
01:42:19,668 --> 01:42:21,038
Dammit!

1088
01:42:39,588 --> 01:42:41,268
News from Houston.

1089
01:42:42,108 --> 01:42:47,298
They've detected flair lights from within a canyon.

1090
01:42:48,398 --> 01:42:50,808
Get the maps up and send it to the main display.

1091
01:42:50,808 --> 01:42:51,738
Understood.

1092
01:42:56,868 --> 01:42:58,008
Here?

1093
01:42:59,598 --> 01:43:01,688
The deepest part of the crater?

1094
01:43:02,078 --> 01:43:03,308
Not good.

1095
01:43:04,358 --> 01:43:08,968
Hopefully, the thermoregulation on their suits is okay.

1096
01:43:08,968 --> 01:43:13,368
But being at the bottom of the crater is not good.

1097
01:43:14,198 --> 01:43:17,008
In about an hour’s time, it's going to be -60 degrees Celsius.

1098
01:44:33,338 --> 01:44:36,958
Estimated time to destination: approximately 50 minutes.

1099
01:44:37,468 --> 01:44:40,318
They're at the bottom of that crater and no sun...

1100
01:44:40,318 --> 01:44:41,638
We've got to keep going!

1101
01:44:41,638 --> 01:44:44,068
Buddy, stay cool.

1102
01:44:44,068 --> 01:44:48,098
Focus, okay? We're doing everything we can.

1103
01:45:00,198 --> 01:45:00,728
Damian!

1104
01:45:02,278 --> 01:45:03,378
Damian!

1105
01:45:13,418 --> 01:45:14,788
Damian...

1106
01:45:29,058 --> 01:45:30,338
I can do it.

1107
01:45:40,968 --> 01:45:42,798
We're going back, Damian.

1108
01:46:34,288 --> 01:46:36,818
Wow, it's dazzling.

1109
01:46:39,658 --> 01:46:41,638
Congratulations.

1110
01:46:47,338 --> 01:46:51,268
Okay, next is the final interview.

1111
01:46:51,798 --> 01:46:58,588
But, before that, please enjoy the sun.

1112
01:46:58,588 --> 01:47:00,388
Applause for the candidates.

1113
01:47:07,688 --> 01:47:09,078
You soldiered on well.

1114
01:47:13,558 --> 01:47:14,888
Congratulations.

1115
01:47:15,508 --> 01:47:17,398
Must be hell being so far.

1116
01:47:20,388 --> 01:47:21,378
You did well.

1117
01:47:22,518 --> 01:47:23,718
Very good.

1118
01:47:24,208 --> 01:47:25,758
It was hard.

1119
01:47:31,408 --> 01:47:32,298
Please, take a seat.

1120
01:47:33,638 --> 01:47:34,808
Sure.

1121
01:47:39,108 --> 01:47:40,148
Namba-kun.

1122
01:47:41,668 --> 01:47:44,798
10 days. It must have been tough.

1123
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:46,778
Must have been.

1124
01:47:46,778 --> 01:47:47,568
Thanks.

1125
01:47:48,408 --> 01:47:53,988
In this final interview, we are only prepared to through with it, if you're okay.

1126
01:47:55,128 --> 01:47:55,888
Yes.

1127
01:47:57,158 --> 01:48:00,538
We don't want to place any unnecessary stress on you.

1128
01:48:02,918 --> 01:48:03,988
I am ready.

1129
01:48:07,238 --> 01:48:10,838
All astronauts have to confront this challenge.

1130
01:48:12,338 --> 01:48:13,278
Namba-kun...

1131
01:48:14,688 --> 01:48:19,838
Are you prepared to die?

1132
01:48:53,938 --> 01:48:55,078
Mu-chan...

1133
01:48:57,188 --> 01:48:58,278
I'm sorry...

1134
01:49:11,448 --> 01:49:12,438
And that's...

1135
01:49:14,288 --> 01:49:15,338
That's my answer.

1136
01:49:21,598 --> 01:49:22,708
I understand.

1137
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:26,538
That's all.

1138
01:49:26,538 --> 01:49:27,698
Excuse me.

1139
01:49:36,638 --> 01:49:37,718
I'm sorry but...

1140
01:49:42,038 --> 01:49:45,178
I lied.

1141
01:49:51,048 --> 01:49:52,328
In fact,

1142
01:49:53,538 --> 01:49:54,748
I don't want to die.

1143
01:49:56,028 --> 01:49:57,278
I don't.

1144
01:49:59,968 --> 01:50:01,048
Regarding...

1145
01:50:03,218 --> 01:50:06,328
Regarding your question on life and death,

1146
01:50:07,888 --> 01:50:11,638
I would try to live every last second.

1147
01:50:14,638 --> 01:50:16,128
Until the very end,

1148
01:50:17,558 --> 01:50:21,368
I would try my hardest to live.

1149
01:50:31,938 --> 01:50:35,578
I shall replace your answer

1150
01:50:35,578 --> 01:50:40,238
at the conclusion of this test.

1151
01:50:44,168 --> 01:50:45,528
I...

1152
01:50:50,878 --> 01:50:51,948
Thank you.

1153
01:50:54,728 --> 01:50:58,128
Let me conclude this test

1154
01:50:58,128 --> 01:51:00,668
by showing my gratitude

1155
01:51:05,108 --> 01:51:06,458
for my brother and I.

1156
01:51:07,658 --> 01:51:08,818
Hibito.

1157
01:51:09,638 --> 01:51:11,998
You've watched over us since we were kids.

1158
01:51:13,598 --> 01:51:14,578
But,

1159
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:18,128
I've been a hopeless big brother.

1160
01:51:21,668 --> 01:51:27,348
I have kept a promise to my brother.

1161
01:51:29,188 --> 01:51:33,868
I've seen the test through to the end.

1162
01:51:36,388 --> 01:51:37,518
Really,

1163
01:51:39,608 --> 01:51:41,378
thank you very much.

1164
01:51:45,648 --> 01:51:50,448
Looks like I'm having a déjà vu.

1165
01:51:55,308 --> 01:51:56,848
Five years ago,

1166
01:51:57,448 --> 01:52:03,098
I assessed your brother, too.

1167
01:52:05,858 --> 01:52:07,618
You guys really are brothers.

1168
01:52:14,918 --> 01:52:15,718
Yes.

1169
01:52:24,188 --> 01:52:27,428
Please, follow me to the control room.

1170
01:52:27,428 --> 01:52:28,048
Sure.

1171
01:52:46,008 --> 01:52:47,308
Hey, wait...

1172
01:53:48,778 --> 01:53:50,678
Bastard...

1173
01:53:53,358 --> 01:53:55,548
Bastard!

1174
01:53:57,678 --> 01:53:59,058
Passing this...

1175
01:54:01,618 --> 01:54:05,558
Passing this can't save your life!

1176
01:54:13,518 --> 01:54:14,848
Hibito.

1177
01:54:19,228 --> 01:54:21,668
You're not going to be a tragic story.

1178
01:54:25,578 --> 01:54:28,068
You're not allowed to die!

1179
01:54:43,088 --> 01:54:44,898
Hibito...

1180
01:54:45,348 --> 01:54:46,718
Hibito, hey...

1181
01:54:48,108 --> 01:54:50,898
Hibito, there's an UFO.

1182
01:54:51,768 --> 01:54:52,868
Where?

1183
01:54:53,848 --> 01:54:54,928
Where?

1184
01:54:57,188 --> 01:54:59,518
Just kidding.

1185
01:54:59,898 --> 01:55:05,178
What the heck, Mu-chan. I thought it finally appeared.

1186
01:55:07,188 --> 01:55:09,708
How'd you sleep, Hibito?

1187
01:55:09,708 --> 01:55:12,568
I was just resting my eyes.

1188
01:55:13,638 --> 01:55:16,598
Well then, let's play a game, yes?

1189
01:55:16,598 --> 01:55:17,648
Yeah!

1190
01:55:17,948 --> 01:55:21,898
Space quiz!

1191
01:55:21,898 --> 01:55:23,518
Yay!

1192
01:57:01,628 --> 01:57:03,768
Gorgeous!

1193
01:57:05,628 --> 01:57:07,348
Mu-chan...

1194
01:57:59,188 --> 01:58:00,438
If I don't try...

1195
01:58:04,088 --> 01:58:05,828
I'll die.

1196
01:58:39,008 --> 01:58:41,808
The next space question is as follows.

1197
01:58:41,808 --> 01:58:43,508
Yay!

1198
01:58:44,078 --> 01:58:48,178
What was the biggest space news in 1961?

1199
01:58:48,178 --> 01:58:49,768
Hmm...

1200
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:55,348
Gagarin makes it to space.

1201
01:58:55,348 --> 01:58:56,918
Correct!

1202
01:58:56,918 --> 01:58:59,708
What about 1969?

1203
01:58:59,708 --> 01:59:01,928
Hmm...

1204
01:59:04,068 --> 01:59:07,178
Apollo 11 landing on the Moon.

1205
01:59:07,178 --> 01:59:09,998
Hey Mu-chan, give me an easier one.

1206
01:59:09,998 --> 01:59:12,508
Then, what happened in 1993?

1207
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:14,838
No idea, how about a clue?

1208
01:59:14,838 --> 01:59:17,248
The Doha tragedy.

1209
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:20,368
That's when you were born, Mu-chan.

1210
01:59:20,678 --> 01:59:22,368
That's correct!

1211
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:25,978
That's the year when the future astronaut Mutta Namba was born.

1212
01:59:25,978 --> 01:59:28,768
Next one, what happened in 1996?

1213
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:32,978
Easy, that's the year when the future astronaut Hibito Namba was born!

1214
01:59:43,408 --> 01:59:46,158
We choose to go to the Moon.

1215
01:59:46,158 --> 01:59:47,868
We choose to go to the Moon!

1216
01:59:49,028 --> 01:59:55,488
That's one small step for man.
One giant leap for mankind.

1217
02:00:15,638 --> 02:00:20,728
America's first space shuttle.
The shuttle has cleared the tower.

1218
02:00:20,728 --> 02:00:24,818
What's it like to work out there,
maneuvering freely in space?

1219
02:00:24,818 --> 02:00:28,528
Well, we've had a great deal of training,
sir, so it feels quite comfortable.

1220
02:00:35,448 --> 02:00:37,328
Station, from Endeavour...

1221
02:00:38,108 --> 02:00:43,298
Yuri Gagarin.
John F. Kennedy.
Neil Armstrong.

1222
02:00:43,298 --> 02:00:49,468
Names forever synonymous
with man's greatest
achievements in
space exploration.

1223
02:00:49,468 --> 02:00:52,598
Could they have imagined this day?

1224
02:00:57,628 --> 02:01:04,648
The day in which two little boys from
Japan, inspired by those legendary men,

1225
02:01:04,648 --> 02:01:10,608
became the first brothers in
history to set foot on the Moon.

1226
02:01:11,018 --> 02:01:16,748
Hibito Namba, who miraculously returned to Earth from the Moon five years ago,

1227
02:01:16,748 --> 02:01:23,038
and his brother, Mutta Namba, who
finally earned his ticket into space today.

1228
02:01:23,038 --> 02:01:28,668
Have encouraged and inspired each
other to make their dreams come true.

1229
02:01:29,078 --> 02:01:32,558
We are now about to
witness these two brothers

1230
02:01:32,558 --> 02:01:38,678
pick up the banner from their
heroes and begin a new chapter
in the history of the space program.

1231
02:02:00,838 --> 02:02:02,138
Hibito.

1232
02:02:05,038 --> 02:02:05,888
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

1233
02:02:06,938 --> 02:02:07,918
No problem.

1234
02:02:08,868 --> 02:02:11,928
It's time for space!

1235
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:25,948
They're going to launch in 2 minutes!

1236
02:03:26,808 --> 02:03:31,208
5... 4... 3...

1237
02:03:31,208 --> 02:03:34,508
2... 1...

1238
02:04:06,998 --> 02:04:08,478
This is Houston.

1239
02:04:09,078 --> 02:04:11,528
How's it going, Space Brothers?

1240
02:04:20,828 --> 02:04:22,848
One, two, in!

1241
02:04:36,808 --> 02:04:39,068
Mu-chan, quick, look at that!
