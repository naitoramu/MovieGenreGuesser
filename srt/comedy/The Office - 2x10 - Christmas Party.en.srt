1
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:04,538
Go, in the door..

2
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:06,108
Push !

3
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:07,353
Push !

4
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,254
No no no! Turn it around.
Turn it around, you're breaking.

5
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:10,193
Shove it, breaking !

6
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:12,598
You shove it! Shove it back !

7
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:16,803
Here we go.

8
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,638
Don't break the branches, Dwight.

9
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,215
Ah, I got a splinter.

10
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:24,990
Well, suck it up, we all have problems.

11
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:26,576
Hey everybody.

12
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,570
Look what we have !

13
00:00:30,846 --> 00:00:32,096
Nice, huh ?

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,192
- I've got it leveraged. Push !
- One three.

15
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:37,063
- Straight up.
- Ready, one, two, three.

16
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,223
Merry Christmas !

17
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,202
Episode 210- Season 2
CHRISTMAS PARTY

Catch 22 team :

20
00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:21,260
Did it work ?

21
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:23,513
Well, sort of.

22
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,212
Why did you get it so big ?

23
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:28,422
'A', that's what she said.

24
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:29,863
And 'B',

25
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:31,190
I wanted it to be impressive.

26
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:33,561
he biggest day of the year deserves
the biggest tree of the year.

27
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:36,371
But what are we going to do
with this hacked off part ?

28
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:39,030
Well, that is a perfectly
good mini tree Kevin.

29
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:42,201
And we are going to
sell that to charity.

30
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:44,500
That's what Christmas is all about.

31
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:54,582
<i>So this year,
for the first time ever...</i>

32
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:56,702
I got Pam in Secret Santa.

33
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,580
And I got her this, teapot.

34
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:00,420
Which I know she really wants.

35
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:01,721
So she can make tea at her desk.

36
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:04,621
but I'm also gonna stuff
it with some inside jokes.

37
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:06,301
Like...

38
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:08,521
This is my high school yearbook photo.

39
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,653
She saw it at the party,
and it really makes her laugh.

40
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:13,373
I'm not sure why.

41
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:15,631
What else?

42
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:17,821
This is hot sauce packet.

43
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:21,120
She put this on a hot dog
a couple of years ago.

44
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:23,011
Because she thought it was ketchup

45
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,742
And, it was really funny.

46
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:27,801
So I kept the other two.

47
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:30,440
This would take a little
too long to explain.

48
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:31,643
So I won't.

49
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,572
And this is a card.

50
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:38,013
Because Christmas is the time
to tell people how you feel.

51
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:42,981
Is there anything we're missing ?

52
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:44,451
Phyllis, you got the lights ?

53
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:46,293
Yes, I got those cute little ones.

54
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:49,932
Do you think I should have
gotten the big ones ?

55
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,060
We'll see.

56
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:54,780
<i>Angela, drafted me into the
party planning committee.</i>

57
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:59,070
Her memo said that we need to
prepare for every possible disaster.

58
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:03,771
Which to me seems...excessive.

59
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:06,853
Merry Christmas !

60
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:08,971
Pimp !

61
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:10,950
I'm kidding.

62
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:13,193
What do we got ? What do we got ?
How many plates are we getting ?

63
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:13,840
Fifty.

64
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:14,971
Double it. Double everything.

65
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:17,132
Double ice cream.
Double napkins. Double it.

66
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:18,620
On me.

67
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:20,331
<i>It was a tough year</i>

68
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:21,603
<i>I had to fire somebody this year.</i>

69
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:23,703
This party has to really rock.

70
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:26,070
Check it out.

71
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,213
Christmas bonus.
Three-thousand G's.

72
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,382
I got this for helping save
the company money

73
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:34,303
So I guess some good came
out of firing Devin after all.

74
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,433
Maybe  I should call him, tell him that.

75
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,640
I want people to cut loose.

76
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:42,153
I want people...making out in closets.

77
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:47,670
I want, I want people hanging from
the ceilings, lampshades on the heads

78
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:50,490
I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party.

79
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,460
And also, I want you to know,

80
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,720
and spread the word, that
I will have my digital camera.

81
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,613
And I will be taking
pictures all along the way.

82
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:00,013
And the best and craziest
thing that happens,

83
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,003
will be on the cover of the newsletter.

84
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:02,772
Incentive.

85
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:05,102
You do realize that we can't
serve liquor at the party.

86
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:06,841
Yeah, I know. Dammit.

87
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:09,030
Stupid corporate wet blankets.

88
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:10,843
Like booze ever killed anybody.

89
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,690
One, two, three.

90
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:17,280
You guys should use a hand truck.

91
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:19,892
Do we have one ?

92
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:21,563
No.

93
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:26,491
Will you help me ?

94
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,800
No. No way.

95
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:29,853
It- no.

96
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,723
Come on, Mike. Let me borrow the hat.
For just a couple of hours.

97
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:33,200
- You wanna be Santa ?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:34,833
Have you ever seen Santa ?

99
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:37,020
Yeah, I've SEEN Santa. Who cares ?

100
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:39,271
Okay, well, I'm sorry.
It just doesn't work.

101
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,492
Michael !

102
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,573
I would like to be the elf.

103
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:45,941
That makes sense, because
he has elfish features.

104
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:49,443
Okay, everyone, listen up !

105
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,830
It is time, to get your presents.

106
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:55,183
Wrap them, and place them under the tree.

107
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:57,841
Like so.

108
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:00,601
If you do not get your present wrapped,

109
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,943
and under the tree within
the next five minutes,

110
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,932
you  will be disqualified
from Secret Santa.

111
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:08,283
All right ? No exceptions.

112
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:09,690
Except Michael.

113
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,410
I got Angela.

114
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:14,733
She's into these posters of babies...

115
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:17,520
dressed as adults.
I got her one of those.

116
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:21,622
I felt kind of weird buying that.

117
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:23,151
I got Creed.

118
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:25,220
And to tell you the truth,
I don't know anything about Creed.

119
00:05:25,518 --> 00:05:28,330
know his name's Creed.
I know he works right over there.

120
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,351
I think he's Irish and I...

121
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:34,060
I got him this, uh, shamrock keychain.

122
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:37,660
I got myself for Secret Santa.

123
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,391
I was suppose to tell
somebody, but I didn't.

124
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:45,933
You get something good this year

125
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:47,423
I think I did a pretty good job.

126
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,591
Who'd you have ? 

127
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:51,650
I can't tell you, 'cause it's a secret.

128
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,333
think I got something
pretty nice for my guy.

129
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,412
- Yeah ?
- Spent a lot of dough. A lot of dough.

130
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:56,451
Wow.

131
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:58,501
Well, there, there's
a $20 limit, right ? So.

132
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,500
Yeah, I wanted this party
to be really special.

133
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:02,123
So I sorta went above and beyond.

134
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,852
hat's great, well, don't
tell me who it is, 'cause...

135
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,870
It was Ryan ! Yep.

136
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,243
I  have Ryan.

137
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:09,840
Gather 'round.

138
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:12,681
Secret Santa, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

139
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,441
Stanley, no. I'm gonna handle the cord.

140
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:16,043
Kay ? Safety reasons.

141
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,741
I know how to plug something in.

142
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:18,891
I wanna do it.

143
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:20,350
All right !

144
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:23,586
Let's count it down.
Like Rockefeller Center.

145
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,480
Ready ?

146
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,446
Three.

147
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:27,631
Two.

148
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:28,712
One.

149
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,621
Yeah !

150
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:33,202
Not great.

151
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:34,922
Sorry, everybody.

152
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:37,760
I think the tree looks nice.

153
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:40,500
- I could get some flares from my car.
-  No, no

154
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:43,442
Shake it off, everybody.
Just, let's do Secret Santa.

155
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:47,021
Presents are the best way to show
someone how much you care.

156
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:51,042
It is like this tangible thing
that you can point to and say:

157
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:54,323
"Hey, man, I love you this
many dollars worth."

158
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:57,541
First present, Oscar.

159
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:02,150
A shower radio, neat.

160
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:03,661
Oh, great. That was from me.

161
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:05,592
hanks, Kelly. You know, I was
gonna get one of these.

162
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,633
Okay, that's enough.
Let's keep it moving on. Jim.

163
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:11,151
Ah, cool.

164
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,041
That's from me.

165
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:17,591
Great.

166
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:19,372
Where'd you get it ?

167
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,641
I don't know, it was so long ago.

168
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,030
He obviously forgot to get me something.

169
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:27,190
And then he went into his closet
and dug out this little number.

170
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,772
And then threw it in a bag.

171
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:30,952
Yep, that's exactly what happened.

172
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:32,022
Pam.

173
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:41,943
Oh, my God !

174
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:46,142
Thank you very much, Santa.
Whoever you are.

175
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:48,862
- It's awesome.
- There's a little more to it.

176
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:50,972
All right, next. Ryan.

177
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,323
Don't !

178
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:59,133
A video iPod.

179
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:04,773
omebody really got carried away
with the spirit of Christmas.

180
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,842
It was me. I got carried
away with the spirit.

181
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:09,961
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift?

182
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:12,832
This is 400 bucks.

183
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:15,753
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, you left the price tag on.

184
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:18,311
I did, what ? Oh, shoot. Wow,

185
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,402
Well, who cares?
It doesn't matter what I spent.

186
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:24,290
What matters is that
Christmas is fun, right ?

187
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:27,743
Michael.

188
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,532
For me ?

189
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:33,311
What is in here ?

190
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:37,682
- Come on.
-  I-I knitted it for you.

191
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:40,532
An oven mitt ?

192
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:42,280
Okay.

193
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:45,230
So Phyllis is basically saying :

194
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,571
"Hey Michael, I know you did
a lot to help the office this year."

195
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,903
"But I only care about you...
a homemade oven mitt's worth."

196
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:53,733
I gave Ryan an iPod.

197
00:08:56,776 --> 00:09:00,213
Should we just keep
opening up the presents ?

198
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:03,211
We don't do anything until Michael
gives us further instructions.

199
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,082
I got it !

200
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:14,510
We are going to turn Secret
Santa into Yankee Swap !

201
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,360
What is, Yankee Swap ?

202
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:18,560
One person chooses a gift.

203
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,352
The next person can
either choose a gift.

204
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:23,843
Or steal that person's gift.

205
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:27,622
If your gift gets stolen, then you
can steal someone else's gift

206
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:29,083
Or choose a new gift.

207
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:31,191
I thought that was
called nasty Christmas.

208
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,063
Yeah, we call it White Elephant.

209
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:34,562
Well, I call it fun !

210
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:35,822
Why are we doing this ?

211
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:37,863
Because it's better.
Because it's more special.

212
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,383
- I sounds mean.
- Shut...

213
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,162
No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.

214
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,992
Michael should have asked the
party planning committee first.

215
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:48,322
He's not supposed to just spring
things on us out of nowhere.

216
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,813
Okay, Meredith is up first.

217
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:59,620
Here's the deal.
You can either pick a new gift,

218
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:03,100
OR, you can steal somebody
else's gift they've already gotten.

219
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:04,921
Like the oven mitt.

220
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:06,250
I'll take the teapot.

221
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:08,282
Oh, shouldn't we...

222
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:10,631
I bought that specifically for Pam.

223
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:12,801
Yaaankee Swap.
That's what makes it fun.

224
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,931
- Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
- I'll take the iPod.

225
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,451
And I have to give it to her ?
I don't have a choice ?

226
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:20,720
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt,

227
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:23,892
the old shirt, the shower
radio or pick a new gift.

228
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:38,122
- That was meant for Kelly.
- Yeah, I figured.

229
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,691
I think this is going great.

230
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:59,340
- Yikes.
-  Well, it's for Angela, so...

231
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:04,782
That's like the creepiest
thing that I've ever seen.

232
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:06,932
Angela, you're up.

233
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,302
I'll take the poster.

234
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:16,042
Some  people like these.

235
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:18,581
I will steal the iPod.

236
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:22,081
Everyone wants the iPod.
It's a huge hit.

237
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,801
It is almost a Christmas miracle.

238
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:28,320
Ah, well, Oscar, you little gourmand.

239
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:29,822
You have the next turn.

240
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:33,372
I'll take the teapot.

241
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:34,501
Dammit.

242
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,121
Okay, moving along,
Meredith, let's go.

243
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:40,031
I really want the iPod.

244
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:42,410
It's already been stolen this round.
Pick something else.

245
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:45,972
I hope nobody takes this baby,
'cause this is great.

246
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:48,802
Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship.

247
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:52,542
Somebody really put a lot of
work into that. It's beautiful.

248
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:55,603
I'll take the oven mitt.

249
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:01,642
See, I wanted somebody to take it.
Boom.

250
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:02,953
Reverse psychology.

251
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,993
Reverse psychology is an awesome tool.

252
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:07,190
I don't know if you guys know about it.

253
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:12,790
But, basically you make someone think
the opposite of what you believe.

254
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:16,450
And that tricks them into
doing something stupid.

255
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,561
Works like a charm.

256
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:27,641
In addition to these paint
ball pellets your gift includes,

257
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:30,132
two paintball lessons
with Dwight Schrute.

258
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:32,491
You and me, Michael. Yes !

259
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,673
Who wants to take
paintball lessons ?

260
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,733
How is that better than an iPod ?

261
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:43,331
I never said it was better than an iPod.

262
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,080
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod.
But, you know what ?

263
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,540
Two paintball lessons with
someone as experienced

264
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:54,310
as I am is worth easily like two grand.

265
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:56,691
Take that Saddam.

266
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:58,521
Last gift, Kevin.

267
00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:00,820
I want the footbath.

268
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:05,301
That's the thing I bought myself.

269
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:08,512
I'm really psyched to use it.

270
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:13,071
Maybe I should have taken the iPod.

271
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:16,912
Shoot.

272
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:19,520
Pam, steal something
or pick the final gift.

273
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:21,690
I want the iPod.

274
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:24,480
- Dammit.
- Sure you don't want the teapot ?

275
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,932
I mean, it's an iPod.

276
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,023
- Right.
- Sorry.

277
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:29,851
No, no, definitely.

278
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:34,492
Okay, well, I guess I will take,
that book of short stories.

279
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,173
Yes! There you go.
I want the teapot.

280
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,210
Gracias.

281
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:41,731
You gotta be kidding me. 

282
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:46,161
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets..

283
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,033
Christmas.

284
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,030
What is she so upset about ?

285
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,892
Maybe because you hated
her present so much.

286
00:13:54,986 --> 00:13:57,133
I think Yankee Swap was a big hit.

287
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:58,843
I think it was a success.

288
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:01,260
And I'm the one who ended up with
Dwight's stupid paint ball pellets.

289
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:04,792
Yeah, but Michael, the point is that
we all bought gifts for specific people.

290
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,712
And  you should have just bought
a $20 gift like everyone else.

291
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:11,292
Well, I didn't! I got a big bonus
because I fired Devin,

292
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:14,212
And I used the money to buy
something awesome. Sue me !

293
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:18,101
You got a bonus check ?

294
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,603
How much ?

295
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:24,323
It wasn't...It wasn't that much.
It was 3,000.

296
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,891
All right, I'm done now.

297
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:33,863
Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that
anyone's ever done for these people.

298
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:34,791
And they freak out.

299
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,493
Well, happy birthday, Jesus.
Sorry your party's so lame.

300
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:43,751
That comes to 166.41.

301
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:45,323
All right, now you're the expert.

302
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,212
Is this enough to get
20 people plastered ?

303
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:51,561
Fifteen bottles of vodka?

304
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:55,600
-Yeah, that should do it.
- Cool, cool. Box it up.

305
00:14:57,456 --> 00:15:02,112
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas</i>
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas</i>

306
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:05,593
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year</i>

307
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,663
I bought this teapot for Pam,
and I know she really wants it.

308
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:10,582
- So can I trade you for it ?
- No trades.

309
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:13,471
Come on. It's a shamrock keychain.
Good luck.

310
00:15:13,888 --> 00:15:15,772
A real man makes his own luck.

311
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:17,501
Billy Zane, "Titanic".

312
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,273
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight.

313
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:22,870
Can I buy it from you ?
- No, I want it. I'm going to use it.

314
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:24,580
- You don't even drink tea.
- True.

315
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:26,161
But I get sinus infections.

316
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:29,983
And sinus infections can be cured by
making a tea, from green tea leaf stems.

317
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:34,112
And pouring it directly
into your nose like so.

318
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:39,752
To think that my gift to
Pam will be used for that...

319
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,781
It's a little too much to handle.

320
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:44,573
- This is awesome.
- I know,

321
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,810
It's totally going to change
the way I workout.

322
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,292
Yeah, and I was going to get
you one of these for Christmas.

323
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,573
Now I don't have to.
I'm gonna save a ton of money.

324
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:52,862
So what are you going
to get me instead ?

325
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:56,371
I don't know.
Probably like a sweater or something.

326
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:03,180
Looks like Santa was a little naughty.

327
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:06,120
What is that ?

328
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:10,151
This is Christmas spirit.
As in spirits. Booze.

329
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,012
We can drink ?

330
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,051
We're really not supposed
to serve alcohol.

331
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:17,333
Zip it! Toby.
Just, I mean, it's a party, come on.

332
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:21,130
If I can't throw a good party for
my employees, then I am a terrible boss.

333
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,633
- Who wants a drink ?
- Me, please.

334
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:26,911
Here we go !

335
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,563
The deal is that this is my last hurrah.

336
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:33,513
Cause I made a New Year's resolution
that I'm not going to drink anymore.

337
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:35,541
During the week.

338
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:37,353
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

339
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:40,153
Does everyone know
my boyfriend, Bob Vance ?

340
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:43,392
- Kevin Malone.
- Bob Vance, Vance refrigeration.

341
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:46,190
- Stanley Hudson.
- Bob Vance, Vance refrigeration.

342
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:49,152
- Ryan Howard.
- Bob Vance, Vance refrigeration.

343
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,593
What line of work you in, Bob ?

344
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:56,151
I got, I lost Culpepper
at TO, it was over, man.

345
00:16:56,638 --> 00:17:01,032
Oh yeah, I need McNabb and Deon Branch
to have big games or else I'm done.

346
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:04,303
It's possible. I can't believe you
traded Sean Alexander, man.

347
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,952
- I had to I need a defense.
- Come on! Sean Alexander ?

348
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,240
- He's the best back in the league !
- Defense.

349
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:12,062
- <i>Oh, no, it's-that's not worth it.
- It is worth it.</i>

350
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,080
- <i>Never.
- Are you kidding ? You wait.</i>

351
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:18,622
Anybody making out in here ?
Not yet, give it time

352
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:20,891
Oh hey, Ebenezer. Boink.

353
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:23,170
Okay, how's it going in here ?

354
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,343
We're running low on cups.
Do you want me to just run out and

355
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:26,462
- Yeah, there should be some
- No, no, no.

356
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,212
We'll find some, don't leave the party.

357
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:30,500
One, two, three !

358
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:37,971
Kudos to Ryan, king 
of the party committee !

359
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,841
Oh, no, I REALLY did not do anything.

360
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:43,173
No false modesty, my friend.

361
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:49,541
You know, you don't have
to answer calls during a party.

362
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,912
- Just thought you should know.
- No.

363
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:54,402
I was just, checking out my present.

364
00:17:58,138 --> 00:17:59,732
I traded with Dwight.

365
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:04,652
I figured, you know, you went to a lot
of trouble and that means a lot.

366
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:09,780
And  also Roy got me an iPod or,

367
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,362
was going to get me an iPod, so...

368
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:19,282
Well, either way. This is an amazing
gift because it comes with bonus gifts.

369
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:22,293
Look inside.

370
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,192
Oh my God !

371
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:31,411
The yearbook picture !

372
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:34,100
Yeah, I think I made the right choice.

373
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:36,612
Oh, my God.

374
00:18:36,636 --> 00:18:38,590
This is incredible.

375
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,782
Is this the Boggle timer ?

376
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:42,700
I didn't think you were going
to get that one. I really didn't know.

377
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:46,082
This is so awesome.

378
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:49,220
Not bad- and if it couldn't go to Ryan,
you are the guy I'd want it to go to.

379
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:50,963
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

380
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:52,443
Merry Christmas asswipe.

381
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:55,541
No way! Oh, you're kidding me.
Packer !

382
00:18:57,245 --> 00:19:00,383
Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen !

383
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:02,563
What's up, my nerds ?

384
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:04,523
- Check it out.
- Oh no, no.

385
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:05,883
Oh, look at that !

386
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:07,790
Icing on the cake !

387
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,131
Pac man need a drinky.

388
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,500
Let's fix you up.
Who wants to fix up- Toby?

389
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,143
Toby's gonna fix you up.

390
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,910
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

391
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:21,633
Darryl !

392
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,730
Here you go. You earned it.

393
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:25,381
- That's okay Mike.
- No no no no no

394
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,523
I really want you to have it.

395
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:29,673
All right, thanks, man.

396
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:32,041
Hey, Merry Christmas.

397
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:35,542
Whose butt is that ?

398
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:36,781
Mine.

399
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:39,151
How did I not guess that ?

400
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:41,041
Lampshade on the head !

401
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:43,662
It's happening !

402
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:45,453
Ho, no !

403
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,081
Hey.

404
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:57,273
Hello there.

405
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:01,403
- What are you doing ?
- I don't know.

406
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:05,122
You shouldn't do things like that.
The man is supposed to do that.

407
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,333
Thanks for the party Michael.

408
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:22,562
Listen up, we're going
to Poor Richard's.

409
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:24,103
- Who's in?
- I'm in.

410
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:25,730
- Yes !
- Michael ?

411
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,551
Poor Richard's ?

412
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,250
Yeah, that sounds good.

413
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:32,543
Christmas is awesome.

414
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,132
First of all...

415
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:36,431
You get to spend time
with people you love.

416
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:37,712
Secondly...

417
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:40,023
You can get drunk and
no one can say anything.

418
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:43,790
Third, you give presents.
What's better than giving presents?

419
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:45,880
And fourth, getting presents.

420
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:48,122
So four things.
Not bad for one day.

421
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:51,170
It's really the greatest day of all time.

422
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:56,532
Hey Meredith, heading
over to Poor Richard's ?

423
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:57,502
Yep.

424
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:59,002
Cool, cool, cool.

425
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:01,280
You need a ride ?

426
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,620
All right, let's head out.

427
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:15,670
Sounds good, do you have a coat ?

428
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:18,241
- Yeah.
- Oooh-kay.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
