1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,644
The Stamford branch is closing.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,961
And everybody's just packing off their stuff.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,406
And, Bernard, made this staple hats.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,850
<i>That's the other thing you have to watch out.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,863
Yo, tuna. I want to talk to you 
about the new boss, Michael Scott.

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,300
So, what's he like?

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,917
Likes, dislikes, favorites sports, 
favorite movies, favorite man's magazine

8
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:29,813
You know what? 
I think you just need to meet him.

9
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:32,045
Playing your cards close to the vest? I get it.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,000
Good luck over there, tuna.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,262
Cross me, and I will destroy you.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,379
Sounds good, Andy.

13
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:42,700
It's gonna be an adventure.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,674
Yeah. This is going to be very interesting.

15
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:48,591
Alright. I'm outta here. See you later.

16
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:57,192
- Hey, is that Josh's computer?
- What?

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,610
Hey

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,057
How did the run go?

19
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:07,100
Pretty good. I finished.

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,633
That's great.

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,493
Why is that great?

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,262
Because he accomplished something.

23
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:13,782
What was your mile time?

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,108
About seven.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,760
I can beat that on a skateboard.

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,120
Well, that has wheels.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,824
And, well, my feet don't 
and I could still crush that time.

28
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:23,766
Really, Dwight? How fast are you?

29
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:25,139
Let's just put it this way.

30
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:28,265
Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.

31
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:29,089
Really?

32
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,700
I'm fast. To give you a reference point,

33
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,987
I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,849
And a panther.

35
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:39,000
Damn, what is taking Toby so long?

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,459
Oh, I'll just time him later.

37
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:42,633
And, you compare the times.

38
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:45,542
- Yeah. Are you ready? 
- No, my glutes are really tight.

39
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:47,232
- Set, go! 
- I- I can't!

40
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,727
Am I being mean to Dwight?

41
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:57,254
I don't know. 
I did just make him run around the building

42
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:59,628
and I have no intention of timing him.

43
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:00,970
This isn't even a stopwatch.

44
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,739
It's a digital thermometer.

45
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,553
He does make my life harder sometimes, 
and on purpose.

46
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:09,400
Like he tried to put meters 
on the bathroom stalls

47
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,667
as a way of bringing in more money 
for the company.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,103
Hey. Three more laps to go.

49
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,091
You've gotta pick it up 
if you're gonna beat Toby.

50
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:22,589
I should probably get back to work.

51
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:53,928

Here... who's here?

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,100
- Name tag? 
- Yes, please

55
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,801
Karen Filippelli

56
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,562
Karen Filip... Karen Filippelli

57
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:07,209
She's probably an Italian.

58
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,189
Possibly, Filipino

59
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:12,600
My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch.

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,790
Or, as I like to put it, 
my family is doubling in size.

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,202
That's all I'm going to say about it

62
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:22,100
because I have a gigantic 
performance ahead of me

63
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,629
and I have to get into my head and focus.

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,400
Here's next. That's Andy Bernard

65
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,055
Andy Bernard.

66
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:33,000
- If I were you... 
- Saint Bernard.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,900
- I would fire Anthony Gardner. 
- What?

68
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,984
- Before noon.
- I'm not...

69
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:37,979
The consolidate power.

70
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:39,555
I'm not gonna firing somebody in the first day.

71
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:41,435
No, no, no, no. 
Not somebody. Gardner.

72
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:43,585
The Japanese camp guards of World War Two

73
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:47,500
always chose one man to kill 
whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived.

74
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:52,061
I always wondered how they chose the man 
who was to die.

75
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,082
I think I would have been good at 
choosing the person.

76
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,400
Good morning.

77
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,900
Got the food, good.

78
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,244
Looky, looky, looky. 
What I want you to do,

79
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:06,257
Set it up in conference room, please. 
Make it look nice.

80
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:07,757
As if you are trying to impress much older man

81
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:09,000
who's way out of your league.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,755
Okay.

83
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,297
Yes, I'm in a good mute today.

84
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:17,455
I'm exited to meet all of the new people.

85
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,393
and to see my old friend again, definitely.

86
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:23,017
That's always a thing to make people happy.

87
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:24,524
To have an old friend back.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,100
Hello.

89
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,344
Ah, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, 
our first arrival.

90
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:33,787
Welcome to Scranton. 
This is Hannah Smotrich-Barr

91
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:35,127
Hannah Smotrich-Barr

92
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:37,823
Welcome to our home boulevard.

93
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,848
Follow me to your desk.

94
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,397
Your ball and chain is right over here.

95
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:47,455
You know, a lot of these people, 
this is the only family they have,

96
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:52,162
so, as far as I am concerned...
this says ¡°World's Best Dad.¡±

97
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,966
Ah, there he is.

98
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:58,027
- Tony. What's your last name?
- Gardner

99
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:00,937
Gardner. I knew that. There you go.

100
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:03,632
Gift bag... for you. Okay.

101
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:04,140
Thanks.

102
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,959
Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.

103
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,507
Well, they're just for guest.

104
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,005
If there's any left over, you can buy one later.

105
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,796
My bag is mostly pencils.

106
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:14,458
And, coupons to various hot spots around Scranton.

107
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,565
Alright, let me show you to your area, sir.

108
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:18,933
<i>Come on, big guy.

109
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,600
Can I have your pencils?

110
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,109
<i>No.

111
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:24,536
- Hi, I'm Pam. 
- Karen.

112
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:25,573
I love your sweater.

113
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:28,027
Oh, thanks. My mom made it for me.

114
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,400
Really, that's so cool.
I've always wanted to learn that knit.

115
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,918
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

116
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,037
Take-me-to-your-leader.

117
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:39,211
Oh-wait,-I-am-your-leader.

118
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,283
Uh, wait, are you a robot or a Martian?

119
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm actually your boss, Michael Schott.

120
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,351
Welcome. Wow, you are very exotic looking.

121
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,958
Was your dad a G.I. or...?

122
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,000
<i>I'll be the number two guy here 
in Scranton in six weeks.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,761
How? Name repitition, personality mirroring,

124
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:12,805
and never breaking off handshakes.

125
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,630
I'm always thinking one step ahead.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,459
Like a... carpenter that make stairs.

127
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,281
Hello.

128
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:28,437
Ah, you must be Andy Bernard. 
Aloha and welcome!

129
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:33,456
And you must be Michael Scott. 
Aloha and... hello.

130
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:38,450
Ah ha! Very good!
Welcome to our little kingdom.

131
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,570
We have a bag of nifty gifties for you.

132
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:47,227
Michael, thank you for welcoming me to 
your little kingdom... Mike.

133
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:49,694
Nifty!

134
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:53,103
They are nifty! 
They're nifty gifties.

135
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,533
<i>You know who I really like?

136
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:56,009
Is this guy Andy Bernard?

137
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,027
He's got this very likable way about him.

138
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,609
which is why they just needed to investigate.

139
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:07,563
Right.

140
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:09,300
No way. Get him out of here.

141
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
We don't wanna use this kind of hair.

142
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,477
Good to see you, man.

143
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:15,112
How are you, Martin Nash, I presume?

144
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,913
This is a little gift bag for you, free of charge.

145
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:21,258
Follow me, I will show you 
where all the slaves work. Not...

146
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:24,078
<i>So, your desk is...

147
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:27,326
- Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here. 
- Oh my god! It's really you!

148
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,700
I was just doing a little joke there about 
how we had never met...

149
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,985
I know, I don't care!

150
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:34,928
Awesome! Good to be back.

151
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,530
The place looks really good.

152
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,796
It's really good to see you.

153
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:38,820
You too.

154
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,574
Where do I stand with Pam?

155
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,337
Um... no idea.

156
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:45,698
I mean, we're friends.

157
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,000
Always have been friends.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,969
That is where we stand.

159
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,800
Well, well, well. 
Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.

160
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,632
Hey, Dwight!

161
00:07:56,632 --> 00:08:00,557
Fact. I am older. I am wiser.

162
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:01,800
Do not mess with me.

163
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,308
Okay. Sounds good.

164
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:05,513
What are you doing?

165
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:06,516
I don't know what you're talking about.

166
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:07,465
Do I have a smudge on my forehead?

167
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:08,749
No, you're good.

168
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:10,949
Why are you looking at my forehead?

169
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:11,632
I'm not.

170
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:14,379
Meet my eye line, Jim!

171
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:15,376
I am.

172
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:17,362
Stop acting like an idiot!

173
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:17,999
Okay.

174
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,696
<i>Hey, everybody.

175
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,304
- Welcome back
- Hey

176
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:24,004
- How are you man. It's good to see you. 
- I'm good. How are you?

177
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:28,609
So...

178
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:31,535
Oh, I'm sorry, 
you sitting here now?

179
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:32,814
Yeah.

180
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:34,235
Oh.

181
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,967
Um... Then I must be 
really really wanna pack.

182
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,114
You know, that's really your call.

183
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:44,270
...call. Thank you.

184
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,260
Get that for you.

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,839
Got it.

186
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,545
This one taken? No? Good.

187
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,577
Yeah, Jim is a nice guy.

188
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,203
That's why I got the desk.

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,922
Hey, this came with the Stamford people.

190
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:10,401
Can you take care of it?

191
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,420
Oh, yes I can.

192
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:17,500
In general, they do not give me 
much responsibility.

193
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,193
But, they do let me shred 
the company documents.

194
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,942
And that is really all I need.

195
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:33,228
Michael Scott. Thank you. 
I appreciate it, Mike.

196
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:37,623
Hello, I don't believe we've been introduced.

197
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:39,859
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.

198
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:42,959
Andy Bernard, 
Regional Director in charge of sales.

199
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,500
So, you'll be reporting to me, then.

200
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,777
On the contrary...

201
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:46,984
My title has ¡°manager¡± in it.

202
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:49,400
And, I'm a director,

203
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,856
which on a film set is 
the highest title there is.

204
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:54,100
Do you know anything about film?

205
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,000
I know everything about film.

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,517
I've seen over 240 of them.

207
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,598
Congratulations.

208
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:09,588
- Hey, Toby. 
- Hey, Jim

209
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:10,606
How are you, man.

210
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:13,016
Oh, really good. Thank you. 
Hey, Welcome back.

211
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,027
Oh, is that like a new thing, or...?

212
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,540
No,  I'm sorry, it's...

213
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,250
No, it's cool.

214
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,019
No, it's nothing. just...

215
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,297
- Alright, good to have you back. Alright.
- Okay

216
00:10:27,738 --> 00:10:29,285
- Alright, Sorry, sorry about that. 
- <i>No problem.

217
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:30,021
- Just...

218
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:31,600
<i>What?

219
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,555
Nothing.

220
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,097
This thing is so awesome.

221
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,844
It will shred anything.

222
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,689
It will shred a CD.

223
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,975
It will shred...

224
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:51,843
a credit card.

225
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,116
It will shred... oh.

226
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,421
Shut.

227
00:10:58,421 --> 00:11:00,722
I present the orientation video.

228
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:02,869
- We need to talk 
- Not now

229
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,123
Which is higher?

230
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:07,056
Assistant Regional Manager 
or Regional Director in charge of sales?

231
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:09,950
I told you the titles are not relevant.
They just relate to pay scale.

232
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,516
Okay. So, who gets paid more? 
Me or Andy?

233
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,457
It is not matter of more or less.

234
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:16,229
Your pay is just different. Okay?

235
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,824
Alright. Show time part one.

236
00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:20,000
Okay, who reports to who?

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,536
I don't care!

238
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:24,500
Dwight, you all report to me. 
That's all that matters.

239
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,491
The rest of is just work it out amongst yourselves, okay?

240
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,500
- And, then if I want... 
- Work it out amongst yourselves!

241
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,355
I have company to run. 
Will you let me run the company?

242
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:33,300
- Will you? 
- One...

243
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,415
Please.

244
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,925
- Jiiiiiiim! 
- Kelly!

245
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:43,550
Oh my god! 
I have so much to tell you!

246
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,900
Really?

247
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,580
Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? 
They had a baby, they named it Suri.

248
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,600
And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie?

249
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,536
They had a baby too and they named it Shiloh,

250
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:55,081
and both babies are amazing!

251
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,580
Great. What's new with you?

252
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,728
I just told you.

253
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,340
Okay, everybody settled in?

254
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,516
Good. Why don't we all precede 
into the conference room?

255
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:11,378
Or, should I say the banquet hall.

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,608
For drum roll plays...

257
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:20,944
The official merger day.

258
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:23,285
All family welcome breakfast. 
Come on in.

259
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:24,499
Don't be shy.

260
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:29,748
- Hey, champagne 
- No, no, guest only.

261
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:33,200
- Smoked salmon. 
- No.

262
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,100
For you, consider it cow meat. 
Strictly taboo.

263
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,054
I eat beef.

264
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:41,297
Well, then consider it poisoned beef. 
It's no touch.

265
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,050
- The- the- the beef is poisoned? 
- No, it's not... beef...

266
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,314
Just... sit down, please.

267
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:46,869
Welcome. Help yourself.

268
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:50,258
Um, you might want these orientation materials.

269
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:54,269
Wrong, Toby. This is an orientation, 
not a bore-ientation.

270
00:12:55,521 --> 00:13:00,781
Okay. Do not worry, 
all of your questions are about to be answered.

271
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,200
Cell phones and pagers off, please.

272
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,600
Oh, this looks promising.

273
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,955
You won't be disappointed.

274
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:08,592
Let's face it. 
Moving to a new job can be very stressful.

275
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:14,100
So I have made an orientation video, 
especially for you new comers.

276
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,038
But, it's not like any orientation video

277
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:20,289
that any of you've have ever seen,

278
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:22,161
it's funny.

279
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:25,472
It's got a little bit of zing to it.

280
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,332
And I hope that it gives you a flavor

281
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:31,430
of what we are all about here at Dunder-Mifflin.

282
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,555
And, what we are all about here in Scranton.

283
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:36,419
So, let's just all laugh together

284
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,598
and watch ¡°Lazy Scranton.¡±

285
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:42,431
<font color=yellowgreen>¢Ý Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, ¢Ý

286
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:44,763
<font color=yellowgreen>¢Ý Call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'¢Ý

289
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:51,929
<font color=yellowgreen>¢Ý They call it Scranton / What? ¢Ý

290
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:53,198

294
00:13:58,513 --> 00:14:01,433

295
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:05,722
It reminds me of the orientation video 
Michael showed on my first day.

296
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,805
The Scranton Which Project.

297
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:09,966
<font color=lightblue>I'm so scared!

298
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:13,194
<font color=lightblue>When people don't label their personal food.

304
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:30,179
Well, so far, I think it is killing!

305
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,596
I thought it would be an A or A+

306
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:36,875
But I completely forgot there was an A++

307
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:41,100
This is Karen Filippelli, 
please leave a message.

308
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,178
Terrible. Totally uncommented!

309
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,057
This is Karen Filippelli, 
please leave a message.

310
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,851
Not bad. But you are Italian, so...

311
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,847
Try more Italian.

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,768
Italian?

313
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,735
Alright

314
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:11,055
Karen Filippelli...

315
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,106
Hey buddy. Anything new to report?

316
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,100
You mean, to me, from you?

317
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,043
Cause that's how it works.

318
00:15:26,431 --> 00:15:27,763
Sure thing, buddy.

319
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:36,142
<i>Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes.

<i>Because the angrier that he gets, 
the more marginalize he becomes!

321
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:42,555
Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there.

322
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:45,247
Layng on the charm

323
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,011
Hey, Angela. Check this out.

324
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,770
It's my new screen saver.

325
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:55,200
Do you like it?

326
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,715
I do like it, actually.

327
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:57,403
Thank you.

328
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,930
You have such a pretty smile by the way.

329
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:05,730
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome.

330
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,106
Hey.

331
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,061
What happened to grape soda?

332
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:14,628
Oh, yeah, I'm trying to move away from that.

333
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:16,900
Getting into more of a bottled water phase.

334
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,036
Oh, you've changed so much.

335
00:16:19,036 --> 00:16:20,827
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.

336
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,516
So, when do I get to hear everything?

337
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,500
Are you still getting unpacked, or...?

338
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,646
You wanna grap a coffee 
or something after work?

339
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:30,400
Oh, um... it's night. 
Actually, no.

340
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,889
I'm... I'm... just still getting settled.

341
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,962
- Oh, yeah. I know. whatever. 
- Okay.

342
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,426
Sorry to interrupt. I...

343
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:39,923
No, you are not interrupting anything.

344
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:44,200
- No, I'm... Don't... 
- Alright.

345
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,476
- Okay 
- Alright

346
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,623
I should probably get back to work.

347
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:52,327
- Crack the whip.  
- Yeah, I know. me too.

<i>The day's going fine.

349
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,238
It's been a little chaotic, 
but it's fine.

350
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,368
It's great.

351
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:06,832
A lot of distractions, but... it's good.

352
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:15,017
Take a picture. It'll last longer.

353
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:18,049
I'm sorry... it's just... 
it's a little distracting.

354
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:19,865
Ditto that, my brother.

355
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:39,782
Look what's on his computer!

356
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:42,322
What is that? It's squid's eye or...

357
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:46,320
It's my left breast.

358
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,186
- How did you... 
- Right place at the right time.

359
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,494
What's this smell?

360
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,903
What smell?

361
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,234
Must a Febrize air freshner is pluged in somewhere.

362
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:01,966
It smells like a funeral home.

363
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,717
Oh, I'll help you find it.

364
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,200
Oh, you know. Never- Nevermind.

365
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,000
What is it?

366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,833
I- I think I'm just allergic to your perfume.

367
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,469
My perfume?

368
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,457
It's just my crazy nose.

369
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,727
I... um, I'm used to different smells.

370
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:24,632
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me 
in metropolitan Orlando.

371
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:26,535
It's made from real pine.

372
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,442
Who's Bob Vance?

373
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,518
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.

<i>I don't know who this new people think they are.

375

376
00:18:41,002 --> 00:18:42,097
Never said a word.

377
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:44,542
People hate people that are different from them.

378
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:45,768
That's natural.

379
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,432
<i>But, you know what makes people 
to forget their differences?

380
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:49,277

384
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:04,101
I know what a lot of you must be thinking.

385
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,598
Wow. What a day!

386
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:08,732
Feel's more like at night at a party than a day of work.

387
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:15,369
Well, in my opinion, 
business should feel like a night out.

388
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:18,185
A night at...

389
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:23,306
the Roxbury.

390
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,094
Okay. It's supposed to be music, and...

391
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:29,957
I got it, I got it! Dwight! Just...

392
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:30,755

00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,319
Why are the new people on the table?

411
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,680
To show them that we are not about them.

412
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:28,700
Shouldn't we be equals?

413
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,900
Not today.

414
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,881
No.

415
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:36,643
Tony, please join your cohorts on the table, 
if you would.

416
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,800
Ah, this is difficult, for me.

417
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,600
I- I understand. We are all friends.

418
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:46,285
No, I mean I can't, physically. 
I can't get on the table.

419
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:53,863
Oh, well. Just use the momentum 
of your lower half to hoist yourself up.

420
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:03,250
You know what? 
I'll help. I will help.

421
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,097
No, please don't.

422
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:05,845
Don't be shy.

423
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:06,900
Dwight, let's do this.

424
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,229
- Come on, we are doing this thing. Let's get up!
- Ready? On three.

425
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:10,903
- One, two... 
- Bend at the knees

426
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,764
Okay here we go. Here we go.

I don't know what I'm grabbing here.

429
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,600
But it really feels good.

430
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,105
- Push it, push it. 
- No!

431
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:22,200

- No, put me down, now!

Put me down, now!

- You got it, you got it!
- I had enough!

434
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,300
Put me down right now!

435
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,945
- Well, hey, easy. 
- Easy

436
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:32,050
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,448
Don't...

438
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:36,257
It's just not going to work for me.

439
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,463
I have to go.

440
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,500
I don't understand.

441
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,100
I was on offence about this,

442
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,130
And, it's just not a good fit.

443
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,750
Well, we will squeeze you, man.

444
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,453
I can't work here.

445
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:48,856
I have to quit.

446
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:53,940
You can't quit on the first day!

447
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,464
That's heresy, my friend!

448
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,723
Okay, let's talk about this. 
What happened?

449
00:21:58,723 --> 00:21:59,949
I mean, Dwight...

450
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,400
Was it Toby? Did he say something?

451
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,725
Because he's...

452
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:09,218
No, Toby was helpful, 
he was very kind.

453
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,409
It's just your management style.

454
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,548
My management style?

455
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:21,019
Didn't you think Lazy Scranton was funny?

456
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:24,502
No. Was that supposed to be funny?

457
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:26,223
Okay, well.

458
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,368
Don't bother quitting. Because you're fired.

459
00:22:30,368 --> 00:22:33,042
Excuse me? You are fired!

460
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team.

461
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,300
Just clean out your desk.

462
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,413
There's nothing in my desk except the coupons.

463
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:41,700
Don't try to apologize to me, man.

464
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,486
It's too late! Just get out.

465
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,294
That your bad vibes with you.

466
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
It was my advice.

467
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,550
Remember I'm the one suggested 
that you fire him!

468
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,000
Probably, the best advice 
that you ever gave me, Dwight.

469
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,806
And, what advice has Andy given to you today 
that you have act done?

470
00:22:57,806 --> 00:23:03,303
Would none be accurate estimate? 
None advice?

471
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:07,523
Fire Andy. Fire Andy.

472
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:10,900
Dwight may have won the battle.

473
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,356
But I will win... the next battle.

474
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:18,180
Tony was right. 
This environment is dysfunctional.

475
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,833
Maybe that's because some people treated like 
their own private Hooter's strip club.

476
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,676
Woo... Angela, hold on.

477
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:26,397
Hooter's is a restaurant.

478
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:28,267
With over 400 locations worldwide.

479
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:30,115
But, after work, we don't have to get along.

480
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:31,455
We just have to work together, you know.

481
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:33,135
No, we do have to get along.

482
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:36,445
Can't we all just get along?

483
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,262
Or have we forgotten the words of Reverend King?

484
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:43,398
<i>The word ¡°merger¡± comes from the word ¡°marriage.¡±

485
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:45,545
And that was what today was supposed to be.

486
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:48,700
The loving union between people.

487
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,146
Instead, it has become like 
when my mom moved in with Jeff.

488
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,642
And once again, 
it becomes my job to fix it.

489
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:00,686
Hey, hey everybody!

490
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:01,965
Something happen.

491
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,341
<i>Those guys of Vance Refrigeration.

492
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:06,400
- They let the air out of our tires. 
- What?

493
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,247
Yeah, they punk us! 
They punk us goods!

494
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,467
Come on! Come on!

495
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:15,269
Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?

496
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:16,739
Does he ever.

497
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,684
Man, he got us so bad.

498
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:26,710
We cannot let him get away of this.

499
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,316
We have got to pull together as one

500
00:24:29,316 --> 00:24:31,002
and steal their refrigerators!

501
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,658
- Yeah! 
- Yeah?

502
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:34,200
I don't- I don't think we can do that.

503
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,800
Go home, Toby. Just...

504
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,738
Hey, what doesn't your car have flat tires?

505
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:40,674
Why? I will tell you why.

506
00:24:40,674 --> 00:24:43,268
Because they saved the worse for me.

507
00:24:43,268 --> 00:24:46,153
They put ¡°I-hate¡± note under my windshield wipers.

508
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,104
Check this out. It's so hateful.

509
00:24:48,104 --> 00:24:50,100
¡°You guys suck!"

510
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,633
"You can never pull together as one and revenge us."

511
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:54,388
"That is why you suck!¡±

512
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,962
Crying out, wow!

513
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:58,057
No, no, no, no, no. No!

514
00:24:58,057 --> 00:24:59,500
You are following forward.

515
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,888
you are playing right on their hands!

516
00:25:00,888 --> 00:25:02,156
Cause' this is just what they want you to do!

517
00:25:02,156 --> 00:25:03,339
What's wrong with this guy?

518
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:05,952
God, now I'm trying to explain.

519
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:11,744
This is egregious!

520
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:15,649
This is egregious!

521
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,750
Trust me, it only gets worse.

522
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,772
Is he always like this?

523
00:25:19,772 --> 00:25:21,768
Sometimes he brings more costumes.

524
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,937
When do people work?

525
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:26,542
Oh, we find little times during the day.

526
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,210
How are we gonna get home?

527
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,000
Bob Vance has an air pump.

528
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,920
He said he'd fill all our tires up.

529
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,179
Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration?

530
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:39,294
See that. Mission accomplished!

531
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:40,936
they're like a bunch of fourth graders.

532
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:46,143
Sometimes what brings the kids together is 
hating the lunch lady.

533
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:48,006
Although that'll change.

534
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,600
Because, by the end of the fourth grade,

535
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,318
the lunch lady was actually the person 
I hung out with the most.

536
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,611
Jello! 
<font color=lightblue>Michael

537
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:02,011
Hi Jan.

538
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:04,338
<font color=lightblue>You fired Tony Gardner of 
when he was trying to request.

539
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:07,818
I did. Major personal crisis averted.

540
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:09,200
Complement accepted.

541
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,600
<font color=lightblue>You realize Michael that 
now we have to pay him exuberance?

542
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,401
Yes

543
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:16,353
<font color=lightblue>You do

544
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:19,692
But, do you realize 
that was actually Dwight's idea?

545
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:21,453
That is advice from my number two.

546
00:26:21,453 --> 00:26:25,413
<font color=lightblue>What, no, no, no. 
No. Jim is your number two.

547
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:26,209
What?

548
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,481
<font color=lightblue>He's the only one 
who has worked for both group.

549
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:30,531
<font color=lightblue>So, I sent you a memo about this.

550
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,171
Yes, I know that,

551
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:35,434
or I do read the memos.

552
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,034
So, after a great deal of thought 
and introspective-shun,

553
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:44,223
I have decided to make Jim 
my new number two.

554
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:47,087
If he even once said.

555
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:48,373
It doesn't come with pay raise.

556
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,357
No, it does, actually.

557
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:53,348
So, who will be your number three?

558
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,553
Ah, that I have not decided yet.

559
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:57,482
Michael, I would just like to say that

560
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:01,600
you have handled this entire situation 
with great Aplam.

561
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,332
Thank you, Andy. 
That's very kind. Thank.

562
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,899
And, I have to say that your leadership has ...

563
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:09,273
Shhh, shut it. That's...

564
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:12,723
Suck up.

565
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,335
Hey, where you at?

566
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:25,099
I'm at the grocery store buying a cork screw 
to give myself lobotomy.

567
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:27,801
What's wrong. 
You didn't have a good first day?

568
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:31,800
Oh my god! Hey you want to meet 
in a Cooper's in an hour?

569
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,127
I need to drink.

570
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:34,758
Yeah, sure. Sounds good.

571
00:27:34,758 --> 00:27:38,622
I... Hey, you know what. 
Can I call you right back?

572
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:41,237
Yeah
- Okay, thanks. 
- Okay

573
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:42,837
Hey.

574
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:44,142
Hey.

575
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:46,665
I thought you had already left.

576
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,207
Uh, no. I just had some other stuff I had to do.

577
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,387
Ah, Good.

578
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:52,428
What's up?

579
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,175
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad.

580
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:56,105
I feel like things were 
a little weird today or something.

581
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:57,296
What do you mean?

582
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:03,800
I just think I should tell you 
that I've sorta started seeing someone, and um...

583
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,478
Oh, that's totally cool.

584
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,115
You can do whatever you want.

585
00:28:09,198 --> 00:28:11,783
Oh? okay. Um... Good.

586
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:13,862
We're friends.

587
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:15,280
We'll always be friends.

588
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:17,076
Right.

589
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:20,247
It's good to have you back.

590
00:28:20,247 --> 00:28:23,167
Yeah, it's good to be back.

591
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:44,151
Where did you get that salad?

592
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:46,403
Staples.

593
00:28:51,423 --> 00:28:53,051
I saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot.

594
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:54,432
What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?

595
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:55,909
Uh, try double that.

596
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,300
Classic Trans Am, 
vintage American muscle. Please.

597
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,590
Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet.

598
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,747
Luxurious yet rugged. 
Leave it to the Japanese.

599
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:05,700
Xterra's not even a real word.

600
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,400
Actually, it is. 
It's Latin for ¡°earth.¡±

601
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,944
Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?

602
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:10,487
Yeah.

603
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:11,347
That makes sense.

604
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:15,839
I'd rather drive a classic Trans Am than an XEarth.

605
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:17,565
Yeah, I bet you would.

606
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:20,822
Oh, and by the way, 
1985 called and wants its car back.

607
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:24,000
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 
'cause I drive an 87.

608
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,315
Oh, speaking of time machines,

609
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:26,610
I just got back from the future

610
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,597
and I went to your funeral

611
00:29:27,597 --> 00:29:29,419
and guess what, nobody came.

612
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,453
Speaking of funerals,

613
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:34,250
why don't you go ahead and go die.

614
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,964
Oh, that was a really well-constructed sentence.

615
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:43,423
You should be an English professor 
at Cor-not University.

616
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,400
Idiot!

617
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,695
If I were an idiot, 
I'd be driving a Trans Am.

618
00:29:47,695 --> 00:29:49,315
If you were driving a Trans Am,

619
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:52,179
you would be the smartest 
idiot in the whole world.

620
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,923
Idiot!

621
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:57,956
You're the idiot!

622
00:29:57,956 --> 00:29:59,576
Nice comeback!

623
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:02,073
I was making fun of your comeback!

624
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:04,259
That's why it worked.

625
00:30:06,793 --> 00:30:09,559
I totally got the best of that interchange.
