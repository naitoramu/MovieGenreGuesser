1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,875
Let's think this through.

2
00:00:02,074 --> 00:00:05,904
If we ask corporate for that, then...

3
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:10,880
They are either gonna say yes... or no.

4
00:00:11,157 --> 00:00:12,210
Could go either way.

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,052
We don't know what
they are going to say.

6
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,246
- Think it through !
- Have to think it through.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,123
Because if they say no...

8
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:23,170
Can we not ?

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,314
No, yes we have to.
You know why ?

10
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:27,450
Cause I don't like to be
cooped up in that office.

11
00:00:27,483 --> 00:00:29,936
In that box all day long.
Heisman !

12
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,050
Because I need to think. Okay, Jim ?

13
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:35,356
Oh, Kevin !

14
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,121
Nice catch.

15
00:00:41,217 --> 00:00:42,620
Oscar !

16
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:44,613
Intercepted. Right here. 

17
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:46,221
- Right or the left.
- Give it to me.

18
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,321
Phyllis, give me the ball.
Okay, give me the ball.

19
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:50,430
You guys...Creed. Give me the ball.
Right now.

20
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:52,311
- Give it to me.
- Ryan.

21
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:55,980
Fumble ! Yeah !

22
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:00,801
All right, hey, Dwight !

23
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:12,422
- You all right, Ryan ?
-  Yeah.

24
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:16,082
Pam !

25
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:41,550

28
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:53,071
They're having a sale on TiVo.

29
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:56,151
Maybe I should get a TiVo.

30
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:59,533
DVD burner.
Maybe I should get one of those.

31
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,632
You are so lucky, Jim.

32
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:05,481
You are so lucky you
don't have this problem.

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,032
What was the ninth place prize again ?

34
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:11,531
A loaf of bread ?

35
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:13,612
Cojino's pizza.

36
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:16,510
Great. Tasty terrific pizza.

37
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:20,712
Question, do their pizza play DVDs ?

38
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:25,472
<i>Dwight was the top salesman
of the year at our company.</i>

39
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:29,802
He wins a little prize money and
gets honored at some convention

40
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:35,130
It is literally the highest possible
honor that a Northeastern, Pennsylvania;

41
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:38,831
based, mid-sized, paper company,
regional salesman, can attain. So...

42
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:43,981
- What did I do to deserve this ?
- Are you sad that Dwight beat you ?

43
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:45,993
- No.
- Are you gonna cry, Jim ?

44
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:49,023
- Do you need a tissue ?
- I heard that you got a wedding dress.

45
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:53,000
- Do you have pictures ?
-Yeah. I'll show 'em to you later.

46
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:56,250
I should get back.

47
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:58,100
- Talk to you guys later.
- Okay, cool.

48
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,173
I have a ton of stuff
to do for the wedding.

49
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:02,051
And I have to do it in the office.

50
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:04,180
And that can be kind of awkward.

51
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:09,203
Just because people, can get all
weird about wedding stuff.

52
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:12,482
I just don't want to offend...

53
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:15,413
Angela. Or someone.

54
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:23,201
- That's what she said.
- I don't get it.

55
00:03:23,798 --> 00:03:26,030
Grapes, seductive.

56
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:28,550
So, you ready for the big
speech this afternoon ?

57
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:31,472
Well, it's not really a big speech.
You're still coming, right ?

58
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:34,202
Abso-fruitly.

59
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,552
Fruit, grapes. Nailed the joke.
Matter of time.

60
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:40,051
And yes, it is a big speech.
Biggest of your life.

61
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:43,581
Speaker at the sales convention.

62
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,772
Been there, done that.
Went there again, did it again.

63
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,281
Two years in a row. Consecutive.

64
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:55,651
I just I miss the feeling of knowing
that you did a good job.

65
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:57,892
Because somebody
gives you proof of it.

66
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:01,272
<i>Sir, you're awesome.
Here's a plaque.</i>

67
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:04,521
<i>What, a whole year has gone by,
and you need more proof ?</i>

68
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,952
<i>Here's a certificate.</i>

69
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,032
They stopped making
plaques that year.

70
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:11,653
What if I give a really
long extended thank you ?

71
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:14,873
For instance, thank you, Mr. Blank.

72
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:18,621
- Thank you, very, very...
- That would look terrible.

73
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:21,873
These are mostly salesmen, and
salesmen expect to be entertained.

74
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:23,713
And  you are the main act.

75
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:27,360
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a
finalist in our school spelling bee.

76
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:30,593
It was me against Raj Patel.

77
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:34,322
And I misspelled,
in front of the entire school.

78
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:37,001
The word "failure".

79
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,351
I can't do this.

80
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:40,381
That's because you're
incapable of doing it.

81
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,852
Because you don't know how.
Because you have no skills.

82
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,602
Dwight, there's no way
I can possibly teach you,

83
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:50,170
you need to know about
public speaking by speech time.

84
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:51,073
Okay.

85
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:55,251
But, I can teach you enough so that
you don't embarrass me or the company.

86
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:57,992
Okay, deal. I'll do whatever you say.
No questions asked.

87
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:00,151
Well, if you have a question,
you should ask me.

88
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:01,310
I'll try to think of one...

89
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:03,473
Don't-don't try to think of
a question to humor me.

90
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:04,890
Just try not to be such an idiot.

91
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,813
Is that an insult or is that part
of the public speaking advice ?

92
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,200
Insult.

93
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:16,300
<i>Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and dad
are chipping in for the wedding.</i>

94
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:18,240
But I do not want
orange invitations.

95
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:21,601
Yes.

96
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,121
<i>Well, if you really want...</i>

97
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,491
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one
of your travel agents ?

98
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:28,342
I'm gonna take a trip.

99
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,902
I'm gonna get out of town for a while.

100
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:33,353
And go someplace...

101
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,220
Not here.

102
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:37,673
Where do I want to go ?

103
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,861
That is an excellent question.

104
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:43,743
<i>And one I probably should have
thought about before I called you.</i>

105
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:49,101
<i>I get here early every morning
so I can set the thermostat.</i>

106
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:52,521
I like it a little cooler,
around 66 degrees.

107
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:54,441
I'm more productive.

108
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:57,602
<i>Maybe some people don't
like it as cold as I do.</i>

109
00:05:58,197 --> 00:05:59,420
But I don't care.

110
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:03,473
But  seriously, what's the difference
between a salesman and a saleswoman ?

111
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,852
- A saleswoman has a vagina.
- It's a joke, Dwight.

112
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,700
- It's not a sex ed class.
- But I'm right.

113
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,482
Yeah, you're right about the difference
between a man and a woman.

114
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:12,710
But not about the punchline
to the joke, all right ?

115
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:16,573
The difference between a salesman
and a saleswoman is boobs.

116
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:19,622
Hey, do you remember
the speeches that you gave ?

117
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:20,942
I do. Both of them.

118
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:23,802
- Could I have a copy of one of them?
- No, no, they would remember.

119
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:25,782
Look, it doesn't matter what you say.

120
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:28,883
it just matters that you're saying
something that people care about.

121
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:32,013
Yeah? All right, here we go.
Watch this.

122
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:34,341
Attention everybody !
Attention please.

123
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:37,173
I have some very great
news from corporate.

124
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:39,803
We had a wonderful quarter,
and as a result,

125
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:43,031
all of you are getting
bonuses for $1,000.

126
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:45,441
- Yeah ! 
- Congratulations.

127
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,462
You see that ?

128
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,662
You see how they responded to me ?
In that moment, I had them.

129
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:59,012
- That is so great about the bonus !
- No, no. It's not true.

130
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:02,991
I was just talking.
So, just go out there and say anything.

131
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:05,390
They'll eat it up,
they're a great audience.

132
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:08,991
Go ahead, get the wallpaper.
Wallpaper the ceiling if you want.

133
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:12,661
Excuse me ?
May I have your attention please ?

134
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:15,961
There has been an accident on 84 West.

135
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,242
Cars have skidded off the
road into the safety railing.

136
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,933
Several  cars have flipped.
There is broken glass everywhere.

137
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,683
Several people are injured.

138
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:28,111
Do we know anyone who
was injured in the accident ?

139
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,172
Brad Pitt.

140
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:33,991
Also, there will be no bonuses.

141
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:36,660
- Why would this affect our bonuses ?
- They're unrelated.

142
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,033
Is Brad okay ?

143
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,870
He will never act again.

144
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:42,056
Also, this branch is closing.

145
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,710
What the hell is going on here ?

146
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:45,236
- Are we out of jobs ?
- Yes.

147
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,001
This is karma for what he
did to Jennifer Anniston.

148
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:49,511
He's kidding. Dwight was kidding.

149
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:52,260
And I don't know why
because it wasn't funny.

150
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,863
And it was just horrible.

151
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,213
- Michael ?
- Yeah ?

152
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,760
You said we were getting bonuses.

153
00:07:57,797 --> 00:07:59,810
All right. Everybody in
the conference room now.

154
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,432
Let's go ! Let's do it.

155
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:03,290
<i>Cancel the wallpaper</i>

156
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,132
As your leader and your friend,

157
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:09,511
I sort of demand that you can
all speak in public as I can.

158
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,433
And did, twice.

159
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,961
You saw the plaque, right ?

160
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:17,561
All right, we're all gonna go around the
room and we're going to make toasts.

161
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:21,263
And that way we will overcome
or fear of public speaking.

162
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,780
- You mean toastmasters ?
- Pam !

163
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,730
I'm public speaking.
Stop public interrupting me.

164
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:29,682
Actually, this would be good
practice for your wedding toast.

165
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:34,812
Yeah, the bride doesn't really do,
have you ever been to a wedding ?

166
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:36,760
- Can I go ?
- Yes

167
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:39,111
Good. Jim taking the initiative.

168
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:43,681
So, I am going on a trip.

169
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:46,083
But I'm not really sure
where I'm going yet.

170
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:47,261
It'a kinda open ended.

171
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,913
So I was hoping maybe you guys
would have some suggestions.

172
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:52,431
You should go to Hedonism.

173
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:55,113
- What is that ?
- It's like Club Med.

174
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:58,162
But everything is naked.

175
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,182
I was thinking more like Europe.
Or something like that.

176
00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:03,312
But good second choice.

177
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,382
Been to Amsterdam.

178
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,133
Okay, you know what ?

179
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:09,942
That's not a toast.
You're not standing up.

180
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:13,731
- To Amsterdam.
-  When did you go there ?

181
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:16,461
After my divorce.

182
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,240
Really? For like, how long ?

183
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:21,412
About a week or...maybe or month.

184
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,383
- I can't
- Jimmy, listen to me

185
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:26,080
You do not want to go
to Amsterdam, trust me.

186
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:29,160
- Where do I wanna go ?
- I'd send you to Hong Kong.

187
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:31,311
I'd like to say hi to
my friends in China.

188
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:35,361
Wode Zhongguode Pengyou Nihao.

189
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:38,182
Okay. Dwight.

190
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,043
Show us what you have learned today.

191
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:49,093
Good morning, Vietnam !

192
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:59,081
Okay, you know what ?
This isn't working.

193
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:02,143
Because, I'm not
nervous in front of them.

194
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:05,130
- They're my subordinates.
- No, we're not.

195
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:07,913
Yes, you are. I am the
assistant regional manager.

196
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:10,953
- Which means absolutely nothing.
- Michael, can you explain ?

197
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:14,220
- Well, it's mostly made up. So...

198
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:16,532
Dwight is not going to
do a good job, it's sad.

199
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:19,511
And they're expecting excellence
because I did do such a great job.

200
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:22,040
Two years in a row I killed.
It was amazing.

201
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:26,043
Confidence, Dwight !

202
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:31,661
Dwight.

203
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,530
If you could travel anywhere
in the world, where would you go ?

204
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:36,130
I can travel anywhere, except Cuba.

205
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:38,413
And I WILL travel to New Zealand.

206
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:40,640
And walk the Lord of the
Rings trail to Mordor

207
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,260
And then I will hike Mt. Doom.

208
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,481
So, you know, just leave me alone.

209
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,852
Okay, just trying to get
some advice on my trip.

210
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:50,133
Oh please, you're not taking any trip.

211
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,613
You know, I majored in
public speaking in college?

212
00:10:57,816 --> 00:10:59,260
You did ?

213
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,282
And the first thing
that they teach you

214
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:03,130
is that you've gotta
be true to yourself.

215
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:06,213
And you are all about authority.

216
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,730
Yes, I am.

217
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:12,013
The great speakers throughout
history were not joke tellers.

218
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:14,283
They were people of passion.

219
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,853
So, if you wanna do well today,
you gotta do what they did.

220
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:19,210
- Which is?
- You gotta wave your arms.

221
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:22,161
And you've gotta pound your fists.
Many times.

222
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:25,313
So as to emphasize your point.

223
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:27,820
Okay, I didn't actually major
in public speaking.

224
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:31,563
But I did download speeches from
some of history's famous dictators.

225
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:35,511
Like this one.
Originally given by Benito Mussolini.

226
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:38,912
Okay, look, I know you're giving
this speech on your own.

227
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:41,512
But I wrote up a few talking
points for you to look at.

228
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:43,731
- Hope you don't mind.
-  I'll glance at it.

229
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,333
It's time, Dwight.
The grim reaper is here.

230
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,443
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.

231
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,380
Thank you, Angela.

232
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:04,532
Why'd you pick the
VR for the reception ?

233
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:08,063
Roy has a connection.
It's nicer than you think.

234
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:11,010
You're  inviting Jim ?

235
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:13,712
Of course, he's one of
my closest friends.

236
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:17,632
All right.

237
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:20,393
Ready ? Here we go !

238
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:28,903
Wow, it's a little bit bigger
than I remembered.

239
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:32,411
Come on, we're down here in the front.

240
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:58,211
I am just feeling under the weather.

241
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,662
And, I think that I will
go home and rest.

242
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:04,502
I've never ever seen
you take a sick day.

243
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:07,312
Well, I've seen you take enough
for the both of us.

244
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:13,093
Next, I'd like to introduce the
Dunder-Mifflin salesman of the year.

245
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:15,363
Dwight Schrute !

246
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:25,253
<i>Dwight, how we doing ?</i>

247
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:27,432
- Okay, you know what ?
- Okay.

248
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:30,960
You know what ? Okay. No, no problem.
You're lucky you have me,

249
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,782
- I am going to cover for you.
All right !

250
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:44,703
Good morning Vietnam !

251
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:50,240
I am not Dwight Schrute.

252
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:54,012
Not at all. I am Michael Scott.

253
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:56,513
His mentor and boss.

254
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,561
And until Dwight comes up,
if he ever does,

255
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:05,113
I wanted to say a few words
about excellence.

256
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:09,990
What makes a work
environment excellent ?

257
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,881
Well, there are many things.

258
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:17,392
I believe, that do such
a thing of that... nature.

259
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,980
And one would be humor.

260
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:27,641
What is the difference between
a salesman and a saleswoman ?

261
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:40,690
I always set it at 69.

262
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:43,861
Maybe we'll use a DJ.

263
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:46,311
That's the one thing Roy's in
charge of for this wedding,

264
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,593
but all he's managed
to do is set a date.

265
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,390
Well, he did a great job.
June 10th is perfect.

266
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:54,360
I want a June wedding.
I've always wanted one.

267
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,111
Ryan, do you know when you
would want to get married ?

268
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,300
Actually, I don't see
ever getting married.

269
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:12,563
Ryan, you should be more sensitive.
It's obvious she likes you.

270
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,510
- And comments like that, they just...
- I know what I said.

271
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:20,063
I'm very sorry, I did not know that
you were wearing a hearing aid.

272
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:21,891
And I just thought you were speaking...

273
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,391
Abnormally.

274
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:29,391
And now, the black guy from
the Police Academy movies.

275
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,391
A robot.

276
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:39,813
Michael Winslow. Anyone ?

277
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,793
Car starting.

278
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:49,211
All right, Dwight Schrute, everyone.

279
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:53,790
Good luck.
That is a tough crowd.

280
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:12,762
Blood alone moves
the wheels of history !

281
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:18,771
Have you ever asked yourselves 
in an hour of meditation,

282
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:22,152
which everyone finds during the day,

283
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:25,822
How long we have been
striving for greatness ?

284
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:32,521
Not only the years we've been at war,
the war of work.

285
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,822
But from the moment, as a child,

286
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:39,611
when we realized that the
world could be conquered.

287
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,870
It has been a lifetime struggle.

288
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:45,043
A never-ending fight.

289
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:51,340
I say to you, and you will understand,
that it is a privilege to fight !

290
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:00,100
We  are warriors !

291
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:08,792
Salesmen of Northeastern
Pennsylvania, I ask you.

292
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:12,900
Once more, rise and be worthy
of this historical hour.

293
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:25,170
I got a time share on Key West
that might be available.

294
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,570
Maybe, thanks.

295
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:31,621
- You really think you're gonna go?
- Yeah, I'm definitely going.

296
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:34,170
Nice, send me a postcard.

297
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,522
Jim has worked at the same
place for five years.

298
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:39,621
Jim eats the same ham and cheese
sandwich everyday for lunch.

299
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,700
I don't know,
if I were a betting man,

300
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,642
I'd say he will have a fun
weekend in Philadelphia.

301
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:55,570
No revolution is worth anything
unless it can defend itself !

302
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:03,053
<i>Some people will tell you
salesman is a bad word.</i>

303
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:07,420
<i>They'll conjure up images
of used car dealers...</i>

304
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:10,200
<i>...and door to door charlatans.</i>

305
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:13,451
<i>This is our duty to change
their perception.</i>

306
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:17,401
I say, salesmen...

307
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:21,370
and women...of the world, unite.

308
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:24,023
We must never acquiesce.

309
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:26,373
For it is together !

310
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:30,551
Together that we prevail !

311
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:36,632
We must never concede control
of the motherland, for it is...

312
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:41,012
Together that we prevail !

313
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:54,231
Australia ?
I've always wanted to go there.

314
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:55,410
I'm going.

315
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:58,762
I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight
on his connecting flight to Mordor,

316
00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:02,163
But, other than that...,
Yeah, I bought the ticket.

317
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:03,411
Non-refundable.

318
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:05,301
That's awesome.
Where are you staying ?

319
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,481
I don't know.

320
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:09,263
I feel like I have plenty of time
to figure out the details, but.

321
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,310
When are you leaving ?

322
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:13,883
I'm leaving...on June 8th.

323
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:17,792
Yeah.

324
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:20,363
And I'm really sorry about that.
I just...

325
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,490
Yeah, that's too bad.

326
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,460
Yeah.

327
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:30,313
Do you want me to take
these on my way out ?

328
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:33,233
It's okay, I got it.

329
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:34,490
Alright.

330
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:40,583
Ok. Thanks.

331
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:43,913
- There you are. What happened ?
- I got thirsty. How it go ?

332
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,442
It was amazing.
I wish you would have been there.

333
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,580
You would not believe
what happened here.

334
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:50,491
What, did something happen ?

335
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:52,611
This woman came in.

336
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:55,292
Sat down. Ordered a drink.

337
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,263
The bartender asked for her ID,
which I thought was odd.

338
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,360
- Because I pegged her at, like, 35.
- Weird.

339
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:01,321
Yeah, really weird.

340
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:04,100
So, she's like, I don't have my ID.
Please, give me one.

341
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:07,200
And he's like, I can't do that.
I can't serve you.

342
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:08,812
- Con artist.
- She might have been.

343
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:11,233
So she says fine,
I will go to my room.

344
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:13,090
I will get my purse,
I will come back.

345
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:14,313
I'll show you my ID.

346
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:15,831
She hasn't come back yet.

347
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:18,772
She's probably in the room
drinking from the minibar.

348
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:20,423
 Right ?

349
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:24,310
<i>Dwight gave a great speech.
That's the word on the street, anyway.</i>

350
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:28,670
<i>And I entertained Dwight to no
end with my bar story.</i>

351
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:30,951
<i>I captivated the guy...</i>

352
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,523
who captivated 1 000 guys.

353
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,181
Can you believe that ? 1 000 guys.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
