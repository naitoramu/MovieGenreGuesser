1
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:09,259
Wait. Before we go in, I just
want you to know that I love you.

2
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,304
I had a great time on our honeymoon.

3
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:16,058
I can't wait
to spend our life together.

4
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,520
You're sticking with
the shell necklace, huh?

5
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,439
You're back!

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,776
Come on in!

7
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,448
How was the honeymoon?

8
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:36,036
So much fun. The best part is,
we met this great couple.

9
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:40,791
That was the best part?
Good honeymooning, tiger.

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,252
They're cool.
It was their honeymoon too.

11
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,463
They live here in the city.

12
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,925
Can we go call them?
Is it too soon to call?

13
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:54,262
We're excited. We finally
have a couple to hang out with.

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:59,393
A couple? Like two people?
Like one, two people?

15
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,022
It's different.
Greg and Jenny are married.

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,859
Greg and Jenny?
"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler."

17
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,238
"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."

18
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,284
- They're great. If you just...
- You know what?

19
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,912
Give us our souvenirs
and get out of here.

20
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,750
- We didn't get a chance to...
- You're kidding!

21
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,130
- We didn't get anything for anyone.
- Nice necklace.

22
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,342
That you can have.

23
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,970

26
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,219
- Welcome home.
- How was the honeymoon?

27
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,472
Great! How about you?
You're having a baby!

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,767
- Look, I have a sonogram picture.
- Good.

29
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,480
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.

30
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:34,613
Now that Ross knows, how'd it happen?
When? How many times?

31
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,700
Monica, that's not right.
Start with where.

32
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,915
It happened about six weeks ago.

33
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:50,462
I got home and Ross was there.
He'd been hanging out with Joey.

34
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,465
You're welcome, buddy.

35
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,680
Yeah, thanks.

36
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,268
I had a lot of work,
and Ross offered to help.

37
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,187
We had wine, we got to talking.

38
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:11,358
Next thing you know,
Ross comes on to me.

39
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,320
That's a little misleading.

40
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,741
- What is?
- The lie you just told.

41
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,662
- That you came on to me?
- There's the one!

42
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,625
- But you did. Let's be honest.
- Yes, let's.

43
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,795
It's not important.

44
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:36,967
What's important is, we're having
a baby, not who came on to who.

45
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,303
"Whom."

46
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,099
That's right.

47
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,938
- You kissed me first.
- You were begging for it!

48
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,607
You were sending me signals!

49
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:57,446
I was sending signals? Anyone think
that I'd send Ross begging signals?

50
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,157
Please, show of hands.

51
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:06,664
It doesn't matter what people believe!
It happened.

52
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:12,253
Maybe I need to be more careful.
Am I sending these signals now?

53
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:17,049
- You know what? Just drop it.
- Show me how I begged you.

54
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,969
I can show you!
I have it on videotape.

55
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,187
It's an expression.

56
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,696
I can't believe
he taped them having sex.

57
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:43,033
Yeah. You gotta tell a girl
before you tape her.

58
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,286
Such a rookie mistake.

59
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:50,207
- Know who has a great camera?
- Greg and Jenny?

60
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,460
- I want to call them.
- Let's call.

61
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,964
Ask them if they brought
their friends souvenirs.

62
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,971
8th Street Deli?

63
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,226
Hang up. You get food poisoning
just talking to that place.

64
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,562
- Sorry, wrong number.
- Here you go, babe.

65
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,110
Hello?
It's the deli again!

66
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,196
All right, I'll have a sandwich.

67
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,408
I don't think this number's right.

68
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:31,081
- What?
- You got fake-numbered.

69
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,294
- What? People don't do that.
- Oh, I think we do.

70
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,631
- Why would they do that?
- I don't know.

71
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:44,011
You were a delight.
You asked those great questions.

72
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:49,183
And you were never funnier.
Joke, joke, joke! You were a hoot!

73
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,977
You still got me and Phoebe.

74
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:56,148
Excuse me, I don't want
Greg and Jenny's rejects.

75
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,278
Rachel won't talk to me.
She won't open the door.

76
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,488
I wonder why, pervert.

77
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,158
Okay, I am not a pervert.

78
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,661
That's, like, the pervert motto.

79
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:15,501
You raise your hand, put your left
hand down your pants and repeat that.

80
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,712
Filming Rachel was not planned.

81
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:22,174
Here's what happened.
Joey can back me up.

82
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:27,387
A month and a half ago, remember
I came to you with a problem?

83
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,724
The personal thing?

84
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,979
- What personal thing?
- About sex?

85
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,942
That I hadn't had sex in months?

86
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,113
Yeah, I knew what
you were talking about.

87
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:58,627
I'd like to talk about something
I'm uncomfortable talking about.

88
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,546
Sure.

89
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:05,467
How about you showering
with your mom?

90
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,973
I actually had a topic in mind.

91
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:18,855
I'm kind of going through
a dry spell, sex-wise.

92
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,858
- For, like, months?
- Five, to be...

93
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,069
...lying. Six.

94
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,780
Six months? That's rough.

95
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:32,411
It's not all bad. I'm learning to
appreciate the small things, like...

96
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:37,207
...the sound of a bird
and the color of the sky.

97
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,211
The sky's blue, Ross.
And I had sex yesterday.

98
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,008
Please help me.
I have a date tonight.

99
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,469
It has to go well.
I'm scared for my health.

100
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:54,516
I got something.
It's this story that I came up with.

101
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:58,520
Very romantic.
Any woman that hears it is putty.

102
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,314
Tell it to me.

103
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:05,444
Now, you're gonna want to have sex
with me when you hear it.

104
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,572
Remember, it is just the story.

105
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,451
I'll try to control myself.

106
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,958
Years ago, I was backpacking
across Western Europe...

107
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:25,589
- You were backpacking across Europe?
- Have a nice six more months.

108
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:31,261
I'm sorry. Please, please.
You were in Western Europe, and...?

109
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:38,435
I was outside Barcelona, hiking
in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

110
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:45,442
I was at the end of this path,
and there was a lake.

111
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,738
Very secluded.
There were tall trees all around.

112
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,575
It was dead silent.
Gorgeous.

113
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:59,748
And across the lake I saw
a beautiful woman bathing herself.

114
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,918
But she was crying.

115
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,129
Why?

116
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,305
This is great wine.

117
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,850
It's from France.

118
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,853
In Europe.

119
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,648
Western Europe.

120
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,530
A few years ago I was backpacking
across Western Europe.

121
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,534
- Really?
- Wait, it gets better.

122
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,207
Yeah, I was in Barcelona.

123
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:45,294
I studied for a year in Barcelona.

124
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:51,216
- Anyway, so I was hiking...
- I love hiking!

125
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,427
Oh, that's great!

126
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:59,808
I was hiking along the foothills
of Mount Tibidaybo...

127
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:04,188
- I think it's "Tibidabo."
- Do you want to tell the story?

128
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,068
How'd your date go?

129
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,281
Great. I'm across the street
having sex right now.

130
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,828
- Your story sucks.
- Then you didn't tell it right.

131
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,415
- Show me how you did it.
- No, I don't want to.

132
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:28,963
- How long since you seen a girl naked?
- I was backpacking...

133
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:34,426
- I'm not feeling it.
- I was outside Barcelona, hiking...

134
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:40,307
- Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
- It's been six months. I'm always hot.

135
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:44,562
You're not selling the story.
You don't believe it.

136
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,772
I gotta go, I got a date.
But try this.

137
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,651
Do what I do before an audition.

138
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:55,656
Use my camera to record yourself
and see what you're doing wrong.

139
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,449
I'll try that.

140
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:03,956
Now, you're all set up. Good to go.
Just hit record. Good luck.

141
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:10,587
If you ever have any problem with the
ladies, you know I'll help you out.

142
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,887
That means a lot to me, man.

143
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:41,910
Can I get you anything?
Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?

144
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:47,040
Ross, thank God you're here.
You have to help me.

145
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,043
Were you talking to yourself?

146
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:54,006
That's less embarrassing.
Yes. Yes, I was.

147
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:58,218
"When she came in",
<i>I totally forgot about the camera.</i>

148
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:02,097
It kept rolling
and recorded everything.

149
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,977
Yeah, we're gonna need
to see that tape.

150
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,690
What a great idea!
That'll get Rachel to forgive me.

151
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,901
It's not fair to her.
Let's forget the tape.

152
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,321
Thank you.

153
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:23,202
- No.
- You're right.

154
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:28,749
- Joey, no.
- Loud and clear.

155
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,425
I don't get why
they'd give us a fake number.

156
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:44,681
If they knew what they were doing,
they didn't give you real names.

157
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,104
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
but not fake names.

158
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:54,233
Hi. Ken Adams.
Nice to meet you.

159
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,569
Regina Phalange.

160
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:01,073
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- I know.

161
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,536
Although you did tell
an awful lot of jokes.

162
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:11,208
You said they were funny.
Joke, joke, joke!

163
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,127
Joke, joke, blah-blah.

164
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,052
- It was your questions.
- What about them?

165
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:27,391
The sheer volume.
It was like flying with the Riddler.

166
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,687
- Was that another joke?
- Was that another question?

167
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,192
Is Ross still here?

168
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,988
No, but he told us what happened.
It was an honest mistake.

169
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:47,035
How would you like it if I had sex
with you and I taped it?

170
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,496
Oh, forget it.

171
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,336
There he is, the father of my child,
the porn king of the West Village.

172
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,590
It was an accident, okay?

173
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,051
I feel bad.
I swear, I didn't even watch it.

174
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,013
Anyway, here.

175
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:10,350
You might be more comfortable
destroying it yourself.

176
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,645
Thank you.

177
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,945
What?

178
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:27,034
- You don't want to see this, do you?
- Hell, yeah!

179
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,579
I am not gonna show you this.

180
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:34,791
Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.

181
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,085
Forget it.

182
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:43,133
We'll think of another way to put the
"who came on to who" thing to rest.

183
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,303
Come on now, think!

184
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:51,349
It's Rachel's tape,
and she can do whatever she wants.

185
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:56,063
And she wants to destroy it,
so end of story.

186
00:14:56,313 --> 00:15:00,108
- I want to see it.
- What?

187
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,486
You don't want us to see this.

188
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:09,075
You so badly don't want us to see it
that it makes me want to see it.

189
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:14,164
Are we watching the tape or not?

190
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:20,545
- It's for your sake.
- I don't believe you.

191
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,383
I think you don't want them
to see you begging me.

192
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:29,597
- Rachel, please?
- Oh, a little preview.

193
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:36,478
Fine. I want the record to show
that I tried to take the high road.

194
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:42,192
Because in about five minutes,
I'm gonna be saying...

195
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,784
Okay, here we go.

196
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,497
I'm so happy.

197
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:03,547
<i>Thank God you're here. Help me.</i>
<i>Were you talking to yourself?</i>

198
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,801
- There I am.
- You're gonna get pregnant.

199
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,178
<i>I screwed up so bad.</i>

200
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:15,684
<i>I told Monica that I'd send</i>
<i>those wedding invitations weeks ago.</i>

201
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,353
<i>You didn 't do it?</i>

202
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:22,858
"I put them in my desk at work",
<i>and forgot about them until today.</i>

203
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:30,991
Sweetie, it's okay. Everybody made it
to the wedding. I'm fine.

204
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:35,704
- Kind of hurting my hand though.
- I know.

205
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:41,335
"I can 't believe it", "especially after"
<i>Monica went on and on about it.</i>

206
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:45,964
"Here are the invitations", "Rachel."
"Be very careful", "Rachel."

207
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:50,970
<i>Please no drinking liquids</i>
"around the invitations", "Rachel. "

208
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:04,066
Did you do it on our invitations?

209
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,696
Not on the ones we sent out.

210
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:15,327
So just the ones you gave back to us
and we had framed?

211
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,171
<i>It seems like yesterday</i>
<i>they just got engaged.</i>

212
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,256
<i>I know.</i>

213
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:33,679
<i>Remember the night they got engaged?</i>
<i>How you and I almost...</i>

214
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:37,682
"Oh", "I remember how we almost."

215
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,103
<i>You think we would've</i>
<i>gone through with it?</i>

216
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:44,106
<i>You think we would have done it?</i>

217
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:50,445
<i>I know I wanted to.</i>
<i>I just wasn 't sure if you did.</i>

218
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,490
"Oh", "I wanted to."

219
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:58,495
<i>So we both wanted to.</i>

220
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,623
<i>Interesting.</i>

221
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:10,382
"Anyway", "it probably worked out"
<i>for the best.</i>

222
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,801
"Yeah", "sure."

223
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:19,892
- In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.
- In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.

224
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,109
<i>Did I ever tell you about the time</i>
<i>I backpacked through Western Europe?</i>

225
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,869
Get ready to see some begging.

226
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:43,415
- Oh, you came on to Ross!
- What?

227
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,210
Now I'm so happy.

228
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,547
- What?
- You used the Europe story!

229
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:55,427
That's the magic story you use
when you want to have sex!

230
00:18:56,345 --> 00:19:01,725
- How do you know about that story?
- How do you know about that story?

231
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,353
My friend Irene heard it
from some guy.

232
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,231
Some guy!

233
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:15,447
No, she told me that
his name was Ken Adams.

234
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,075
Ken Adams!

235
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,589
So, people are familiar
with the Europe story?

236
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:38,637
About that, the "who came on to who"
thing really doesn't matter.

237
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,848
It would have happened either way.

238
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:47,145
If you hadn't initiated it,
I know I would have.

239
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:52,151
- It was an amazing night.
- It was. It was amazing.

240
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,823
You think it looked amazing?

241
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:03,620
I don't know.
I honestly didn't watch it.

242
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,539
Yeah, me neither.

243
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,999
Yet.

244
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,259
- That may be weird.
- Yeah, it would be really weird.

245
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,565
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

246
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,861
- Mind if I mute?
- Oh, please.

247
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:41,116
- There go the clothes.
- You are undressing awfully quickly.

248
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:44,495
Six months, Rachel. Six months.

249
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:57,133
- We look pretty good.
- I was gonna say.

250
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:00,343
- Nice tan.
- Thank you.

251
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,889
I'd just gone to
the beach that weekend.

252
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:11,438
- Have you been working out?
- I have been working out.

253
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:16,610
This is so much better
than I ever...

254
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:25,244
Oh, that's not pretty.

255
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:30,165
- Make it stop. Make it stop.
- Oh, no!

256
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,423
Hello, Greg?
This is Monica from the plane.

257
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:42,511
Listen, the number that
you gave me, 8-5-3...

258
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,722
Jenny's been giving out
their old number!

259
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:49,685
Jenny! That is so Jenny!

260
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:53,981
How would you like to
get together next Saturday?

261
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,316
Okay, how about Sunday?

262
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,986
Okay, the week after that?

263
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,988
The week after that?

264
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:07,411
You know what? We are interesting,
funny people with good questions.

265
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,415
And if you and your precious Jenny
can't see that...

266
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,333
January 15?

267
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:16,170
We'll see you then!

268
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,301
