1
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:06,799
All of a sudden,
so much is happening.

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,343
I know.
Ross is getting married.

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:12,721
Phoebe's making people.

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,432
- Everybody's doing stuff.
- We just sit here.

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,059
If I died,
people would know I was here...

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,147
...only by the ass print
on this chair!

7
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:26,109
We have to do something.
Something huge!

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,696
We could climb Mt. Everest.

9
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,907
Not something stupid.
Something huge!

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,284
I saw an ad for this video.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,747
People climb that thing every day.
We could totally do that!

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,208
Why not?
I mean, it's just climbing.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,503
It's just steep!

14
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:49,925
We're going! It'd be nice
to leave an ass print on Everest.

15
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:51,635
What's up?

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,763
- We're gonna climb Mt. Everest.
- Yeah, baby!

17
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,640
I looked into that.

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,270
Yeah, but it costs like $60,000,
and, you know, you could die.

19
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,858
And you would die.

20
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,320
We could get that Everest video.

21
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,283
We could do that
without risking our lives at all.

22
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:19,163
While we're at the video store,
we could rent "Die Hard"!

23
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,540
I just remembered.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,128
That Everest thing is only available
through mail order.

25
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:30,465
So you'll stay here
and hang out with me?

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,760
But one of these days...

27
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:38,849
...we'll get off our butts
and rent "Die Hard" again!

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,728
The One with the Invitation

29
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,610
So does your uncle Nathan
get an invite or not?

30
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,820
Oh, God!
Nobody likes him.

31
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:38,117
He's so cheap. He'd never fly
to London in a million years.

32
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,078
Invite him!

33
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,456
Did I do these neat enough?

34
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,750
Yeah, they're fine.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,504
We'll say that Ben addressed them.

36
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,340
You invited Rachel then?

37
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,800
Sure, why not?

38
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,135
Really?

39
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:01,724
I wouldn't be comfortable having
any of my old lovers there.

40
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,643
Do you think
we shouldn't invite her?

41
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,604
You know I absolutely adore Rachel.

42
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,901
It's just that I thought
it might be awkward for you.

43
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,569
But it's absolutely your decision.

44
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,781
- More tea?
- Sure.

45
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,867
Earl Grey?

46
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,495
Fine, invite whoever you want.

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,713
I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.

48
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:41,012
And I just want a million dollars!

49
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,768
Oh God, Monica. Thank God!

50
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,689
This is Rachel.
Another Lincoln High survivor.

51
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,190
This is Chandler.

52
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,567
Phoebe.

53
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,901
Joey.

54
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,489
- Do you remember Ross?
- Sure.

55
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,868
Back in high school...

56
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:06,830
...I had a major crush on you.

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,998
I knew.

58
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,042
You did?

59
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,964
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

60
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,134
I did.

61
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,594
Listen, do you think...

62
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:25,849
Try not to let my intense
vulnerability become a factor.

63
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,812
Would it be okay
if I asked you out sometime?

64
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:35,150
Maybe.

65
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,613
Okay, maybe I will.

66
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,366
See, I see...

67
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,077
...big passion in your future.

68
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,829
- Really?
- I do.

69
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,917
Ross, you're so great.

70
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,846
It's never gonna happen.

71
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,557
I have a question.

72
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,561
Actually, it's not
so much a question.

73
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,897
It's more of a general wondering...

74
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,150
...ment.

75
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:24,866
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to...

76
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,411
That's right.

77
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,329
Look!

78
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,333
What?

79
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,252
<i>Top of the world looking</i>

80
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,087
<i>Down on creation</i>

81
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:42,717
<i>And the only explanation I can find</i>

82
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:49,266
Listen, missy! If you want this cart,
you'll have to take me with it!

83
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,064
- Did you see that?
- You were incredible!

84
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,817
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

85
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,987
I could not have done this
without you.

86
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,623
More clothes in the dryer?

87
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,416
I'm fine.

88
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,378
You had no right to tell me
you had feelings for me.

89
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,215
I was doing great with Julie
before I found out.

90
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:26,095
I was doing great too. It's not
easy for me to see you with Julie.

91
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,139
I don't need this right now.

92
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,974
It's too late.

93
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,145
I'm with somebody else.
This ship has sailed!

94
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,813
All right, fine!
Go ahead and do that.

95
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,985
I don't need your stupid ship!

96
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,577
This is the first time I'm doing
something I care about.

97
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:35,372
I'm doing something
that I'm actually good at.

98
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,998
If you don't get that...

99
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:41,170
I get that, but I'm tired
of your answering machine.

100
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,839
I don't know what to do.

101
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,382
Neither do I!

102
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,301
Is this about Mark?

103
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,511
Oh, my God!

104
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,055
Okay, it's not.

105
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,559
I can't keep having this
same fight over and over again.

106
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,395
You're making this too hard!

107
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,772
I am?
What do you want me to do?

108
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,944
I don't know. Look, maybe
we should just take a break.

109
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,114
You're right. Let's cool off.

110
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:12,534
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

111
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,039
A break from us.

112
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,962
- Why are we rushing?
- The girlfriend I told you about.

113
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,216
She wants to get back
together with me.

114
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,425
I found it!

115
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,678
That's so great for you guys!

116
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:36,517
- Good luck with your girlfriend.
- Thank you.

117
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,110
- You got my message?
- You are right on time.

118
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,655
Can I be your girlfriend again?

119
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,950
You can very much.

120
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,078
I want you to leave.
Get out!

121
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,623
I want to talk about this.

122
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,168
All right, how was she?

123
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:08,757
Was she good?

124
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,551
Don't answer!

125
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,932
You wanted to talk about it.
How was she?

126
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,016
She was...

127
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:22,563
- She was not good, not good.
- Nothing compared to you.

128
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:25,357
She was different.

129
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,820
Good different?

130
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,781
Nobody likes change.

131
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,492
Just stop!

132
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,786
The way you owned up to everything.

133
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:42,582
It's just showed me
how much you've grown, you know?

134
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:47,171
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

135
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:52,635
She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

136
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,515
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

137
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:05,063
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective.

138
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:10,903
We were on a break!

139
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,621
You seem to really like her.

140
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:25,626
What do I do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

141
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,087
No commitment.

142
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:32,967
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

143
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,636
...asking to hear stories about you...

144
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,514
...Iooking through
Monica's photo albums.

145
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:42,268
You don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

146
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,020
You think?

147
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,440
You've got 14 hours until
she has to be at the airport.

148
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,901
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

149
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,947
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

150
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,452
You're right.

151
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,174
This is so amazing!

152
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,176
My brother's getting married
and in London!

153
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,554
It's so romantic.

154
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,765
Hey, pretty smart!

155
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,058
Tissue paper.

156
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,727
You're at the wedding.
You have to cry.

157
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:29,940
Handkerchief?
No, I got my invitation.

158
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,318
Isn't this adorable?

159
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:36,697
Ross let Ben address mine.

160
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,744
Did you get your invitation
to Ross' wedding?

161
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,750
Don't worry, I get to bring a guest.
We'll show him.

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,585
I'm so jealous you're all going.

163
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,963
I never knew you can't fly
in your third trimester.

164
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,339
I didn't, either.

165
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,759
I knew that.

166
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:01,388
So I didn't know that.
But you should see your faces.

167
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,265
What's up?

168
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,727
Just hanging out.

169
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,984
What's this?
Ross' wedding invitation?

170
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,738
Maybe that's the one
we should have hidden.

171
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,116
No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.

172
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,159
I'm happy for him.

173
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,038
I am. I really...

174
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,624
I'll work on it.

175
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,460
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,840
You're going to come, though,
aren't you?

177
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,841
I don't know.

178
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,511
This isn't one of those
"If she doesn't come, we don't come"?

179
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,849
Because I already bought my ticket.

180
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,271
You know what would be real weird?
If you weren't there.

181
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:56,569
- Just say you'll think about it.
- I'll think about it.

182
00:12:58,654 --> 00:12:59,655
Who's this from?

183
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,282
That's Ross'.

184
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,456
Oh, my God!

185
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,124
He remembered.

186
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,585
Remembered what?

187
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:16,547
It was months ago.
We were walking by this antique store.

188
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:20,301
I saw this and told him
it was like one my grandmother had...

189
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,887
...when I was a little girl.

190
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,263
I can't believe he remembered!

191
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,016
This must've cost a fortune.

192
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,392
I can't believe he did this.

193
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,311
Remember when he fell in love
with Carol...

194
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:35,608
...and got her
that expensive crystal duck?

195
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,486
What did you just say?

196
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,457
Oh, my God!

197
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:56,086
Flight number 457
from Beijing now arriving.

198
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,798
Oh, my God!

199
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,842
- We were in school together.
- We haven't seen each other since.

200
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,847
I land in China.
Guess who's in charge of the dig?

201
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,766
Julie!

202
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,602
Isn't that great?

203
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:17,691
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

204
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:23,113
That is so sweet!

205
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,034
No, you hang up.

206
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,412
No, you...

207
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:34,791
One, two, three.

208
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,711
You didn't hang up!

209
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,422
She didn't hang up either.

210
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,511
No, you hang up.

211
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:49,598
You!

212
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,353
Ross, hi.

213
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,355
It's Rachel.

214
00:14:56,605 --> 00:15:00,818
I'm just calling to say
that everything's fine.

215
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,112
And I'm really happy for you...

216
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,866
...and your cat.

217
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:11,036
Obviously, I am over you.

218
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,372
I am over you.

219
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:21,171
And that, my friend,
is what they call closure.

220
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,174
I got a message from you.

221
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,885
Oh, my God!
Hang up the phone!

222
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,680
Give me the phone!

223
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,981
You're over me?

224
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,151
Oh, God.

225
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,238
You're over me?

226
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,575
When were you...

227
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,995
...under me?

228
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,873
Basically...

229
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,668
...lately, I've...

230
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:03,464
I've sort of had feelings for you.

231
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,425
I need to lie down.

232
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,511
He broke up with Julie!

233
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:14,057
Go hug her, for God's sakes!

234
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,769
Really?

235
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,855
It's always been you, Rach.

236
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,899
Oh, God.

237
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,868
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

238
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,620
That's okay.

239
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,581
You're worth the wait.

240
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,585
And I don't just mean tonight.

241
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,279
Oh, God!

242
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,656
Honey.

243
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,325
That's okay.

244
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,621
No, you just rolled over
the juice box.

245
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:25,045
Did you say anything to Rachel about
me and the girl from the copy place?

246
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,671
I'm sorry.

247
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:30,384
Was I not supposed to?

248
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,308
You ended it!

249
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:42,772
Because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

250
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,440
You still love me?

251
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:52,406
What does this mean?
Do you want to get back together?

252
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,159
Maybe.

253
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,661
I don't know.

254
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,665
I just, I feel...

255
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:15,178
I can't believe I even thought of
getting back together. We're so over!

256
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,307
Fine by me!

257
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:22,061
And hey! Just so you know,
it's not that common.

258
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:26,649
It doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal.

259
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:30,236
I knew it!

260
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,458
<i>Rachel's coming up.</i>
<i>Doesn't she look pretty?</i>

261
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,043
Oh, my God!

262
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,962
This is us getting ready
for the prom.

263
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,173
We don't have to watch this.

264
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,382
Yeah, we do!

265
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,051
Come on!

266
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,471
<i>- Get a shot of Monica.</i>
<i>- How do you zoom out?</i>

267
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:01,058
<i>There she is!</i>

268
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:04,061
Shut up!
The camera adds 10 pounds.

269
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:07,940
So how many cameras
are actually on you?

270
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,983
<i>Dad, turn it off!</i>

271
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,402
<i>It is off.</i>

272
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,738
<i>Right, Ross?</i>

273
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:21,578
Looking good, Mr. Kotter!

274
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:26,375
<i>I can't go to my prom without a date.</i>
<i>It's too late.</i>

275
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,837
<i>If you're not going,</i>
<i>then I don't want to go either.</i>

276
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,047
<i>I have a wonderful idea.</i>

277
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,508
<i>You should take Rachel to the prom.</i>

278
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,510
We've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.

279
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,805
- I want to see!
- Fine, I'm not going to watch.

280
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,015
<i>Come on, kid. Let's go.</i>

281
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,018
<i>Are you handsome!</i>

282
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:47,396
<i>Let's show them!</i>

283
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,526
<i>- Okay, Dad.</i>
<i>- Rachel, ready or not.</i>

284
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:56,780
<i>Here comes your knight in shining...</i>

285
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:04,038
<i>Oh, dear!</i>

286
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:07,458
<i>How do I turn this off?</i>

287
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,837
I can't believe you did that.

288
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:34,234
See? He's her lobster!

289
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,373
You're really not going?

290
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,292
It's just going to be too hard.

291
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,627
You know, I mean...

292
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,130
...it's Ross.

293
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,092
How can I watch him get married?

294
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:02,638
It's just for the best.
You know? It is.

295
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,557
Plus somebody's got
to stay here with Phoebe.

296
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,560
She's going to be pretty big by then.

297
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,355
She'll need someone
to help her tie her shoes.

298
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,943
Drive her to the hospital
if she goes into labor.

299
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,736
You don't have a car.

300
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,448
And your license expired.

301
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:26,411
There's so much to do,
and I have so little time!

302
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:31,833
Check this out.

303
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:35,546
There's a place you can go
to rent videos of all the museums.

304
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,716
"It's almost as good as being there."

305
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:43,387
It's better! You can't go to a museum
in your underwear.

306
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:47,516
You could, but just the one time.

307
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,185
We could get videos
of the sights...

308
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:54,356
...get a VCR in our hotel room
and never have to go outside!

309
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:58,151
If we do that,
we've got to rent "Die Hard".

310
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:03,031
I bet the British version is good!
