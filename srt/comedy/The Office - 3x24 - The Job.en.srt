David!

2
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:07,366
- Oh, Michael?
- Are we all set?

3
00:00:09,248 --> 00:00:11,589
Isn't our interview tomorrow?

4
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:16,830
Yes. I just happened to be 
in the neighborhood,

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,451
thought I'd drop in and say hello.

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,321
You happened to be in midtown Manhattan?

7
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:22,691
Thought I'd catch a show.

8
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:24,667
In the middle of a work day?

9
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:25,717
No.

10
00:00:26,988 --> 00:00:27,697
You know what?

11
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:29,517
Since I'm here,

12
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:32,728
let me ask you 
a few questions about the job.

13
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:33,572
Okay.

14
00:00:34,404 --> 00:00:35,927
How many people are you interviewing?

15
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:38,235
We're only interviewing 
the branch managers and

16
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:39,853
some other 
upper level company people.

17
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:41,538
Ah, well, good.

18
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:43,883
Out of curiosity 
are you interviewing anyone

19
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:45,949
who has been here 
longer than I have, or

20
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:46,909
manages more people?

21
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,726
- I don't think so. 
- Great.

22
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:50,737
One more question.

23
00:00:50,737 --> 00:00:53,941
When you merged those branches 
who did you put in charge?

24
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:56,749
I believe we put you in charge.

25
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:58,456
Great. No further questions.

26
00:00:58,852 --> 00:00:59,846
- Okay, Michael.
- Okay.

27
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:01,672
I'm really looking 
forward to our interview.

28
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:03,591
And I'm really looking 
forward to working with you.

29
00:01:08,673 --> 00:01:11,783
I have got it made in the shade.

30
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:12,925
I know this company.

31
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:15,045
The other branch managers 
are total morons.

32
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:17,776
Hey, Pam yeah- 
I forgot what day the interview was

33
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:19,087
and I drove to New York accidentally.

34
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:20,334
I'll be like three hours late.

00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:47,933
Hey.

44
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:48,521
Hey, Kev.

45
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:50,718
What's different about you?

46
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:53,854
- You look worse.  
- Thank you.

47
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:55,074
You got a haircut.

48
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,564
It's sexy, hot.

49
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:58,488
Turn around.

50
00:01:58,738 --> 00:01:59,337
No.

51
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:00,070
Come on.

52
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,773
No way.

53
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:01,413
Do it!

54
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,644
What's up, Big Haircut?

55
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:07,625
You are no longer Big Tuna.

56
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:10,304
From henceforth, 
you shall be known as Big Haircut.

57
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:12,175
- Andy...
- What is it, Big Haircut?

58
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:14,154
- Nothing.
- Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut

59
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:15,255
- Yup.
- What?

60
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:17,861
Karen suggested that I get a haircut

61
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:19,651
before the interview tomorrow

62
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,604
so that I could look presentable

63
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:26,017
and not, as she so lovingly puts it,

64
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:26,753
homeless.

65
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:28,177
Hey.

66
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:29,761
I think it looks great.

67
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:31,240
Thanks, Pam.

68
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,990
After I had my little 
outburst at the beach,

69
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,964
Jim was really nice about it.

70
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:43,593
He just basically said that 
he missed my friendship, too

71
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,391
and I would always 
mean a lot to him

72
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,260
and I understand 
where he's coming from.

73
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:50,183
For the record, 
I am not embarassed at all.

74
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:53,004
It needed to be said, 
and I said it,

75
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,851
and it only took me three years 
to summons the courage,

76
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,554
so thank you.

77
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,731
Yeah.

78
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,389
You wanted to see me?

79
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:03,512
Yes.

80
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:06,187
The time has come to 
name my own replacement.

81
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:11,182
So please hand this 
letter of congratulations to

82
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:12,941
Dwight K. Schrute.

83
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,728
But that's my name.

84
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:25,195
"Dwight, congratulations a wipe."

85
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:27,083
"Don't screw the pooch."

86
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,201
Thank you.

87
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:36,134
Okay.

88
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:42,721
- Thank you, Michael.
- Okay.

89
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,008
Thank you so much.

90
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,837
- Stop crying. 
- Thank you

91
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:03,558
Hey.

92
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,663
About the beach-

93
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:07,944
It's okay,

94
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:09,649
we all say things without thinking.

95
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,211
Oh, no it's not that.

96
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,529
I've actually been thinking that 
for a long time.

97
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:15,012
And I'm glad I said it.

98
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:17,537
I just- I'm sorry 
if it made you feel weird.

99
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:22,188
Okay.

100
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:25,943
Pam is kind of a bitch.

101
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:30,061
Hey, what if we leave tonight?

102
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:32,652
Grab a bite, get a hotel room,

103
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:33,913
enjoy the city a little bit.

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,049
I just have so much paperwork to do.

105
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,643
Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.

106
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,302
So I was wondering if Karen and I 
could get off a few hours early

107
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:50,862
'Cause we want to 
spend the night in the city.

108
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:52,240
Why, so you could do it?

109
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:56,481
No, well- I was thinking that uh-

110
00:04:56,481 --> 00:05:00,865
Actually, we could all leave 
tomorrow and do a convoy, you know?

111
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,361
Convoys are really fun.

112
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,020
Pull up next to each other.

113
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:06,827
Give each other the finger.

114
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,766
Moon each other.

115
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:10,678
We're gonna go tonight,

116
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,107
But we're gonna see you there 
tomorrow morning, right?

117
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:12,570
Alright.

118
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,541
Alright. Your loss.

119
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,501
Wait, how would you moon us 
if you were driving?

120
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:17,621
Cruise control.

121
00:05:19,164 --> 00:05:20,709
So Jim,

122
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:21,988
Who do you think is hotter?

123
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,175
Pam or Karen?

124
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:25,791
Yeah, I'm not going to 
talk about this now.

125
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,910
Pam is taller.

126
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,970
You sure?

127
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,860
Yes.

128
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,656
She has bigger breasts too.

129
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:35,202
I think Karen has 
a prettier face.

130
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:39,669
What else?

131
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:43,848
I mean Pam's face is 
really pretty too.

132
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,008
It's a very tough call.

133
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:48,604
Really tough call.

134
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:50,527
You know what?

135
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:53,483
Why don't you take the rest 
of the day to figure it out,

136
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,359
and then come back 
and tell me what you got.

137
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:58,585
- Will do.
- Alright.

138
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,346
Hey, Pam.

139
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,545
I've been meaning to 
say something to you.

140
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,448
I really miss our friendship.

141
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:11,354
It's very funny.

142
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,280
I've never heard you talk that much.

143
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,879
I thought it was Kelly.

144
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:16,906
Are you kidding? 
I would have never done that.

145
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:19,039
It was patheticville. 
No offense, Pam.

146
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,440
You know what? 
Don't even worry about it.

147
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,468
Everyone was so drunk,

148
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:24,301
I bet no one even remembers 
what you said.

149
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,525
I remember.

150
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:26,721
I blogged the whole thing.

151
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:32,840
www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts.

152
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:34,222
Check it out.

153
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:37,761
Last year Creed asked me 
how to set up a blog.

154
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:43,591
Wanting to protect the world 
from being exposed to Creed's brain

155
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:46,534
I opened up a Word document 
on his computer and

156
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:48,237
put an address at the top.

157
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:49,952
I've read some of it.

158
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:54,794
Even for the internet, 
it's pretty shocking.

159
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,813
There they are.

160
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:58,077
The Accounting Department.

161
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:01,613
I shall miss your humility 
and your promptly printed checks.

162
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:05,306
Do you think it's gonna to be weird 
working with Jan in New York?

163
00:07:05,306 --> 00:07:06,239
No. Not at all.

164
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,978
I haven't talked to Jan 
since we broke up.

165
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,183
And I think if she had something 
to say she would have called me.

166
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,073
Maybe you should talk to her, before...

167
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:15,211
No, no, no. You know what?

168
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:16,998
It's a done deal.

169
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,993
I basically have the job already.

170
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:20,639
There's nothing 
she can do to stop it now.

171
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:22,710
I already sold my condo.

172
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,045
Michael... / What? / Why?

173
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:25,748
I'm sorry. 
That just doesn't make sense.

174
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:28,374
- Yes, I- 
- What? Who gave you that advice?

175
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:30,297
Yeah, Michael you should 
never sell your condo...

176
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:31,879
I have to buy another place.

177
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,575
- But you said you were in debt. 
- You're not sure that you have the job.

178
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:36,768
I sold it on eBay.

179
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,316
The buyer was 
very motivated, as was I.

180
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:41,824
It went for eighty percent of 
what I paid.

181
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:43,656
Sold in record time.

182
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:46,043
How would you like to 
spend the night with

183
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:49,123
the Regional Manager of 
Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?

184
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:50,732
No Dwight.

185
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:53,724
I don't care if that is how 
they consolidated power in ancient Rome.

186
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,578
No, no, not, not, Michael.

187
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:56,624
Me.

188
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:59,261
I'm taking his job.

189
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,402
Not now.

190
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:10,159
Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.

191
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,150
Jim, Jim, Jim.

192
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:21,637
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

193
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:24,146
Oh, hey, Dwight.

194
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:27,190
I am gonna be your new boss.

195
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,584
It's my greatest dream come true.

196
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,607
Welcome to the Hotel Hell.

197
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:35,774
Check in time is now, check out time is never.

198
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:38,168
- Does my room have cable?
- No.

199
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:40,454
And the sheets are made of fire.

200
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:42,011
Can I change rooms?

201
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:43,652
Sorry we're all booked up.

202
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:45,850
Hell convention in town.

203
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,172
Can I have a late checkout?

204
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,196
I'll have to talk to the manager.

205
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,019
You're not the manager 
even in your own fantasy?

206
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:54,372
I'm the owner.

207
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,688
The co-owner with Satan!

208
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,658
Okay, just so I understand it.

209
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:04,481
In your wildest fantasy, 
you are in Hell

210
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:08,948
and you are co-running 
a bed and breakfast with the devil?

211
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,285
Yeah, but I haven't 
told you my salary yet.

212
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:12,115
Go.

213
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:16,012
80,000 dollars a year.

214
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:17,560
Once I'm officially 
Regional Manager,

215
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,135
my first order of business 
will be to demote Jim Halpert.

216
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,460
So I will need a new number two.

217
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:25,535
My ideal choice?

218
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,519
Jack Bauer.

219
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:30,145
But he is unavailable.

220
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:31,612
Fictional.

221
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:33,562
And overqualified.

222
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,490
I will see you at the interview.

223
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:43,654
Yes you will.

224
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,685
Who is D. Abramson?

225
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:47,538
He's from that company in Pittsburgh...

226
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:48,269
Michael.

227
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:49,412
Why-

228
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:52,007
are you here?

229
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,566
How are you?

230
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:58,710
I'm good. How are you, Janet?

231
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,398
- It's good to see you. 
- I'm- I'm great.

232
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,014
Can we- can we talk

233
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:09,999
privately for a minute?

234
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,986
Why privately?

235
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:16,791
I just- I uh- I don't uh-

236
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,084
I- I don't- I don't like 
the way that we left things.

237
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:21,405
Okay, sure, fine.

238
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:22,277
Why don't you wait in my office?

239
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:25,216
I have some important 
business matters to take care of.

240
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,897
- Okay. 
- Okay.

241
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:34,792
Pam, Defcon 10.

242
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:38,691
- Houston, we have a problem. 
- What do you want me to do?

243
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:41,384
I may need some 
immediate assistance.

244
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:45,901
If you would slowly and quietly 
gather the ladies in the conference room.

245
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,420
Phyllis, Angela, Karen.

246
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,827
- What about Meredith?
- No.

247
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,862
She's an alternate.

248
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:54,237
- So, how you been? 
- I've been good.

249
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,917
- Good.  
- Good. Yeah.

250
00:10:57,044 --> 00:10:58,744
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly.

251
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:02,116
I- I tried calling, 
but I kept getting voice mail.

252
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:03,164
Weird.

253
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,434
Yeah, I didn't get 
both of your messages.

254
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:12,312
So- Michael needs us 
in the conference room.

255
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:13,305
‘Cause of Jan again?

256
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:16,108
Hey, uh- before I leave tonight,

257
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,501
would you mind making a half a dozen 
copies of Jim's and my sales reports

258
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:20,776
for our interviews tomorrow?

259
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:22,066
- Sure.
- Thanks.

260
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,765
I really hope you get the job.

261
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:26,151
Thanks.

262
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:32,021
After you ended everything with us,

263
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,847
I went on a vacation.

264
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:36,623
To kinda clear my mind.

265
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:38,082
Sound good. Sounds fun.

266
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:40,168
It was. Yeah, it was good.

267
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,251
I think I- just-

268
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,562
get right to the point, you know?

269
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,695
I- I feel good about myself for the 
first time in a really long time, and-

270
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:56,243
I've made some big changes in my life and-

271
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:58,789
I miss you.

272
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,787
I want us to get back together.

273
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,743
Would you excuse me for a second?

274
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:13,986
Defcon 20.

275
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:17,565
She wants to get back together.

276
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:18,694
What are you gonna do?

277
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,385
I don't know. That's why you're here.

278
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,496
- Help me, please.
- Would you want to get back together with her?

279
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:25,315
No, no. What do I do?

280
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,234
Just don't get back together with her.

281
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,438
What if she makes me?

282
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:30,313
How can she make you 
get back together with her?

283
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:32,910
She made me do a lot of things 
I didn't wanna do.

284
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:35,011
This was a terrible relationship.

285
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:36,861
You were not happy 
when you were with her.

286
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:37,623
I wasn't.

287
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,144
You're so much happier now.

288
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:42,000
Just go in there and be strong.

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,685
You're right.

290
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,596
You're absolutely right.

291
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,227
I need to go in there 
and tell her that we can't be together.

292
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:48,018
Right.

293
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:50,296
Do it.

294
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:52,012
I'm in a very good place right now.

295
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,200
Thank you.

296
00:12:57,547 --> 00:12:59,731
Okay. Jan.

297
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:03,199
We need to talk.

298
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:11,883
Jan is in a different place right now.

299
00:13:11,883 --> 00:13:16,431
And it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances.

300
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:18,825
So I am going to hear her out.

301
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:25,480
Oh my God.

302
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:30,980
Huge!

303
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,922
Yeah, bigger actually.

304
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:34,031
That's crazy!

305
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:40,665
Oh, my God. Can you believe that?

306
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:42,165
Unbelievable.

307
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,778
- She could put the cup right there. 
- I know.

308
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:46,893
No, it's fine.

309
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:49,436
I'm sure it must've been weird for Jim

310
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:51,505
when Roy and I were 
joking around-

311
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:53,672
that one time.

312
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,483
I would never do that.

313
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,043
Waste of money.

314
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:01,171
In my experience,

315
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:04,072
guys are way more attracted 
to the back of you than the front.

316
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:06,442
I love fake boobs.

317
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,121
Often times, 
you find them on strippers.

318
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:11,105
I find it offensive.

319
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:12,635
Au naturale, baby.

320
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:13,860
That's how I like'em.

321
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,033
Swing low, sweet chariots.

322
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,879
So...

323
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:20,459
There are a lot of things that 
I would like to do differently / Yeah.

324
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,959
I feel like when we first got together,

325
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,942
that I had a problem
with my priorities.

326
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,029
First got priorities.

327
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,408
And if we could talk about a way 
to approach a possible reconciliation...

328
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:31,293
Let's get back together.

329
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:36,071
No, no, no, no, no.

330
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,829
I'll tell you this, 
it is not because of the boob job.

331
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:39,984
Excuse me,

332
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:41,185
boob enhancement.

333
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:42,482
That would be shallow.

334
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:43,994
And this is the opposite of shallow.

335
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,866
This is emotionally magnificent.

336
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,171
Okay, everyone, listen up!

337
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:51,654
Time to begin the interview process

338
00:14:54,388 --> 00:14:55,598
Andrew Bernard.

339
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:57,852
Saving the best for first.

340
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,550
Alright, you guys. See you later, wish us luck!

341
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,708
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck.

342
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,423
All luck must be wished unto Michael.

343
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,801
- Good luck, you guys! 
- What did I say!?

344
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:09,567
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

345
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,483
I'm happy for him.

346
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,879
I hope he gets the job.

347
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,861
I really just want him to be happy.

348
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:21,846
And I know that sounds cliche.

349
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:25,216
And I know saying it 
sounds cliche, sounds cliche.

350
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:28,640
Maybe I'm being cliche. 
I don't care.

351
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:30,695
Because I am what I am.

352
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,401
That's Popeye.

353
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:37,749
I am going to begin this process 
with a simple test of

354
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:40,408
intelligence and mental dexterity.

355
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:42,909
What is the best color?

356
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:43,794
White,

357
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,461
because it contains all other colors.

358
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:48,602
Wrong. Black.
It is the most dominant.

359
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:49,998
How do you make a table?

360
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:51,817
You make a chair,

361
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,322
but you don't sit on it.

362
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:54,707
What is the capital of Maine?

363
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:57,478
The capital of Maine is 
Montpelier, Vermont,

364
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,538
which is near Ithaca, New York,

365
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:00,575
where I went to Cornell.

366
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:03,895
Okay, also, 
moratorium on Cornell talk.

367
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,174
Don't wanna hear about it.

368
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,396
Forget your personal history

369
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:07,773
and learn the history 
of this company.

370
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:08,777
Should not be a problem.

371
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:11,679
I minored in history in the 
Ivy League school which I attended.

372
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,154
You're not off to 
a very good start, Bernard.

373
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:15,754
I agree.

374
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:17,909
But in another way,

375
00:16:18,706 --> 00:16:21,352
I am off to a very good start, 
wouldn't you say?

376
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:24,484
I am a great interviewee.

377
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,514
Why? Because I have 
something no one else has.

378
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:29,079
My brain.

379
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,583
which I use to my advantage,

380
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:33,780
when advantageous.

381
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:39,630
Time! No, you failed.

382
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,339
Damn it!

383
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,011
This interview is over. 
I'll let you know.

384
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:48,154
Hey, thank you so much for 
driving me down for my interview.

385
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:49,471
Totally, no problem.

386
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:51,856
What are you 
interviewing for by the way?

387
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:53,499
my assistant, or?

388
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:56,464
Oh, you know I'm gonna have 
a congratulations Karen party

389
00:16:57,212 --> 00:16:58,787
Tomorrow night at my friend's house.

390
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:00,396
Oh wow, that sounds like fun.

391
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,727
Is your friend name Karen, too?

392
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,243
What did she accomplish?

393
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:04,965
No.

394
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:06,634
I'm sorry. 
I should have been clearer.

395
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,732
It's for me.

396
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,595
'Cause I'm going to get the job.

397
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:12,924
How remarkable.

398
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:14,446
Thanks.

399
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:18,825
Wait- Wait a sec.

400
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:19,973
- Check one more time.  
- Okay.

401
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:23,826
Very good

402
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,927
Alright, well-

403
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:32,533
I- I have to get back.

404
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:35,523
- But I will see you in New York tomorrow, right? 
- Yes indeed.

405
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:37,066
- Good luck with your interview. 
- Thank you.

406
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,439
Bye.

407
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:49,880
So, I guess 
we're getting back together.

408
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,044
What happened?

409
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:54,267
Your advice was good, 
but Jan's was bigger.

410
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:56,811
Here's the sitch.

411
00:17:57,045 --> 00:18:01,356
Two weeks ago, I was in 
the worst relationship of my life.

412
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:03,000
She treated me poorly.

413
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:05,623
We didn't connect, 
I was miserable.

414
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:10,145
Now, I'm in the best 
relationship of my life

415
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:11,883
with the same woman.

416
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,892
Love is a mystery.

417
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:19,119
So we have all night. 
Where do you want to go first?

418
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,027
I don't know.

419
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:21,313
How about the U.N.?

420
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:23,440
How often do you come here?

421
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:26,387
Every time my sixth grade 
class has a field trip.

422
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:29,142
I think you'll really 
enjoy this, adult Jim.

423
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:36,846
Hey, everybody.

424
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:39,874
The next time you see me,

425
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:41,817
I'll be working for corporate.

426
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,523
Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute

427
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,959
will be running the branch.

428
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:49,649
So, without further ado,

429
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,746
I would like to start 
saying my goodbyes

430
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:59,678
♬ For everything you've done ♬

431
00:18:59,678 --> 00:19:03,167
♬ You know I'm bound ♬

432
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:03,794
Okay.

433
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:06,134
♬ I'm bound to thank you for it ♬

434
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:09,994
Goodnight

435
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:12,507
and good luck.

436
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:26,390
Who's ready to work?

437
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:32,464
Yeah, we went to 
the Spotted Pig for dinner.

438
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:33,844
It's in the Village.

439
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:34,703
Karen knew it.

440
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:37,375
And then we second acted Spamalot.

441
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,305
That's when you sneak in 
at intermission with all the smokers.

442
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,937
And then we went to a bar 
that used to be a church.

443
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:47,115
Oh and at this one bar, 
I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.

444
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:48,032
That wasn't him.

445
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:53,260
So what's going to happen 
to us when I get this job?

446
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,884
Oh do you mean when I get the job?

447
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:57,705
Well, if you get the job

448
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,113
then I'd move here with you.

449
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,470
Would you move with me?

450
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:05,555
I'm not stupid, okay?

451
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:06,710
I was at the beach.

452
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:09,514
We won't have a future in Scranton.

453
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:12,283
There's one too many people there.

454
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:14,809
You mean Kevin?

455
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:17,147
Exactly.

456
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:20,229
But you get it, right?

457
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,634
Can't stay there.

458
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,439
Yeah, I do.

459
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,672
Come on.

460
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:44,840
How are you guys doing? 
Need anything?

461
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:47,057
Uh- no, we're good. Thanks.

462
00:20:47,057 --> 00:20:48,801
I have been here a bunch of times.

463
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:51,173
So I know where everything is, 
know everybody's names.

464
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:53,475
If you need to know 
somebody's name, just ask me.

465
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:57,460
Who's that?

466
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:00,066
That is Beardy.

467
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,356
Beardy?

468
00:21:02,484 --> 00:21:03,335
I'm gonna introduce myself.

469
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:04,748
No, no, no, just- 
that's not his real name.

470
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:06,168
That's just what I call him, so...

471
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:10,085
I am by far the most qualified 
person they're interviewing.

472
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:13,212
Jim and Karen are here, 
which is cute.

473
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:16,847
They're like, kid actors 
tagging along with daddy

474
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:20,012
on the big audition, 
hoping to be discovered.

475
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,557
Except daddy is 
the best actor around.

476
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:26,168
Daddy is Meryl Streep.

477
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:28,551
Michael is gone.

478
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:31,228
Hail to the chief!

479
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:35,827
My first order of business?

480
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,410
Make Andrew Bernard 
my number two.

481
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,142
My first order of business?

482
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:41,318
Accept.

483
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:42,748
As if you had a choice.

484
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,331
Duh. Opportunity of a lifetime.

485
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:50,943
<i>Three months ago, I was nowhere.

486
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,263
I was just a Cornell grad, 
in anger management.

487
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:56,379
Look where I am now.

488
00:21:57,646 --> 00:21:58,534
Not bad.

489
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:05,855
Hey! Hunter! 
What's up my brother?

490
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:09,254
This is Hunter, 
secretary extraordinaire.

491
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:10,963
Uh- administrative assistant.

492
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:11,981
Jan in yet?

493
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:13,077
I think she's coming in later.

494
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:14,841
Could you give her a message 
for me, when she gets in?

495
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,365
Sure.

496
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,752
Just say,

497
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:20,671
"I want to squeeze them."

498
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:23,905
It's code. She'll 
know what it means.

499
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,238
Okay.

500
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,816
Oh, Hunter?

501
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,073
Could you tell her, also?

502
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:35,965
You showed great leadership 
potential at the coal walk.

503
00:22:35,965 --> 00:22:39,315
Even if you did follow it with that 
embarrassing personal confession.

504
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:40,914
Thank you.

505
00:22:41,271 --> 00:22:43,165
I had to make Andy my number two.

506
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:46,013
It's political, complicated, 
you wouldn't understand.

507
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:51,242
I want you to be 
Assistant Regional Manager.

508
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:52,047
Really?

509
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:54,380
Well, in a sense.

510
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,607
Although, publicly I am going to retain 
the Assistant Regional Manager position.

511
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:00,092
You will be your own assistant.

512
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:02,030
Correct, I need 
someone I can trust.

513
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,568
But I would also like the title 
to be secretly applied to you.

514
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:10,571
Just stripped of 
its pomp and frills.

515
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:12,413
Okay.

516
00:23:13,388 --> 00:23:17,154
So, you would be 
the Regional Manager,

517
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:20,049
and the Assistant 
Regional Manager.

518
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:22,190
Andy is your number two.

519
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,607
I would be the Secret
Assistant Regional Manager.

520
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:28,641
Let's call it Secret Assistant 
to the Regional Manager.

521
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:31,528
Do you accept?

522
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:34,030
Absolutely, I do.

523
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,169
I learned from Jim.

524
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,377
If Dwight ever asks you to 
accept something secret,

525
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:42,046
you reply, "Absolutely, I do."

526
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:47,563
Hello, hello!

527
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:50,289
- Michael, good to see you!
- Good to see you.

528
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:53,073
Here are the post-merger 
performance stats that you asked for.

529
00:23:53,073 --> 00:23:56,129
Great. I've been meaning 
to thank you by the way.

530
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:58,147
You didn't lose a single 
customer during the merger.

531
00:23:58,147 --> 00:23:59,556
And you still managed 
to trim the budget.

532
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:00,794
That is nice work.

533
00:24:02,784 --> 00:24:05,601
So, let me ask you a question 
right off the bat.

534
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,110
What do you think are your 
greatest strengths as a manager?

535
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,576
Why don't I tell you what 
my greatest weaknesses are?

536
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,563
I work too hard.

537
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:15,114
I care too much.

538
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:18,713
And sometimes I can be 
too invested in my job.

539
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:21,028
Okay.

540
00:24:21,937 --> 00:24:22,712
And your strengths?

541
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,107
Well, my weaknesses are 
actually strengths.

542
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:30,254
Oh. Yes. Very good.

543
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:31,685
- Thank you. 
- Very good.

544
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:33,748
Dwight is our new boss.

545
00:24:33,748 --> 00:24:35,074
Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.

546
00:24:35,988 --> 00:24:37,444
Then who do you think will get the job?

547
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:38,127
Karen.

548
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:40,674
She looks corporate.

549
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:43,306
Those little pants suits.

550
00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:44,833
I think it's gonna be Michael.

551
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,775
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?

552
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:50,415
No, but he wasn't qualified for 
the job he has now, and he got that one.

553
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:51,821
Yeah.

554
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:53,640
Listen up! Come to the 
center of the room, please.

555
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:59,326
This is a Schrute Buck.

556
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,257
When you have done 
something good,

557
00:25:02,257 --> 00:25:04,935
you will receive 
one Schrute Buck.

558
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,045
One thousand Schrute Bucks

559
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:09,507
equals an extra five 
minutes for lunch.

560
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:13,189
What is the cash value 
of a Schrute Buck?

561
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:16,216
Excellent question, Pam. 
1/100th of a cent.

562
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,172
So ten thousand of your dollars 
is worth one real dollar?

563
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:22,044
Just- zip your lid!

564
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,889
Another announcement.

565
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,651
Michael wasted an enormous amount 
of the group's time and

566
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:30,050
patience with non-work related 
ethnic celebrations and

567
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,008
parades of soft-minded 
dogoodedness.

568
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:34,325
No longer.

569
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,568
No more meetings!

570
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,567
Amen.

571
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:42,049
Instead, today I will begin my first 
lecture in a long series of lectures

572
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:44,409
designed to increase your 
knowledge on the world of paper.

573
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,464
Do we have to?

574
00:25:45,464 --> 00:25:47,027
Yes! Michael is gone.

575
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,005
There's a new sheriff 
here in these offices,

576
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:51,239
and his name is me.

577
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:53,007
Conference room!

578
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:54,341
10 seconds!

579
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:55,453
All of you!

580
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,412
I literally cannot wait until 
I see what Dwight has planned.

581
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:00,765
And I wish Jim were here.

582
00:26:03,277 --> 00:26:04,779
What do you think we 
could be doing better?

583
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,731
I've never been a big fan 
of the name Dunder-Mifflin.

584
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,460
I was thinking we could name 
the company something like,

585
00:26:11,117 --> 00:26:12,629
"Paper Great.”

586
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:14,887
“Where great paper 
is our passion.”

587
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:16,331
“We're GREAT!"

588
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:18,480
I don't know, could be good.

589
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:21,404
Or, "Super Duper Paper."

590
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:22,320
"It's super duper."

591
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:24,980
I don't know, 
something like that.

592
00:26:26,063 --> 00:26:27,120
- Okay. 
- Okay.

593
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,877
- Thanks for coming in, Michael. 
- Thank you.

594
00:26:28,877 --> 00:26:30,918
It is always a treat 
when our paths cross.

595
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:33,564
It is always a treat 
when our paths cross.

596
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:35,995
So, oh! Before I forget,

597
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,192
I wanted to let you know,

598
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:41,499
if you hadn't already heard, 
Jan and I are back together.

599
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,984
So, I may need to fill out 
one of those love documents again.

600
00:26:44,984 --> 00:26:45,860
You're back together.

601
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,568
Yes. And I am very excited about
the prospect of working under her,

602
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:50,508
or on top of her.

603
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:53,775
That's not sexual, just- 
we're all professionals.

604
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:55,712
Okay, well-

605
00:26:55,712 --> 00:26:58,415
I thought it was clear 
in the description of the position.

606
00:26:59,677 --> 00:27:02,432
The job you're applying 
for is Jan's job.

607
00:27:03,097 --> 00:27:03,700
I don't understand.

608
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,307
So, we're gonna tag team it?

609
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:07,890
No, we're letting Jan go.

610
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,568
Listen up. Let's start 
from the ground up.

611
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:16,859
Where does paper come from?

612
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:19,304
- Trees. 
- Trees!

613
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,186
And where do trees grow?

614
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,480
- Forest. 
- Soil.

615
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:28,663
Right. We have in 
front of you here,

616
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:32,030
7 different types of 
Pennsylvania top soil.

617
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:35,388
Now, what would you say-

618
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:37,847
is the most important element

619
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:40,764
in the production of above 
ground leafy growth?

620
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,579
Probably phosphorus, right?

621
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,512
Wrong! It's nitrogen!

622
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:48,763
Absorb this information.

623
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,166
Good!

624
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,485
Now, let us discuss precipitation.

625
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:57,960
Stanley? When rainfall occurs,

626
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,651
does it usually fall in a liquid, 
solid, or gaseous state?

627
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:04,522
Liquid.

628
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:05,962
Very good!

629
00:28:05,962 --> 00:28:08,698
You have earned one Schrute Buck.

630
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:09,778
I don't want it.

631
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:12,889
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!

632
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:14,118
Make it 100.

633
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:17,712
Don't you wanna 
earn Schrute Bucks?

634
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:21,973
No. In fact, I'll give you 
a billion Stanley Nickels

635
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:23,619
if you never talk to me again.

636
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,877
What's the ratio of Stanley 
Nickels to Schrute Bucks?

637
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:28,383
The same as the ratio of 
unicorns to leprechauns.

638
00:28:28,383 --> 00:28:29,816
- Okay... 
- That's it!

639
00:28:29,816 --> 00:28:31,262
- What- 
- Class is canceled, everybody out!

640
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:32,938
- No wait, what are you doing? 
- I'm punishing them.

641
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:34,433
No, no, no, wait! 
Class is not canceled.

642
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:36,854
Hey! Come on!

643
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:39,302
Let's listen to 
Dwight's presentation!

644
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,105
- What- What are you winking for? 
- Zip your lid!

645
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:47,811
So, that's... 
my basic 5 year plan.

646
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,169
And after that, who knows?

647
00:28:50,544 --> 00:28:55,926
- Okay. Uh- now, this may seem like an odd question, but... 
- Yeah?

648
00:28:55,926 --> 00:28:57,598
What do you think 
about Michael Scott?

649
00:28:58,619 --> 00:28:59,960
He's a very nice man.

650
00:29:00,745 --> 00:29:02,826
And he's very well suited 
for the job he has now.

651
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,876
This is off the record.

652
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:05,932
He would be disaster.

653
00:29:12,202 --> 00:29:13,012
Hey you!

654
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:14,553
Hey.

655
00:29:15,738 --> 00:29:17,073
How was your interview?

656
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:18,378
- Pretty good. 
- Yeah?

657
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:19,485
Could have gone better I guess.

658
00:29:21,288 --> 00:29:22,919
I'll put in a good word for you.

659
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:23,446
Cool.

660
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,006
Maybe you should do it 
sooner rather than later.

661
00:29:26,006 --> 00:29:26,404
What?

662
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:28,243
Let's just run away together.

663
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:30,129
Let's just run away to 
Jamaica and live in a bungalow.

664
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,620
You have some savings right? 
You could pay off my debts.

665
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,678
It would be fine. We'd have fun.

666
00:29:35,678 --> 00:29:37,641
What's- what's the matter?

667
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:38,917
What- what happened in there?

668
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:41,291
I can't tell you.

669
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:44,507
Tell me what?

670
00:29:51,887 --> 00:29:52,934
You son of a bitch!

671
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:55,184
Jan, this isn't the time,

672
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,596
- You're firing me?
- we're in an interview...

673
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:57,952
Where the hell do you get off?

674
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:01,704
Frankly, it's overdue.

675
00:30:01,704 --> 00:30:05,183
Your behavior in the last two years 
has been completely erratic.

676
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:06,128
Erratic?

677
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:08,532
Recently, you don't even 
show an interest in your work!

678
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:10,497
You smoke constantly 
in your office.

679
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:12,488
You spend most of the 
day online shopping.

680
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:14,959
You disappear for hours 
at a time, sometimes days.

681
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,372
Always saying you're visiting 
your sister in Scottsdale.

682
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:19,482
You go to Scranton far more 
often than you used to...

683
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:20,359
Is it because of these?

684
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,341
- Hey, whoa, Jan, not- 
- No, I wanna know. I wanna know!

685
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:26,699
Because if it is, then- then- 
then- I will see you in court!

686
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,340
It's not.

687
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,061
- No? 
- It's not.

688
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:29,343
'Cause he likes them.

689
00:30:29,343 --> 00:30:30,763
Okay? He likes them.

690
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:32,690
And- and that is- 
that is all I care about.

691
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:36,634
The time has come for you to end your 
professional relationship with this company.

692
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,455
You are clearly unstable.

693
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:40,076
- Hey! You're unstable! 
- Yeah!

694
00:30:40,783 --> 00:30:43,763
No, we're all unstable...

695
00:30:43,763 --> 00:30:47,278
Okay, you know what? 
I'm just not leaving.

696
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:48,842
Not leaving.

697
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:50,634
David, I did not tell her.

698
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:56,583
It's like staring into my soul 
when I look at this wall.

699
00:30:56,583 --> 00:31:00,585
It's like outer space without 
the stars. It's so black.

700
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:03,296
This is gonna look so awesome!

701
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,749
It's so intimidating! 
Anyone who comes in here

702
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:07,337
is gonna have to take me seriously.

703
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,393
Abandon all hope, 
you who enter here!

704
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:12,342
Totally!

705
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,345
- Bye Hunter. 
- Bye.

706
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:27,866
Good luck with your band.

707
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:31,781
- Oh, thank... 
- Don't let them change you, okay?

708
00:31:53,624 --> 00:31:55,153
So long, xxx!

709
00:31:57,796 --> 00:31:59,761
So, I am gonna 
give her a ride home.

710
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:02,630
Let me know about the job.

711
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,307
Actually, Michael,

712
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:05,484
I think we're gonna take it 
in another direction.

713
00:32:05,484 --> 00:32:07,111
Good, I'm glad we're 
on the same page.

714
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:08,735
I have a lot of ideas 
for new directions.

715
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:09,223
No.

716
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:11,441
We're not giving you the job.

717
00:32:17,298 --> 00:32:20,628
You know what? 
That is actually good

718
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:21,163
Because-

719
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,627
I don't think I could take 
my girlfriend's job.

720
00:32:26,516 --> 00:32:27,806
That's not being 
a good boyfriend.

721
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:33,628
So, I respectfully withdraw 
my name from consideration.

722
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:37,179
Do you accept my withdrawal?

723
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:38,828
- I do. 
- Good. Very good.

724
00:32:38,828 --> 00:32:40,784
I'm glad we are finally 
on the same page.

725
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:43,334
Still have my job 
in Scranton, though.

726
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,600
- Yes. 
- Good.

727
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,728
That's all I ever wanted.

728
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:47,684
These two.

729
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:49,729
Either one of them,

730
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:51,929
excellent candidates.

731
00:32:56,106 --> 00:33:02,624
Wow. That was some serious, 
hardcore, self destruction.

732
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:05,466
Yeah. Kinda feel bad 
for her though.

733
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:07,503
Don't. She's nuts.

734
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:11,019
Oh, man.

735
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:14,760
You know what? 
This might take a while.

736
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,064
You really don't have to 
stay, if you don't want.

737
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:18,002
Okay, good, because-

738
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:20,568
a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.

739
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:22,423
- And, I was gonna meet them, so... 
- Okay.

740
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:25,025
- Just call me when you're done. 
- Sure.

741
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:26,960
Good luck, Halpert.

742
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,706
Thank you.

743
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:35,120
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Grace.

744
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,111
Sure.

745
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,681
Oh, God! I mean, 
I just don't understand!

746
00:33:43,681 --> 00:33:45,406
It's just so rude, you know?

747
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:46,964
I mean the absolute 
nerve of that guy!

748
00:33:46,964 --> 00:33:49,348
I know. I know, I'm sorry 
about that. That was terrible.

749
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:51,203
Oh, just- No, actually 
I think it's good.

750
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:52,536
You know? It's fine, actually.

751
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:55,195
I do. I really think it's great 
that it happened, because,

752
00:33:55,195 --> 00:33:59,721
you know, my work has always been the thing 
that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so...

753
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:12,858
No, don't cry, 
it's gonna be okay.

754
00:34:12,858 --> 00:34:16,321
Oh, I know, I know. 
It's just- I'm sorry.

755
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:19,702
It's just these painkillers that 
I started taking since the surgery.

756
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,962
They make my moods 
totally unpredictable!

757
00:34:26,843 --> 00:34:27,827
What am I gonna do?

758
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:29,497
I don't know.

759
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:35,456
Well, I guess you could come 
and stay at my condo.

760
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,601
I think I could 
back out of the sale.

761
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:41,272
Probably get some negative 
feedback on my eBay profile.

762
00:34:41,272 --> 00:34:43,666
Live together. 
Actually, wait a minute!

763
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,553
This could be great! 
This could be perfect!

764
00:34:45,553 --> 00:34:47,738
You know, my full-time job 
could be our relationship.

765
00:34:47,738 --> 00:34:49,954
I could wear stretch pants and 
wait for you to come home at 5:15.

766
00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:52,267
It could work. This 
could work, really!

767
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,674
I'll be back!

768
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,452
And I am back!

769
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,342
How'd it go?

770
00:35:09,751 --> 00:35:13,352
No. No, Pam. I'm back!

771
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,905
For good!

772
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,024
Kevin Nealon.

773
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:20,312
Everybody, may I have 
your attention please?

774
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:26,581
It is with great honor and 
privilege that I announce to you

775
00:35:26,581 --> 00:35:30,253
that I have officially withdrawn my name 
for consideration from the corporate job.

776
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:32,834
I know, I know, I know.

777
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:35,056
"Michael, what are you 
thinking? You were a shoe in."

778
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:38,938
Well, got down there. 
I nailed the interview.

779
00:35:38,938 --> 00:35:41,354
And the strangest thing happened.

780
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:42,989
Why is my office black?

781
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:46,545
To intimidate my subordinates.

782
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,654
That's stupid.

783
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:50,109
It was Andy's idea.

784
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:51,023
You shouldn't have taken it.

785
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:53,777
Bad management.

786
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,482
Good thing I'm back.

787
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,232
Ryan, coffee.

788
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:00,451
I don't do that stuff anymore.

789
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:03,749
No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids.

790
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:06,084
So I'm back.

791
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:12,086
And I am never, 
ever going to leave.

792
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:14,932
I am going nowhere.

793
00:36:17,112 --> 00:36:21,037
This place is like the hospital

794
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:23,202
where I was born,

795
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:25,198
my house,

796
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,359
my old age home,

797
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,795
and my graveyard for my bones.

798
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:37,232
Did Karen get the job?

799
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:40,980
Back to work.

800
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,676
Still waiting on that coffee.

801
00:36:57,495 --> 00:36:58,783
Pam, hello.

802
00:36:58,783 --> 00:36:59,711
Dwight, hello.

803
00:37:00,408 --> 00:37:01,291
I wanted to thank you

804
00:37:03,977 --> 00:37:04,785
for helping me,

805
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,616
when you held the title of Secret 
Assistant to the Regional Manager.

806
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:15,498
You served the office 
with great dignity.

807
00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:25,907
No, I don't know 
what the future holds.

808
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:28,420
But, I'm optimistic.

809
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,767
And, uh- I had fun goofing 
around with Dwight today.

810
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:38,223
Jim and I are just too similar.

811
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:42,104
Maybe one day I'll 
find my own Karen.

812
00:37:43,669 --> 00:37:47,063
But- that is a- um- 
you know, not-

813
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:48,518
A man.

814
00:37:49,114 --> 00:37:49,947
A man version.

815
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:56,011
But uh- until then, 
I can hold my head up.

816
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:58,662
I'm not gay.

817
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:02,217
I don't know how I feel about 
hiring a Sixers fan.

818
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:04,159
I should leave.

819
00:38:05,362 --> 00:38:06,974
Uh, let me ask you 
a question, Jim.

820
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:08,712
- You're clearly a very bright guy. 
- Thanks.

821
00:38:08,712 --> 00:38:10,209
Always hit your 
numbers, personable,

822
00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:12,301
you make a great impression 
on everyone you meet-

823
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:13,451
I'm sorry, wait, 
so is the question

824
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:14,932
How'd I get to be so awesome?

825
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:18,769
Because, I don't have 
an answer for you.

826
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:22,759
Uh, oh, hey, do you have 
your quarterly numbers?

827
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,520
- Sorry to make you fill that thing out. 
- Oh, no, absolutely.

828
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,098
That's a HR formality.

829
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:29,148
We have this very 
irritating HR guy here.

830
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:32,387
He's probably the only person 
you're not gonna like. Kendall.

831
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:37,988
- So, first up...
- There you go.

832
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:40,212
How do you think you 
function here in New York?

833
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:43,581
What's that? Oh, great.

834
00:38:43,897 --> 00:38:45,213
You know? I just-

835
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:49,217
I really appreciate the 
buildings, and the people,

836
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:53,049
and there's just a energy 
that New York has.

837
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:57,358
Not to mention, they have 
places that are open past eight.

838
00:38:57,358 --> 00:38:58,511
So that's a bonus.

839
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,388
You've been in the Scranton 
branch a long time.

840
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:03,932
What have you liked 
most about that place?

841
00:39:07,316 --> 00:39:08,010
The friendships.

842
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:09,648
Okay.

843
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:13,941
Well, we want the person who takes 
this position to be here for the long haul.

844
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:19,123
So, long haul. Where do you 
see yourself in ten years?

845
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,475
How are your feet?

846
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,318
Medium rare. Thanks.

847
00:39:36,265 --> 00:39:38,132
The real reason that 
I went to Stamford

848
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:45,336
was because I wanted 
to be not here.

849
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,393
I know.

850
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,230
And even though I came back,

851
00:39:53,415 --> 00:39:59,704
I just, I feel like 
I've never really come back.

852
00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:08,287
Well, I wish you would.

853
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,088
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.

854
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:20,996
Just one moment, 
I'll transfer you.

855
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,925
I haven't heard anything, 
but I bet Jim got the job.

856
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:27,058
I mean, why wouldn't he?

857
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:29,461
He's totally qualified, and smart,

858
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,853
everyone loves him.

859
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:35,543
And, if he never 
comes back again,

860
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:39,817
that's okay. We're friends.

861
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:41,846
And I'm sure we'll stay friends.

862
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:44,906
We just- we never 
got the timing right.

863
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,125
You know? I shot him down, and then

864
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,254
he did the same to me, and-

865
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:53,443
But you know what? It's okay.

866
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:57,872
I'm totally fine. Everything 
is gonna be totally...

867
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,653
Pam. Sorry.

868
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:02,690
Are you free for dinner tonight?

869
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,535
Yes.

870
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:07,576
All right. Then, it's a date.

871
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,755
I'm sorry, what 
was the question?

872
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:22,739
So, I know we left the other 
day on a note of uncertainty.

873
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:24,208
But, after some more thought,

874
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:26,599
I'm very pleased to be able 
to offer you this job.

875
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:30,493
Great, I'm so glad.

876
00:41:31,386 --> 00:41:33,223
We're all very excited 
you're going to be joining us.

877
00:41:33,223 --> 00:41:35,175
It'll be nice to have 
another MBA around here.

878
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:36,316
I'm excited, too.

879
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,308
Okay. Bye.

880
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,914
- Who was that? 
- Nobody.

881
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:46,443
You and I are done.

882
00:41:46,897 --> 00:41:47,660
What?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
