1
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:07,883
- Hi!
- Hey!

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,554
So, what's the final head count
on my baby shower?

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,515
Twenty. Some work people
had things to do.

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,683
Your sisters can't make it.

5
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,561
They're not coming
to a social event...

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:23,982
...where there's no men and no booze?
That's shocking.

7
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,152
As long as my mom's here.

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:30,322
- Oh, my God. Your mother.
- My mom's not gonna be here?

9
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:35,160
Given we forgot to invite her, it'd
be a big coincidence if she was.

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,579
My God!

11
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,541
Phoebe was in charge
of the invitations.

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,460
I don't have a mother.
Often I forget...

13
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,005
Oh, give it a rest.

14
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,424
So my mother is not coming
to my baby shower?

15
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,967
No.

16
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,262
Neither is mine.

17
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,934
We'll take care of it. We'll call her.
You go home and get ready.

18
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,646
Make sure she comes.
It's important. It's my mom.

19
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,941
- I know. What's her number?
- I don't know.

20
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,152
Go. I have it in my book. Go.

21
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,703
If you're in charge of invitations,
why am I calling her?

22
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,957
Hello, Mrs. Green!
Hi, it's Monica Geller.

23
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,792
- Oh, hello, Monica.
<i>- Hi.</i>

24
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,880
It's last-minute, but we've decided
to throw an impromptu...

25
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,009
...baby shower for Rachel today.
- My daughters told me...

26
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:36,847
...when they received their impromptu
invitations a month ago.

27
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,601
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
"- For what", "dear?"

28
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,854
For not inviting me,
or for lying about it?

29
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:48,108
Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.

30
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,988
Please, please, can you come?
It starts at 4:00.

31
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,617
- Well, all right. I'll see you at 4:00.
- Thank you.

32
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,831
- Isn't it at 3:00?
- Son of a bitch!

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,209
The One With the Baby Shower

36
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,246
Hey! Wanna shoot some hoops?

37
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,543
I'm practicing for an audition
to be host of a game show.

38
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,794
- Cool!
- Great!

39
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,172
If I get it, by day,
I'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.

40
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,385
But by night, I'll be Joey Tribbiani!

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,639
You'd be perfect! That's your name!

42
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,476
The audition's soon,
and I don't understand the game.

43
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,061
Do you want help?

44
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,900
Oh, really? That'd be great.
Hey, you guys can be the contestants!

45
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,528
We can lose to junior-high girls
some other time.

46
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,866
- All right. Let's play Bamboozled!
- Bamboozled?

47
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,159
- Isn't that a cool name?
- Yeah!

48
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,997
All right. Okay.
Our first contestant is Ross Geller.

49
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,375
Tell us about yourself, Ross.

50
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:33,255
Well, I'm a paleontologist.
I live in New York.

51
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:38,344
I have a son, Ben. Hi, Ben! And...

52
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,972
I said, "a little bit."
How about you, Chandler?

53
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,185
I'm a headhunter. I hook up
out-of-work Soviet scientists...

54
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,646
...with rogue Third World nations.
Hi, Rasputin.

55
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,525
Excellent! Let's play!
Chandler, you'll go first.

56
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,528
- What is the capital of Colombia?
- Bogota.

57
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,782
It's Bogota, but close enough.

58
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:05,370
You can either pass your turn to Ross
or pick a Wicked Wango Card.

59
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,625
- What does a Wicked Wango Card do?
- I should know that.

60
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,128
Let's see. One moment, please...

61
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:19,593
Here we are. A Wicked Wango Card
determines if you go higher or lower.

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,096
Higher or lower than what?

63
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:27,601
- This is embarrassing!
- Can you believe how lame this is?

64
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:33,148
I'm sorry. I don't believe contestants
are allowed to talk to each other.

65
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,822
I told the stripper to be here at 5.
That's good, right?

66
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,369
You ordered a stripper?
That is inappropriate.

67
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,371
Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.

68
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,169
Oh, hi, Mrs. Green.
I'm so glad you could make it.

69
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:58,132
Thank you so much. We're so sorry.
We could not feel worse about it.

70
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,883
Try.

71
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,845
There's my little girl!

72
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,681
- She's still mad.
- Yeah, I know.

73
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:09,560
Isn't it great? One less
person to make small talk with.

74
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,355
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.
It doesn't bother you?

75
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:17,276
We've apologized twice.
I can't do any more than that.

76
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,195
You hate it when people
are mad at you...

77
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,490
...but you just have
to be okay with it.

78
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,994
Okay. I can do that.

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,455
- I gotta go powder my ass.
- Oh.

80
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,751
That face! Like when
you were in high school.

81
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:38,338
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you're a cheerleader in trouble.

82
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,215
Come, let's get some tea.

83
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,552
Oh, my! Look at that.
Only three weeks to go.

84
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:48,474
Did you pick a nanny? If you use your
maid, it will split her focus.

85
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,270
Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.
And I don't have a maid.

86
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,481
It's like you're a cave person.

87
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:01,320
You must get a nanny. You don't
know how overwhelming it will be.

88
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,781
When you were a baby, I had Mrs. K.

89
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,036
Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet.
She taught me Spanish.

90
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,956
I actually think
I remember some of it:

91
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,917
<i>Tu madre esta loca.</i>

92
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,630
Such a sweet woman.

93
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,799
As great as she was,
I can't afford that.

94
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,843
- Oh, Rachel!
- What?

95
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,972
I just had a great idea!
I'm gonna come live with you!

96
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,391
What? What?

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,271
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna
do this for my little girl.

98
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,900
Look at you.
You have tears in your eyes.

99
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,238
Yes, yes, I do.

100
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,366
Ross is in the lead.

101
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,869
Another question,
or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

102
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,832
The Wheel has not been
my friend tonight, Joey.

103
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,833
I'll take another question.

104
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,211
This is tough. Hold your breath.

105
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,171
It's okay. I'm ready.

106
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,299
You gotta hold your breath
until you answer.

107
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,511
This is ridiculous! He's not gonna...

108
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:15,102
Okay. What do you have a fear of if
you suffer from this phobia? Triska...

109
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,398
Holy cow. That's a big word. Tris...

110
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,026
Look at this. How do you say that?

111
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,278
- Let me see that.
- This one right here.

112
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,157
- Triskaidekaphobia.
- Fear of Triscuits!

113
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,745
- No! No. Fear of the number 13.
- Fear of Triscuits?

114
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,374
It's possible.
They have really sharp edges.

115
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,210
Chandler, you're up.

116
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,006
I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass
for a free turn.

117
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,510
- This game makes no sense!
- You're upset because you're losing.

118
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,640
Oh, come on, Ross.
I think we're all losers here.

119
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:57,102
You can either spin the Wheel
or pick a Google Card.

120
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,856
Let me think, let me think.
Oh, I don't care.

121
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,484
You must choose.

122
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:09,030
- Either. It makes no difference.
- Choose, you jackass.

123
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:13,369
- I'll take a card.
- You picked the Gimme Card!

124
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,955
- You get all of Ross' points!
- What?

125
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,375
This game is kind of fun!

126
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,670
You don't think it's crazy
you get my points...?

127
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,841
The contestants aren't supposed
to speak to each other.

128
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,514
- Why did you invite my mother?
- What?

129
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,975
She wants to move in
and help care for the baby.

130
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,562
- For how long?
- Eight weeks.

131
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:44,316
I love my mother, but, my God,
a long lunch with her is taxing.

132
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,486
I'd be honored if she wanted
to live with me.

133
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,238
She can't hear you.

134
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,074
What am I gonna do?

135
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:57,120
If you don't want her to move
in with you, just tell her.

136
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,248
You're right.
I'm about to have a baby.

137
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,627
I can say I don't want
her sleeping on my couch.

138
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,089
She'll wanna sleep in my bed.
This can't happen.

139
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,340
That is right.

140
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,510
Tell her you don't want her
to live with you.

141
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,013
Do not take no for an answer.

142
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:19,643
This is great! Now she's
gonna be mad at Rachel!

143
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,940
And I'm just gonna swoop in there and
be like the daughter she never had.

144
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:29,945
I have new respect for Chandler.

145
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:34,491
All right, everybody!
It's time to open the presents!

146
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,619
Yes! The first gift
that Rachel opens...

147
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,247
...should be from the grandmother.

148
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:46,378
Because you're the most important
person in this room! And in the world!

149
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,923
I don't have one
because I was invited late.

150
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,137
But thank you so much, dear, for
bringing that to everybody's attention.

151
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:01,727
How about you less important people?
Let's open your presents!

152
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:06,565
- It's okay that you didn't get a gift.
- I kind of did.

153
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,109
Me! Eight weeks of me.

154
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:13,113
Okay. See, Mom?
The truth is, I can do this on my own.

155
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,074
I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.

156
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,161
But you need help at the beginning.

157
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,038
I know what I'm doing.
I can handle it.

158
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,041
Really? Remember Twinkles?

159
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:28,211
He was a hamster.
I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!

160
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,715
Okay, come on, Rach.
It's present time!

161
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,885
You're the glue holding
this party together.

162
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,347
It's kind of falling apart here.

163
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,725
- Oh, look!
- Wow!

164
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,768
This is from work friends.

165
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:48,482
Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow!
Oh, I know what this is.

166
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,484
Wait a minute.

167
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,612
That can't be right.

168
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:57,450
Is that a beer bong for a baby?

169
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,744
Darling, that's a breast pump.

170
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:07,668
Did I say I was done guessing?
Okay, thank you for that.

171
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,462
Oh, wow! What's this?

172
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,091
- It's a Diaper Genie.
- It dispenses clean diapers!

173
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,343
It's where you put dirty ones.

174
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,555
Why don't you take it outside
and throw it in a dumpster?

175
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:25,769
- You're gonna do that 10 times a day?
- What, it goes 10 times a day?

176
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,480
Are we feeding this baby Indian food?

177
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,817
No, dear. That's what babies do.

178
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:36,405
Rachel, listen to your mother.
She is very smart.

179
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:42,327
What will you do with the baby
while you trot out to the garbage?

180
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,498
I don't know,
I'd leave it on the changing table?

181
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:51,712
- What? What did I do? What did I do?
- You can't leave a baby alone.

182
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,631
Of course, I know that!

183
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,675
Of course you never leave
a baby alone.

184
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,261
It would...
She wouldn't be safe.

185
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:03,640
Not as safe as she would be
with me, the baby dummy.

186
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:07,644
Opening the presents is a little
overwhelming right now.

187
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,231
I'm gonna maybe open
them all a little bit later.

188
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,942
Thank you for coming,
for the gifts...

189
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:19,573
...and this basket is beautiful.
- It's actually a bassinet.

190
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,993
Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.

191
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,543
In what film is the line:
"We don't need no stinking badges!"

192
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,670
"- Treasure of the Sierra Madre"!
- Backwards Bonus.

193
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,257
"- Madre Sierra the of Treasure"!
- Yes!

194
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,427
I'd like to go up the Ladder of Chance!

195
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,055
- Wise! How many rungs?
- Six!

196
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:48,685
- That noise can only mean one thing.
- Hungry Monkey!

197
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,897
- I'd like a Wicked Wango Card.
- It's an audio question.

198
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:56,819
Name this television theme song:

199
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:01,282
Oh, my God. I know this.
Give me a second.

200
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,534
- Tell the Time Turtle!
- Shut up!

201
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,827
- "I Dream of Jeannie"!
- Yes!

202
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,288
I'd like to spin the Wheel.

203
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,880
Oh, come on!

204
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,756
Super Speedy Speed Round.

205
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,717
- Is there a Hopping Bonus?
- Of course.

206
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,431
- Who invented bifocals?
- Franklin!

207
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,434
Which monarch ruled
Great Britain the longest?

208
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,894
Queen Victoria!

209
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:35,316
You forgot to switch legs between
questions. No Hopping Bonus!

210
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,693
Every time!

211
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,864
- Yeah. Now over to Chandler.
- I'd like a Google Card.

212
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,743
- Are you sure?
- Yes! No! Google!

213
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:52,082
Oh, my God! Congratulations, Ross!
Because, Chandler...

214
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,418
...you've been Bamboozled!
- No!

215
00:13:54,626 --> 00:14:00,006
- Yes!
- This is the best game ever!

216
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,218
You'll stay as long as I need you?

217
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,054
- Of course.
- I swear I'm not an idiot.

218
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,224
I read books on pregnancy
and giving birth.

219
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,728
I didn't think to read about what
to do when the baby comes.

220
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,606
And the baby's coming...

221
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:20,860
...and I don't know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my Diaper Genie?

222
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:24,114
Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.

223
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,534
- Where you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

224
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:32,539
Now, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

225
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,584
It is gonna be okay!

226
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,882
Worth a shot.

227
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,636
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?

228
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,348
I just Bamboozled Chandler!

229
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,770
Which is not a sexual thing.

230
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:00,901
- Well, that was a quick shower.
- Not if you were here.

231
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,903
We got good stuff.

232
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,240
We did. My mom got
us the greatest gift of all.

233
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,408
A Play-Doh Barbershop?

234
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,705
No. She's going to live
with us for eight weeks.

235
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,332
What?

236
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,336
Yes! She's gonna help us
take care of the baby!

237
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,381
You're not serious!

238
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:26,761
She's a very nice woman,
but we can't take eight weeks of her.

239
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,138
- She'll drive us crazy...
- Hi, Ross!

240
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,515
Hey, roomie!

241
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,649
Hey, I'm Ray.
I'm the producer of the show.

242
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,986
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.

243
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:48,406
This is Duncan and Erin.
They're gonna help with the audition.

244
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,619
- Right, Ray.
- Whenever you're ready.

245
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:57,374
Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Let's play Bamboozled!

246
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:02,213
Erin, first question. In hockey,
who is known as "The Great One"?

247
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,631
- Gretzky.
- Correct!

248
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,718
Want to pick a Wicked Wango Card
or spin the Wheel?

249
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:11,138
Didn't your agents give
you the revised rules?

250
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,391
We've eliminated all that.
No wheel. No cards.

251
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,560
Why?

252
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:20,898
It was too complicated.
People didn't follow it.

253
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:25,068
Complicated?! Spin the Wheel
to go up the Ladder of Chance...

254
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,572
...through the Rainbow Ring
to the Golden Monkey.

255
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,909
You yank his tail,
and you're in Paradise Pond!

256
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,786
Yeah. All that's gone.

257
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:38,039
It's a simple question-
and-answer game now.

258
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,459
Well, what's fun about that?

259
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:45,131
You expect me to host a boring game
of people answering questions?

260
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:48,092
Women in bikinis hold up the scores.

261
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,220
Let's play Bamboozled!

262
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,848
Oh, and all those dinosaur
knickknacks you have...

263
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,268
They might be better in the garage.

264
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:02,939
- Well, we don't have a garage.
- Did I say garage? I meant garbage.

265
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:09,112
You know what? Maybe it's not
absolutely vital that you live with us.

266
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,826
- Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.
- I really do. I don't know anything.

267
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,870
I'm sure that's untrue.

268
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,915
Oh, no?
Do I know anything about babies?

269
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:23,168
- No. Not a thing.
- It's frightening.

270
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,463
Even if she doesn't
know anything, I do.

271
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:30,217
I have a son. His mother
and I didn't live together.

272
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:34,930
When he was with me, I took
care of him all the time, by myself.

273
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,267
- That's true. You do have another child.
- Yeah.

274
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,226
With another woman.

275
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,772
Have you no control, Ross?

276
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,277
That's a different issue.

277
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:53,657
The point is, when the baby comes,
I will be there to feed her...

278
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,201
...and bathe her and change her.

279
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:59,705
I want to do all those things.

280
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:04,460
- You don't need me to live with you.
- Yes!

281
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,630
Yes. You're gonna be so missed.

282
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:13,135
- You'll be a great father.
- You'll be a wonderful grandma.

283
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,514
Hello? I still don't know
what the hell I'm doing!

284
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:21,018
Every first-time mother
feels that way.

285
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:27,191
You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you will.
Look, when you first came to the city...

286
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:32,696
...you were a spoiled, helpless little
girl who used Daddy's credit cards!

287
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,907
I hope you're going
somewhere with this.

288
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,910
Look at you.
You're this big executive.

289
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,830
You are very capable.

290
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,168
I have no doubt you're gonna
be an incredible mother.

291
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:49,546
- Really?
- I'm telling you.

292
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,341
Thank you.

293
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,137
All right. I'm gonna get going.

294
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,681
No, sweetheart, stay put.

295
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,978
I'll let myself out. It's like I'm
not here. Which I almost wasn't.

296
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:11,276
You're just so funny. You're so funny.
What do I do?

297
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,489
Nothing. You have apologized
to her like a million times.

298
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:18,784
And she's been nothing
but terrible to you.

299
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:24,247
You just threw her daughter a lovely,
albeit slightly boring, shower.

300
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:29,502
- And she hasn't even thanked you for it.
- You know what? You're right.

301
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,881
If you wanna say anything,
I'd tell her off.

302
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,508
Really?

303
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,262
Okay, I will.

304
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,806
Mrs. Green?

305
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,516
Mrs. Green?

306
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,603
It is rude not to say
goodbye to the host.

307
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:50,649
When someone apologizes to you,
the decent thing to do is to accept it.

308
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,068
What I did wasn't on purpose.

309
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,905
But what you're doing to me now
is plain spiteful.

310
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,449
- Spiteful?
- Right.

311
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:02,578
It's time you took a good
look in the mirror, young lady!

312
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,496
Old lady!

313
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,498
Lady!

314
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,543
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

315
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:17,051
So whenever you're ready to apologize
to me, I will forgive you. Good day.

316
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,847
I can't feel my legs!

317
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:25,518
You were fantastic!
I'm so proud of you.

318
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:29,730
- Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
- You should be.

319
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,401
- Could you get me something to drink?
- You got it!

320
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:39,448
Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry!
I apologize. If you...

321
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:44,119
Okay! I bit my tongue!

322
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:47,623
But I'm still really sorry!

323
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,672
- Okay, I'm ready.
- You sure?

324
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,801
I've done my studying,
and I know my stuff.

325
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,178
All right, then.

Rachel Green,
let's play Bamboozled!

327
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,852
How do you test
bathwater temperature?

328
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,146
- Put your elbow in it.
- Good!

329
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:15,693
- How do you let a baby nap?
- Full, dry, on its back, no loose covers.

330
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:16,943
Correct!

331
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:22,783
This is an audio question. What do
you do when a baby makes this sound:

332
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,747
Check if it's wet or hungry, burp it.

333
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:33,919
Excellent! Now do you want another
question or a Wicked Wango Card?

334
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,547
- A card! A card! I pick a card!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

335
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:42,928
You've been Bamboozled!
You're gonna be a terrible mother!

336
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:48,975
I've lost sight of why
we're doing this!

337
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,023
