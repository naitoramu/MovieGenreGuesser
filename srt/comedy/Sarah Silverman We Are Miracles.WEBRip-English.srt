1
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,480
Hey, I like your knee socks

2
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,160
They're not knee socks
They're fashion tights

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,440
It's all one... whatever
You wouldn't get it

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,520
Yeah, I do

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,560
You mean, they're all pure black up
to the thigh, sheer black up top

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,640
Yeah, that's...
that's exactly right

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,320
Yeah, I like it

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
I think it's hot

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,160
Yeah, I like it too

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,560
I've just been really into, like
wearing my thighs out lately

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,200
Like, I feel like it's sexual-ish
and super powery

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,960
You like the superpower sex, huh?

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,400
Yeah

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,160
Yes, I see why you think that's funny

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Like, in your world that's probably
really clever word play

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,760
Could you guys buzz off?
I'm trying to focus

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,360
Focus on what?
The wall?

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,440
"Focus on what?
The wall?"

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,080
That's what you sound like

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,560
No, I'm shooting a special here
for HBO, maybe you've heard of it

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,040
It's kind of a big deal

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,040
At Largo?
That's like barely 300 seats

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,680
Well, I'm actually doing it
in the littler room

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,720
The little room?
That's like 50 seats

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,800
Thirty-nine with the fire marshal
Oh, whatever

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,040
Hey, you need to call your agent

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,320
You can't be doing no
HBO special for 39 people

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,440
That's like super tiny

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,840
It's called intimate, fuck face

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,040
What's that? Pot?

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,840
It's a bunch of stuff

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Hey, tell us a joke

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,000
What do you call a car full
of Mexicans?

34
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,640
What?

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Pains in my ass...

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,120
Hole

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,280
"Please put your hands together
for Miss Sarah Silverman"

38
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,520
- Tell me I'm great
- What?

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,600
Tell me I'm great
Tell me I'm great!

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,600
You're crazy, eh

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,160
Crazy great

42
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,600
I very rarely, occasionally

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,600
obsessively watch porn on my phone

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,840
And when I do, I integrate it
into my nighttime rituals

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,920
I wash my face, I floss

46
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,480
I take a puff, then I brush

47
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,480
then I do my stretches

48
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,760
then I type in my search words

49
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Let me just say, my search words

50
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,560
are not anything
I would want to happen in real life

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,200
I don't know why they're my search
words, but they are

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,240
A great man once said
"The heart wants what it wants"

53
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,240
So, my search words are:

54
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,960
gangbang, I do not want
that to happen in real life

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,440
amateur, because I don't like seeing
like piercings and tattoos

56
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,960
It takes me out of it

57
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Cum, which I would not have thought
you had to put cum

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,760
I thought that was given in pornography

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,920
You have to put cum

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,320
If you don't, you might not get cum

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,120
If anything, I would think you'd
put non-cum if you don't want cum

62
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,560
And then there's one more
Oh, high-fives So...

63
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,360
I put my iPhone and lean it against
my water on my nightstand

64
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,040
and I think I'm maybe the only person
that watch this video

65
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,720
all the way until the end, end, end
like when the video freezes

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
It's of course a gangbang
and, you know

67
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,400
it basically ends with all the guys
cumming on the lady's face

68
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,400
And I don't know why face
was the quiet word of the day

69
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,000
All the men cum on the lady's face

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,640
And then right before the video freezes
I heard a guy say to her

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,000
"Hey, great job
I know you were sick"

72
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,160
You find humanity
in the oddest of places

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,600
So my mom was in the hospital
and I visited her

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,400
I don't need segues

75
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,160
The brain doesn't work that way

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,680
A train of thought bounces
around from thing to thing

77
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,240
But anyway, speaking of a whole
bunch of men cumming on a lady's face

78
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
my mother has been sick

79
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,680
And I visited her in the hospital
and she said, it's weird

80
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,240
You know, there was this Jewish
volunteer service that came by

81
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,200
and they were visiting
the Jewish patients, which is nice

82
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,160
but isn't that so, like, elitist?

83
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,200
Like, what are they like banana
around the non-Jewish patients?

84
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,600
Like, "None for you"

85
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,440
But my mother's last name is O'Hara
She married a John O'Hara

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,240
And she said, "They visited me
Like, how they do know I was Jewish?"

87
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,000
And we looked into it

88
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,320
and it turns out they count how
many times you press the call button

89
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,920
I had a...
have you ever had a memory

90
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,840
and you... that you haven't had
since the event happened?

91
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,760
You know what I mean?
It's so crazy

92
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,720
I had this memory of being like three

93
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,120
and I would shower with my mother
and, like, my mom's... okay

94
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,760
My mom got her water
from the shower head

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,680
like that's where she would get her
water with which to cleanse herself

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,880
That water would then
cascade down her ample bosom

97
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,440
and, like, pike off of her '70s
Jew bush...

98
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,080
That was my water

99
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,680
And that's the thing
it was a happy memory

100
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,200
I associate it with happy

101
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,880
I don't know why

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,600
Like, it was my very own curly
shower or something

103
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,240
Maybe because we didn't
need words, you know

104
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,680
It wasn't like she was, like
"You get my water from my pubes"

105
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,280
you know, it was...

106
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,120
We didn't need any of those
Like, I was...

107
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,240
I was like a native that knew you could
get water from this leaf or some things

108
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,360
Very animalistic

109
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,440
I was a bedwetter
well into my teens

110
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,840
And when you're a bedwetter

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
there's only one group of people
you can feel better than, bedshitters

112
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,920
And unfortunately,
they're hard to come by and...

113
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,760
I love this
The HBO 39

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,480
When I grew up in New Hampshire, and
there are not many Jews in New Hampshire

115
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,320
and we... we weren't really
raised with any religion

116
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,640
We were just Jewish and that
it oozed out of our pores, you know

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,080
Um, but I didn't feel so different
until maybe like around third grade

118
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,360
Kids started blaming me
for my people killing Jesus

119
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,120
I remember, like,
even then thinking like

120
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,280
"It's not like we killed Baby Jesus"

121
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,240
I mean, the man, like...

122
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,920
He had quite a run

123
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,120
He was 33

124
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,280
Thirty-three is young
If someone dies now at 33, it's terrible

125
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,800
But I mean, back then
in the olden oldie timey times

126
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,800
33 was like elderly

127
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,000
Thirty-three... dying at thirty-three
was like he had a full life, you know

128
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,200
And by the way, you're welcome

129
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,520
If we had not killed him
he wouldn't even be famous

130
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,000
You know, and nothing seems crazy
when you're used to it

131
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,360
There's so much crazy shit everywhere
We're used to it

132
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,720
And everything seems crazy
when you're not used to it

133
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,280
That's why so many comics
make fun of scientology, right?

134
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,760
Because like...

135
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,720
Well because it's
a bat shit crazy religion but...

136
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,080
It's no more bat shit crazy
than like every single religion

137
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
It's just new, you know

138
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,560
Christianity is super old
but it's fucking crazy

139
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,000
I mean, it's...
You're born a sinner

140
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,440
By being born, you are a sinner
and you're going to hell

141
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,200
but you can just apologize
and then you can go to heaven

142
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,000
No big deal

143
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,600
If you're a murderer, same thing
you just apologize and go to heaven

144
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,760
You can be Hitler
and go to confession and say

145
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,240
"Forgive me, Father
I killed six million Jews"

146
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,920
and the priest would just be like
"No problems, say ten Heil Marys"

147
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
And Hitler goes to heaven

148
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,920
Hitler Goes to Heaven
is the name of my band

149
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,120
Scientology is weird
because it's new, it's...

150
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,720
It feels weird in our ear holes to hear
people worshipping a guy named Ron

151
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,360
We know Rons in our life

152
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
He had to change his name
to L. Ron

153
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,720
because there was another
Ron Hubbard in the Writer's Guild

154
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,720
That's how recent a religion it is

155
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,960
And people who follow their religion
to the letter of the law are just silly

156
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,960
I mean, I want to tell Hasidic Jews

157
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,880
"I promise you, God will not mind if you
wear a nice cotton blend in the summer"

158
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,320
You're being fucking ridiculous

159
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,840
But we live in the greatest country
in the world

160
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,480
A country where we have
freedom of religion

161
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,800
and separation of church and state

162
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,480
only we daunt it all and nobody says
anything 'cause we're used to it

163
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,960
It says, "In God we trust"
on our money

164
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,800
It says, "In God we trust"

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,240
above the judges bench
in a courtroom, in a court of law

166
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,360
where you have to put your hand
on a Bible... the Christian Bible

167
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,080
It's not my Bible

168
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,720
I mean, if I... if I told the truth
it's because I tell the truth

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,680
not because I put my hand
on a book and made a wish

170
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,840
It's fucking crazy

171
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,640
That's craziness

172
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,440
And stop telling girls they can be
anything they want when they grow up

173
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,920
I think...

174
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,400
I think it's a mistake

175
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,080
Not because they can't

176
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,240
but because it would've never
occurred to them they couldn't

177
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,840
You're planting that seed
in their heads

178
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,640
It's like saying,
"Hey, when you get in the shower"

179
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,800
"I'm not gonna read your diary"

180
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,240
"Hold on...
Are you gonna read my diary?"

181
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,080
"What? Are you crazy? I just said
I'm not gonna read your diary"

182
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,520
"Get in the shower"

183
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,760
Girls grow up so fast

184
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
It's like they don't have
childhoods anymore

185
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,920
They're sexualized so early,
you know

186
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,160
I... a girlfriend of mine has a little
baby girl and I babysat to her

187
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,000
I changed her diaper,
totally shaved

188
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,200
Six months old

189
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,040
What a country!

190
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,640
That's my new catch phrase

191
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
I know that Yakov Smirnoff
said in the '80s

192
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,520
but I'm repurposing it
with a malaise

193
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,200
I just wanna shake girls, all the girls
here, I wanna just tell you

194
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,520
"You don't need
a vaginal deodorant, okay?"

195
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,440
I know it seems like a real thing

196
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,120
because there's real commercials
and for some reason, we trust that

197
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,360
That commercials mean it's real
you know

198
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,680
And there's real products on shelves

199
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,400
No, it's a made-up need
made by greedy money-addicted

200
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,200
faceless corporations preying
on a woman's greatest insecurity

201
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,720
smelly vagina

202
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,320
If you use regular soap
and water in the...

203
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,440
Use whatever you wash your asshole with
How about that?

204
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,400
Surely that's strong enough
for your disgusting vagina

205
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,200
Rinse, and if... when you get out of
the shower, there's still like something

206
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,960
like a rancidishness coming

207
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,360
go to the doctor

208
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,880
Don't spray perfume on it
That's fucking crazy

209
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,440
That's what a crazy person would do
Do you see now?

210
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,400
Are your eyes open?
Are you living a conscious life?

211
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,440
I'm lucky I don't have to worry
about that because...

212
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,640
I've been with the few men
who have told me

213
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,320
that my vagina smells like a um,
a peach...

214
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,960
A peach tree...

215
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,680
Peach tree dish
Is that a thing?

216
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,800
That joke took real acting
real life acting

217
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,680
You had the craziest reaction

218
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,520
He just... his arms were folded
and he just went like...

219
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,800
Like,
"Oh Sarah, you're incorrigible"

220
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh, I'm corrigible

221
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,960
It's not all demand
It isn't

222
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,240
It's not all corporate America
It's us too

223
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,880
We have to take responsibility too

224
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,280
We shit on ourselves
We scrutinize ourselves

225
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,840
We think that self-deprecation
is modesty, It's not

226
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,160
It's self-obsession
and there's no room for anything else

227
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,840
You think... you think Mother Theresa
walked around complaining

228
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,240
that the tops of her thighs touched?

229
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,280
I mean, they didn't
She was stick thin, fucking, bitch

230
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
But she wasn't like...

231
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,360
"Okay, this is fine, okay. But it's like
then, I clench and it's all oatmeal"

232
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,080
No, she was busy

233
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,240
She had things to do

234
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,880
You know one thing I've noticed

235
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,240
people who say the phrase
"Threw me under the bus," um, say it lot

236
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,560
You know...

237
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,960
and I don't think it's because
they get thrown under the bus a lot

238
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,120
I think it's because they...
they deflect blame a lot

239
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,720
I think it's because they look
inward not a lot

240
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,720
And I... you know,
Jesus had a great quote

241
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,280
and I know all his quotes are great

242
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,720
There's no Jesus B sides
But...

243
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,240
and I'm paraphrasing
but it's basically like...

244
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,720
"If you don't deal with your shit
your shit deals with you"

245
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,520
you know
but it had like doth in it

246
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,000
And it's so true

247
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,320
And I... I made a short list
that I think can help people

248
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,320
who don't look inward ever

249
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,440
One, if you quit being cunty

250
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,400
the whole world
will stop being against you

251
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,920
If you have terrible luck with roommates
you're the terrible roommate

252
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
It's you, doll

253
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,760
If you feel like the whole world
is judging you all the time

254
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,160
you're an alcoholic

255
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,200
I don't know why,
but specifically alcohol

256
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,120
Dear sirs, your middle-aged
pierced ear

257
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,200
tells a different story
than you think it does

258
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
To women of a certain age

259
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,520
your heartbreaking and drastic
attempts to look younger

260
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,480
are the reason your daughter
doesn't dream about her future

261
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,760
Insecurity burbles up
in all corners of us, you know

262
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,240
Either you have a chip
on your shoulder

263
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,680
You feel like people are disrespecting
you all the time

264
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,600
or you get really braggy

265
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,480
You want people to know who you know
but you like hide it by shitting on them

266
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,920
Like...

267
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,320
how many fucking videos
of a monkey smelling his assy fingers

268
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:27,920
and falling out of a tree can
Helen Mirren send me, it's like ridic

269
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,320
Look at my space work there

270
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,560
It's impressive, isn't it?

271
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,440
What does that tell you?
Blackberry

272
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,000
Guess what?
Guess what?

273
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,760
I don't even own a Blackberry

274
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,160
I shadowed someone
who does for months to do that bit

275
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
There are people that,,,
it's there survival

276
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,320
It's the way they deal with life

277
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,000
to see themselves differently

278
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,760
than the way the rest of the world
sees them, you know

279
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,600
You get the idea if these people were
one or two degrees more onto themselves

280
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,040
they fucking kill themselves

281
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,840
I consider myself one of them

282
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,680
I get out of the shower and I'm like

283
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,600
"Nice try, mirror...
Those are obviously my mom's boobs"

284
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,920
Sometimes insecurity proves you right

285
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:29,800
I mean I... when I moved to L.A.
I had an eyebrow

286
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,600
And my roommate at the time was like
"Hey, let's go make this into two"

287
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,680
"Like each eye can have one"

288
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,120
And so I went to her waxing lady

289
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,280
I had never been to like a waxing lady

290
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,480
and the lady called me in and
I'm like following her into a room

291
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,320
and she turns around and she goes

292
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
"What are we doing today?
Just the mustache?"

293
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,120
"I don't have a mustache
What?"

294
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,160
"I bleach my mustache.
That means it's invisible"

295
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,600
Bright yellow means you can't see it

296
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,120
But she did and she waxed it

297
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,800
and I remember walking out
of the door and being like...

298
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,080
I could feel the wind on it
You know?

299
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,280
What about this one?

300
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,680
Yeah, whatever

301
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,200
Like jerk off thing, right?

302
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,960
I believe that's from insecurity
"Yeah, whatever"

303
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,200
What is a guy saying
when he does what he's saying?

304
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Whatever it is we're talking about here
I don't give a shit

305
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,280
Really?

306
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,800
I think you do give a shit

307
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,800
If you didn't give a shit
wouldn't you be just be like...

308
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,160
I think you do give a shit, sir

309
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,280
What is he saying?

310
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,640
He's saying, "Whatever it is
we're talking about here"

311
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,360
"please don't think I care"

312
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,280
"Oh my God, I would die
if you thought I cared"

313
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,040
"In exchange, feel free
to know my personal jerking off style"

314
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,960
"It is so important to me
that you think"

315
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,480
"I don't care about whatever
it is we're talking about here"

316
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,160
"I'm willing to exchange that
for you knowing"

317
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,400
"that my masturbation style is that
like I don't... I don't move my hand"

318
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,040
"Like my hand is still and I, like
fuck my hand"

319
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,920
"My hand is locked"

320
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,120
"And then, like
I fuck... I pretend it's a vagina"

321
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,200
"I'm not a faggot"

322
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,720
"And I fuck my hand"

323
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,560
"I make it like she's shorter than me"

324
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,480
"Like it's lower and I have
to like scoop it in"

325
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,720
Fuck you

326
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,720
Sometimes you can say and go
"Scoop, Scoop, Scoop"

327
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,280
"But please don't think I care
oh my God, I would die"

328
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,920
Traumatic things
happened to that guy

329
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,120
Traumatic things happened
to all of you by the way

330
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,720
Traumatic things
happened to all of us

331
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,200
We just don't realize it because
there's no music informing us

332
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,200
how to feel
or what's gonna come up

333
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,640
There's no slow motion

334
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,440
It just happens in real time and then
the next moment and the next moment

335
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,560
My sister used to be babysit me
when I was three

336
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,680
And she would...
She would... okay

337
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,640
I used to think this was
a heartbreaking story about me

338
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,640
It's a heartbreaking story about
my sister Susie, because she was so...

339
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,040
she was so starved for love

340
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,560
She was so needy for love and
she would come out and she'd say

341
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,440
"Sarah, if I drink this orange juice
I'm gonna turn into a monster"

342
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,600
And I was so scared
I wish I had the foresight to say

343
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,960
"Hey, how about don't even pour
the orange juice?"

344
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,280
But I didn't, I didn't think that
far ahead, I was three

345
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,720
And I'd go "Susie, no, no"

346
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,960
Whip open the laundry nook
and put on this brown leather ski mask

347
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,840
which... why the Silverman family
needed a brown leather ski mask

348
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,480
I still do not know

349
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,040
She puts it on and she like...

350
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,520
I mean I thought I was going to die

351
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,760
I felt the feeling of I'm going
to die when I was three

352
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,400
And then this is what's
so heartbreaking

353
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,400
She'd go "I will only turn back
into Susie if you hug me"

354
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,120
"Like, I wish I had the wherewithal
to be like, Sus, you want a hug?"

355
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,000
"I'd love to hug you"

356
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,600
"Let's cut out the middleman
where I shit my pants"

357
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:09,480
But instead I'm inching towards
this monster I'm terrified of to hug it

358
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,480
Oh, God
I'm sorry

359
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,560
That's every relationship
I've ever been in, There you go

360
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,200
Breakthrough on stage, HBO Special

361
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,200
She would take the...
that threw me for a loop

362
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,480
She'd take the biggest knife out
of the kitchen drawer and be like

363
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,480
"It's so funny
Like, I could kill you right now"

364
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,120
"Isn't that funny?"

365
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,160
She gets so upset
when I bring those up

366
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,640
No, She's so sweet now

367
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,360
And she... it literally makes her cry
when I bring those up

368
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,240
but thank God, I...
She is in at HBO

369
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:53,200
But she's like this liberal, hippy
feminist rabbi that lives in Israel now

370
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,840
and she's got five kids and her oldest
daughter is going to Brandeis next year

371
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,320
which is only from Israel can going to
Brandeis be a step down in Jewy-ness

372
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,040
I don't know if your familiar
with Brandeis

373
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,360
It's not technically a Jewish school
but I think the team mascot is a nose

374
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,720
Yes
It helps you at all

375
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,040
Okay. This would be terrible
if I had just made it up

376
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,880
I didn't
This is really upsetting

377
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,040
But the University of North Carolina
did a study and what they found was...

378
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,320
that 9/11 widows give great handjobs
And I...

379
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,560
Don't shoot the messenger

380
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:46,000
I wish it wasn't true, but I am happy
for them and their new boyfriends

381
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,280
I made that up, I'm sorry
I made that up

382
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,520
I thought of it and it made me giggle
and then I got really sad

383
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,840
and then I still needed
to say it to you

384
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,880
I don't know what part of me
needs to say to you

385
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,320
that 9/11 widows give great handjobs
it's dark

386
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,960
That's something I'm gonna talk
about in therapy

387
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,280
But I wanted to say it
I needed to say it to you

388
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,520
and so I built a frame around it

389
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,920
that forced you to not be able
to blame me for saying that

390
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,360
And...
But you know what?

391
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,920
I feel like you should take some
of the blame

392
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,320
Honestly because
you decided to believe

393
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:51,520
that the University of North Carolina
spend money on a study of what?

394
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,400
Trauma-based handjobs
That's crazy

395
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,080
You're crazy
You're being crazy right now

396
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,720
Hmm, I need more rape jokes

397
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,560
I do

398
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,400
I... rape jokes are a hidden gem
in comedy

399
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,840
Let me explain

400
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,800
Rape, obviously the most
heinous crime imaginable

401
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,640
Rape jokes are great

402
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,400
No, because they make a comic
seem so edgy and so dangerous

403
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,720
And the truth is it's like the
safest area to talk about in comedy

404
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,560
because who is gonna
complain about a rape joke?

405
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,760
I mean, I would say rape victims but
they're traditionally not complainers

406
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,360
I know
That's a tasteless joke about the fact

407
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,480
that rape victims often
don't report rape

408
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,160
I mean the worst thing that could happen
really is someone comes up to you

409
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,720
after a show and it's like
"Look, I'm a victim of rape"

410
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,080
"and I just wanna say I thought that
joke was insensitive and inappropriate"

411
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,200
"and totally my fault
and I am so sorry"

412
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,240
Yeah, right?

413
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,720
Let's take that to the night back

414
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,840
My God!
I hope I don't have to say that

415
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,400
You know no woman is asking
to be raped

416
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,320
I actually do think there are some
women who are asking to be motorboated

417
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,280
I have a dog who is 19 years old
and that's true

418
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,200
And he... you know
sometimes the audience claps

419
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,520
because they're really happy for me
that I took care of a 19...

420
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,520
No, forget it now
Don't, stop

421
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,400
He has got this beautiful big blue eyes
floating over his big brown eyes

422
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,120
His breath, I've really
really thought about this

423
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,920
His breath smells like
if all the farts

424
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,760
from all the different like cultures and
nations in the world combine together

425
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,960
and then past through
my grandpa's teeth

426
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,320
And he was constipated
and it's so heartbreaking

427
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,200
You know, when a dog gets constipated
and they... you can tell

428
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,360
because their little knees
like quiver, quiver

429
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,600
And his pushing so hard
and then like something broke through

430
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,080
and his mouth made a shape
I've never seen on a dog

431
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,440
I didn't know it was possible
It was like perfect circle

432
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,960
Ohh!

433
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,880
And his little tiny rectum
was bleeding

434
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,920
and I went to take
a picture for the vet

435
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,040
The vet
is what I call Twitter

436
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,200
You know, when you take a picture
but it's video, and you don't realize it

437
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,160
It was basically a picture
but it was like a second and a half

438
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,280
and it had breath
ended with me going like, "Urg"

439
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,680
He's great now
He shits like crazy

440
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,600
Only thing that keeps him from shitting
in his pants is he doesn't wear pants

441
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,600
that's a horrible joke

442
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,000
If you do have a dog,
here's a great game

443
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,480
You're gonna love this

444
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,520
When you're having sex
lock eyes with your dog

445
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,240
And then you see
who looks away first

446
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,040
It's a fun game

447
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,640
Pussy

448
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,800
Pussy is a word... it used
to have so much power over me

449
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,840
like when I was in high school,
the word pussy...

450
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,840
it was so...
it grossed me out

451
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,320
and yet it was titillating
and I just had... it...

452
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,080
I felt like I had Christmas
lights inside me

453
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
like it just affected me so much

454
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,880
I don't even understand how
but when I was young it was like

455
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,760
if somebody said it or
if I read it somewhere or sometimes

456
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
I would write it down
and look at it

457
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,280
Now, I'm just dead inside

458
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,200
Pussy, pussy
Who cares?

459
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,600
I found a way to make pussy gross again
It's so simple

460
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,920
All you have to do is like puff out your
cheeks when you say it like, "Puhssy"

461
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,160
"Puhssy"
"Puhssy!"

462
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,040
Now, say that becomes old hat

463
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,920
You can add some elements

464
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,080
A deadness in the eyes, a lisp

465
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,840
"Puthy"

466
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,720
"Hey, man you wanna go out
and look for some puthy?"

467
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,840
"Puthy"
"Puthy"

468
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,040
You look so confused

469
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,200
You don't know how to feel just
like me when I first heard "puthy"

470
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,800
If you're drunk and throw up
on a man's penis mid-blowjob

471
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,640
you can save the moment
if you can muster a "ta-da"

472
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,800
Oh, you guys

473
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,800
this is embarrassing
This is a... this is a confession, okay?

474
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,640
Sometimes I get an orgasm
from giving a blowjob

475
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,760
is that normal?

476
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,200
Like to get an orgasm
from giving a...

477
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,760
oh, not giving a blowjob,
taking a shit

478
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,400
I... you don't understand
I'm at a show too

479
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,000
You're my show
and that joke is so fun to tell

480
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,600
because, like,
at the first juncture

481
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,080
the guys are like this
and the girls are like this

482
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,880
And then it just goes whoo!

483
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,040
It's like the wave

484
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,080
Don't forget God
can see you masturbating

485
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,040
But don't stop
He's almost there

486
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,680
I'm just kidding
There's no God

487
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,280
I believe in miracles, though
I really do

488
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,200
I mean, that... They're obviously
science-based But...

489
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,160
They're beyond my comprehension
so to me they're miracles

490
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,080
That's what miracles are

491
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,200
And we are miracles
Think about this

492
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,840
Every single person
in this room tonight, all 39

493
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,200
including me, 40 of us
there was a time in history

494
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,040
a bleep ago in the scope of history
where we were all microscopic specs

495
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,280
That was far out, right?

496
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,280
Everybody got deep

497
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,560
There was a time where you could fit
a million of me on the head of a pin

498
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,680
There was a time where
I lived in my dad's balls

499
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,000
That's the only life I knew

500
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,320
There was a time where I literally
was choking on my dad's cum

501
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,480
I was five
No, I'm just kidding

502
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,560
That's disgusting

503
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,720
Erase

504
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,880
That's not part of that joke I...

505
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,160
It's just it went in my head
and then I couldn't be alone with it

506
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,560
There was a time my dad
Donny "Schleppy" Silverman

507
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,200
who does my taxes
who I Skype with every Saturday

508
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,120
there was a time
where I literally exploded

509
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,080
out of the guy
who taught me to skeez penis hole

510
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,360
I can't believe
I was ever that thin

511
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,360
I'm an Obama person

512
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,320
Yeah

513
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,280
I like him

514
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,800
I liked Obama since before
he ran for president the first time

515
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,160
when he was a senator in Chicago
Not like I'm so smart or hoity-toity

516
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,240
I just... he was on Letterman
and I thought he was cool

517
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,080
And I remember
when he decided to run for president

518
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,640
I was like, "I'm gonna work
on that campaign" And I did

519
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,480
And because I live in Los Angeles

520
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,200
I could go to this fundraiser
out here that was just star-studded

521
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,840
Like a who's who

522
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,280
And you could walk, you know
he was just a senator at that time

523
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,680
so you could walk right up to him
and pet him and...

524
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,800
I did

525
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,840
I wanted to think of something
smart to say or a question to ask

526
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:16,280
and I was like "Senator Obama
when you were a student in Boston"

527
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,800
"did you ever encounter any racism?"

528
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,720
And I'll never forget what he said
He said...

529
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,040
he said, "I'm Kanye West"

530
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,360
I was like, "Totally
I'm Kanye West too. We all are"

531
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,360
I get it
I get it

532
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,800
We're so divided
We live in a very divided country

533
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,040
like it's crazy, you know?

534
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,240
It's not even about ideas anymore
It's not even about ideals anymore

535
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,680
It's just teams
It's just the Red Sox and the Yankees

536
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,920
It's just hatred, you know?

537
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,160
And I think whether you're liberal
or you're conservative

538
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,880
it's so important to remember that we...
All of us love our families

539
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,280
love our country
believe what we're doing is right

540
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,760
You know, maybe liberals
are a little more open-minded

541
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,240
a little more progressive

542
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,280
You know, maybe conservatives
are a little less progressive

543
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,400
a little more faggotish

544
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,760
But I pray for them

545
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,480
I do

546
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:40,000
I was just literally praying for the
billions of teeny tiny Republicans

547
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,800
that die every single year
in hookers' assholes

548
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,400
I know that some of you are thinking...
and you're right, you're right

549
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,480
Really? That's what you're gonna pick on
the Republican Party?

550
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,680
That's what you're pick...
Choosing to pick on?

551
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,120
You know, I mean, surely

552
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,920
there are Democrats
that have butt sex with prostitutes

553
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,520
You're right
You're a hundred percent right

554
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,960
There are, but Democrats
aren't trying to take my rights away

555
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,760
So, when a Democrat
gives a hooker anal warts...

556
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,200
She can then go to a clinic
and get that shit zapped

557
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,320
It's just bewildering to me
that a party

558
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,040
that is so about having big government
out of their backyard is so intent

559
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,400
on legislating my "puhssy,"
my pussy

560
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,440
Puh, pussy

561
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,680
People don't make the simplest
connections, you know?

562
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,640
I feel like I have shit here

563
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,360
I don't.
That'll be my biggest fear

564
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,920
Okay

565
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,120
Do I have anything in my teeth?
I had blueberries

566
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Yeah. People don't make
the simplest connections

567
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,440
I've... I think because we're
so close to our own lives, you know

568
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,000
but even in deep ways
but even in not deep...

569
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,840
like I used to work at a club
like a music club, kinda like this

570
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,160
And tables and I was, you know

571
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,840
I lit the candles of the tables
and put the fliers out and stuff

572
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,760
And the band that was playing
had sound check

573
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,240
and they did their sound check
and left

574
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,360
but the drummer stayed
and she was just sitting at her drums

575
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,920
watching me set up

576
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,640
And I was talking to her and I made some
stupid joke and she goes, "Pa, rum, pum"

577
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,440
I was like, "You know
that comes from drums" Right?

578
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,080
"You're sitting at drums"

579
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,200
It's like people who go
"Don't get your dog from a breeder"

580
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,960
"Get your dog from a shelter"

581
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,960
"You're a fucking asshole
if you get your dog from a breeder"

582
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,280
Okay, I agree
I got my dog from a shelter

583
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
but it's always coming from a woman

584
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,000
who's like nursing a baby
with four other kids

585
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,600
and I just wanna say like
"Get your people from a shelter"

586
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,240
You know there are human puppies
in shelters, right?

587
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,600
But people don't like people
as much as they like dogs

588
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,120
'cause they don't...

589
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,560
They don't see what they hate
in themselves

590
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,640
looking back
in a dog's eyes, you know?

591
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,280
If Africa was just all Labradoodles
dying of AIDS...

592
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,640
We would take care of it in one day

593
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,440
But I wanna have kids

594
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,240
I'm great with kids

595
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,840
I am
I have a lot of bits

596
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,880
Like little girls between like,
two and sixish

597
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,520
I like to go like this, I go

598
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,480
"I'm gonna tell you a secret,
you cannot tell anybody"

599
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,360
"I'm a princess"

600
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,000
"But I dress regular
so people treat me normal"

601
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,760
And their brains fucking explode
It's so funny

602
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,440
And then, the rest of the day

603
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,360
they're spying me like I'm a celebrity
which I know I am

604
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,520
but a lot of toddlers
don't know that

605
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,880
and it does at levels of playing film

606
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,200
Or boys or girls like toddler age
like two year olds

607
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,360
if their parents like introduce me
I like to go, "I'm your new mommy"

608
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,520
They're so into like
their mommies at that age

609
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,720
They're always like,
"No, you're not"

610
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,360
And then I go, "I'm just kidding"

611
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,800
And then just as I start to relax
I go, "I'm your real mommy"

612
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,680
That's more just fun for me

613
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,360
But I do
I want a baby

614
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,480
The thing with me is like the caveat is

615
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,720
I don't want like a 10 year old
in 10 years

616
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,080
You know what I mean?
I want a baby

617
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,800
I figured out a solution
like I think works for me

618
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,360
I'm not preaching it to anybody

619
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:37,080
but like, I think I'm gonna
adopt like terminally ill babies

620
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,080
Every six months
to two years-ish

621
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,200
I feel like there is like a blanket
of judgment in this area

622
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,560
Why?

623
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,400
Are you thinking like what kind of
person would look to adopt a dying baby?

624
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,720
I mean, I think an amazing person

625
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,800
I'm amazing

626
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,080
I have a hu...
my heart is too big

627
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,960
Like, I can't take it
My heart can't take

628
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,320
I don't like being made to feel

629
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,200
Like Pixar movies, no fucking way

630
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:27,320
Wall-E, like the idea to me
of a lonely robot and space breaks me

631
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,280
Good, bad, I don't wanna feel
I don't like it

632
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,840
Like, my mother sent me an email that
said "Elephants reunite after 20 years"

633
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,760
Delete

634
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,280
I am not even gonna read that
That will kill me

635
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,400
I'm afraid it will kill me

636
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,680
Those commercials with like a
starving kid in Africa

637
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,360
with flies buzzing around him

638
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,440
I have to remind myself like
"It's just an actor, it's just an actor"

639
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,880
I love being able to see all 39 of you
It's so cool.

640
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,480
But you know, what's amazing
is the Make a Wish Foundation

641
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,600
just to... you know, they...
if you're not familiar with what they do

642
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,080
they work with terminally ill children
and young adults

643
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,520
And what they will do is
they will grant these kids

644
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,760
any wish they dream up
except for not dying

645
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,960
Which I feel like I'm being nitpicky
'cause what they do is amazing

646
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,760
but like, I feel like that's gonna be
maybe even like 60%

647
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,120
of their number one wishes

648
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,960
I just feel like if there's
a suggestion box or something

649
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,800
I'd say, "Maybe call it like
Make another Wish"

650
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,280
You guys did a great job

651
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,320
I'm gonna reward you
with an incredible song

652
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,720
Is this in tune?

653
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,760
Are you a musician?

654
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,320
Oh, you should get a haircut

655
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,360
Let's make this real hot and sexy

656
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,800
Nothing but the best for the Largo 39

657
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,200
"If you call yourself a diva"

658
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,080
"You better be a singer"

659
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,600
"and not somebody
cutting me in line"

660
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,600
"If you call yourself a diva"

661
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,360
"you better sing a solo"

662
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,240
"and not be someone
treating me unkind"

663
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,840
"If you call yourself a diva"

664
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,640
"you better be for reels"

665
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,120
"and not some sad pathetic
kind of front"

666
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,520
"If you're selfish
and you're thoughtless"

667
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,920
"and you're broken
and you're heartless"

668
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,280
"you're probably not a diva,
you are a cunt"

669
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,680
"Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt"

670
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,960
"cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt"

671
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,720
"Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt"

672
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,160
"Cunt"

673
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:08,000
"Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt"

674
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,760
"Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt"

675
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:24,000
"Cunt, cunt"

676
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,480
"cunt"

677
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,240
Thank you so much

678
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,160
Good night

679
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,800
Hey, how did it go?

680
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,800
Oh, it was, oh...
You know

681
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,480
it's hard to say
'cause it's me and it's...

682
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,200
Comedy is so subjective, you know

683
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:55,680
But I guess if I had to say in one word
I'd describe it as like, "Game Changer"

684
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,080
Oh, that's two words,
what am I saying?

685
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,040
Mind Blowing
That's two words again, God!

686
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,760
Okay, I'm gonna have
to describe it in two words...

687
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,480
Great job, Sarah

688
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,800
Hey!

689
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:51,800
