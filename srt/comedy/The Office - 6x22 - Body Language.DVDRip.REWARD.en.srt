I was just wondering what you
had planned for Secretary's Day.

I'm going to give Erin $15.

I wanted to know what
your plans for lunch were,

00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,343
Uh-oh.

156
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,578
Well...

157
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,379
(GROANING)

158
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,452
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

159
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,359
In the foster home,
my hair was my room.

160
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,130
(PANTING)

161
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,824
(SHOUTING)

162
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,802
Okay, okay, you know what?
You know what? You know what?

163
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,465
Everybody's looking
at you right now.

164
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,409
(PANTING)

165
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,805
I'll have what
she's having.

166
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,681
Did you have a...
Did you like your lunch?

167
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,221
Did you have a good lunch?

168
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,390
Did you like that?
Did you enjoy your food?

169
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,121
It was good.
I liked my lunch.

170
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,590
(GROANING)

171
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,996
What's up?

172
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,429
Her milk is coming in.
She's getting uncomfortable.

173
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,527
Dwight, don't be gross.

174
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,435
No, no, he's right.

175
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,271
Same thing happens with my cows if
I don't tend them frequently enough.

176
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,834
You gotta milk them, or
else they'll moo like crazy.

177
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,436
That's weird,
my breast pump is missing.

178
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,038
Have you seen
my breast pump?

179
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,742
All right, this is
gonna traumatize me

180
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,877
a hell of a lot more
than you, believe me.

181
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,616
You know what, Dwight? Let me just
check the bathroom first. Okay?

182
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,488
Really? Fine.
Let your breasts explode.

183
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,391
Three squeezes
and I would drain you.

184
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,895
PAM: Mmm.

185
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,064
Meredith! MEREDITH: I
just like the way it feels.

186
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,932
PAM: What are you doing?
MEREDITH: Just relax, okay?

187
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:58,993
Relax?

188
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,402
This is like
the Cadillac of pumps.

189
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,599
Give it
back to me, now!

190
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,699
Okay. I was just
warming it up.

191
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:04,936
That's...
It's disgusting!

192
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,205
It's not a big deal.

193
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,610
It's not sterile!

194
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,375
We're both girls.
Who cares?

195
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,157
So, how was lunch?

196
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,997
Lunch was fine.

197
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,628
Was it everything that you
hoped and dreamed it might be?

198
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,430
I don't know.
It was lunch, Andy.

199
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,169
Well, I know, I'm...
That's what I'm...

200
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,003
Just wondering...
I mean...

201
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,945
Erin, I think we're
out of fax cover sheets.

202
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,281
God, Oscar, will you keep
your pants on? It's easy.

203
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,749
(MIMICKING KEVIN) My name
is Kevin. I'm an accountant.

204
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,055
You see?
I did the voice.

205
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,857
It's a little derivative.

206
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,295
But parody is
always derivative.

207
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,356
It's not organic.
Do you know what I mean?

208
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,061
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.

209
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,365
Oh, guys, I really
refuse to participate.

210
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,532
(MIMICKING KEVIN) "Michael, can
I have an advance on my paycheck,

211
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,339
"because a Mrs. Fields Cookies
just opened up at the mall!"

212
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,072
<i>Guys, why don't we leave the
parodies to the pros at MADtv?</i>

213
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:19,879
"Sorry, Gabe, but that show
hasn't been on in many cookies."

214
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,178
Okay.

215
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,681
Hey, can I have
your attention, please?

216
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,746
First of all,
thanks to everyone

217
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,124
for helping put this
awesome party together,

218
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:33,689
and a very special shout-out to the
chair of the party planning committee,

219
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,259
Miss Angela Martin.
You have outdone yourself.

220
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,829
Yeah, you know what?

221
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:42,340
I think we can all agree that
Angela's not so great, so...

222
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,104
I'm saying the exact opposite.
Angela is fantastic.

223
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,701
No, no, no.

224
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,110
ANDY: Specific shout-out.

225
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,508
Stop talking.

226
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:55,179
Okay. As some of you may know, I have a
very special connection to Secretary's Day

227
00:10:55,254 --> 00:11:00,351
in the form of that 115-pound
moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon.

228
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,890
To a lot of you she may just be the person
who brings you your fax confirmations,

229
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,898
but to me,
she is my girlfriend,

230
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:11,330
in addition to being the person
who brings me my fax confirmations.

231
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:15,431
So, I wrote
a little ditty

232
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,874
that I would like to play
for all of you right now.

233
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:25,440
<i>It's a little tune called
Secretary of Love.</i>

234
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,786
One, two, one, two, three...

235
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,116
(ALL GASPING)

236
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,588
I know about Angela.

237
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,056
I know that you
were engaged to her

238
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,183
and that you were
sleeping with her.

239
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,285
Michael told me.
Oh, God.

240
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,727
Erin, can we talk
about this in private?

241
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:42,427
I don't want it to be in
private. Is it true or is it not?

242
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,035
Yes. Who else did you sleep with?

243
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:51,600
Did you sleep with Phyllis or
Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?

244
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:52,666
PAM: No. No. No. No.

245
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,872
Did everyone know? Was I
the only one who didn't know?

246
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:55,971
Yeah. Pretty much.

247
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,071
KEVIN: Pretty much.
Yeah.

248
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,016
Who are you? I don't know you. Get away!

249
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,215
I should probably
get involved in this,

250
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:11,525
but I think my energy is better
spent on the Cookie Monster issue.

251
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,467
Erin, you know, if I had been
engaged to anybody before you,

252
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,400
I would have told you.

253
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,295
Thanks.

254
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,432
So if you need anything,
I'm right over there.

255
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,540
(MIMICKING KEVIN) "Hey, Erin, you
look delicious! I mean, beautiful."

256
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,784
Okay. Okay.
There, I heard that.

257
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,448
So, I'm sorry, Pam,
but that's it.

258
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,486
I'm going to have to suspend
you without pay for two days.

259
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,926
What? What do you mean, suspend me?

260
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,429
I think you need
to go a little easy.

261
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,829
You can't just suspend
someone from work.

262
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,699
Yeah, you're right. You know
what? You're suspended too, Jim.

263
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,633
Okay.
Fine. You too, Dwight.

264
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,109
Wait, what? I was just slow-clapping
your no-nonsense decision-making.

265
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,669
I don't want to hear it.
Suspended.

266
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,450
"C" is for suspension.

267
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:13,386
Why would that be something that you
would talk about on Secretary's Day?

268
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,758
Andy, she's not the easiest person in
the world to have a conversation with.

269
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,265
All right? And besides, who
doesn't tell their girlfriend

270
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,790
that they were engaged to someone
who works four feet away from them?

271
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,236
<i>That's like... That's... That's
like Mr. & Mrs. Smith crap.</i>

272
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,774
I was gonna tell her,
just on my own time.

273
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,243
You know what? I resent the implication
that I would keep that secret.

274
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,873
Everyone here knows that I
can't and won't keep a secret.

275
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,914
<i>ANDY: Who cares?</i>

276
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:45,089
I mean, it's not like I killed
somebody. Big deal, right?

277
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,057
This is gonna blow
over in two seconds.

278
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,560
She never asked me, so if you
think about it, it's kind of...

279
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,428
I probably should have told her, I
guess. Everybody does stupid things.

280
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,867
Psst.

281
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,961
Hey. Erin.

282
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,802
You want to talk to me,
come to my desk.

283
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,985
You embarrassed me earlier.

284
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,147
Take it up with
the chief of police.

285
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:21,522
You think I want people remembering
I had sensual relations with Andy?

286
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,390
It's the kind of thing you
wish you could have annulled.

287
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,259
I want to throw up
just thinking about it.

288
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,697
I want to throw up
just thinking about it.

289
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,200
You are throwing up
for the wrong reasons.

290
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,863
I don't think this
fax is going through.

291
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,066
Oh...

292
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,338
Is there a different... I guess
put it through again, you know?

293
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,477
Hey.

294
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,089
You know,
I was engaged before Jim.

295
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,218
Really?

296
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,126
Yeah. And he
worked here, too.

297
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,223
It was Andy,
wasn't it?

298
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,530
No, no, it wasn't Andy. It wasn't.

299
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,298
It doesn't matter.

300
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,037
It's not about
who you've been with.

301
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,542
It's about who
you end up with.

302
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:17,708
Sometimes the heart doesn't know what
it wants until it finds what it wants.

303
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,552
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

304
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,326
Thank you.

305
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,272
So I can reprimand them,
but I can't suspend them?

306
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,875
Oh, I can't do either?
Uh-huh.

TOBY: I called Tallahassee.</i>

<i>Now, he can ask you not to come in, but
he can't dock your pay. It's not legal.</i>

Very interesting.

GABE: Hey, everyone. Hi.

315
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,467
Quite an afternoon, huh?

316
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,698
Cathartic, in a way. I'm glad
that I got to share it with you.

317
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,506
Makes you think about
what's really important.

318
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:19,305
It's not about showing you're in charge
or flexing some sort of authority.

319
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,243
It's about forgiveness.

320
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,407
And, yes, I'm talking about you
three in this desk clump right here.

321
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,314
I think that if you
were to apologize to me,

322
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,649
then I would revoke
your suspension.

323
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,848
I don't think
an apology is enough.

324
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:35,690
I really think the only way for me to
learn my lesson is to take my suspension.

325
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,619
And I gotta take
this bad attitude

326
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,722
and I gotta go home
and I got to adjust it.

327
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,596
DWIGHT: Oh, come on. I hope
the suspension does that.

328
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,295
PAM: Yeah.
Prideful idiots.

329
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,739
Watch how it's done.
Gabriel, I apologize.

330
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,801
Great.

331
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,840
I kneel before you.

332
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,413
Guys, I would even take a
contrite look as an apology.

333
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:01,010
Humbly taking your hand upon
which I kiss to show my contrition.

334
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,920
Guys, to...
To err is human.

335
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,028
ERIN: Trust is the most
important thing to me.

336
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,691
Is your name
Andy Bernard?

337
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,702
What's your real name?
Lionel Frankenstein?

338
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,102
Will you stop walking
for one second?

339
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,640
That's it. There's no
other secrets, okay?

340
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:27,372
I mean, yeah, my chest
is not naturally hairless,

341
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,414
and my parents pay
my credit card bill.

342
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,813
How long were
you guys together?

343
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,078
A year.

344
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,180
A year?

345
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,388
You were together
for a year?

346
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,915
Yeah. But that's it. Now
you know everything about me.

347
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,421
I promise. And if I
think of anything else...

348
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,363
I think I have to be on
my own for a little bit.

Well, do they
still get paid?

354
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,978
It's tacky to
discuss finances.

355
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,919
It's best to pretend
that this never happened.

356
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,684
Sounds like they just got
to go home with pay.

Pathetic.
