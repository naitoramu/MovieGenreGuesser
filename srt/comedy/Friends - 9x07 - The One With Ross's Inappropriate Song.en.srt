1
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,634
And that's why,
no matter what Mommy says...

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,887
...we really were on a break.
Yes, we were.

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,892
Yes, we were.
Come here, gorgeous.

4
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:21,731
Look at you.
You are the cutest little baby ever.

5
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:25,734
You're just a little-bitty baby,
you know that? But you've got...

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,903
You've got big, beautiful eyes.

7
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:32,199
Yes, you do. And a...
And a big, round belly.

8
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,286
Big baby butt.

9
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,874
I like big butts.

10
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,391
Oh, my God, Emma.
You're laughing.

11
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,811
Oh, my God. You've never
done that before, have you?

12
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,648
You've never done that before.
Daddy made you laugh, huh?

13
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,402
Well, Daddy and Sir Mix-A-Lot.

14
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,613
What? What?
You wanna hear some more?

15
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,290
I'm a terrible father.

16
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,710

19
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,885
- What do you know about investments?
- How come?

20
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,973
I'm starting to make good money on the
show, and I should do something with it.

21
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,310
- What do you do with your money now?
- It's taped to the back of my toilet tank.

22
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,606
I didn't say that.
It's in a bank guarded by robots.

23
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,027
- Do you have any ideas?
- A guy at work got me excited...

24
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,364
...about going in on an emu farm.
That'd be kind of cool, huh?

25
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,159
Pitching in on the weekends,
helping to plant the emus.

26
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,456
Joe, emus are birds.
You raise them for meat.

27
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,958
Yeah. Right!

28
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,671
People eat birds. Bird meat.

29
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,342
Do they just fly into your mouth?
Or you go in a restaurant and say:

30
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,678
"Excuse me, I'll have
a bucket of fried bird."

31
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,973
Or maybe just a wing. Or a...

32
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,562
You should consider something
a little less risky.

33
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,189
I think real estate is
your best investment.

34
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:14,695
The Fed just lowered the rates, and the
interest on your mortgage is deductible.

35
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,239
That's right. I know some stuff.

36
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,032
Real estate, huh?

37
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,910
And you know who's selling
a great apartment? Richard!

38
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,956
And you know whose knowledge of
her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!

39
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,835
- My dad told me. They play golf together.
- Well, maybe I'll join them sometime.

40
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,672
I just hope the club doesn't
slip out of my hand...

41
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,092
...and beat the mustache
off his face.

42
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,519
Hi! You have to help me pick a dress.
I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.

43
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,564
Wow, the boyfriend's parents.
That's a big step.

44
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,569
- Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
- They'll love you. Just be yourself.

45
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,488
They live on the Upper East Side
on Park Avenue.

46
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,199
Yeah, she can't be herself.

47
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,411
Okay, so, all right, which dress?

48
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,044
- You can say neither.
- Oh, God. Neither.

49
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,548
I'm sorry. We'll take you shopping.
It'll be fine.

50
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,301
You are in such good hands,
and I am so good with meeting parents.

51
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,014
With the father, you wanna flirt a little,
but not in a gross way.

52
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,351
Just kind of like, "Mr. Pinzer, I can
see where Wallace gets his good looks."

53
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:31,897
- You went out with Wallace Pinzer?
- He took the SATs for me.

54
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:37,861
- I knew you didn't get a 1400!
- Yeah, well, duh! I mean...

55
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,572
So now, what about with Mike's mom?

56
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:45,119
Well, with the mother, just constantly
tell her how amazing her son is.

57
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,955
Take it from me. Moms love me.
Ross' mom one time actually said...

58
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,042
...I am like the daughter
that she never had.

59
00:04:55,087 --> 00:05:00,759
- She said what?
- She's like the daughter she never had.

60
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,970
Listen.

61
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,691
I just got Phoebe all dressed
to meet Mike's parents.

62
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,152
She's so nervous. It's so sweet.

63
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,445
Guess what. I made Emma laugh today.

64
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,365
You what? And I missed it...

65
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:27,202
...because I was giving a makeover
to that stupid hippie?!

66
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:32,166
Yeah, and it was like
a real little person laugh too.

67
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,125
It was like:

68
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,136
Only not creepy.

69
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:47,598
- What did you do to make her laugh?
- I...

70
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,433
Well, I sang. Actually...

71
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,187
...I rapped...

72
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,729
..."Baby Got Back."

73
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,650
You what?

74
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,196
You sang to our baby daughter...

75
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,323
...a song about a guy
who likes to have sex...

76
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,034
...with women with giant asses?

77
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,246
You know what,
if you think about it...

78
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:14,833
...it actually promotes
a healthy body image...

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,377
...because even big butts...

80
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,839
...or "juicy doubles" are...

81
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,888
Please don't take her away from me.

82
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,939
Hi, come on in.
I'm Catherine, the listing agent.

83
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,648
Hi, I'm Joey. This is Chandler.

84
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,569
So how come Richard's selling
the place? Went bankrupt?

85
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,490
Medical malpractice?
Choked on his own mustache?

86
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,828
He's buying a much bigger place.
It's got a great view of Central Park...

87
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,580
That's enough out of you.

88
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,458
Is there anything we should know
about the place?

89
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:01,130
All the appliances are included.
There's a lot of light, a new kitchen.

90
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:05,467
I think you guys would be
very happy here.

91
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,226
No, we're not together.
We're definitely not a couple.

92
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,437
- Okay. Sorry.
- That's all right.

93
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,816
Wow, you seemed
pretty insulted by that.

94
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,527
What, I'm not good enough for you?

95
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:28,199
We are not gonna have
this conversation again.

96
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,910
Look at this place.
Why am I so intimidated by this guy?

97
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,831
Pretentious art.
This huge, macho couch.

98
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,292
When we know
all he does is sit around...

99
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,128
...crying about losing Monica
to a real man.

100
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,090
- You don't think he's here, do you?
- I don't know.

101
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:50,345
It's a nice place, but I gotta say,
I don't know if I see myself living here.

102
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,431
Well, let me see.

103
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,732
Yeah, I can see it.

104
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:06,069
Look at these videos.
I mean, who does he think he is?

105
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,781
"Magnum Force", "Dirty Harry",
<i>Cool Hand Luke.</i>

106
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,616
- Oh, my God.
- What?

107
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,162
There's a tape here
with Monica's name on it.

108
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,333
A tape with a girl's name on it.
It's probably a sex tape.

109
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,002
Wait a minute.

110
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,463
This says "Monica."

111
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,967
And this is Richard's apartment.

112
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,304
Get there faster!

113
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,698
Wow. You look...

114
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,742
...like my mom.

115
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,913
I'm wearing pantyhose.

116
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,291
- Great! Come on in.
- Okay.

117
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,255
Thank you.

118
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,676
- Oh, my God. You're rich.
- No, my parents are rich.

119
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:14,305
Well, so? They gotta die someday.
Hello!

120
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,140
Mom, Dad, this is Phoebe.

121
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,100
Phoebe, these are my parents,
Theodore and Bitsy.

122
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,770
Theodore, Bitsy...

123
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,023
...what a delight.

124
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,444
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- And you.

125
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,947
Your home is lovely.

126
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,993
Thank you. I'll give you a tour later.
It's actually three floors.

127
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,036
Holy crap!

128
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:42,708
Why don't you come meet our friends.

129
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,001
Try and stop me.

130
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,839
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get your parents to like me.

131
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,717
I'm sure they will,
but you don't have to do this.

132
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,637
I want them to get to know Phoebe,
not "Phoebe."

133
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,431
- You've got it.
- All right.

134
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,558
It's hard to stop.

135
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,227
Well, come on.

136
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:05,898
Phoebe, these are our friends
Tom and Sue Engel.

137
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,693
Phoebe, come sit.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

138
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,571
- So where are you from?
- Okay.

139
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,324
Well, all right.
Originally, I'm from upstate...

140
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:20,870
...but then my mom killed herself,
and my stepdad went to prison.

141
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:25,626
So I moved to the city, where I lived in
a burned-out Buick LeSabre for a while.

142
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,961
Which was okay. That was okay.

143
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,839
Until I got hepatitis, you know...

144
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,550
...because this pimp spit
in my mouth and...

145
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,428
But I got over it.

146
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:41,600
And, anyway, now I'm
a freelance massage therapist...

147
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:46,146
...which isn't always steady money,
but at least I don't pay taxes.

148
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,823
So where does everyone summer?

149
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:05,999
- Oh, God, this is not going well.
- No, you're doing fine. Really.

150
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,753
- Why don't you go talk to my dad.
- Okay, okay, okay.

151
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,506
- Still sure about me being myself?
- Absolutely.

152
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,091
Though maybe just
a little less "pimp spit."

153
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,935
So, Theodore, I can see
where Mike gets his good looks from.

154
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,396
Well...

155
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:32,359
- You must work out all the time.
- Not all the time. I do the best I can.

156
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,945
Yeah, I bet. Look out!

157
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,823
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- I recently had surgery.

158
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,785
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'll be fine.

159
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,038
- I just should check the stitches.
- I really am sorry.

160
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,251
How could you know? Why wouldn't
you punch me in the stomach?

161
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,297
Did you just hit my dad?

162
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,551
Yes. I'm sorry. I've never met
a boyfriend's parents before.

163
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,388
But, I mean, you have met
humans before, right?

164
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,849
Why don't you go talk to my mom.

165
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:07,394
Okay, yeah, your mom.
She looks nice. I can talk to her.

166
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:12,441
You do that, and I'm gonna go check
my dad for signs of internal bleeding.

167
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,613
Bitsy? Listen, I wanted to thank you
again for having me here tonight.

168
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,990
Well, not at all.

169
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:23,786
Also, I just want you to know
what a wonderful man your son is.

170
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:28,498
- Thank you. I think so too.
- It's a testament to how he was raised.

171
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,710
Especially to you,
because he's very respectful of women.

172
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,672
- Is he really?
- He is so considerate of my feelings.

173
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,844
You know, I think you'd also like
to know that he is a very gentle lover.

174
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,683
Excuse me?

175
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,395
No, don't get me wrong.
No, not in like a sissy way.

176
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,397
When he gets going...

177
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:56,693
...he can rattle a headboard
like a sailor on leave.

178
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,823
That's... my boy.

179
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:09,873
Awesome.

180
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,422
I'm not gonna watch it.
I don't need to watch it.

181
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,384
I mean, what good could
possibly come from watching it?

182
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,804
Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.

183
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,017
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Don't judge me! I'm only human!

184
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,353
Did you take that tape?

185
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,024
I had to! Lmagine you were married
and you found a tape of your wife...

186
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,902
...in another guy's apartment. Wouldn't
you need to know what was on it?

187
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,947
I don't know. Who am I married to?

188
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,867
Some girl.

189
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,118
She hot?

190
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,707
How did she get me to settle down?

191
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,917
All right, I'm gonna watch it.

192
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,878
I mean, it's probably
not even what I think it is.

193
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:01,883
Even if it is, it can't possibly be as
bad as what I'm picturing in my head.

194
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,843
Can it?

195
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,806
See, in my experience,
if a girl says yes to being taped...

196
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:11,602
...she doesn't say no to much else,
I'll tell you.

197
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,105
- Then you have to watch it for me.
- What?

198
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:19,193
Just for a few seconds
so I can know what it is. Please?

199
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:24,155
All right, fine. But if I enjoy this,
you have only yourself to blame!

200
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:32,414
- Why am I hearing cheering?
- It's okay. It's just a football game.

201
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,377
- It's just football?
- You were all worried for nothing.

202
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,963
It's football! It's just football!

203
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,507
This is great! This is the first time
I've ever enjoyed football!

204
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,760
I think it may be customary
to get a beer!

205
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,472
What the...?

206
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:55,020
- What are you doing?
- You don't wanna see what I just saw!

207
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,147
What are you guys doing?

208
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,192
Oh, my God! Is that Richard?

209
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,783
Okay, please laugh for Mommy.
Please?

210
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,242
Please laugh for Mommy.

211
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,082
Not funny, huh?

212
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,210
Well, so is it...

213
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:22,381
...only offensive novelty rap?

214
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,426
Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.
Because Mommy can rap.

215
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,394
I can't rap.

216
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:42,317
All right, sweetheart. This is
only because I love you so much.

217
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:47,155
And I know that you're
not gonna tell anybody.

218
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,774
Emma, you're laughing! You are!

219
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:27,612
You really do like big butts, don't you?

220
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,741
You beautiful little weirdo.

221
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,662
You missed it! She was laughing!

222
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,122
It was amazing.

223
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,543
It was amazing. It was the most
beautiful, beautiful sound.

224
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:45,256
I know, isn't it?
What'd you do to get her to laugh?

225
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,594
You know, I just...
A couple of things I tried. Different...

226
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,138
Just sang a little
"The ltsy-Bitsy Spider."

227
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:57,017
You sang "Baby Got Back," didn't you?

228
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,689
Nothing else worked!
That girl is all about the ass!

229
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,360
And then it goes back to the chorus.

230
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,658
Resolve.
And that's the end of the song.

231
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,370
I realize you hadn't asked
to hear it...

232
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:20,082
...but no one had spoken
in 17 minutes.

233
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:26,213
Phoebe writes lots of songs. What was
that one you sang the other night?

234
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,090
"Pervert Parade"?

235
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:34,096
- "Ode to a Pubic Hair"?
- Stop.

236
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,185
Oh, God. Is that veal?

237
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,897
Mom, I thought I told you,
Phoebe's a vegetarian.

238
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:48,027
No, that's okay. That's okay.
I mean, I am a vegetarian...

239
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,822
...except for veal.
Yeah. No. Veal I love.

240
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:56,618
- Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.
- Any baby animals. Kittens, fish babies.

241
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,496
But, you know, especially veal.

242
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,709
You know, and this nice vein of fat
running through it.

243
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,018
Yummy.

244
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,280
So...

245
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,407
...what do you think?

246
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,830
So you stole that tape
from Richard's apartment?

247
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,834
Listen to the judgment
from the porn star!

248
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:50,589
That tape was never meant
to be seen by...

249
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:54,677
Joey, I would feel more comfortable
if this conversation were in private.

250
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:59,931
Monica, look, I don't think you and I
have any secrets anymore.

251
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,560
Not ready to joke about it yet?
See you later.

252
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,772
Why in the world would you take
this tape? And why would you watch it?

253
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,317
Because that's who I am. Okay?

254
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:14,697
I'm sure a man like Richard could see
a tape like that and not be bothered.

255
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,240
It'd just be another saucy anecdote...

256
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:21,578
...for him to share at his men's club
over brandy and mustaches.

257
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:25,666
Is all of this about you not being able
to grow a mustache?

258
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,628
This is about you and Richard.
He's clearly not over you.

259
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,631
He keeps a tape so he can
look at it whenever he wants.

260
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,552
Isn't that sad?
Can't you see how pathetic that is?

261
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,221
Don't be jealous.
You should feel bad for him.

262
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,182
Yeah, well, poor Richard, he...

263
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,560
I can grow a mustache.

264
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:50,691
This is not our problem. We have
each other. That's all that matters.

265
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:56,029
But I just keep picturing you rolling
around with him, with your...

266
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,073
...cowboy boots in the air.

267
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:03,953
Cowboy boots? I've never worn
cowboy boots in my whole life.

268
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:07,457
Good, good. Play more
because I wanna see how it ends.

269
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,629
- That's not me!
- What?

270
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,132
That's not you! Life is good again!

271
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,595
Ride 'em, cowgirl!

272
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,641
That bastard taped over me!

273
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,728
Is that a problem?

274
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:32,149
It's just so insulting.
Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!

275
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,779
I can't imagine what he sees in her.

276
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:40,532
She actually makes me miss
that pill-popping ex-wife of his.

277
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,452
Hello, dear.

278
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,914
- What's going on?
- We were just chitchatting.

279
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,834
- How's your friend?
- A little better.

280
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,631
Do you know who's moving back into
town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.

281
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,385
You remember her, Michael.
She's lovely, well-behaved and single.

282
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:04,681
- I'm not interested.
- Please, darling, let's be honest.

283
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:08,852
You can have all the sailor fun
you want with that one.

284
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,104
- But let's be real.
- All right, stop.

285
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:15,776
All Phoebe has done is try and get you
to like her. Maybe it's not clear...

286
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,486
...but she did her best.

287
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:22,616
- She's a little different than you are.
- Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.

288
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,787
So what? If I can get past that,
it shouldn't bother you.

289
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:31,167
You don't have to like her.
Just accept the fact that I do.

290
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,794
If you can't even be civil
to the woman I love...

291
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:37,840
- The woman you what?
- Yeah, the woman you what?

292
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,843
The woman I love.

293
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,766
I love you.

294
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:54,272
Something I shouldn't say for
the first time, in front of my parents...

295
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,608
...and Tom and Sue.

296
00:21:56,775 --> 00:22:02,406
Who are, by the way, the most sinfully
boring people I've ever met in my life.

297
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,869
- I love you too.
- You do?

298
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,497
How great is this?

299
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,836
Wanna get out of here?

300
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:20,590
- Mom, Dad. Thanks for dinner.
- I had a great time.

301
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:24,886
It was really top-drawer.
And here's something rich.

302
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:29,391
Thirteen bathrooms in this place,
I threw up in the coat closet.

303
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,810
Ta-ta!

304
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,789
One more time from the top!

305
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:02,383
Rachel, please!
That is so inappropriate!

306
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,223
