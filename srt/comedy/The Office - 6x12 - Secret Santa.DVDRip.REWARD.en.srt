1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:04,670
You wanted to see me?
Yeah, have a seat.

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,228
Is it serious?

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,935
Wow. Andy's
a little scared.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,137
Okay, right there.

5
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,376
Right there's the problem.

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,882
There have been reports
around the office

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,512
that you have been
talking baby talk.

8
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:22,646
Why would people
say that?

9
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:28,092
Well, I have it on good authority
that you said the following.

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,953
Can you read that
back to me?

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,055
"Andy have a boo-boo
tummy." Mmm-hmm.

12
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,766
Would you rather me say,

13
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:38,793
"Hey, guys, my irritable
bowel syndrome is flaring up."

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,102
Okay. "Crazy diarrhea
happening right now."

15
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,903
'Cause things can get
real adult real fast.

16
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,807
You are also on
record as saying,

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,108
"Wittle-ittle,
footie-wooties, num-nums,

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,082
"jammies, make boom-boom,
widiciwus, and Whode Island."

19
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,352
Do I sometimes
replace Rs with Ws?

20
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,455
Do I sometimes repeat a
word to get my point across?

21
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,583
Well, if I do,
Andy's sowwy.

22
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,651
You can't be a baby
in the office.

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,391
It makes me look
like I hire babies.

24
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:06,557
Well, if we're
complaining,

25
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,567
a lot of people think your
Elvis voice is annoying.

26
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,795
Okay. Who said that?

27
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,029
Just people.

28
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,073
For the record, I think
it's pretty fantastic.

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,165
Thank you.
Thank you a lot.

30
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,903
And for what it's worth, I
think your baby voice is tops.

31
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,969
Tank you, Mr. Elvis.

32
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,275
You're welcome, baby.

33
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,170
Dr. Tuna M.D., I have
some terrible news.

34
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,641
Wait, are you the patient
or the doctor?

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,507
The entire office
has come down

36
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,241
with a pernicious
case of the Mondays.

37
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,206
Wow. What do you put
our chances at?

38
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,477
0%.

39
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:03,352
Unless we perform an immediate
emergency morale transplant, stat!

40
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,181
Sounds risky.

41
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,590
Don't worry.
There is a surefire cure.

42
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:12,296
Employee of the Month. Every
awesome place I've worked had one.

43
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:16,959
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers,
AIG, my summer at Enron.

44
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,034
Wow. That's not such a bad idea. Great.

45
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,903
Anything else?
Nope.

46
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,137
"Frankie's Dirty Joke
of the Day."

47
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,805
There's a bunch of those.
Keep.

48
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,407
There's a bunch of sent emails
that just say "delivered."

49
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,576
Should I delete those?

50
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,120
I want to keep those
so I can see what I sent.

51
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,348
That's why you have
a sent mail folder.

52
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,480
Keep.

53
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,526
There's about three news
alerts from Nip Slip.

54
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,390
For what?
Nip Slip.

55
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,589
Okay. I don't know
how those get on there.

56
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,722
Well...

57
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,493
Must be hackers.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

58
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,694
Hey, what's up?

59
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,268
What if I told you I had
done the worst thing ever?

60
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,704
Would you still want
to be my friend?

61
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:55,968
Did you murder someone?

62
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,100
Worse than murder.

63
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,337
Oh, my God.

64
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,109
Lurk much?

65
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,313
I miss Pam.

66
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,376
I think she's okay.

67
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,115
Is that what we're
going for now? "Okay"?

68
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,885
We used to go
for "pretty good."

69
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,016
Great.

70
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,559
Hey, how do you feel
about starting

71
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,060
an Employee of
the Month program?

72
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,530
Yeah. You know what, that
actually might make me feel better.

73
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,896
I'm not in this for
the trophies, but...

74
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:21,991
You're not in it at all

75
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,933
'cause you can't be Employee
of the Month. You're a manager.

76
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,527
Well, technically
I am a co-manager

77
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,436
and I barely have
any responsibilities.

78
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,873
All right. Yeah. But I work
hard, I love this company,

79
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,411
and for those reasons I think I would
make a good Employee of the Month.

80
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,604
It would look bad. Sorry.

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,046
It would look good
on my mantle.

82
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,583
Jim's talking to
Michael right now.

83
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,516
They totally
went for our idea!

84
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,112
Yeah! Your idea.

85
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,451
My idea.

86
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,452
I just need Andy to
think it's his idea

87
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,290
so it won't get
traced back to me.

88
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,232
In approximately six hours Jim will
get a phone call from David Wallace.

89
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,132
He will be fired.

90
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,963
Hey, Pam, do you have a sec
to check over this itinerary?

91
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,163
Looks great.

92
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,143
Did you really look it over?
Felt like maybe you didn't.

93
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,337
Okay.

94
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,708
The Michael Scott Foundation
is still in existence.

95
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,650
There you are. I don't think
we have finished with my inbox.

96
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,585
What's "Scott's Tots"?

97
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,821
(LAUGHING)

98
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,321
Has it really
been 10 years?

99
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,024
(READING)

100
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,166
Michael, why did you
promise that?

101
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,503
To change lives.

102
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,443
No. Michael, why would you promise that?

103
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,104
You know...
Okay. I can't...

104
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,679
Call the school, cancel.
I can't go through with this.

105
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,650
We've already rescheduled seven times.

106
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:49,279
Michael, this is a terrible,
terrible thing you've done.

107
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,379
Well...

108
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,550
It's terrible.
Just terrible.

109
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,627
And the longer you put it
off, the worse it's gonna get.

110
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,357
I just... I fell in
love with these kids,

111
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,230
<i>and I didn't want to see them
fall victim to the system.</i>

112
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,360
<i>So I made them
a promise.</i>

113
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,337
<i>I told them that if they
graduated from high school,</i>

114
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,500
I would pay for their
college education.

115
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:13,170
I have made some empty
promises in my life,

116
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,771
but hands down, that
was the most generous.

117
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,110
Just tell me it is going
to be okay, all right?

118
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,208
No!

119
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:22,118
I'm not a bad-news person.
I bring good news,

120
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,520
like when I promised those
kids I'd pay for college.

121
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,614
(LAUGHING)

122
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,024
Okay. All right.

123
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,425
You have to tell them.

124
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,265
Would you come with me? You know,
like old times? Instead of...

125
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,871
I can print out a new
itinerary with Pam's name on it.

126
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,306
It's fine.
Erin, you're gonna go,

127
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,239
and you're gonna make sure
Michael tells the truth.

128
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,335
Oh, God. You know what?
Could this day get any worse?

129
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,009
Hey, Jimmy, what's up?

130
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,141
Not much.

131
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,380
Cool. Very cool.
I bet if you tried,

132
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,988
you could grow the best beard
of anyone in this office.

133
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,217
Thanks, Dwight.

134
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,691
That laugh is
so infectious.

135
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,024
You're creeping me out.
I'm gonna go.

136
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,326
I didn't mean any of
those things I just said.

137
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,993
And you can expect the same
thing from everyone in this office

138
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,367
if you don't nip this whole Employee
of the Month situation in the bud.

139
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,668
Make it about
the work.

140
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,606
Let me guess. You
think you should get it.

141
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,236
This encompasses
all available data.

142
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,880
Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed
sick days, participation.

143
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,712
Everyone has been assigned
a random number

144
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,415
for total fairness
and transparency.

145
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,451
Also, this should be
accompanied by a monetary prize.

146
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,221
Well, in an ideal
world... In an ideal world

147
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,023
I would have all 10
fingers on my left hand,

148
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,030
so my right hand could
just be a fist for punching.

149
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,497
Okay. If it's all
the same to you,

150
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,330
I'm just gonna take away
survival skills and self-defense.

151
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,598
I'm gonna run this
by Toby and Accounting

152
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,161
and have them
assemble the data.

153
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,140
It's okay,
I'll do it.

154
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,810
MIKELA: Mr. Scott?

155
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,042
Hey! Mikela Lasker!
How are you?

156
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,142
I'm good.

157
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,447
Good to see you.
Where's your saxophone?

This was
your idea anyway.

Correction.
It was my idea.

Okay.

Guys, I'm starting to think
Pam's not even pregnant.

321
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,907
Okay, for the record,
I am pregnant,

322
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,573
and obviously there's been
some kind of a mistake,

323
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,483
so why doesn't Jim just pick the
next highest score on the list

324
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,917
and we'll move on.

325

Yeah, okay.
That's fair.

326

Excellent idea, Pam.
Thank you.

How is that possible?

No offense, Pam, but how
the hell is that possible?

332
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,404
There must be some reasonable
explanation for this.

No.
Yes.

00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,984
No, there's
financial aid.

410

They could join
the Army or the Navy.

411
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,698
Maybe...
You're, what, like, 12?

412
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,937
The principal
told me that

413
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,705
90% of Scott's Tots are
on track to graduate,

414
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,975
and that's 35% higher
than the rest of the school,

415
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,077
so I think that if you
hadn't made that promise,

416
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,585
a lot of them
would have dropped out,

417
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,020
which is something to
think about, I think.

from this job,

421
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,272
provided the company
doesn't go out of business?

422
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,074
Well, I've always wondered what it
might be like to be an accountant.

423
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,205
Really?

424
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,646
Yes, but I'm
terrible at math.

425
