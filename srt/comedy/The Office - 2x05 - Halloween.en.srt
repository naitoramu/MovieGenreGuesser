1
00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:10,512
Happy Halloween, everyone.

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,920
Oh, that's great.

3
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:14,155
Hey. Happy Halloween.

4
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,552
Jan called.

5
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:20,234
Ohh, 'kay.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,425
I know, why she's calling.

7
00:00:24,043 --> 00:00:25,956
It's the end of the month,
and I was supposed,

8
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,192
to let somebody go by
the end of the month.

9
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:33,211
And somehow I'm supposed
to put on a costume and smile.

10
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:37,220
- Okay.
- <i>Jan Levinson's office.</i>

11
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,546
Hey, Sherri, Michael Scott returning.

12
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,970
<i>Oh, she's in a meeting.</i>

13
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:44,066
<i>She just wanted the name of
the employee you let go.</i>

14
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:45,883
Well, I'm going to wait
'till the end of the day.

15
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:48,281
Because the book said it's best
to wait until the end of the day.

16
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:50,713
<i>I just need the name of who
you're planning to let go.</i>

17
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:53,953
I don't know yet.

18
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:56,373
I will have to call her back.

19
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:58,972
<i>I know she wanted the name.</i>

20
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:01,230
- Okay, Sherri ?
- <i>Yeah ?</i>

21
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:04,151
If you were getting fired,

22
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:05,511
how would you wanna be told,

23
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:08,433
so you could still be friends
with the person firing you ?

24
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:13,042
<i>Jan wants the name as
soon as possible, Michael.</i>

25
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:14,520
- Thanks.
- <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

26
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,452
I'll call her back.

27
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:19,892
Wish I could fire Sherri.

28
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:22,543
- <i>Hey, I'm still here.</i>
- Okay. I'm sorry.

29
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:23,810
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- No ?

30
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:27,240
- Bye
-<i>Hanging up now.</i>

31

32
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:05,120
I mean you hear about
lay offs in the news.

33
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:08,981
but when you actually have to
do it yourself, it is heavy stuff

34
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,940
It's, I mean, these are people's
lives you're talking about.

35
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:16,640
- You wanted me?
- Yes.

36
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:25,141
- Paper-mâché ?
- Yes.

37
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:26,743
- Hmm.
- Yesh

38
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:31,441
Pam, I have to let
somebody go, today.

39
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:34,903
This is, uh, the hardest
thing I've ever had to do.

40
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:37,533
Why did you put it off until Halloween ?

41
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:39,743
Because it's very scary stuff.

42
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:42,070
I think it's gonna put a
damper on the party a little.

43
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:44,893
You're worried about the party ?
There's a man's life at stake here.

44
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,313
- So it's a man ?
- No.

45
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:49,883
Or a woman. A human life.

46
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:53,270
If you had to guess,
ho it would be, based on,

47
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,171
their job performance ?

48
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:59,070
And who do you think deserved
to be fired? Who would that be?

49
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,270
I just answer the phone.

50
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,843
And, sometimes you just
let it go to voicemail.

51
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,980
Your costume, is fantastic.

52
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:19,552
I know. I sent away for
it in July from a catalog.

53
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:23,443
Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't.

54
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:25,670
Aah !

55
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:28,740
- Okay.
- Oh, man.

56
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,503
Okay, I have to fire somebody.

57
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:38,272
What is that ?
What are you supposed to be ?

58
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:42,130
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim.

59
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:45,682
'Cause you can have me either way.
Plain white Jim, or three-hole punch.

60
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,180
- That's great.
- Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,003
Yeah, well, look, what about me ?

62
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:56,011
What are you ? A monk ?

63
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,070
I am Sith Lord.

64
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:03,333
Big deal.

65
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:06,223
Three round pieces of
paper taped to his shirt.

66
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:10,001
This cost me $129.

67
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,351
Ass.

68
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:17,982
Hey, you guys excited about the party ?

69
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:20,242
- It's going to be fun.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:22,801
Oh, looks at you.

71
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:26,333
Showing your colors.
Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.

72
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,903
- What are you implying ?
- All good.

73
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:30,392
Happy Halloween.

74
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:33,353
What  happened to all those
spooky decorations that we had ?

75
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,071
- The cobwebs and such?
- You know, I don't know.

76
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:37,722
We put them all up last night.

77
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:43,653
Well, you know what ?
Go buy some more.

78
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:45,421
I'll approve the overages.

79
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,590
- Sound good ?
- Yeah.

80
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:48,200
Good.

81
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,980
Oh, yeah, also, about budget stuff.

82
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:54,483
I going to need you to find, like

83
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,443
a full employee salary,
plus benefits, like fifty grand.

84
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,313
I'm going to need you to find
50 grand in the numbers.

85
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,311
- But we don't keep two sets of books.
- Well, that's not what I'm saying

86
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,891
Just, you know, find it.
Pretend that your jobs depend on it.

87
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:18,690
Interesting take on Dorothy.

88
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,552
I love it.
Hey, you know what would even be better?

89
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:23,571
- Soccer ball and cleats.
- Why is that ?

90
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,742
Bend It Like Beckham.

91
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:28,291
Oh, like the movie about the
Indian girl who plays soccer?

92
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,353
Yeah.

93
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,522
That would be perfect.

94
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:35,310
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that.

95
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,722
I don't really play soccer or anything.

96
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:40,442
Well, I don't really have two heads, so

97
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:43,090
Wait, what are you again ? Oh, right.

98
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:45,482
Three hole PUNCH !

99
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:51,183
- Okay, greatest strength.
- Okay, okay.

100
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:55,221
- A dog like obedience to authority.
- Nice.

101
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,613
- But that doesn't sound good.
- Okay, okay.

102
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,511
How 'bout, the ultimate team player ?

103
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:04,790
Dwight is special.

104
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:08,480
But, I don't believe his talents
are being used in this office.

105
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:14,810
So Pam and I have put his resume
on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List.

106
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:18,921
We're really interested most in
jobs that take Dwight out of state.

107
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:22,372
Preferably Alaska, or India.

108
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:23,923
He's a gun nut.

109
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,503
He sticks to his guns.

110
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:30,333
Well,  I looked through all the budgets.

111
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:32,150
- And there is one department...
- Yes ?

112
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:33,790
That has three people...
Yeah ?

113
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:36,260
...doing the work,
that could be done by two.

114
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,241
This is great.

115
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:41,940
Oh.

116
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,921
Yeah.

117
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:46,093
Oh.

118
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,370
- Who do you think it should be?
- Jim.

119
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:49,650
- Definitely.
- No, Jim brings in money.

120
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:51,372
Phyllis.

121
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:55,073
Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith.

122
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:57,742
Kevin. Angela.

123
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,550
It's not a popularity contest.

124
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:02,650
Although it does make sense
to fire the least popular.

125
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:05,593
Because, it has the least
effect on morale.

126
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:09,151
One of the warehouse guys. 

127
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:11,093
What ?

128
00:07:11,685 --> 00:07:13,771
There was someone left off that list?

129
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:16,350
Who is he saying?

130
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,641
You're right, I didn't
even think of him.

131
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:21,370
No, Michael.

132
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:25,151
- Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
- No, not me.

133
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:27,562
- Yeah I could.
-  Not Dwight

134
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:30,961
- I'm not saying that's what he said.
- I know that's what he said.

135
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:32,872
What ?

136
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:35,132
Tell  him, not Dwight.

137
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:37,460
That is not a very nice thing to say about him.

138
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:39,501
- Tell him to stop.
- Are you kidding?

139
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:42,293
- Quiet you.
- I agree. He'd land on his feet.

140
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:44,480
Make him be quiet.

141
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:49,172
Those aren't chips and dip.

142
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:51,913
No, I made brownies.

143
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:53,980
What ?

144
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,836
I'm just trying to figure out
why you're sabotaging things.

145
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,760
- I made brownies.
- And I made cookies.

146
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,596
Same category.

147
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,480
I'm guessing Angela's the one,

148
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,351
in the neighborhood who gives,

149
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,901
The trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes

150
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,092
Pennies.

151
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:17,853
Walnuts.

152
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,643
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam.

153
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,151
Yeah.

154
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:27,632
Just one second. I will, uh, transfer
you to our manager, Michael Scott.

155
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,531
Michael Scott here.

156
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:40,090
Yes, I am regional
manager of this orifice

157
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:45,941
Dwight Schrute, is, amazing.

158
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:51,910
Yeah. No, he is actually the single
greatest employee of his generation.

159
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:55,781
You know what ?
I'm gonna tell you what.

160
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:58,460
You hire Dwight K. Schrute,

161
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:01,650
and he does not meet, nay, exceed,

162
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:04,740
every one of your wildest expectations,

163
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:06,870
well then, you can hold me,

164
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:12,240
Michael Gary Scott, personally
and financially responsible.

165
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:16,902
Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay

166
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:27,282
- Stanley, could you come with me, please.
- No.

167
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:31,913
As assistant regional manager.

168
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:33,592
- To the ?
- Look.

169
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,681
I've got some bad news.
You're fired.

170
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:39,071
You need to pack up
your things and go.

171
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:41,411
I'm serious, Stanley.

172
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:43,513
It's over, I'm sorry.

173
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:47,251
You're fired.
Get your fingers off my phone.

174
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,111
So, how did it go with Stanley?
How-how'd he take it?

175
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,463
- He wouldn't listen to me
- Oh, come on.

176
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:01,271
If you want to fire him, you're
going to have to tell him yourself.

177
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,853
I don't wanna fire Stanley,
I never said that.

178
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:06,481
I'm certainly not going to do it myself.

179
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:10,593
Get those big, baleful,
eyes staring at me. Yikes

180
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:14,001
Just, okay, just...

181
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:17,271
Cumberland Mills?

182
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:20,240
How did you get my resume?

183
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,962
Oh no, no. I'm very flattered.
Don't get me wrong.

184
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:26,273
I'm just not sure that
it's my official resume.

185
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:29,093
or if it's something that maybe,

186
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:32,270
a satisfied customer posted online.

187
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:36,390
What does it say under
martial arts training ?

188
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:39,813
Oh, okay, I'm gonna
have to supplement that.

189
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:42,333
Could I have your fax number?

190
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:44,261
Would I ever leave this company ?

191
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:46,390
Look, I'm all about loyalty.

192
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:49,760
In fact I feel like part of what I'm
getting paid for here is my loyalty.

193
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:54,631
But, if there were somewhere else
that valued that loyalty more highly.

194
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:58,721
I'm going wherever they
value loyalty the most.

195
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,001
Oh, hey.

196
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,473
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back.
Kind of just...

197
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:09,080
Oh.

198
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,593
So you got the fax?
So why didn't you add it to the resume

199
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:19,242
What do you mean ? Of course martial
arts training is relevant.

200
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:23,162
Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion
Asians that would beg to differ.

201
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:28,172
get a little frustrated when
I'm dealing with incompetence.

202
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:29,963
Well, you know what ?
You can go to hell too.

203
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:32,313
And I will see you there...burning.

204
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:35,941
Fine! Okay, wait. So you'll let me
know when you've made a decision.

205
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:43,072
Jim is really talented.

206
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:46,333
And he should be the one who's
getting a better job offer.

207
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:48,200
Like, for real.

208
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:50,253
Don't take this the wrong way.

209
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,642
But, you should go for that job.

210
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:00,263
It's in Maryland

211
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:03,293
Yeah, but I mean,
look at the salary.

212
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:06,203
And it's definitely a step up.

213
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,112
And a challenge.

214
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:12,430
Yeah.

215
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,223
Yeah, you know what ? Maybe...

216
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:20,271
Maybe I will.

217
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:25,161
Jim...

218
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:28,771
This is called, leveraging an offer.

219
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:32,091
- Michael, can I talk to you for a moment
- Oh, God.

220
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,452
I just thought you should know,

221
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:39,220
that I was just offered
a job with better pay,

222
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:43,141
Better benefits and a better
title at Cumberland Mills.

223
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:45,442
- Fantastic.
- And I turned it down.

224
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:48,043
What ? That would've
solvedall my problems.

225
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:51,723
- Out of loyalty to this company...
- Oh, you idiot.

226
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:55,683
- So I was hoping to be made assistant
regional manager officially.
- If you left,

227
00:12:55,745 --> 00:12:57,481
I wouldn't have to fire anybody

228
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:00,392
- But then you wouldn't have me here.
- Big deal, oh !

229
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,201
It would've worked out so well.
Can you get it back ?!

230
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,241
- It's in Maryland.
- You can call, can you call 'em?

231
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,912
I can't, I, I suppose, I could, no.

232
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:11,182
They never really made
me an offer anyway.

233
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:13,303
Why are you torturing me ?

234
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,420
G od.

235
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:18,691
Honestly, I don't think that Michael has,

236
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,283
the slightest clue of who
he's going to fire.

237
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:23,702
I think he keeps hoping that
someone's going to volunteer.

238
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:27,370
Or be run over by a
bus before the deadline.

239
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:30,002
But in the end, really,
what's going to happen is

240
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:32,152
It's gonna be the first person to
give him a dirty look in the hall.

241
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:37,461
And therein lies the true
essence of his charisma.

242
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:43,431
Yes.

243
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:11,150
Michael, I really didn't mean to.
Help, me.

244
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:15,423
- I'm sorry ?
- I want you to role play firing me.

245
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:18,673
I want you to fire me,
and I will take it.

246
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,003
- Oh, you want me to be you?
- Yes.

247
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,153
- Okay.
- I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.

248
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,240
- Oh, are you firing Creed?
- No, no. No, that's just the first,

249
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:27,903
Thing...can't, in head.

250
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,872
We should switch seats in order to..

251
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:32,942
- Yes, that's a good idea.
- Alright.

252
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,651
Excuse me.

253
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm really sorry, but
I have to let you go.

254
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:46,070
And it's purely budgetary,
it's not personal.

255
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,782
- Wow.
- I'm going to kill myself,

256
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,573
- And it's your fault !
- That's an overreaction.

257
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:57,220
Corporate is really
breathing down my neck.

258
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,022
And they're saying this has to be done,

259
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:00,650
- by the end of the month.
- Is this you?

260
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:02,722
Is this you? Are you being you,
or is this Creed? Are you..

261
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:04,880
I,

262
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,032
- This is Creed.
- Okay.

263
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:09,480
I'm improvising, so just try to keep up.

264
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:12,312
- Hold that thought. Hold that thought.
- And I'm very angry, and I want...

265
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:15,612
- Michael Scott here. Toby ?
- I'm gonna kill you for firing me.

266
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:18,523
I really have to take this Creed,
so it was really worth...

267
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,130
- Get off, get off. No, no.
- Okay.

268
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,941
Just, just, yeah.

269
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:33,933
- What happened ?
- It wasn't me.

270
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:37,462
- Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was
- Yeah, I know.

271
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:49,762
- Creed ?
- Huh ?

272
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:52,542
Could I talk to you for a second ?

273
00:15:56,568 --> 00:16:00,350
You are great. Very ambitious.

274
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:04,852
And I feel like you want more
than this little office has to offer.

275
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:07,963
And I understand that you'd
wanna just spread your wings,

276
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:11,533
- And fly the coop.
- What are you telling me ?

277
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:15,312
I, we're gonna have to...
You, you want something better.

278
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:17,830
No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.

279
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,312
- No, you wanna leave.
- No, I wanna stay here

280
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,132
Why, why are you making this so hard ?

281
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:27,021
- I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael. 
- I think you're right.

282
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,360
- Can I go?
- No, of course, you can't go

283
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:33,063
We haven't even started
this horrible process of.

284
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:36,152
Okay, Creed.

285
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,941
I need to let somebody go today.

286
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:43,572
They told me I need to let somebody go.

287
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,391
And as much as I think you're
a great guy, and I like you,

288
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:49,293
You're-you're, good-bye.

289
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:52,081
Let's fight it.

290
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,112
Let's  call Jan and fight this
thing together like the old days.

291
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,813
What old days?
What are you talking about?

292
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:58,653
Did you start the paperwork yet?

293
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:01,090
- It's right here on the desk, yeah.
- You don't have to do this Michael.

294
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:03,483
- I can't, I can't...
- Undo it!

295
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,720
<i>I can't change anything.</i>

296
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,450
- This is the way...</i>
- No

297
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,193


298
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:08,190
Michael, undo it !
I don't...

299
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,063
- <i>No, you have the
power to undo it.</i>

300
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,211
Yeah, I went hunting once.

301
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,233
Shot the deer in the leg,

302
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,423
had to kill it with a shovel.
Took about an hour.

303
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,252
Why do you ask?

304
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,893
I have to fire someone today. Okay?

305
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:23,610
Fine. Fire someone else.

306
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,832
Fire Devon, he's terrible.

307
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,391
I am so much better at
my job than Devon.

308
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:31,610
Okay, well, I already picked you.
And you know that.

309
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:34,652
So, unless I just go through with this,

310
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:37,161
You're always gonna look at me
as the guy who almost fired you.

311
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:39,853
No, no, no, no, no,
I will forget so fast.

312
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:41,533
You will be my savior.

313
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:45,033
You're they guy who
gave me my life back.

314
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,273
Thank you.
I knew you'd see it my way Michael,

315
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:50,413
- God Bless you. You're a fine man.
- Don't...

316
00:17:50,857 --> 00:17:52,681
Listen, you will not regret this either.

317
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:55,673
Devon's terrible.
No one's gonna miss him.

318
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:58,140
Good, good, good.

319
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:17,302
Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?

320
00:18:17,756 --> 00:18:20,002
- Creed's an idiot, you know that.
- Well, he...

321
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:22,880
No, no, no, no, no.
You had it right the first time.

322
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,970
- Well, maybe I did.
- Exactly.

323
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:26,613
You gotta go with your gut man.

324
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:32,173
No. I can't, no. I can't go back.

325
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:33,940
I would look like an idiot.

326
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,692
- That's why I'm being fired?
- No.

327
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,060
So you might not look like an idiot ?

328
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:38,581
No. It was all the stuff that I said.

329
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:41,421
It was business downturn,
the cutbacks, and, and...

330
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,662
This is unbelievable!

331
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:46,921
I just hope that you and
I can remain friends.

332
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,660
Devon wait, please.

333
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,331
Look, look.

334
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:56,780
In addition to severance,

335
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:00,891
and everything, I want to give you,

336
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:05,321
This gift certificate to Chili's.
From me.

337
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:09,003
Okay? No hard feelings.

338
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,753
Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby,

339
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:19,560
Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis,
Stanley, or the temp.

340
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:22,940
If any of you wanna meet me for a drink,
I'm going to be a Poor Richard's

341
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:25,682
And the rest of you can go to hell.

342
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,013
What about the Halloween party ?

343
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,271
Hey, Jim. Wait, stop.

344
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,832
I'am sorry for pushing
you towards Cumberland.

345
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:50,153
Seriously, if you left here,
I would blow my brains out.

346
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:54,590
Come on.

347
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:57,592
That's just a figure of speech.
You know ?

348
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,630
Blow your brains out ? Come on.

349
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:02,542
All it really means is
that we're friends.

350
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:05,871
I mean, who else is she gonna talk to...
If I'm gone, right?

351
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:08,491
I mean, if she left, I wouldn't
blow my brains out.

352
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,220
Of course, I would take
that job in Maryland.

353
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:12,883
Because it's double the pay,

354
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:16,362
and soft shell crab just
happens to be my favorite food.

355
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:27,471
I love Halloween. You know,
it's just, it's just fun

356
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:29,270
Every year, it's just fun.

357
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:32,183
Last Halloween I came as
Janet Jackson's boob.

358
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:36,873
It was topical. 
People got a big kick out of it.

359
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:39,702
The year before that,
I came as Monica Lewinsky.

360
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,742
And I wore a stained dress.

361
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:45,732
The year before that, I also
came as Monica Lewinsky.

362
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,512
And before that, I was O.J.

363
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:50,350
It was pretty funny.

364
00:20:50,468 --> 00:20:52,872
Oh, I wish you were here last year.

365
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:02,973
Trick or treat !

366
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,232
Hey,  how you doing ?

367
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:07,273
Wow ! You guys looks great.

368
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:09,030
I'm a bumble bee.

369
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,781
You look great !

370
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:12,993
- And you're a princess?
- A fairy princess.

371
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:15,321
- A fairy princess, you're...
- I'm a lion.

372
00:21:15,427 --> 00:21:17,902
You're a lion. Wow,
I want to hear your...Oh !

373
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:20,460
Oh, okay, that's all yours.
That's all yours.

374
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:23,660
Grab it, grab it. You know what ?
You guys are getting all of these.
