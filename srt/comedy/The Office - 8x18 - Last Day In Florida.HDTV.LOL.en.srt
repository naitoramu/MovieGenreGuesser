1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,138
Okay. Bye.

2
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:10,145
Everyone stop
what you're doing.

3
00:00:10,163 --> 00:00:11,997
I have terrible news.

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:13,665
Dwight is no longer with us.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,367
What?

6
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:18,787
He's gone, damn it!

7
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:21,206
He's been promoted
to VP of Sabre retail,

8
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:24,159
and he's staying
in Florida forever.

9
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:25,744
So... He's alive.

10
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:27,879
Yeah.
That was him on the phone.

11
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:29,381
He sounds wonderful.

12
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:31,583
Well, the way you said it
made it sound like he was dead.

13
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:33,835
How could I have been
more clear?

14
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,304
He had a massive stroke
of good fortune

15
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:38,674
and he is now
in a better place.

16
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,208
If Dwight's not coming back,

17
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:41,727
does that mean we can open
his treasure?

18
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:42,877
Uh...

19
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:44,012
You guys, we've gone over this.

20
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:45,514
There is no treasure.

21
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:47,516
When the team left
for Tallahassee,

22
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,152
Dwight told everyone
not to touch his treasure.

23
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:52,053
Don't touch my treasure.

24
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:54,055
Okay? You understand?

25
00:00:54,073 --> 00:00:55,540
Obviously, he wants us
to obsess about it.

26
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:59,194
There's nothing in there.

27
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:01,163
Which is obviously what
he would want us to think,

28
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:03,865
making it the perfect place
to hide a treasure!

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,033
Oh, God, I'm Wallace Shawn

30
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,835
<i>The Princess Bride!</i>

31
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,237
I think that Dwight
wanted us to realize

32
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:11,339
that this conversation
among friends

33
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:12,708
is the true treasure.

34
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:15,293
That's not Dwight.
No.

35
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:17,596
I am dying to know
what's in there.

36
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,097
Yeah, I know, Oscar.
We all are.

37
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:21,450
But nobody's gonna open it.
You'd have to be insane.

38
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,556
Hi, hello.

39
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,276
Now carefully open the box.

40
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:38,400
It's a photo of all of us.

41
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:40,786
Oh, that's so sweet.

42
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:45,490
A dart?
Are you kidding me?

43
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,375
Who would put a poison dart--

44
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,377
Well, I mean, I don't know
that it's poison.

45
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:54,299
I mean, I just have to imagine.
God, I'm glad he's okay though.

46
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,667
Kinda sounds like
he deserved it,

47
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:57,252
opening another man's
treasure and all.

48
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:58,620
Wow!

49
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:06,453
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

50
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:22,077
Well, Mr. Ball,
it's been a pleasure.

51
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:25,997
Now give my regards to hell!
Dah!

52
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:30,318
All right!
Well swung, my VIP VP.

53
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:32,954
I am loving the chemistry
between you two.

54
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:34,456
I am so happy.

55
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,091
Dwight is gonna be working
alongside me.

56
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:40,629
We are a regular Archibald
and his man George.

57
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:42,547
I bet.
I'm excited.

58
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,850
Trick!
There's no such thing.

59
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:46,501
It's not even
a real English duo.

60
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:47,836
Ahh!

61
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:51,056
I just made you look
like the Goat of Dover.

62
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:52,641
And that doesn't exist either.

63
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:56,878
You think you're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

64
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,181
Boing!

65
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:02,100
Oh, that reminds me.
Little something from all of us.

66
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:03,702
Oh, my gosh.

67
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:06,154
Thank you, Jim.
That's so thoughtful.

68
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,860
Fore!

69
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:15,897
- Oh, yeah!
- He doesn't even care.

70
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:17,565
Don't even care!

71
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,167
This is the last time
I'll ever see Dwight.

72
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:20,919
It's a weird feeling.

73
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:23,288
It's, um...

74
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,423
What's the word?
It's not bittersweet.

75
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,843
It's, uh...

76
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:29,127
Sweet.

77
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:30,629
Yeah.

78
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,414
Hey, man.
Selling cookies for Jada.

79
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:35,217
Want the same as last year?

80
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:36,918
Would if I could
and I can, so I will.

81
00:03:36,936 --> 00:03:39,020
Put me down for one box.

82
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:40,588
Don't care what it is,
dealer's choice.

83
00:03:40,606 --> 00:03:42,891
I'll put you down
for shortbreads.

84
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:44,425
Damn it!

85
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:46,478
Knock, knock.

86
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:48,429
Hey, it's Sasha's first year
in the troupe,

87
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:49,781
so I'm selling cookies for her.

88
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:52,267
- Anyway, would you like some?
- No!

89
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:53,568
- No.
- What?

90
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:55,153
I've been selling here
for five years.

91
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:56,238
This is my spot.

92
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:58,907
You can't claim territories.

93
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:00,575
This is the only place
I interact with people.

94
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:02,377
Can't you sell at...

95
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:06,581
Your church or barbershop?

96
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:08,583
Or... Chess club?

97
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:11,136
You know what?
It's your first time.

98
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,171
Let's split the office.

99
00:04:13,222 --> 00:04:16,324
You can have sales,
the annex, creed.

100
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,293
And I don't know,
I'll just take, uh...

101
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,979
- Accounting.
- That's it?

102
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:24,516
Yeah, well, okay.
Thanks, Darryl.

103
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:26,801
Okay.
Great.

104
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,603
All I need is Kevin.

105
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:31,072
Dude buys more cookies
than everyone combined,

106
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:32,574
and then some.

107
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,109
When I first started
selling cookies,

108
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:35,777
he was a relatively thin man.

109
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:40,031
Not a thin man, mind you.
Relatively thin.

110
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:43,752
Hey, Lucy, I'm home!

111
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:44,920
Bobaloo!

112
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:47,589
- Oh, here, let me help.
- I got it.

113
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:49,874
It was so busy
at the store today.

114
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:51,793
Really good cheese samples.
I had, like, a hundred.

115
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,828
Irene hired me
as her live-in helper.

116
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:56,097
We met at the store launch.

117
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:58,700
I told her I was moving here
and I needed a place.

118
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:00,435
And it just sort of made sense.

119
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,187
I basically do
everything for her.

120
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:04,489
I run errands,
I do chores around the house,

121
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:05,890
I cook and clean.

122
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:08,944
Honestly, I don't know how
she survived without me.

123
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:12,147
When can I introduce you
to my grandson?

124
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,065
He's a wonderful swimmer.

125
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:17,202
Shallow end, deep end.
He does it all.

126
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:19,988
Well, today might be
kind of tough, Irene.

127
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:21,406
I have to talk
to my old boss Andy

128
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:23,942
and tell him I'm staying
in Florida.

129
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:31,199
Oh, what kind of tea is this?

130
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:35,220
Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.

131
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:39,808
- Oh.
- Ah!

132
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:41,376
In england, they put the holes

133
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:43,928
a little bit to the right,
you see?

134
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,647
We'll just chalk it up
to cultural bias.

135
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:47,932
If I may...

136
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:51,052
Try holding the putter...

137
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,437
Here.

138
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,389
With your wrists here,

139
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:56,675
your thumbs here.

140
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:59,194
- Oh.
- That's right.

141
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,912
Your little finger.

142
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:04,565
Would you like to buy
some cookies?

143
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,419
- Cookies, eh?
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,204
♪ oh, the springtime thinks ♪

145
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:10,905

00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,360
It's not
a scratch and sniff, Kev.

153
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:33,594
I know.

154
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,363
But sometimes you still
get a little something.

155
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:37,816
Hey, you tricked me.
You just wanted Kevin.

156
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:40,935
You're new to the game.
You learned a lesson today.

157
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:43,405
- See you next year, sport.
- No, no, no. It's not fair.

158
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,873
What if Kevin wants to buy
cookies from me?

159
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:46,708
- I do.
- See?

160
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,076
That doesn't mean anything.

161
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,161
Kevin, do you wanna
buy cookies from me?

162
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:52,247
Oh, I definitely do.

163
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,832
Huh.
Hit the road, Jack.

164
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:56,617
No, you hit the road, Jack.

165
00:06:56,635 --> 00:07:00,004
Hey, guys, come on.
Don't fight over me.

166
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:01,089
Why don't we split the order?

167
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:02,424
It's only fair.

168
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,792
No, wait, no.
I'm buying, I make the rules.

169
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,645
I actually do want you
to fight over me.

170
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,233
I wanna be wined and dined
and... sixty-nined.

171
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:14,402
Ugh.

172
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:17,238
Metaphorically
sixty-nined.

173
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:19,791
Ew! Perverts.

174
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:21,242
No offense, Oscar.

175
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:25,947
Hop in.
We have places to be.

176
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:27,665
No rest for the wicked.
Ha ha.

177
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,201
All right.
So...

178
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:32,003
I guess this is it.

179
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:33,371
Well, Jim, I just wanna say

180
00:07:33,422 --> 00:07:35,039
that we haven't always
gotten along.

181
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:36,291
And at times,
I've even hated your guts.

182
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:40,845
But...

183
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,432
Bye-bye.
I win.

184
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:46,134
- Good-bye, Dwight.

185
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:48,019
Robert! Race you
to the clubhouse.

186
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:53,391
Gentlemen's bet.
Whoo-hoo!

187
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:58,313
Well, he's Florida's
problem now.

188
00:07:58,347 --> 00:08:00,198
Oh, let Dwight have his fun.

189
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:03,701
- Today will not be his day.
- What's that?

190
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:05,203
I'm gonna tank the Sabre store

191
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:06,538
at the presentation
to the board.

192
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:07,688
I thought you liked the store.

193
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:10,074
The store is lovely.

194
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:14,462
You created a wonderful space
to showcase our product line.

195
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:16,331
Great job!
Cheers.

196
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:19,134
Thank you.

197
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:22,554
But there's a reason
we sell our products online

198
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:24,889
and over the phone.

199
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:26,975
Have you ever used Sabre
electronics, Jim?

200
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:29,344
They're cheap.
They're unintuitive.

201
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:32,347
The Sabre store would work
if we adopted the carnival model

202
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,432
of leaving town
once everyone's wise to us.

203
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,851
Wow, when you put it that way,

204
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,686
I guess it does sound
pretty terrible.

205
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,222
I couldn't just kill
the project from the start.

206
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,107
Jo Bennett endorsed it.

207
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,944
Shame, though--
I did like Dwight.

208
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:48,029
Robert!
I'm gonna win!

209
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:50,832
Ha ha, I'm the gentleman!
Suck it!

210
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:55,336
Bravo, Dwight.
Very good.

211
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:56,688
Shame.

212
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:03,260
The math is simple, folks.

213
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:06,113
Deeper market penetration,
plus greater visibility,

214
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:12,086
- will raise Sabre...
- To the power of two.

215
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,771
How did that look?

216
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:15,089
I'm not just saying this.

217
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,608
That was the best thing
I've ever seen.

218
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,393
Told you.

219
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:21,946
When you guys do that whole
"power of two" shebang,

220
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,480
how about I pop up also?

221
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:26,016
I guess we'd have to say
"power of three."

222
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:29,787
Hmm, actually, you know what?
Yeah! That actually works.

223
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:30,905
You'd spin-off right,
I'd spin off--

224
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:32,689
You know what?
That is a great idea.

225
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:34,158
Cathy, write that down
and print it out.

226
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:35,960
It's gonna make some really
good toilet paper.

227
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:37,545
All right.
There he is.

228
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,246
What are you doing here?
I thought I got rid of you.

229
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:41,048
Can I just talk to you
for one quick second?

230
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,918
What, your stylist ran out
of messy spray?

231
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:47,004
Um, actually
it's for your own good.

232
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:48,038
I think we should--

233
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:49,089
You wanna do something
for my own good?

234
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,207
Turn around,
walk out that door,

235
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:51,592
do not stop till you get
to Scranton,

236
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:53,344
find my cell phone charger,
mail it back to me,

237
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:54,711
and then go to hell!

238
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:58,349
Nice!

239
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:00,317
Hey, Halpert,
anyone ever tell you

240
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:02,102
you look like Wooly Willie?

241
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:03,553
Silence.

242
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:05,706
I'm just trying--

243
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,041
I know what you're
trying to do.

244
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:09,793
I don't want it.

245
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:14,298
But your face does look like
the guy from "Operation."

246
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:15,666
It's the same guy.

247
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,418
- That's the joke I made.
- That's not--

248
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:18,419
- Different guy.
- You know what?

249
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,054
I just think
you should know--

250
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:22,723
That you look like
the world's tallest hobbit.

251
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:27,544
Well, I tried.
You saw it.

252
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:31,432
So it's on the record.
I have a plane to catch.

253
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:32,900
Can you help me?

254
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:35,603
I'm trying to make
a video chat with Andy.

255
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:37,521
Just open the program
and type in his username.

256
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:40,574
Can you just do it?

257
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,880
Here, type in your password.

258
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:48,799
Erin123.

259
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,685
That's a terrible password.

260
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:53,137
And you don't "make a video
chat"-- You "video chat."

261
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:55,523
All right!

262
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:00,461
Hello!

263
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:01,812
That's so weird.

264
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:04,014
There's something wrong
with my laptop.

265
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:08,185
Oh! I fixed it.

266
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:14,125
Oh! Now mine's broken.
Hang on.

267
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,627
Oh, there we go.

268
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:18,462
Aghh!

269
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,381
He said "I did like Dwight"?

270
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:21,832
He's gonna fire him.

271
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:22,967
No, no, I think it was more
like, you know,

272
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,168
"I liked him,
but I don't any more,

273
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:25,369
'cause he did a bad job.

274
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:26,804
So I'm definitely
gonna yell at him."

275
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:28,205
Robert doesn't talk like that.

276
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:29,974
You have to stop Dwight
from doing this.

277
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:31,875
I tried.
He will not listen.

278
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:33,544
Did you actually
try your hardest?

279
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:34,878
Yes.

280
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:37,348
My pretty hardest.

281
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:39,049
Look, you haven't dealt with him
in a while, all right?

282
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,651
He's like Super Dwight.

283
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:44,105
It's like he's been bitten
by a radioactive Dwight or som--

284
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:46,440
- Stanley, back me up.
- Don't talk to me.

285
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:48,359
Stanley's very upset
that we're leaving Florida.

286
00:11:48,393 --> 00:11:49,994
But he would back me up.

287
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:51,412
If Dwight's about to get fired,

288
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,063
you have to tell him.

289
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,249
Just get the words out,
that's all you can do.

290
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:57,835
Okay.
All right.

291
00:11:57,869 --> 00:12:00,738
What's a skinny guy
like Toby know about cookies?

292
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,840
You can't trust him to
understand the wants and needs

293
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:04,208
of the thick man.

294
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:05,710
Maybe Toby from two years ago.

295
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:07,077
- Yeah.
- That's true.

296
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:09,463
If I have a question
about my cookies at midnight,

297
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:12,016
who am I gonna call?
Darryl.

298
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,635
Toby's probably in bed
with some model.

299
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:15,970
Thank you.

300
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,555
I'm not gonna comment
on my personal life.

301
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,690
Look, I need this.

302
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:21,726
Your daughter is
a pretty little girl.

303
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,761
Let her go door to door.

304
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,264
You think people are gonna
buy cookies from my...

305
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:30,434
Chubby daughter?

306
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:32,286
Baby, if you're watching this,
you're not chubby.

307
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:33,738
You're beautiful.

308
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:37,158
Daddy's just gotta sell
some cookies.

309
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:39,076
And we're also gonna
exercise more.

310
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:40,578
It's gonna be fun.

311
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:42,380
Oh, you know what you have
to do to decide?

312
00:12:42,414 --> 00:12:43,748
You need to make them
do things for you.

313
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:45,249
And, like, buy you things.

314
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:46,784
Or have them sing that song

315
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:48,586
that the frog does
in <i>Looney Tunes.</i>

316
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,755
Make them kiss each other.

317
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,890
Make them kiss <i>me!</i>

318
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:55,760
Eww.

319
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:59,313
Yes! This is too tan.
This right here.

320
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:02,266
- No!
- This is a tan spot.

321
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,485
I don't buy it.
That is a freckle.

322
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,604
That is not a tan.

323
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:08,489
I'm gonna have to inspect it in
person when you get back here.

324
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:12,243
I want you looking
totally <i>puertoriquena</i>

00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:13,694
when I see you.

326
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:16,197
Well, Andy,
I'm not coming back.

327
00:13:16,231 --> 00:13:19,617
- What?
- I have a job here.

328
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:22,152
I work for an old lady.

329
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,987
Hello!

330
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:25,823
Andy?

331
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:29,877
Yeah, that's awesome.
That's great.

332

'Cause Darryl, you sang better
and you dance better.

336
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,478
But Toby has
that indescribable quality

337
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:49,630
that makes a star.

338
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:52,566
I think I've reached
my decision.

339
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:54,485
I have decided...

340
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,405
That you guys are gonna
keep doing things for me.

341
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:00,241
No, no, no.
It's not worth it.

342
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:02,460
- No.
- No, it's not worth it?

343
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:03,878
That's too bad.

- Dwight.
- You again?

357
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,495
Gosh, I keep throwing you away,
you keep flying back.

358
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:38,896
You're like
an amish return-stick.

359
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:41,999
Okay, great, listen to me.
No, no, I know.

360
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,117
Will you just let me tell you
one thing, please?

361
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:44,118
Yes, you may tell me one thing.

362
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:45,169
Great!

363
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:46,170
Wait, do you wanna
borrow money?

364
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:47,171
Listen to me.

365
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:48,238
Robert is going to veto
the Sabre store.

366
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:49,457
Jim, come on.

367
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:50,624
Dwight, he's gonna kill
the store.

368
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:52,009
- Mm-hmm.
- And then I'm pretty sure

369
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:53,427
he's gonna fire you for it.

370
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:56,580
Wait, he's gonna kill
the store,

371
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:58,883
- and he's gonna fire me.
- Yes.

372
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:01,218
- That's two things.
- Dwight, please.

373
00:15:01,252 --> 00:15:02,386
Nice try, Jim.

374
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,471
Your pranks have never worked
in the past,

375
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:04,855
and they're not gonna work
today.

376
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,190
Okay, first of all,
they've mostly worked.

377
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:07,942
You know what, you might
wanna get to the airport.

378
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:09,777
It's gonna take you a long time
to get through security

379
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:11,529
with all those beauty products.

380
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:14,482
- Bye!
- Dwight, come--

381
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:15,866
Nothing is gonna stop me.

382
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,601
That is the mark
of a great man--

383
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,370
Unstoppability.

384
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:22,122
Dunder Mifflin...
the farm, Mose.

385
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:23,908
All those things.

386
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:26,660
Vanish in my rearview mirror.

387
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:30,247
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date with destiny.

388
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:32,616
And from what I hear,
she's a-- Oh!

389
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:40,934
- Help!
- Shut up.

390
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:42,569
Oh, gross!
Don't lick my hand!

391
00:15:42,603 --> 00:15:43,820
God, why is there
so much saliva?

392
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:44,855
All I had to do
was think about pie,

393
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:46,907
and my salivary glands
did the rest.

394
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:49,276
- Nah!
- What, what, what, what?

395
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:50,861
- Oh, my appendix.
- I'm sorry.

396
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:53,496
- My wound hasn't healed yet.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:54,531
- Oh, man.
- I'm so sorry, I forgot.

398
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:56,065
Are you all right?

399
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,035
Are you okay?

400
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:01,037
Dwight!

401
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:02,372
Where the hell is he?

402
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:03,573
I cannot do this without him.

403
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:07,677
I don't know.
He's not picking up.

404
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:10,180
Oh, look like shnoot's
a no-show.

405
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:13,717
Guess he wasn't Vice President
material after all.

406
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:16,219
But I am.
Put me in, babe.

407
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:18,271
I've got the info down
backwards, forwards,

408
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:20,023
and doggy-style.

409
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:22,275
I'm your man.

410
00:16:23,728 --> 00:16:25,094
Right, let's begin then.

411
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:26,596
Ladies and gentlemen,

412
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:30,951
allow me to introduce the Vice
President of Sabre retail--

413
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:33,987
Mr. Todd Packer.

414
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:36,122
'Sup?

415
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:45,999
What are you doing?

416
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,335
Oh, I'm just dealing
with Erin's stuff

417
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:50,003
since apparently
she's not coming back

418
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:51,471
and she didn't bother
to tell anyone.

419
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:54,724
We knew.
Ryan told us.

420
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,009
Ryan, why didn't you tell me?

421
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,428
Thought you checked my Tumblr.

422
00:16:58,462 --> 00:16:59,813
You never update it.

423
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:01,898
Well, I updated it.

424
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,818
Does anyone else
think this is weird?

425
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:06,970
And, like,
kind of uncool, actually?

426
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:08,271
To leave us
without a receptionist?

427
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:10,974
We'll find another
receptionist.

428
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:14,978
I mean, that's easy.
We'll be fine.

429
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:17,564
Hup, hup, hup!

430
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:18,865
What are you doing?

431
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:20,233
- I was trying to go--
- Get up, get up.

432
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:22,118
Okay, okay!

433
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:23,403
All right?
I'm not gonna let you by.

434
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:24,821
Then you know what?

435
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:26,823
I'm gonna just have to run
right through you.

436
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:28,325
Okay.

437
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,793
What are you doing?

438
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:32,462
Are you really revving up?
You know that doesn't work.

439
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:34,798
Jackie chan!

440
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:38,134
Go.

441
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:40,003
Hi, this is Alex.

442
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:41,638
And this is Sam.

443
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:43,673
Kevin can't come
to the phone right now

444
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:45,325
because he's busy...
With us.

445
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,726
Perfect!

446
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:50,213
Now people will think
I'm doing hot girls all day.

447
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,048
I don't know, man, they might
think we're drag queens.

448
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:53,400
Yeah, I don't know why
you picked names

449
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:55,185
that are also guys' names.

450
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,320
Okay, now who do I ride
to the kitchen like a pony?

451
00:17:57,355 --> 00:17:59,572
Don't make me be your pony,
Kevin.

452
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:01,491
- Forget it, man.
- What do you mean?

453
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,777
I'm out.
So is Toby.

454
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:05,245
This may be wrong,

455
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,447
but there's a limit
to what I would do for my child.

456
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:10,684
Yeah, I have my dignity too.

457
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:13,203
I refuse to be
another man's horsey.

458
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:17,457
No, guys! Stop!
You have to sell me cookies.

459
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:19,993
I'll do anything!

460
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:22,379
♪ Hello, my baby,
hello, my honey ♪

461
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:24,014
I'm even gonna kiss Meredith.

462
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:28,084
That's what--

463
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:30,770
That is--
Hmm.

464
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:35,275
That's... so good.

465
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:36,592
What are you doing?
No!

466
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,145
- No, no, no!
- This will end now.

467
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,564
- No! This is dangerous.
- Thunderslam!

468
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:44,767
- Arrgh!
- Oh!

469
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:49,622
Anything else you need
to talk about?

470
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:53,126
Nope.
That was it.

471
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:01,668
Once again, it's showtime.

472
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:06,673
What baffles me
is how you could

473
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,642
take a perfectly good idea,

474
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:13,012
which the great Jo Bennett
rightfully signed off on,

475
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:16,015
and then utterly botch it
in execution.

476
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,301
If I may speak to that,

477
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,820
I have only been Vice President
of this project

478
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:22,188
for the last half hour.

479
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,107
So the man you want
is Dwight Schrute.

480
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:26,076
I don't see Dwight.

481
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,911
He clearly had
the infinite wisdom

482
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:31,581
to stay as far away from
this clown show as possible.

483
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,983
Whatever you do...

484
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:36,336
Do not blame Todd packer.

485
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,589
It is not his fault.

486
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:42,592
Blame his upbringing,
his parents.

487
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:45,712
The society that would mold
this idiotic creature.

488
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:50,266
Fire the employee, yes.
But not the man.

489
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:53,770
You may not cancel his soul.

490
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:56,022
That was never on the table.

491
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:57,673
Are you kidding?

492
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:59,476
She's the queen of the whole
friggin' magilla!

493
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,345
And yet, Todd,
it's you who's fired.

494
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:04,481
What--
I can't get fired.

495
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:05,848
I'm an institution.

496
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:07,817
I have been at this company
for 20 years.

497
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:09,519
How many of you have been here
that long, huh?

498
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,301
Hey, hey!
They're back.

499
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,322
Hey! Wait, Dwight,
what are you doing here?

500
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:41,407
I thought you were supposed
to be in Florida.

501
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,858
Yeah, the crazy thing
about that

502
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,978
is, um--
Wow, you look great.

503
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,780
- Did you lose some weight?
- Thank you.

504
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:50,238
For someone who actually
notices this.

505
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:52,326
No, I didn't lose weight,
but I started using my make up

506
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:54,163
to contour my face
to look skinnier.

507
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:55,614
Actually...

508
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:59,872
- Hey, good to have you back.
- Good to be back.

509
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:04,176
- Hey, stranger!
- Hey!

510
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,138
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you.

511
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,321
I'm going to Florida to get Erin.

512
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,972
I forgot to turn off my email.

513
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,446
It's crazy, right? It's just,
when she said she was leaving...

514
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:26,421
I thought...

515
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:29,096
You're about to close four tabs,
are you sure you want to continue? Yes.

516
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,958
I am sure.

517
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:34,575
Ahh! Slow computer!

518
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:45,323
