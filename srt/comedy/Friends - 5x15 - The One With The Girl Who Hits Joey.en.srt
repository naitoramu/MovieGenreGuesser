1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:06,507
Chandler! Chandler!

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,927
I saw what you were doing
in the window!

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:15,224
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!

4
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,810
Listen, we had a good run.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,229
What was it?
Four, five months?

6
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:25,109
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime. Goodbye.

7
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,695
- What are you doing?
- I am going on the lam.

8
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,074
Come on, Chandler.
I can handle Ross.

9
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,327
Hold on!

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,040
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,878
What the hell are you doing?

12
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:45,962
What's going on?

13
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:51,135
I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

14
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:55,514
Dude, he's right there.

15
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,267
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!

16
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,521
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!

17
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,650
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,694
I'm in love with her.

19
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,323
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

20
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:18,370
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I love him too.

21
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,295
My best friend and my sister!

22
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,593
I cannot believe this!

23
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:38,015
You guys want to probably
get some hugs in too. Big news!

24
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,852
We've actually known for a while.

25
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,565
What? You guys knew?

26
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,901
You all knew and
you didn't tell me?

27
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:56,825
We were worried about you. We didn't
know how you were going to react.

28
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,538
You were worried about me?

29
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,292
You didn't know how I'd react?

30
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,171
Okay. All right.

31
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:15,010
Let's clear out of here and let
these love birds get back to business.

32
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:22,017
I'm just talking here.
He's the one doing your sister.

33
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,939
The One with the Girl Who Hits Joey

34
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,060
You know what I just realized?

35
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,770
If you guys have kids...

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,146
We're having kids?

37
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,191
I call godfather!

38
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,029
You can't just call godfather.

39
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,656
Shouldn't her brother be godfather?

40
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,868
Sure. If you cared enough
to call it first.

41
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,456
- You're a few steps ahead of us.
- Big zero gravity moon steps.

42
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,543
I just thought of
the greatest wedding gift.

43
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:34,006
I'll go in on that with you.
I couldn't decide.

44
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,466
Hey, Katie.

45
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,344
This is Katie.

46
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:39,512
You ready to go?

47
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,680
I'll run to the bathroom.

48
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,848
Where's lunch?

49
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,891
I was thinking Chinese food.

50
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,518
I love Chinese!

51
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,939
How did you know I love Chinese?

52
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,526
She is so cute.

53
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,321
You could fit her
in your pocket.

54
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,325
I don't know. I like her a lot,
and she's really nice, but...

55
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,662
But what?

56
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,291
She keeps punching me.

57
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,628
In the cute little,
sweet way she just did?

58
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,340
It's a lot harder than it looks.

59
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,259
She's hurting me.

60
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,221
I know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.

61
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,975
What is Ben doing after preschool?

62
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:32,480
Joey is having a problem.
A little girl is beating him up.

63
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:33,858
Joey, come here.

64
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,485
Honey, I know. This must be
really difficult for you, and...

65
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,948
I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

66
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,251
I brought you some housewarming gifts.

67
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,380
Salt, so your life always has flavor.

68
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,508
Bread, so you never go hungry.

69
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,427
And a scented candle for the bathroom.

70
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,806
Because, well, you know.

71
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:11,228
Thanks. Thanks.
And thanks, I guess.

72
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:15,441
Welcome. I'm Steve Cera,
President of the tenants' committee.

73
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:19,236
Ross Geller.
And this is my friend Phoebe.

74
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,447
Mr. President.

75
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:26,076
I came to talk to you
about Howard.

76
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,787
He is the handyman
who's retiring next week.

77
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:33,875
Everyone who lives here is kicking in
$100 as a kind of a thank you.

78
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,502
That's nice.

79
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,755
Want to give me a check?

80
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,011
Not now. You can
slip it under my door.

81
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,971
No, it's not that.

82
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,641
I just moved in.

83
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,978
Well, the guy's worked here
for 25 years.

84
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:57,315
Yes, but I've lived here
for 25 minutes.

85
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,820
Okay, I get it.

86
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,741
Wait! Look, I'm sorry, it's just
I've never even met Howard.

87
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,328
I mean, I don't know Howard.

88
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:13,082
Howard's the handyman.

89
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:17,586
Yes, but to me he's just "man".

90
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,839
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

91
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,051
Welcome to the building.

92
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,346
Can you believe that guy?

93
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,351
I really like his glasses.

94
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,608
So then President Steve
told everyone I was a cheapskate...

95
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,818
...and now the whole building hates me.

96
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,573
A little kid spit on my knee.

97
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,698
You know what?

98
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,119
I'll throw a party.
For everyone in the building.

99
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:54,206
And I'll sit them all down and
explain that I am not a bad guy.

100
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,209
I am not a cheap guy.
I'm just a guy...

101
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,836
...who stands up
for what he believes in.

102
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,840
A man with principles.

103
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,343
Sounds like a fun party.

104
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,597
If you want them to like you,
why don't you just pay the $100?

105
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,600
The party will cost you more.

106
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,393
That doesn't matter!

107
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:18,272
It's my principles!
We're talking about my principles!

108
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:21,692
I thought it was about
your neighbors liking you.

109
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:27,322
They'll like me once
they come to my awesome par-tay.

110
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,909
I gotta get some name tags.

111
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,375
And that crazy party animal
will be your brother-in-law.

112
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,919
Very funny.
But don't say that to Monica.

113
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,631
Don't put any ideas in her head.

114
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:48,761
You do realize that those ideas
are probably already in Monica's head?

115
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,555
Why?

116
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,684
Well, because she loves you
and because you love her.

117
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,979
Yeah, so? What's
that supposed to mean?

118
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,983
Don't freak out! I'm telling you
something you already know.

119
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,319
She left Richard because
he didn't want to have babies.

120
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,867
And she is a woman. And she's
almost 30. And, you know, it's Monica.

121
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,328
I don't see it that way.
I see two Monicas:

122
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:18,916
My friend who lives across
the hall and wants a lot of babies.

123
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,585
And the new Monica
who I started to date.

124
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,464
Now, who is to say what she wants?

125
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,507
I'm right.

126
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,761
Am I right?

127
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,637
You're right.

128
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:37,643
You're absolutely right.
That makes everything different.

129
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,228
It's not different, is it?

130
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:43,190
Not unless "different"
means the same.

131
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:49,363
You were so funny with that waiter.
You're such a nut!

132
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,661
You know, breadstick fangs
are always funny.

133
00:08:56,912 --> 00:09:01,542
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one!

134
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,755
Look, Katie.
Listen, we need to talk, okay?

135
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:11,301
Look, I like you.
I really do. I like you a lot.

136
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,930
But sometimes when you
playfully punch me like that...

137
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,853
...it feels like I'm being hit
with a very tiny but a very real bat!

138
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,982
Like I could hurt you.

139
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,067
Are you making fun of my size?

140
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:32,823
Don't make fun of me
because of my size!

141
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,038
Isn't this great?

142
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:43,375
Couldn't you just
stay like this forever?

143
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,630
Couldn't you just stay here forever?

144
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:53,761
Yeah, here, somewhere else.
You know, wherever.

145
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,221
Are you okay?

146
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,596
I'm cool.

147
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,974
Casual.

148
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,642
What are you doing?

149
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:06,816
Just hanging out. Having fun
with the girl that I'm seeing casually.

150
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,236
Man, I knew it!
I knew you'd do this.

151
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,906
Get all freaked out because
everybody was joking about marriage!

152
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:18,202
Well, you do want
all that stuff, right?

153
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,870
You know what I want?

154
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,291
Yes! You want babies!
You have baby fever!

155
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,251
I do not have baby fever!

156
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:29,380
You're obsessed
with babies and marriage...

157
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,676
...and everything that's
related to babies and marriage.

158
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:39,181
Why don't we turn the heat
down on this pressure cooker!

159
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,266
Have you lost your mind?

160
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:45,730
This isn't about me. This is about
you and your weird commitment crap!

161
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:51,109
I know you. I know the thoughts
that you have in your head.

162
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,778
You don't know everything.

163
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,490
Did you know I'm going out
with Rachel tonight instead of you?

164
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,784
And that the only baby here is you?

165
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:03,664
Did you know I can't even
look at you now?

166
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,376
I did not know that.

167
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:14,758
It'll be okay, right?
She won't leave me. This is fixable.

168
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,010
- Yeah, sure.
- Absolutely.

169
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,930
By me?

170
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,560
Unless you make some big gesture.

171
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,313
Big, though.

172
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,107
The missus!

173
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:33,652
Gunther, can I get a coffee?

174
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,446
To go.

175
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,740
I still don't want to talk to you.

176
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:41,702
Tell me how to make things right.

177
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,245
That's what we do.

178
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,581
I mess up, you tell me
how to fix it and I do.

179
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:50,794
And then you think I'm cute again.

180
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,839
I'm really tired of being
your relationship tutor.

181
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,009
Figure this out for yourself.

182
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,720
If you're afraid
of a real relationship...

183
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,515
...then don't be in one.

184
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:44,265
Howard! Howard! Howard!

185
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,028
Hi, Ross!

186
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,780
What are you doing here?

187
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,700
I thought this was your party,
and it's a party for Howard.

188
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,787
He's the sweetest little man.

189
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,998
See you, Phoebe.
And thanks for chipping in.

190
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,293
Oh, sure.

191
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,045
You chipped in?

192
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,171
Yeah, $100.

193
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,882
I can't believe you gave him money.

194
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:23,386
I thought you agreed it was unreasonable
that they asked me for that money.

195
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,222
But they didn't ask me.

196
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:30,227
I'm just the exotic, generous stranger.
That's always fun to be.

197
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,604
But you're making me look bad.

198
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:35,941
No, I'm not! If anything,
I'm making you look better.

199
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,112
They'll see you
talking to me. I'm a hit.

200
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,281
Hey, Pheebs!

201
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,158
Hey, Ross.

202
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,619
Maybe you two could
switch apartments.

203
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,497
Because Phoebe is more
our kind of people.

204
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,540
Think about it.

205
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:58,005
Okay, my bad.

206
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,355
You look big.

207
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,775
Thanks, I've been working out.

208
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:22,821
Listen, is it obvious
I'm wearing six sweaters?

209
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,325
But it's not obvious why.

210
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,953
I'm breaking up with Katie,
so I put on some extra padding.

211
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:34,375
If she hits me when she is happy,
can you imagine how hard she'll hit...

212
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,671
...when I take away the Joey love?

213
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,467
Hey, cute jacket.

214
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,220
Thanks.

215
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,224
- That's so sweet!
- Ouch!

216
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:58,566
Did Joey tell you to say that?
You guys are too much!

217
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,569
You know what?
I got to tell you...

218
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,989
...I think you're the one
that is too much.

219
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,368
Joey has the nicest friends.

220
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:13,622
And the nicest girlfriend.

221
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,375
You're so sweet!

222
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:20,170
You're so sweet!

223
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,554
She just kicked me.

224
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:36,561
Aren't you going to do something?

225
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:41,233
Do something or I'll walk
out that door right now.

226
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,195
Are you going to?

227
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:09,010
This is a disaster.
Can't I please just go?

228
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,971
I'm talking you up to people.

229
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:15,434
Give it some time, relax.
Get something to eat.

230
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,439
What did you tell them about me?

231
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,234
I told them about you and Emily.
Trying to get some sympathy.

232
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,113
But you came off as the bad guy.

233
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,450
I told it wrong.

234
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:37,331
We should talk about that, because
I don't understand what happened there.

235
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,417
This cake is really good!

236
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,085
Things are looking up.

237
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:48,175
Oh, my God!
Someone cut Howard's cake!

238
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:54,431
Who would do a thing like that?

239
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,480
3-B.

240
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,191
You got your free food.
You ruined everyone's fun.

241
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:08,695
Isn't it time you went home?

242
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:12,867
Go back to 3-B, 3-B.

243
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:18,496
Everyone, calm down!
I have something that I'd like to say.

244
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,918
Who here likes Ross?

245
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,131
Of course you don't like him.

246
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,217
He didn't give you any money.

247
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,012
He raised his own hand
when I asked, "Who likes Ross?"

248
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:37,683
And he's wearing two name tags.

249
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:44,982
I'll be honest. When I first met Ross,
I didn't like him at all.

250
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:49,027
Once I got to know him,
I saw that he is really sweet...

251
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:52,656
...and caring and very generous.

252
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:56,701
All I'm saying is don't judge
Ross before you get to know him.

253
00:17:56,952 --> 00:18:01,832
You know, I like all of you guys now.
But when I first met you, you know?

254
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,919
Kurt? I thought, abrasive drunk.

255
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:07,754
Lola?

256
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,717
Mind-numbingly stupid.

257
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:17,764
You guys. Gold digger,
cradle-robbing perv.

258
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:23,270
So I think you all know what I mean.

259
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:32,779
Obviously, I didn't think
they would throw things.

260
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,283
I thought if I kept insulting them
you'd defend them.

261
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:40,078
Then you'd look like the hero.

262
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,708
See, I did not get that.

263
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,298
Where's Monica? I need
to talk to her, it's urgent.

264
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,758
I'm Monica.

265
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,178
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

266
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:57,804
I've been thinking...

267
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:03,352
...about us. A lot of "us" thinking.

268
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,690
I guess there's
only one way to do this.

269
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,070
What are you doing?

270
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,738
Don't do it.

271
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,908
Will you marry me?

272
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,704
What a bad idea.

273
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:26,459
I can't not look at it.

274
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,835
Why are you doing this?

275
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,963
I don't know.

276
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:35,175
But I know I'm not afraid to do this.

277
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:39,889
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?

278
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:44,977
Do you think the best reason
to get married is because you're sorry?

279
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,647
The best reason is pregnancy.

280
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:55,946
Sorry is fourth, behind being ready
and actually wanting to get married.

281
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,741
Will you be my wife?

282
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:07,791
I want you to take a minute and think
about how ridiculous this sounds.

283
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:14,215
I'm kind of wishing
everyone wasn't here now.

284
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,509
None of that came from me.

285
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,304
I never said I wanted to have babies
and get married!

286
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,767
I was really confused.
Then I talked to these guys.

287
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:28,854
Who? Two divorces and Joey?

288
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:32,358
She's right, you know?

289
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:36,945
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!

290
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:40,032
You know when I said
that I want you...

291
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:43,368
...to deal with relationship stuff
all on your own?

292
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,204
You're not ready.

293
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:48,832
I didn't think I was!

294
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,462
Oh, my God.

295
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,381
What would you have done
if I had said yes?

296
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,509
I would've been happy because...

297
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:03,514
...I would spend the rest of
my life with the woman I love.

298
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:08,602
Or you would have seen
a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.

299
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,859
Will you pass that knife?

300
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,776
No, I will not.

301
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,363
You don't have to be mean about it.

302
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:24,118
You're right. I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

303
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:31,833
I was going to ask you to marry me
because I didn't say hello to you.

304
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:36,880
Or ask them to move in with you.
But I'm not sure. Chandler?

305
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,632
How long is this going to go on?

306
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,842
I think the length of teasing...

307
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:45,931
...is directly related to how insane
you were. So, a long time.

308
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:47,182
This is fun!

309
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,768
Remember that
"we were on a break" thing?

310
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:53,688
I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

311
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,405
That's not funny.
