1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,970
Stop it!
Stop what?

2
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,016
You're talking
about me in Morse Code.

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,517
But you know what? Joke's on
you 'cause I know Morse Code.

4
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,575
Ha!

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,446
Yeah, that's what
we're doing.

6
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,417
In our very limited free time
and with our very limited budget,

7
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,257
we went and got a nanny, and
then we went out and took a class

8
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,230
on a very outmoded and very
unnecessary form of communication

9
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,858
just so we can talk
about you in front of you.

10
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,766
Yep, that's exactly
what we did.

11
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,468
It all started when Dwight was tapping
his foot against the leg of his desk.

12
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,071
When I asked him
to stop, he said,

13
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,307
"I will when you
lose the baby weight."

14
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:53,008
Very well. I must have
imagined it. I apologize.

15
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,295
Detonator? Detonator. Where?

16
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,098
Michael!

17
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,440
Jim, are you
clicking a detonator?

18
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,733
It's a pen.
Michael, come on.

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,142
Get back to work,
Dwight. Please.

20
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,437
Fine.

Whoo!

24
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:10,760
Things with Donna are so...
They're going great!

25
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:16,225
I... We're just
clicking on every level.

Who enjoys the weekends?

31
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,953
Of course. Now the
weekend is always great

32
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:45,123
if you have someone, which I
do. I have Donna, she is hot.

33
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,730
She has a Pilates butt.

34
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,200
But we need to find something to
do this weekend beside have sex.

35
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,369
Did I say that?
Yes, I did.

36
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,407
And the reason you are here
is that I need ideas

37
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,273
for things that Donna and I can do
on the weekend. So just shout it out.

38
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,175
I have an idea for your weekend. Okay.

39
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,441
Let me go back to my
desk right now. Okay.

40
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,710
You get out of here,
big dog.

41
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,718
No, no, no, no, you guys
sit down. I need ideas.

42
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,775
Stanley got to go.

43
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,219
Yeah, Well, Stanley
doesn't help with anything.

44
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,551
Come on, shout them out.
Shout them out.

45
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,885
Walk around apple orchards.
Oh!

46
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,220
Super romantic.
That's fun.

47
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,419
Eel fishing.
All right.

48
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,121
Curl up with
your favorite DVD.

49
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,629
You and Donna
should hit the Poconos.

50
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,461
They have heart-shaped
Jacuzzis, room enough for three.

51
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,694
We actually went to the
Poconos last Tuesday.

52
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,672
We headed up there, we went to a
little Chinese bistro, P.F. Chang's.

53
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,067
Why would you go all the way
to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's

54
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,872
when we have
the Great Wall in Scranton?

55
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,511
Because when your
super-hot girlfriend

56
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,945
says, "I want to
go to Mount Pocono,"

57
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,812
you go to Mount Pocono,
and you do her.

58
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,148
And we screwed. Whoops!
TMI! (PEOPLE GROANING)

59
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,484
Wait, that's crazy far. Are
you sure she's not cheating?

60
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,682
You know what, Kelly,
this is the real world.

61

<i>Not,
The Real World, Scranton.</i>

62
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,818
Oh, my God,
this is super weird.

63
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,953
When Ryan had
two girlfriends,

64
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,724
he used to take me to
some diner in Hazleton

65
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:52,924
just so the other
girl wouldn't see.

66
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,467
Some diner?
It was the Starlight Diner.

67
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,595
<i>It's in a Life magazine
spread about Americana.</i>

68
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,332
You guys think
Donna's cheating on me?

69
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,541
No. Michael, no.

70
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,010
You had a nice meal with your
girlfriend in a lovely place.

71
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,671
And sex. We had sex, too. That is right.

72
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,647
Don't make any more of it.
How?

73
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,809
How what? How do I not
make any more of it?

74
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,715
You could start by
concluding this meeting.

75
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:14,810
All right.

76
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,022
Okay. And she won't say, "I love you."

77
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,080
DWIGHT: Oh, no.

78
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,455
How many dates
have you been on?

79
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,154
Nine dates. I said
it on the second date.

80
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,257
That seems quick,
even for lesbians.

81
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,526
RYAN: Does she keep her phone
locked around you, Michael?

82
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,934
Does she watch how much she
drinks around you, Michael?

83
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,905
Does she leave the room
when she takes phone calls?

84
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,441
Does she keep perfume in her
purse? Does she shower before sex?

85
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,340
Does she shower
after sex? Does she...

86
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,708
Yeah, she does all that.

87
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,007
Sorry, dude.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

88
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,980
Michael, do not let
your imagination run amok.

89
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,311
Run what?
Amok.

90
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,511
It means don't let your
imagination run out of control.

91
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,281
Why didn't you
just say that, Pam?

92
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,515
Michael, do not let your
imagination run out of control.

93
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,023
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

94
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,991
You have a bad imagination, it's stupid.

95
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,550
I live in a fantasy world.

96
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,754
You do?

97
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,558
Yes, Jim, I do.

98
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,462
And I can't stay
in a relationship

99
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,330
that is full of
lies and deceit.

100
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,233
But you didn't believe any of
this was true five minutes ago.

101
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,431
That's what makes it so raw.

102
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,838
Ever since I found out that
Donna might be cheating on me,

103
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,933
I have not eaten or slept.

104
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,314
It's the not knowing,
that's what's killing me.

107
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,152
(WHISPERING) I want

112
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,992
$100 a day plus expenses.

113
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,434
I'll give you 50.
Money's no object.

114
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,561
Done.

115
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,868
I'm just going to warn you, and
I say this to all my clients,

116
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,271
you might not
like what I find.

117
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,400
Okay.

118
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,910
And you might not
like how I find it.

119
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,014
Of course.
Yeah, that's terrible.

120
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,280
Okay, let me get back to you.

121
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,653
Hey, Stanley, one of my clients just
called and said that their Sabre printer

122
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,989
started smoking
and caught on fire.

123
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:05,421
My doctor told me to cut out
hotdogs. We all got problems.

124
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,770
Hey, Gabe, I need to talk to you
about something. It's really important.

125
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,897
There's no way that you guys
have any almond butter, right?

126
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,168
Yeah, I don't know. Look,
one of my clients called.

127
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,504
He was in the middle
of a big printing job

128
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,477
and the back of the
printer started smoking

129
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,206
and then the paper
tray caught on fire.

130
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,541
That's weird. I haven't
heard of that happening.

131
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,378
I would even settle
for apricot preserves.

132
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,879
What are we going
to do about this?

133
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,514
I don't know. Call HQ,
see if they know anything.

134
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:35,751
Yeah, that's what I'll
do today. All right.

135
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,318
Let me know what they say.

136
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,227
Wow, that dude is good.

137
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,427
What do you mean?

138
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,728
You didn't feel like
he was hiding something?

139
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,063
I don't know.

140
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,768
Like he was
covering something up?

141
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,399
Maybe.

almost lost my job.

146
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,694
Man, I was mad as
hell at the time.

147
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,131
But I said, "Darryl,
just wait. He's a fool.

148
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,693
"There's going to be an

Oh, hi.
You work for Michael.

00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,844
I work with Michael.
Right.

Donna, hi.

153

All cases are
solved with logic.

154
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,575
The only logical way to find out if
Donna is a cheater is to seduce her,

155
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,818
bring her to orgasm, then call
Michael and tell him the sad news.

00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,022
Wow. It's a little early for
ice cream, don't you think?

157
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,562
It's never too early
for ice cream, Jim.

158
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,621
But we didn't
have any ice cream,

159
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,428
so this is mayonnaise
and black olives.

160
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,525
Oh!
Oh, my God.

161
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,762
It's comfort food,
all right?

162
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,394
God!

163
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,337
Michael, this whole Donna
thing is going to be okay.

164
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,806
You just...
Stop beating yourself up.

165
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,536
I know. Well,
I hope you're right.

166
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,634
We'll see what Dwight says.

167
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,939
Why do we have to
see what Dwight says?

168
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,741
Because I have him
investigating her.

169
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,940
I'm waiting for
a text update.

170
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,175
Michael,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

171
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,376
No, no, no, no, no.
Undo that.

172
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,646
Undo that.
It's too late to undo it.

173
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,553
I need to know, otherwise this
thing is going to spiral out of amok.

174
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,820
Michael, okay, I'm going
to talk straight to you

175
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,155
because I think you need
to hear it. Michael...

176
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,525
(GRUNTS) This
is so disgusting.

177
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,394
Stop eating it.
Do you want to be happy?

178
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:23,231
Look at you. You have a major
self-destructive streak in you.

179
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,130
I know.
And you...

180
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,833
You kind of torpedo every
romantic relationship you're in.

181
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,068
That's not true.

182
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,212
You're right.
I ruin everything.

183
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,082
And I have known
some wonderful women.

184
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,444
Holly, Carole, Jan.

185

Oh!

189
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,318
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,385
All of the greatest
loves of my life.

191
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:55,062
You should stop this. You
should call Dwight right now.

192
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,234
(SIGHING) All right.

193
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,804
Oh, gosh, we're both going for
the same weight at the same time.

194
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,971
You go ahead.
Thank you.

You're back. What happened?

228
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,724
I pulled muscles in both my
thighs. Thanks for asking.

229

No. What happened with Donna?

Yeah, no.
She's not cheating.

I told her not to,

but she's coming over
here and she's furious.

What? No, she didn't
say that. You're right.

I was paraphrasing.

243

What she actually said was,
"What is with him?

"He is crazy. I'm coming
over there to talk to him."

I had no other recourse

but to tell her
and gym security

247
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,808
that you had sent me there
to see if she was cheating.

00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,373
In a mall down there.

316
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,471
Franklin Mills?

317
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,711
King of Prussia?
Springfield? Governor's Place?

318
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,752
Franklin Mills.

319
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,851
What?
Hmm.

320
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,582
Oh!

321
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,055
It's probably nothing.

322
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,190
Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not
something that a woman buys for herself,

323
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,031
a man definitely
bought it for her recently,

324
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,003
and it wasn't Michael.

325
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,867
Wait, so you like heart-shaped
jewelry, though, right?

326
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,306
No.

327
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,809
Except for the pendant
that you bought me.

328
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,403
Which I love.

329
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,005
Psst!

330
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,919
Creed's head
of Quality Assurance,

331
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,227
so he'd definitely
be wrapped up in this.

332
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,894
So there I am
minding my own business,

333
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,229
and Darnell offers me
three bucks.

334
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,202
All I've got to do is walk
by Andy and go like this.

335
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,172
Darnell's a chump. I
would've done it for anything.

336
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,174
I've done a lot
more for a lot less.

337
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:16,305
<i>PAM: So, it turns out Donna and I have
a Facebook friend of a friend in common,</i>

338
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,613
so I was able to see
some of her pictures online.

339
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,980
This was taken
two weeks ago.

340
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,356
And this was
taken the same night.

341
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,629
This photo was
taken this morning.

342
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,562
It's Cece.

343
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,362
She's never going
to do anything wrong.

344
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,403
Isn't that something?
Wow. That's exciting.

345
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,234
Hey, Michael.
Hey.

346
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,864
Sorry to interrupt you.

347
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,274
I actually have something very
important to talk to you about.

348
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,538
Well, it can wait.
Business related.

349
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,375
It can wait.
I lied, it's personal.

350
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,744
It's about me
and Jim, we're...

351
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,113
(STAMMERS) You're the only
person I can talk to.

352
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,049
Jim is her husband.
Oh.

353
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,746
PAM: And... And they're
having problems...

354
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,311
No, no, we're not...
...and so she comes to me.

355
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,721
We're not having problems,
but it is personal.

356
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,692
And I was...
In bed.

357
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,818
(CLICKING TONGUE)

358
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,661
Yes, yes, I desperately
want to speak with you

359
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,290
about my sex life with Jim.
(MICHAEL CLEARING THROAT)

360
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,631
Oh, my God, look at how
cheap street-level rooms are.

361
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,399
Am I the only person
who enjoys people-watching?

362
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,905
I need you to sign this!

363
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,441
So bad!
Okay, weirdo.

364
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,474
I love...
This idea is neat.

365
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,535
I've never been.
Yeah.

366
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,671
It sounds lovely.

367
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,875
Yeah, I think it'll be a nice
trip. We're going to get a lot done.

368
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,941
You're going to want to
look at the date on that.

369
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,818
Oh! Wow. Look at golfing.

370
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,946
Are you a golfer?

371
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,547
I am, but I gave
my clubs away.

372
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,114
Swear too much.

373
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,922
(BOTH LAUGHING)

374
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,221
Hey, you okay?

375
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,233
Yeah, I just remembered that
I have to go to the bathroom.

376
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,700
Pam?
Absolutely.

377
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,939
Look, I'm not down anymore, so if
the guys start making fun of you,

378
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,874
you've just gotta
stand up for yourself.

379
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,941
I know. It's just, I'm
scared... ANDY: I got your text.

380
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,140
It said, "911."

381
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,977
Glen, could you
excuse us?

382
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,989
It's bad.
What's bad?

383
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,047
It's real bad.

384
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,320
Still no plan.

385
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,528
Oh, God.
It's getting bigger.

386
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,464
I might have to go public here, but
no one's going to believe me. Uh...

387
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,797
I need proof. I need, like,
a printer to catch on fire.

388
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,496
I can videotape it.
Yeah.

389
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,699
There it is.

390
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,867
There what is?

391
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,169
What?

392
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,175
Who the hell is this?
Who is this guy?

393
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,737
I don't know who it is.
God!

394
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,908
Lowest of the low, that guy.

395
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,451
Just a notch above Toby.

396
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,611
You know what?
What?

397
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,849
I'm going to kill him.
No, I'm not. I feel... No.

398
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,016
I'm not going to kill him.

399
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,923
You just have to go in there.
You have to hear it from her.

400
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,019
I have to hear it from her. But
you have to settle down first.

401
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,758
I need to have her
tell me herself. Okay.

402
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,821
Okay.
Right?

403
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,958
Yes.
I need to have her say...

404
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,626
I need to say, "What the
hell is that? Calm down first.

405
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,964
"What the hell is that?"
Hey, look at this.

406
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,197
Look at this baby picture.

407

(GRUNTING) Oh, God,
no. Oh, my God.

408
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:55,831
Hi, Michael.

409
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,739
Hi, Michael.
Okay.

410
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,970
Okay.

411
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,771
Okay.

412
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,239
I talked to corporate. Turns out there
have been 12 reports of faulty printers.

413
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,716
Out of 400,000.

414
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,614
We've investigated. Every
time it's been user error.

415
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,656
They block the vents
or something, I don't know.

416
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,315
That's why we have
the fine print.

417
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,250
Thank you for bringing
this to our attention.

418
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,817
So, I'd like to
reward you for that.

419
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,665
That's good for five bucks at
Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts.

420
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,659
Oh.

421
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,715
You know what? We should really
do something fun this week.

422
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,179
Yeah.
Wouldn't that be fun?

423
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,446
Yeah.

424
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,714
How about Thursday?

425
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,948
Thursday works, yeah.

426
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,388
What do you want to do? I
can't do it Thursday, book club.

427
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,857
How about Friday?

428
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,553
Oh! Friday doesn't work.

429
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,064
Oh, really? 'Cause I was thinking
we could go to this concert.

430
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,659

for Weird Al. Front row.

Shoot. I'm working.

Oh! Okay, well,
maybe I should stop by.

434
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,441
Well, won't you
be at the concert?

435
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,909
Nope, that's Tuesday.

436
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,534
Well, I can make it
on Tuesday.

437
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,805

00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,627
Wait, what do you mean?
The other man.

472
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,228
Who's the guy?
Who is it?

473
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,206
It's you. I'm married.

474
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,840
I'm the mistress?

475
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,376
Okay, everybody,
let's take this next hill!

476
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,420
<i>Excuse me. Yeah, I'd appreciate
it if you'd just let me run this.</i>

477
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,580
You know what? You had your
chance, you're no leader.

478
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,624
<i>Up, out of your seat! Let's
blast! Don't listen to him.</i>

479
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,489
<i>We're approaching a
cool-down, down a gentle hill.</i>

480
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,257
No! The hill's a trap. Let's take
the dirt road off to the side.

481
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,161
<i>No, guys, no.
We're just cooling down.</i>

482
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,166
If they catch us,
they will rape us.

483
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:13,193
Go for the cliff.
And three, two, one, jump!

484
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,500
No! You're dead, you're
dead, you're dead. Good jump.

485
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,041
You're barely alive.
Okay, now, nice cool-down.

486
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,136
Check your pulse rate.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
