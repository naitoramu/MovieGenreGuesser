1
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:05,982
Where is my desk ?

2
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:09,009
That is weird.

3
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:12,885
This is not funny, this is totally
unprofessional.

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,879
Okay, well, you're the
one who lost the desk.

5
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:17,286
- I didn't lose my desk
- Okay, calm down.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,972
Where was the last place
you saw it ?

7
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:20,440
Okay, who moved my desk ?

8
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:22,569
I think you should
retrace your steps.

9
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,251
Okay, I am going to tell Michael.

10
00:00:25,477 --> 00:00:28,330
And this entire office
will be punished.

11
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,326
Colder.

12
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,530
Warmer.

13
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:36,966
Little warmer.

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,841
There you go, ooh, warmer.

15
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:41,640
Warmer.

16
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:43,343
Warmer, warmer !

17
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:45,211
Warmer, cold, cold ! Cold !

18
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:46,372
Back up !

19
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:50,753
Ooh, ooh, warmer.

20
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:52,693
Hot, red hot. Hot.

21
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:54,973
Very hot.

22
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:09,872
- Dwight Schrute.
- Hi Dwight !

23
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:13,510
What sort of discounts are we giving
on the 20 pound white bond ?

24
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:16,010
Jim, I've given you this
information like 20 times.

25
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,273
<i>I know.</i>

26
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,423
It's by the ream ?

27
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:25,300
- <i>Uh, yeah.</i>
- It is now 9.78.

28
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:28,253
- So it's a discount of 7%.
- Okay thank you,

29
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,142
I got to get back to work.

30
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:35,993
Wash your hands Kevin.

31
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,553

35
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:14,292
Right. Oh, well,
let me just check the pricing list.

36
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:16,083
- Hold on one second.
- Sensei...

37
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,782
Hello, it's sempai.

38
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,903
Dwight.

39
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:23,201
You know what, let me give
you a call right back.

40
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm going to find it and then
I'll call you back. Thanks.

41
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,873
Yes, I just had a ques...
Yes, sensei.

42
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,202
Arigato goazai mashta. Hai.

43
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,683
- Was that you mom ?
- No. That was my sensei.

44
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,163
- Thought it was your mom.
- I am now sempai,

45
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:45,833
which is assistant sensei.

46
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:47,902
Assistant to the sensei,
that's pretty cool.

47
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:49,673
- Assistant sensei.
- Okay.

48
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:54,593
I am a practitioner of Goju-Ryu
ka-ra-te, here in Scranton.

49
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:56,863
- Hai !
- 2 !

50
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:59,612
- Hai !
- Dwight, stamp and kick back. 3.

51
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:05,140
My sensei, Ira, recently
promoted me to purple belt.

52
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:08,081
And gave me duties of a sempai.

53
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:11,653
Not that a lot of people here in
America know what a sempai is.

54
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:14,692
But it's equally as
respected as a sensei.

55
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:22,272
I don't want to stay until
7:00 again this year.

56
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:25,571
I don't really have any
control over that, Stanley.

57
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:34,210
Michael tends to procrastinate...
a bit whenever he has to do work.

58
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:39,370
Time cards.
He has to sign these every Friday.

59
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,460
Purchase orders have to be approved
at the end of every month.

60
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:44,453
And expense reports.

61
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:48,491
All he has to do is initial these,
at the end of every quarter.

62
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:52,571
But once a year, it all falls on
the same Friday. And that's today.

63
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:54,750
I call it the perfect storm.

64
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:56,993
"I don't want to work,"

65
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:59,901
"I just want to bang
on this mug all day."

66
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:02,021
Did you ask me here
for any specific reason?

67
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:04,983
Ah, yes, I did.
Here's the bizzle.

68
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:09,683
I have a very top secret
mission for you.

69
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:13,191
I want you to update all the
emergency contact information.

70
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,982
- Why is that secret ?
- Hello. Oh, God

71
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:18,372
Busy work.
Ah, get away, get away. Cretin.

72
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:20,802
I put stickers so you know
where to sign.

73
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:22,272
Yes, thanks, I know where to sign.

74
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,621
It's  just that last year, you...

75
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:26,170
Last year, they were out of
order, weren't they, Pam.

76
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:30,372
Well, the last pickup for
overnight deliveries is at 7:00.

77
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,692
So you need to have them
signed by then. Or much earlier.

78
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:36,772
Shalax, Pam.
Stop Pam-MSing.

79
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:39,021
That's pretty good.

80
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:41,442
Actually, I'm sending Ryan
on a top secret mission.

81
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,853
Tell her what it is.

82
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:46,022
Updating emergency contacts ?

83
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:49,463
Well, is that really a priority ?

84
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:51,423
Is it a priority ?
Oh, I don't know.

85
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:54,221
What if there's a tornado, Pam ?

86
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:56,232
People's legs are crushed
under rubble.

87
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:59,922
Please, would you be so kind as to
call my wife ? No I can't.

88
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,812
Because we don't have any
emergency contact information.

89
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:04,820
Because Pam said
it wasn't a priority.

90
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:06,410
Think. Think with your head Pam.

91
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,322
Okay, well, she walks out.

92
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,983
That's the problem with being a
boss, is that when you are tough,

93
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:15,130
they resent you, and when you
are cool, they walk all over you.

94
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:20,242
- Catch-22.
- Catch-22,  yes.

95
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:26,320
Why don't you give me your contact
information to start with ?

96
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:27,723
Okay? What's your cell ?

97
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:31,870
- Larissa Halpert.
- What's her address ?

98
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,393
- 117 Vonburgen Street.
- Hello.

99
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:37,700
<i>Hey Ryan.</i>

100
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,851
This is Michael Jackson,
calling from Wonderland.

101
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:46,010
You mean Neverland ?

102
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:49,461
This is Tito.

103
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:54,333
What ?

104
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:57,641
<i>Calling from...</i>

105
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:01,073
Your major and minor
lines cross at a ridge.

106
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:03,692
That sucks.

107
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:05,992
You're making this up as
you go along, aren't you ?

108
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:10,313
- I am just following the web site.
- Well, at least I don't have cavities.

109
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,830
Yes, you have very nice teeth.

110
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:14,303
T hanks

111
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:16,440
Who's your emergency contact ?

112
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,553
Stacey.

113
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:24,711
Pick up.

114
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,351
Hello ?

115
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:31,112
This is Mike Tyson.

116
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,633
Hey, Dwight.

117
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:39,833
As sempai, do you ever think
there's gonna be a day,

118
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:43,322
where humans and robots can
peacefully coexist ?

119
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:45,440
Impossible.

120
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,302
The way they're programmed...

121
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,150
- You're mocking me.
- No, I'm not.

122
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:53,492
Well, let me offer you
a little piece of advice.

123
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:57,222
I am not afraid, to make
an example out of you.

124
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,853
That's not advice.
What advice sounds like is this.

125
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:04,841
Don't ever bring your
purple belt to work,

126
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:07,480
because someone might... 
steal it.

127
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:09,622
- Okay, give that back to me.
- Okay, say please.

128
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,710
- No, that is not a toy.
- Please.

129
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,122
- Please ?
- Good.

130
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:15,450
And it absolutely is a toy.
Arigato.

131
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:18,711
Arigato. This is not a toy.
This is a message,

132
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:21,270
for the entire office.

133
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:24,441
So that everyone could see that I am
capable of physically dominating them.

134
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:30,822
And this is more of
a ying yang thing.

135
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:33,943
The Michael is all cursive,
Scott all caps.

136
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:35,573
Left  brain, right brain.

137
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,143
Or duality of man.

138
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,661
Could you practice on the forms ?

139
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,491
No women or children,
unless provoked.

140
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:48,920
Okay, Roy.

141
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:51,540
- Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
- Okay

142
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,141
Michael. Could you beat up Michael ?

143
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,480
Yeah, I don't think
that would happen.

144
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:58,316
- Cause we're friends.
- Because I would kick his ass.

145
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,130
Well, Dwight's a purple belt. So...

146
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:03,636
So ? I've beat up black belts.
Yeah.

147
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,102
How'd you know they were
black belts ?

148
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:07,620
They told me, after.

149
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:12,492
See, I used to run with a very
tough crowd, street fighter types.

150
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,380
Real, real bad people.

151
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:16,983
I'm just lucky I got out.

152
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,513
Is your wife still your contact ?

153
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:21,641
Ex-wife, yeah.

154
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:24,672
Her last name is Becker now.

155
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:27,433
Okay.

156
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:28,973
You don't need to write ex.

157
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,160
And after that, nobody ever messed
with the damn rascals ever again.

158
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:36,131
Sounds tough.

159
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:38,690
When you're a jet, your're a jet
all the way, right ?

160
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:39,710
You're a jet ?

161
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:41,623
Have you signed
the expense reports yet?

162
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:43,282
Yes, in theory I have.

163
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:45,850
I just need to cross some
Ts and dot some Is.

164
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:48,740
Alright.

165
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:53,120
I am going to be in my office
if anybody needs me.

166
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,603
Oh Michael !

167
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:59,191
Sleeper hold. Bedtime for vato.

168
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:03,361
- Stop it.
- You are, the weakest link !

169
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:07,250
I'm friends with everybody
in this office.

170
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,401
We're all best friends
I love everybody here.

171
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:13,072
But sometimes your best friends,

172
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:17,661
start coming in to work late and,
start having dentist appointments

173
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:19,123
that aren't dentist appointments.

174
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:21,310
And that is when it's nice
to let them know

175
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:23,233
that you could beat them up.

176
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:26,110
- Just hit me. You'll see.
- I can't,

177
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,942
- cause I just got a manicure. So...
- Oh, queer !

178
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:32,153
Eye, Queer Eye. That's a good show.
Important show.

179
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,222
Go ahead, do it.

180
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,300
- Just have Dwight punch you.
- Oh, yeah

181
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:38,352
Well, that would be
kind of worthless,

182
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:41,190
because I know a ton of 14 years
old girls who could kick his ass.

183
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:44,000
- You know a ton of 14-year-old girls ?
- What belt are they ?

184
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,013
Look, Dwight is a wuss.

185
00:09:46,348 --> 00:09:47,943
- When we rented Armageddon...
- No...

186
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:49,500
he cried at the end of it.
He did.

187
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,540
Michael, I told you...

188
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,223
That was because it was
New Year's Eve,

189
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,091
and it started to snow
at exactly midnight.

190
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:56,791
"Oh, Bruce Willis, they're going to
leave him on the asteroid."

191
00:09:56,836 --> 00:09:59,000
- Okay I'll punch you.
- Okay, here we go.

192
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:00,511
Alright, come on.

193
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:09,900
Did I want to harm Michael, the one
man I've been hired to protect ?

194
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:12,380
- No, I did not.
- Are you okay ?

195
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:14,371
- Yes.
- Are you sure you're all right ?

196
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:17,541
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

197
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,071
I come from a long line of fighters.

198
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:28,370
My maternal grandfather, was
the toughest guy I ever knew.

199
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:31,321
World War II veteran.
Killed 20 men,

200
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:34,520
then spent the rest of the
war in an allied prison camp.

201
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:40,000
My father battled blood
pressure and obesity all his life.

202
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,500
Different kind of fight.

203
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:45,871
Okay, he has to be stopped.

204
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:48,783
Please, please, please,
please, just ask Michael.

205
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,201
- I don't know.
- <i>Okay</i>

206
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:57,010
Okay. I'll buy you a bag of chips.

207
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:58,200
<i>Why are you twisting around?</i>

208
00:10:58,236 --> 00:10:59,820
- French onion ?
- Obviously.

209
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,331
<i>Kevin, why are you
spinning around ?</i>

210
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:02,381
- Okay.
- Yes.

211
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,752
Take this pen, okay.

212
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,762
<i>And stab me with it.</i>

213
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,581
- <i>Go away.</i>
- I just have a quick question.

214
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:12,122
I haven't signed them, okay ?

215
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:13,961
No, it's not that.

216
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,910
I was just wondering, since I'm
probably going to have to stay late

217
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:21,963
could you ask Dwight to stay late too,
so he can walk me to my car ?

218
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:23,852
<i>Nice.</i>

219
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:25,673
<i>Come in.</i>

220
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,422
Pam, I hate to break this to you,

221
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,752
but Dwight can't stop you
from being mugged.

222
00:11:33,188 --> 00:11:34,581
He's just not tough enough.

223
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:36,322
He's a purple belt.
That's really high.

224
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,420
I could beat up Dwight.
That's ridiculous.

225
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:39,562
I can murder him.

226
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,663
- It's just that out there, you...
- Oh, is that what they're saying?

227
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,263
- Yeah, kind of.
- Okay.

228
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:45,782
Alright.

229
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:47,523
Where's Dwight ?

230
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:48,901
- Kitchen.
- Okay.

231
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:55,062
<i>Try it again. Here we go.</i>

232
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:56,521
Good.

233
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,700
- It way actually pretty good, right ?
- Excellent.

234
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:00,380
Now  watch.
Let me take you from behind.

235
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,233
Watch out Kelly,
might sucker punch you.

236
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:04,512
- I didn't sucker punch you Michael.
- No, really ?

237
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:07,201
In case you didn't remember,
I was defending my honor.

238
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:09,121
- Like samouraï.
- Really, oh, is that it ?

239
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,630
Well, the offer, Dwight,
was for one punch,

240
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:13,321
which I absorbed.

241
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:17,773
I had no idea that there'd be a
second punch. So, catch-22.

242
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:20,420
Okay, fine, tit for tit.

243
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:23,103
Give it your best shot,
two punches, go.

244
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:24,992
Look, if we were in a bar,

245
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:26,691
right now, there would be
two punches.

246
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:28,521
Me punching you and
you hitting the floor.

247
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:30,750
No, I'd block your first punch,
rending ineffective.

248
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:31,590
- Really
- Yeah

249
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:34,222
You know what, you're just lucky
that we're at work right now.

250
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:37,093
- What about, Dwight's dojo ?
- No, they just have classes.

251
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:38,640
It's free during the day,
it's fine.

252
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:39,843
- Look !
- I've got the key.

253
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,091
- Hey, Michael !
- Hey, Toby.

254
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:41,952
Any word on those...

255
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:45,000
You know what ? I have an idea,
why don't you just leave right now?

256
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:47,521
Why don't you walk away
from the room, okay ?

257
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,030
Fine.

258
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:51,793
We'll go at lunch.

259
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:54,791
Pam, make an announcement.

260
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:57,610
Figure out carpools.

261
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:03,191
<i>Well, we're all getting
excited to see this fight</i>

262
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:06,710
The Albany branch is working right
through lunch to prevent downsizing.

263
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:10,501
But Michael, he decided to
extend our lunch by an hour...

264
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,200
so that we could all go down to
the dojo and watch him fight Dwight.

265
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:19,513
Fight, Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, I'm coming, fight.

266
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:25,283
Sorry.

267
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:38,203
I recognize that. That is Japanese
for California roll.

268
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:39,441
No it's not.

269
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:41,161
I think it is, a guy told me
about that.

270
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:43,451
Actually, it's a symbol
for eternal discipline.

271
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:46,813
- Wow, that is really interesting.
- What ?

272
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:49,571
Your love line... I'm just kidding,
I can't see anything.

273
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,040
Look closer.

274
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,610
- Oh-kay.
- One point for me.

275
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:54,810
- Tied up.
- Oh you're dead

276
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:57,413
What ? What are you going to do?
Bring it Beesly. Bring it.

277
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:58,951
Ooh, yeah. Good move.

278
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,382
Ooh, not such an ultimate
fighter now, huh ?

279
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,690
Hey, put me down.
Put me down !

280
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:05,851
Oh my God. Hey, put me down.

281
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,260
Hey. 

282
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,913
Okay, gentlemen, listen up.

283
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:16,280
After a clean strike to the chest,

284
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:19,921
stomach, or kidneys, I will
separate you and award a point.

285
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:21,650
First person to three wins, alright?

286
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,591
- Yes, sensei !
- Lot of rules. Lot of rules.

287
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:26,232
On the street, we didn't
have any rules. Maybe one,

288
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,092
no kicks to the groin,
home for dinner.

289
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:29,601
Hajime!

290
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:32,661
-  What the hell was that ?
- Dwight.

291
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:33,633
- Yes.
- No way.

292
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:34,510
- One point.
- Okay.

293
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:35,422
- Eat it !
- Alright

294
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,471
- That's the way you want to do it ?
- Two more.

295
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,700
You want to play dirty, huh?
Okay, game on, man.

296
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:42,103
- Sweep the leg.
- I'm coming at you, man.

297
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,523
Ha ! Okay, purple belt.

298
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:52,533
- Okay, I got it.
- No.

299
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,313
- I got his pants.
- That was my pants.

300
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:56,343
No points for pants.

301
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:59,602
Dwight, you have...
No, look. No, you have something...

302
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:00,972
You have something...

303
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:03,023
God, you look like such an idiot.

304
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,271
Clean technique gentlemen.

305
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:15,812
Come on. Do that again.
Do that again. I dare you.

306
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:20,131
Okay, break. Break. No holding.

307
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:22,631
Oh, you can't see ?
You can't see ?

308
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:25,183
One point. Two points. Three points.

309
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:27,283
- I said break.
- How many points now ?

310
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:28,673
I win, I win.

311
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,200
No, you didn't.

312
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:35,563
Eight points, nine points.

313
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,492
Stop it. No.

314
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,531
Come on, Michael!

315
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,572
- Open your mouth.
- No, Michael !

316
00:15:58,227 --> 00:15:59,341
You talkin' to me ?

317
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,620
You talkin' to me ?

318
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:04,071
Raging Bull, Pacino.

319
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:06,883
Oh, I want that footage.
I want it. I need it.

320
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,062
Oh, I have to get back to work.
I have lots of work.

321
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:12,871
Check this out, come here.

322
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:15,353
There he is, Mr.Temp.

323
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:17,943
Having lunch by the car.

324
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,740
Let us play with him.

325
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:22,381
See what we can learn.

326
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,421
Oh, we're playing phone tag.

327
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:34,533
<i>Seven new messages.</i>

328
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,121
<i>First new message.</i>

329
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:38,942
<i>Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein.</i>

330
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:43,453
<i>- Next message.</i>
<i>- Hey Ryan, this is your girlfriend.</i>

331
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,440
<i>And I'm mad.</i>

332
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:10,582
My emergency contact
is Todd Packer.

333
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,971
Todd F. Packer

334
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:16,292
- You know what the F stands for ?
- Fudge ?

335
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:19,053
Yeah.
Oh, come in.

336
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,073
Oh, hey, Karate Kid.

337
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,032
The Hillary Swank version.

338
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,341
Hi, how are you ?

339
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:27,912
I need to change my emergency
contact information

340
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:29,291
from Michael Scott.

341
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,493
- Okay, to what ?
- Just put...

342
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:34,880
The hospital.

343
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:36,891
Contact number :

344
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:38,282
Just put 911.

345
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:41,871
He is such a sore loser.

346
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:43,732
You heard obviously,

347
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,451
that I mopped the floor
with him this afternoon.

348
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:51,543
You know what, do yourself a favor.
Just leave me as his contact.

349
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,843
And I will call the hospital.
Cut out the middleman.

350
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,160
- Later Jim.
- Later Kev.

351
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:16,320
- Have a good weekend.
- Yeah, you too.

352
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:29,842
Yeah.

353
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:31,460
I have the emergency contacts.

354
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:34,031
Just lay 'em on the chair.
I'll take it from here.

355
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,982
So what you up to this weekend ?

356
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:40,282
Hanging out with some
friends probably.

357
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,321
Well, if you do anything crazy,
give me a shout.

358
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,340
Yeah. Alright, I will, 
see you Monday.

359
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,590
Alright. Bye.

360
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:57,702
- Dwight ?
- Michael, did you finish yet ?

361
00:18:57,907 --> 00:19:00,230
This close. Dwight, may I speak
with you for a minute.

362
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:01,292
I'm busy.

363
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:03,152
Well, busier.
But I'm making the time.

364
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:05,432
Michael, can't your conversation
wait till Monday ?

365
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:06,823
- We want to go home.
- Well,

366
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:09,190
You  don't even have anybody
to go home to, Toby. So...

367
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,213
The shipping place closes
in a half hour.

368
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,261
I know.

369
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,443
But I've been carrying the
load on my back all day.

370
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:18,471
And if everyone would
just chip in a little bit,

371
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,011
might help me out.

372
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:22,263
What do you say ?

373
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:24,063
Let's gang bang this thing
and go home.

374
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,143
Good.

375
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,320
- This is illegal.
- I don't care.

376
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:41,212
I have been testing you
the entire day.

377
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:42,921
Did you know that ?

378
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,191
Of course.

379
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:48,342
And I'm happy to say that you passed.

380
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:51,452
So, effective immediately,
I am promoting you,

381
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,062
from assistant
to the regional manager

382
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,923
to assistant regional manager.

383
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,931
Michael...

384
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,550
I don't know.
I, I know. I know. I know.

385
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:07,033
I know. I wouldn't be offering it if
I didn't think you could handle it.

386
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:10,050
- I can handle it, I can.
- I know. Okay.

387
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:16,011
So I guess this'll just by my office.

388
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:18,733
No. No. Title change only.

389
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,201
- I'll have Pam send out a memo.
- No, nope.

390
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:22,631
Three month probationary period.

391
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,663
Let's just not tell anybody
about this right now.

392
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,391
- Just a formality ?
- Absolutely.

393
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,931
But not really.

394
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,483
Michael.

395
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:38,192
I have so much, to learn, from you.

396
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,861
Yes you do.

397
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:44,662
Thank you.

398
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:47,361
Sensei.

399
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,383
And, Ditto.

400
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:57,000
I told Dwight that there
is honor in losing.

401
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:59,413
Which as we all know is
completely ridiculous.

402
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:03,560
But, there is, however, honor in
making a loser feel better.

403
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:05,602
Which is what I just did
for Dwight.

404
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,661
Would I rather be feared or loved ?

405
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:15,170
Easy. Both. I want people to be
afraid of how much they love me.

406
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:18,492
And I think I proved
that today at the dojo.

407
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,493
- Typewriter torture.
- Sensei help !

408
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,541
- No.
- Typewriter !
