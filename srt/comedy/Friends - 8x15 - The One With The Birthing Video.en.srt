1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,545
- Oh! Hey, Rach!
- Hi.

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,548
- Happy Valentine's Day!
- You too!

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,300
How's living at Ross'?

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:14,140
It's good, except he makes us watch
the Discovery Channel all day long.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:19,812
Something really boring happened
to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.

6
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,482
Oh, thank you.
I'll see you guys later.

7
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,739
That is one lucky
to-go cup of coffee.

8
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,286
I wish you'd get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.

9
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:41,249
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,335
Thanks. Maybe later.

11
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,923
- Gunther, can I get a scone?
- Want anything?

12
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,258
I want a lot of things.

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,262
I wanna be with the woman I love!

14
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,430
I want her to love me back.

15
00:00:55,639 --> 00:01:01,353
And I want relief from the wrenching
pain of knowing that won't happen!

16
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,064
We have red bagels.

17
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,276
Okay.

18

21
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,735
How does Mona feel about
Rachel moving in?

22
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,071
I'm on my way to tell her.

23
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,366
She's been away all week,
but she'll be cool.

24
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,242
She's been so supportive.

25
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,955
She even got the baby a T-shirt
that says "Fossils are my friends."

26
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,251
Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.

27
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,461
So I'm gonna take off.

28
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,799
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!
Rachel wanted to see this tape.

29
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,761
- What is it?
- My friend giving birth.

30
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,680
Could you take it to your apartment?

31
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,851
"Candy and Cookie"?

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,728
Candy's the mom,
Cookie's the daughter.

33
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,189
The father's name is also Cookie.

34
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,069
Why am I friends with these people?

35
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,198
I wanna show you
something in the bathroom.

36
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,991
Monica, grow up.

37
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:45,791
- What's behind your back?
- Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.

38
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,877
- You don't want my opinion?
- Not really.

39
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,880
Come on, I'm your older brother.
Ask me.

40
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,882
Okay, big brother.

41
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:59,471
Which one would make your best friend
want to do your little sister?

42
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,811
The red one.

43
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,528
Hey.

44
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:19,199
I know you're depressed,
so I brought someone to cheer you up.

45
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,036
Right outside is a real,
live, furry playmate.

46
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,415
I'm not sleeping
with your friend Jane again.

47
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,339
Hey, a dog!

48
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:37,009
Who, you gotta admit,
looks a lot like Jane.

49
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:42,013
He's the happiest dog ever.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.

50
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,309
So you can keep him
till he cheers you up.

51
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,771
Thanks so much, Pheebs.
We are gonna have so much fun!

52
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,940
Oh, not that kind of fun.

53
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,492
Happy Valentine's!

54
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:08,165
I'm slipping into something a bit less
comfortable and a bit more slutty.

55
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,420
"Candy and Cookie"?

56
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,176
"Candy and Cookie"?!

57
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,761
Monica got me porn?

58
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:26,099
Girl-on-girl porn?!

59
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,394
She really must love me!

60
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,659
"- Yeah", "just relax."
- I love you, St. Valentine.

61
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,128
Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.

62
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,797
<i>Now push!</i>

63
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,467
"Oh", "God", "it hurts!"

64
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:04,013
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!

65
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:08,350
"- Oh", "make it stop!"
- I am trying!

66
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,980
Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,191
You're cute, but you're not too smart.

68
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,572
Did I just throw this?

69
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,492
- Hi.
- Hi.

70
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:29,038
I accidentally packed these
with my stuff.

71
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,500
- Who is this?
- Phoebe's friend's dog.

72
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,045
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.

73
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:42,384
You are so cute. I wish I could play,
but I've gotta go to work.

74
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:47,014
I hope I stop talking like this
before my meeting. Yes, I do.

75
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,934
Bye-bye, Joey.
Seriously, I can't stop it.

76
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,815
Come here! Hey!

77
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,527
That's Rachel. She used to live here.

78
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:04,657
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.

79
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,576
But we can't have her.

80
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,454
I really miss her.

81
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,708
Hey, you understand, right?
You're a guy.

82
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,752
Well, you used to be.

83
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,265
So, what do you think?

84
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,227
I've still got it.

85
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,982
- Why did you get me this?
- What is it?

86
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,986
It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.

87
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,615
Oh, the dilating!

88
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:52,746
Is this the video of the birth? It's
Phoebe's. Why were you watching it?

89
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:01,463
I thought maybe you got me porn
for Valentine's Day.

90
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:07,219
If you thought I was gonna
get you porn for Valentine's Day...

91
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,387
...you were right.

92
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:14,768
It's about a girl who moves
to the city in search of stardom...

93
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,313
...but ends up having sex
with a lot of guys.

94
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:19,982
It got four stars.

95
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,609
Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.

96
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,072
- Anyway, you wanna take a look?
- Well...

97
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:32,453
- I'm not really in a sexy mood.
- Hey, what's going on?

98
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,623
Remember the first time
you saw "Jaws..."

99
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,877
...how long it took
to go back in the water?

100
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,840
We can't let this tape
wreck Valentine's Day.

101
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:49,761
- You don't know. You didn't see it.
- Childbirth is beautiful.

102
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,514
Oh, beautiful? Really?

103
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,184
You think this is beautiful?

104
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,816
Oh, my God!
No wonder my mother hates me!

105
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,570
- See, honey, there's...
- Don't touch me!

106
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,659
- Hi!
- Hey!

107
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,913
- How was Atlantic City?
- Good.

108
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,624
I brought you back a present.

109
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,709
You didn't have to...

110
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,170
Saltwater taffy?!

111
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,964
Thanks.

112
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,093
Interestingly, it isn't made
with seawater.

113
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,972
It's actually made
with salted fresh water.

114
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,516
That's not interesting.

115
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,145
- I think it's interesting.
- Me too. I missed you!

116
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,399
- How was your week?
- Good.

117
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,027
- The baby started kicking.
- How exciting!

118
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:52,074
It was amazing. The only thing is,
I wasn't there the first time.

119
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:56,369
- Oh, no.
- I was missing out on all this stuff.

120
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:01,625
- Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
- Yeah, right.

121
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,504
- What?
- Joey cracks me up.

122
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:09,800
"Have your ex-wife move in.
That wouldn't be awkward."

123
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,098
Lmagine, I go away for a few days...

124
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:21,103
...and my boyfriend is living
with a woman he got pregnant.

125
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,399
So, what'd you tell him?

126
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,956
You didn't tell Mona
Rachel moved in?

127
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,793
She seemed to think
it was such a crazy idea.

128
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:49,089
Plus, she got me taffy.

129
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,134
- Really? I've never had any.
- Ever?

130
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:57,222
My mom was too busy planning her
suicide to provide saltwater treats.

131
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,474
Thank you.

132
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,227
Are you gonna tell her?

133
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,147
I will. I want to butter her up first.

134
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:09,860
I'm gonna take her to dinner,
do all this romantic stuff.

135
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,280
When she thinks
I'm the best boyfriend ever...

136
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,534
...I'll tell her my pregnant
ex-girlfriend is living with me.

137
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:22,623
If I haven't said it before,
she's a lucky, lucky lady.

138
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:27,670
So where are...?
What the crap is up with this stuff?

139
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:33,592
Is it gum? Is it food?
What's the deal?

140
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,305
Oh, it's nice.
May I try a pink one?

141
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:46,980
So between her and me being friends,
and her history with Ross...

142
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:49,275
...it just isn't gonna happen.

143
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:53,779
It'd be like you falling in love
with a cat.

144
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,240
- Hey.
- Hey.

145
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:02,204
How's my favorite dog, huh?
How's my favorite dog?

146
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,790
You're subdued.

147
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,752
- Did you give him a beer?
- No.

148
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:12,923
- Will you excuse us? We need to talk.
- Sure.

149
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,134
Oh, me, right.

150
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,641
- He's miserable. What happened to him?
- Nothing.

151
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,227
- We talked about stuff.
- What stuff?

152
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,937
Rachel stuff.

153
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:33,944
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
This is the happiest dog in the world.

154
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,613
He spends a day with you, and look!

155
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,325
He's breathing.

156
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,913
- I'll take him to Wendy's.
- He's fine.

157
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,205
Look.

158
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,831
Here's your ball!

159
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,335
Get your ball!
Get your ball!

160
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,840
God, what have I done to you?

161
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,677
I broke the dog, Pheebs!
I broke the dog!

162
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:05,184
I'm going to pick up Mona.
What are you doing tonight?

163
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,811
Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans.

164
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:12,357
I've got Chinese food on the way,
and your saltwater taffy.

165
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:16,820
Interestingly, it isn't made
with seawater...

166
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,282
We actually watched
the documentary together.

167
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,703
Oh, my Chinese food.
I'll get my cash.

168
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,543
Mona?

169
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,380
What are...?
Hi! How are you?

170
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,175
I'm supposed to pick you up.

171
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,220
I made you a Valentine's dinner.
Surprise!

172
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:50,103
- Oh! Hey, Mona!
- Hi, Rachel.

173
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,397
What's she doing here?

174
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,984
I have no idea.

175
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:59,280
I'll be watching TV
if anybody needs me.

176
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,365
What is she doing?

177
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,910
Lately she just likes
hanging out here.

178
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,497
- Why?
- I think she's lonely.

179
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,626
But it's Valentine's Day.
Can't we ask her to go?

180
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,171
Well, no, she's way too emotional.

181
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,758
And by emotional, I mean crazy!

182
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,347
That's just my Chinese food.

183
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,516
She has food delivered here?

184
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:32,562
Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.

185
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,610
I'm gonna get in my sweats
and eat this in bed.

186
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,451
And you thought
she was gonna be in our way!

187
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:50,372
Open the champagne,
and I will be right back.

188
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,918
- I've got a surprise.
- You got another ex-wife back there?

189
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,422
Please start drinking.

190
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,722
- I'm just gonna grab the phone.
- Rachel, wait.

191
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,601
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way.

192
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,188
- What are you doing?
- Do you need the phone?

193
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,231
No.

194
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,361
Ross is too nice to say it,
but this is his apartment.

195
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:24,949
We need boundaries, so why don't
you go back to your place?

196
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:28,160
But, Mona, I live here.

197
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,040
Happy Valentine's Day!

198
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:42,925
Or, something to remember me by.

199
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:54,478
- How long has it been this time?
- Ninety seconds.

200
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,565
Ninety seconds is a long time
not to think about it.

201
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,484
Except all I did was think about it.

202
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,362
I know. It haunts me.

203
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:09,409
Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was
my dad doing shots off the houseboy.

204
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,789
After this, I would gladly
make that my screen saver.

205
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,086
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.

206
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:20,713
I could do that.

207
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,721
Now all we gotta do
is get rid of this chair.

208
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,572
- Oh, thank God!
- I know.

209
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,740
Come in!

210
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:52,035
Hi. I'm sorry to barge in
on your Valentine.

211
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:55,956
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.

212
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,500
- Oh, my God.
- Poor Ross.

213
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:07,134
We watch him do yoga in his underwear,
but for this he closes the drapes.

214
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,764
You know that birthing tape
you wanted to see?

215
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,015
It's here.

216
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:17,394
We should warn you before
you watch it. Don't watch it.

217
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,105
You saw it? Is it scary?

218
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:23,818
It's ironic how footage
of someone being born...

219
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,112
...can make you want to kill yourself.

220
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,867
Now I'm all freaked out.
Will you watch it with me?

221
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:36,705
No, but I'll leave a sweater that
smells like me right next to you.

222
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:41,168
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me watch this alone.

223
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,965
She's right. Of course not.

224
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,343
Honey, get the tape.

225
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:00,437
This reminds me of a very specific
part of the tape.

226
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,818
Here we go.

227
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,736
Okay.

228
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,531
Oh, my.

229
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,160
"All right", "baby. One more time."

230
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,747
Why is that baby torturing that woman?

231
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:22,460
Why have I seen this thing
three times?

232
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,629
It's beautiful.

233
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:31,510
- It's horrible!
- I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!

234
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:36,473
- You guys! You guys, look!
- What? Did her ass explode?

235
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:42,104
No, the baby's out. Look.

236
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:47,943
Look at those little fingers and toes.

237
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,278
Look how happy the mom is now.

238
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:55,867
- Oh, Rach.
- Screw you! You don't have to do it!

239
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,790
- Hey.
- Hey!

240
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,544
- What's up?
- Mona just dumped me.

241
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,588
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?

242
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:13,302
Lately, I haven't exactly been
the perfect boyfriend.

243
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:16,137
I didn't tell her
I got Rachel pregnant.

244
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:21,435
I gave her a key to my apartment
and then had the locks changed.

245
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:25,231
Then I lied to her about Rachel
moving in with me.

246
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,360
In a way, I judge her for not
breaking up with me sooner.

247
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:34,365
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.

248
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:38,285
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?

249
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,413
Joey without a date
on Valentine's Day?

250
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,916
What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?

251
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,712
- Sort of.
- Really?

252
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,882
You don't have to seem
so happy about it.

253
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,593
Maybe I can help.

254
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,848
Whatever it is,
I am sure it has happened to me.

255
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,895
You know, actually,
once I got dumped during sex.

256
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:14,029
- So anyway, what is it?
- Forget about it. It's no big deal.

257
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,740
- Come on, what is it?
- It's nothing.

258
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,743
Hey, it's me.
Why can't you tell me?

259
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:25,833
Okay. Sit down.

260
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,465
There's this woman that I like a lot.

261
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,885
But it can't happen.

262
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,637
She's not a Tribbiani?

263
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,432
No!

264
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,895
So is she someone from work?

265
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,439
Yes.

266
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,067
Well, does she like you?

267
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,363
Sometimes I think she could.

268
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,157
But I can't do anything about it.

269
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,492
Why not?

270
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,536
It's complicated.

271
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,623
She was with this other guy.

272
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,001
Someone from work too.

273
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:14,090
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

274
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:20,221
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he still in love with her?

275
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,307
- No, I don't think so.
- Okay.

276
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,309
Is he a good guy?

277
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,854
Yeah, he's the best.

278
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,815
- Then talk to him.
- I don't know.

279
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:35,236
It's worth finding out,
if you like her.

280
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,071
I do, so much.

281
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,157
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't...

282
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,827
You know what?
You have to go for it.

283
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:49,207
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

284
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,877
Here's your warm milk.

285
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,509
I'm gonna put the bourbon
in it at home.

286
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:06,475
Anyway, seriously,
just talk to the guy, okay?

287
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,103
Let me know how it goes.

288
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,398
It's Rachel.

289
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:24,785
<i>You're having a baby</i>
<i>and you need to prepare.</i>

290
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:29,873
<i>You're gonna make yourself watch</i>
<i>the whole thing. Just do it!</i>

291
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:36,672
<i>I came to the big city</i>
<i>to become a star.</i>

292
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:41,510
<i>- I'll do anything to make that happen.</i>
<i>- Anything?</i>

293
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:46,223
<i>Maybe it starts with</i>
<i>how she gets pregnant.</i>

00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,187
