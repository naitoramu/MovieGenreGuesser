00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,342
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,595
Hey, Eddie.

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:16,099
- What are you doing here?
- Watching you sleep.

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,601
Why?

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,479
It makes me feel peaceful.

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,147
Please.

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,607
I can't sleep now!

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,610
You want me to sing?

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,156
That's it. I want you
out of the apartment now!

11
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,325
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,536
Hannibal Lecter?

13
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,872
Better roommate than you.

14
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,959
I don't think you're being fair!
One night you see me and you get scared.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,922
What about the other nights
when you don't see me?

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,132
Last night you went
and got some water...

17
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,970
...and I was nice enough
to hide behind the door.

18
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,306
I didn't realize that.

19
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,476
Get out now!

20
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,352
You really want me out?

21
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,561
Yes, please.

22
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,565
Then I want to hear you say
you want me out.

23
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,899
I want you out.

24
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,361
I want to hear it from your lips.

25
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,654
Where'd you hear it before?

26
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,990
All right. You know what?
Consider me gone.

27
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:19,037
I'll be out by the time
you get home from work tomorrow.

28
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,582
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- I heard that.

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,128

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

31
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,221
Well, look at you!

32
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,600
Finally got that
time machine working, huh?

33
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,726
You like it?

34
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,770
This guy was selling them
on 8th Avenue and I thought...

35
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,022
..."You know what I don't have?"

36
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,733
A mirror?

37
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,945
Fine, make fun.
I think it's jaunty.

38
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,574
For a guy who's recently lost his job,
you're in a good mood.

39
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,994
I'll be all right.
I'm not starting from square one.

40
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:45,332
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray
on "Days of our Lives".

41
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,710
That's got to have some kind of cachet.

42
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,880
Cachet? Jaunty?

43
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,342
Chandler gave me
word-of-the-day toilet paper.

44
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,888
I'm gonna get some coffee.

45
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,349
So? Did you read the book?

46
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,726
Oh, my God.
It was incredible!

47
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,229
Didn't it, like,
totally speak to you?

48
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,522
What book is this?

49
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:13,193
You have to read this book.
It's called "Be Your Own Wind Keeper".

50
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,612
It's about how women need
to become more empowered.

51
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,909
But there's wind.

52
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,786
And the wind can make us goddesses.

53
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:28,291
Do you know who takes our wind?
Men. They just take it.

54
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,669
Men just take our wind?

55
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,007
All the time. Because they
are the lightning-bearers.

56
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,971
That sounds kind of cool.
It's like "The Hobbit".

57
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,849
It is nothing like "The Hobbit".

58
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,685
It's like reading about
every relationship I've ever had.

59
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,061
Except for Richard.

60
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:51,816
Richard would never steal your wind.

61
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,526
Because he's yummy.

62
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,777
But all the others.

63
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,864
And the part about how
they're always drinking...

64
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,991
...from our pool of inner power.

65
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,452
But God forbid we should take a sip.

66
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,787
Anybody want a cruller?

67
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,541
This is a typical
lightning-bearer thing.

68
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,208
It's like...

69
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,673
..."Hello. Who wants one of
my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"

70
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:26,391
Don't worry about it, already!
Things happen.

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,854
You're not mad at me
for getting fired and everything?

72
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,689
Look at me.

73
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,943
Look at me!

74
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,238
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

75
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,076
Can we get back to me?

76
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:48,539
Look, honey. People get fired
left and right in this business.

77
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,834
I already got you an audition
for "Another World".

78
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,044
All right!

79
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,171
"Cab Driver Number 2"?

80
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,341
You're welcome.

81
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,093
But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

82
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,806
How can I go from being
a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

83
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,351
Things change. Roll with them.

84
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,770
But this is a two-line part!

85
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,105
It's like taking a step backwards.

86
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,776
I'm not gonna do this.

87
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,405
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told Al Minza...

88
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,909
...and his pyramid of dogs.

89
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:31,122
Take any job you can get,
and don't make on the floor.

90
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,500
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,503
I'll see you.

92
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,839
God!

93
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,174
Oh, God!
I mean, it's just so...

94
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,260
Isn't it?

95
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,971
This is like reading
about my own life!

96
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:50,684
This book could have been called
"Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel"!

97
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,811
It wouldn't have sold
a million copies...

98
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,773
...but it would've made
a nice gift for you.

99
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,570
Sweetie, we've got to go.

100
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:09,452
No! Why do we always have to do
everything according to your timetable?

101
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,498
Actually, it's the movie theater
that has the timetable.

102
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,919
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

103
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:23,634
This isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you stealing my wind.

104
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:27,304
You go, girl!

105
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,434
I can't pull that off, can I?

106
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,604
Excuse me, your wind?

107
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,314
Yes, my wind.

108
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:42,652
How do you expect me to grow
if you won't let me blow?

109
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,203
You know I don't...

110
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:56,000
...have a problem with that.

111
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:10,264
I just really need to be
with myself right now.

112
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,349
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,103
You're right.
I don't have to apologize.

114
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,481
Sorry. Damn it!

115
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,196
- What is it?
- I don't know.

116
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,157
It's got all this stuff
about wind and trees...

117
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,993
...and some sacred pool.

118
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:34,413
I don't really get it.
But she's pretty upset about it.

119
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:39,001
This is why I don't date
women who read.

120
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,338
What's that?

121
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,090
It's my VIS A bill.

122
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,134
Envelope one of two.

123
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:53,015
- That can't be good.
- Open it, open it.

124
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,685
Oh, my God!

125
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,313
Look at this!
How did I spend so much money?

126
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:04,902
That's just the minimum amount.
That's your total.

127
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:09,948
Thirty-five hundred dollars
at "Porcelain Safari"?

128
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,535
My animals.

129
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:17,831
The guy said they suited me. He spoke
with an accent. I was confused.

130
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,416
I don't know what to do!

131
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,586
You can start by driving a cab
on "Another World".

132
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,546
- What?
- That audition?

133
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,548
That's a two-line part!

134
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,927
Joey, you owe $ 1100
at "I Love Lucite".

135
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,305
- So what?
- So suck it up, man.

136
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,223
It's a job. It's money.

137
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:40,104
I don't need you getting judgmental
and condescending and pedantic.

138
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,232
Toilet paper?

139
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,569
I'm not being any of those things.
I'm being realistic.

140
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,612
You're supposed to be my friend!

141
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,697
I am your friend.

142
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,992
Then tell me things like,
"You'll be fine."

143
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,328
And "Something big's gonna
come along. I know it!"

144
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,871
But I don't know it.

145
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:03,168
What I do know is you owe $ 2300
at "Isn't It Chromantic?"

146
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,920
I'm aware of what I owe.

147
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,965
Then get some sense.
It took you 10 years to get that job.

148
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,010
- How long till you get another?
- I don't want to hear this!

149
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,304
I'm just saying...

150
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:17,224
Well, don't "just say"!

151
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,061
Maybe I should just go.

152
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,232
I'll see you later.

153
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,025
Just think about it.

154
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,111
I don't need to think about it!

155
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,572
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

156
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,657
That was huge!

157
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,284
Big things are gonna happen!
You'll see!

158
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,911
Ross!

159
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,206
You still there?

160
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,472
What are you still doing here?

161
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,558
Just some basic dehydrating
of fruits and vegetables.

162
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,478
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

163
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,522
Aren't you forgetting anything?

164
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,899
Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.

165
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,985
He's feistier than the last one.

166
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:14,740
Maybe because the last one
was made by Pepperidge Farm.

167
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,410
Eddie, isn't there something
you're supposed to be doing now?

168
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,037
Not unless it's got something
to do with dehydrating.

169
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,667
Because right now,
I'm a dehydrating maniac!

170
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:30,297
I thought we had a deal.
I thought by the time I got...

171
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,215
You know what that is?

172
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,386
Your last roommate's kidney?

173
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,388
That's a tomato.

174
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:42,268
This one definitely goes
in the display.

175
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,611
Hey, Gunther.
Let me get a lemonade to go.

176
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,029
Lemonade?

177
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,448
You okay, man?

178
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,241
It's career stuff.

179
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,286
They killed off
my character on the show.

180
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:04,081
That's too bad.
How'd they do it?

181
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,209
I fell down an elevator shaft.

182
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,543
That sucks.

183
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,964
I was buried in an avalanche.

184
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,090
What?

185
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,344
I used to be Brice
on "All My Children".

186
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,825
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

187
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,244
There'll be no more
watching me sleep! No more...

188
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,080
...watching!

189
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,797
I got some great stuff to dehydrate.
Grapes, apricots.

190
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,884
I thought it'd be cool to see
what happens with these water balloons.

191
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:02,556
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!

192
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,391
- What?
- You! Move out!

193
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:08,645
Take your fruit!
Your stupid small fruit and get out!

194
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,358
You want me to move out?

195
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:25,245
I gotta tell you, that's kind of
out of the blue, don't you think?

196
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,705
This is not out of the blue!

197
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,625
This is smack-dab
in the middle of the blue!

198
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,587
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

199
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,965
You don't have to tell me twice.

200
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,761
Someone will be by for my stuff.

201
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:48,686
If you think I'm leaving you
alone with my fish, you're insane!

202
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:49,937
You want some help?

203
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,649
No help required, "chico"!

204
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,034
All the way to the airport, huh?
You know, that's over 30 miles.

205
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,537
That's gonna cost you about so bucks.

206
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,583
Excuse me, that's fifty bucks.

207
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,004
Five-O dollars.

208
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:19,049
You know what it is?
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

209
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,011
When I was on "Days of our Lives"
as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

210
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:26,682
...they'd send over
the whole script on real paper.

211
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,725
That's great.

212
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,980
If you wanted to expand this scene,
like have the cab crash...

213
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,065
...I could attend to the victims...

214
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,693
...because I have a background
in medical acting.

215
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,488
Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.

216
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:46,534
Don't thank me for coming in.
At least let me finish.

217
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,499
We could take the expressway...

218
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:56,544
...but this time of day
you're better off taking the budge.

219
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:01,634
You were going for bridge there,
weren't you?

220
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:05,179
I'll have a good day.

221
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:09,975
Question number 28.

222
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,688
"Have you ever allowed
a lightning-bearer to take your wind?"

223
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,191
I would have to say no.

224
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,820
And I would have to say...

225
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,946
What?

226
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,865
Do you not remember the puppet guy?

227
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:31,371
You totally let him wash his feet
in the pool of your inner power.

228
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,374
And his puppet too!

229
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,751
Well, at least
I didn't let some guy...

230
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:40,422
...into the forest of my righteous
truth on the first date!

231
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,136
- Who?
- Paul!

232
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,557
Moving on, moving on.
Next question.

233
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,266
Okay, number 29.

234
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,437
"Have you ever betrayed
another goddess...

235
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,564
...for a lightning-bearer?"
Okay, number 30.

236
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:02,235
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go back to 29.

237
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,158
Not to my recollection.

238
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,452
Danny Arshack, ninth grade.

239
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,163
You know the bottle
was pointing at me.

240
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,709
Only because you took up
half the circle!

241
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,882
Listen to you two.
It's so sad.

242
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:28,637
Looks like I'll be going to
the goddess meetings alone.

243
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,014
Not when they find out
you slept with Jason Hurley...

244
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:35,603
...an hour after
he broke up with Monica.

245
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,979
One hour?

246
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:40,941
You are such a leaf blower!

247
00:15:54,872 --> 00:16:00,920
Be careful with that 3-D "Last Supper".
Judas is a little loose.

248
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,884
Oh, my God! What's going on?

249
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,554
They're taking all my stuff back.
I guess you were right.

250
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:14,808
No, I wasn't right.
That's what I came here to tell you.

251
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,562
I was totally hung up
on my own stuff the other day.

252
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,566
No, listen. I need the whole
security thing, you know?

253
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:27,237
To know where my next paycheck is
coming from. But you don't need that.

254
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,030
And that's amazing to me.

255
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,326
I could never do what you do.

256
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:35,204
- Thanks.
- You hold out for something bigger.

257
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,539
I can't tell you
how much respect I have...

258
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,583
...for you not going
to that stupid audition.

259
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,961
- I went.
- Great! How did it go?

260
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,047
- I didn't get it.
- Good for you!

261
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,050
You're living the dream!

262
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,095
All right, then!

263
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,889
Not my parrot.

264
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,142
I can't watch this.

265
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,603
Hey, hold on, hold on.

266
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,607
How much for the...
How much to save the bird?

267
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,567
- Twelve hundred.
- Dollars?

268
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,653
You spent $ 1200 on a plastic bird?

269
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,740
It was an impulse buy.
Near the register.

270
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,367
Go ahead with the bird.

271
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:19,414
Do you have anything for around $ 200?

272
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,292
The dog.

273
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,171
I'll take it.

274
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,633
My gift to you, man.

275
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,719
Thanks, Ross!

276
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,388
I really liked that bird, though.

277
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,891
But the dog!

278
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,109
Here are your cakes.

279
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,986
We didn't order cake.

280
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,573
No, I know. They're from me.

281
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,450
You guys, this is not good.

282
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,161
We have enough trouble
with guys stealing our wind...

283
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,997
...without taking it from each other.

284
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,207
You're right.

285
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,543
I love you goddesses.

286
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:10,090
I don't ever want
to suck your wind again.

287
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,759
- Thank you. So are we good?
- We're good.

288
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,678
We're good?

289
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:19,349
Let me take these back.
They'll take it out of my paycheck.

290
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:24,605
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

291
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,276
Are you sure this time?

292
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,445
I actually saw him leave.

293
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,323
That guy is holding a human head.

294
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:38,410
He's holding a human head!

295
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,412
Check it out, man!

296
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,623
I tore it off a mannequin
in the alley behind Macy's.

297
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:44,958
There's no alley behind Macy's.

298
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,962
So I got it in the junior miss
department. Big diff.

299
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,841
It'll make a hell of a conversation
piece at our next cocktail party.

300
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,302
"Our next cocktail party"?

301
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:59,931
We'll put chips in it.
We'll make it a chip chick.

302
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,686
Do you remember yesterday?

303
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:07,606
Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

304
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:15,822
Do you remember
talking to me yesterday?

305
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:21,995
So what happened?

306
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,165
We took a road trip to Las Vegas!

307
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,876
Oh, sweet Moses!

308
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,504
So on this road trip,
did you win any money?

309
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,924
I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!
He cleans up!

310
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,760
$300! He buys me these new shoes.

311
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,136
Nice.

312
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:41,974
See you upstairs. See you, pals!

313
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:49,106
Is anyone else starting
to really like him?

314
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,752
May I help you?

315
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,046
Why doesn't my key work,
and what's my stuff doing downstairs?

316
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:16,342
I'm sorry.

317
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,676
Have we met?

318
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,971
It's Eddie, you freak!
Your roommate.

319
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,265
I'm sorry...

320
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:27,310
...I already have a roommate.

321
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:38,864
He's lived here for years.
I don't know what you're talking about.

322
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:44,787
No, he moved out and I moved in.

323
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:48,457
Well, I think we'd remember
something like that.

324
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:51,501
I know I would.

325
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,088
That's a good point.

326
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,381
Okay, wow.

327
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,426
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

328
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,347
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Hey, no problem.

329
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,308
See you.

330
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:15,859
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

331
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,946
- You want me to help you unpack?
- Nah, I'm okay.

332
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,826
Just so you know, I'm not
moving back in because I have to.

333
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:26,787
I mean, I do have to, but...

334
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,165
It's just that that place,
it wasn't really...

335
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,293
I mean, this is...

336
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:36,630
Welcome home, man.

337
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:48,559
- A little foos?
- Absolutely!

338
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,895
What happened to the foosball?

339
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,106
It's a cantaloupe.

340
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:02,114
Are we gonna bring this out
every time Ross comes over?

341
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:06,076
He paid a lot of money for it.

342
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:13,959
I'm gonna hold him a different way.

343
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,754
If you hated it so much,
why'd you buy it in the first place?

344
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:21,759
Well, I had a whole ceramic
