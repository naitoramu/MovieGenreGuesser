1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,130
- Guys, guess what?
- What?

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,216
We're having a Halloween party!

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,593
- Good!
- Great!

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:14,014
- You have to wear a costume.
- I can't make it.

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,974
Come on, it'll be fun.

6
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:21,188
I'll be there. I have to wear a
costume to my classes that day anyway.

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,858
Tell me you're not gonna dress
like a dinosaur.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,986
Not two years in a row.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,366
- I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.
- You have to.

10
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:38,330
No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,
pretending to be someone you're not.

11
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,375
You're an actor.

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,086
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

13
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,630
- I will.
- The girl from the wedding?

14
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:52,260
If she needs costume ideas,
she could be a bikini model...

15
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:56,015
...or a slutty nurse,
or a sexy cheerleader.

16
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:02,271
Or Leatherface from "Texas Chainsaw"
"Massacre." No! Slutty Leatherface.

17
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,608
Wasn't Joey hitting on her too?

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,736
That's right, he was hitting on her.

19
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:14,741
And I got her. I guess
the better man won.

20
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,078
Please don't take her from me.

21
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,331

24
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,080
Ursula!

25
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,916
Wait. It's me, Phoebe.

26
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,504
I thought there was a mirror there.
Okay. Bye.

27
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:09,922
Wait a second!

28
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,258
So, what's new with you?

29
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,178
Nothing.
I'm getting married next week.

30
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,930
What?

31
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:21,392
Lt'll be a small ceremony.
Just family.

32
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,852
His.

33
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,062
Okay.

34
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,898
I'm happy for you.

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,070
Wait. If you want to come,
I guess that'd be okay.

36
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,404
- Really?
- Sure.

37
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,282
You could be my sister for the day.

38
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,660
Yeah, okay.

39
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:45,666
My friends are having a party tonight,
so you could come.

40
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,169
Maybe I could meet the guy.

41
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,338
Well, I'm supposed to work tonight.

42
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,258
I'm supposed to be working now,
so who cares!

43
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:59,680
- It's a costume party.
- So that's why you're...

44
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,932
No.

45
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,393
But thanks.

46
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,610
- You're supposed to wear a costume.
- I am.

47
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:18,365
I am a woman who spent money
on a dress she wants to wear...

48
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,202
...because soon she won't
fit into it.

49
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,748
I'm Catwoman, who wants the dress
when you're too big for it.

50
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,752
- Trick or treat!
- Can I give out candy?

51
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:35,883
I want to be with kids. Since I got
pregnant, I have maternal instincts.

52
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,053
- Trick or treat!
- Just a minute!

53
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,852
Look at you guys!

54
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:51,565
- Wow! You are a very scary witch.
- Thank you.

55
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:55,694
- And you are a very funny clown.
- Thank you.

56
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,320
And you...

57
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,075
...are so in style right now.

58
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:06,622
I work at Ralph Lauren. The fall line
has got this equestrian theme.

59
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:11,752
- Did you see the cover of "Vogue"...?
- Could I just have the candy?

60
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,131
Sure.

61
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,225
Catwoman. So we meet again.

62
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,395
So we do, Supergirl.

63
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,606
It's me, Phoebe.

64
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,652
Monica, can I talk to you
for a second?

65
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,452
I appreciate the costume.

66
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,913
You did this to him?

67
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,790
I thought he'd love it.

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,213
- He loves "The Velveteen Rabbit."
- That rabbit was brown and white.

69
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,715
It was pink, or no bunny at all.

70
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,845
No bunny at all.
Always no bunny at all!

71
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:10,185
- You didn't dress up either?
- Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.

72
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,900
Dude, what happened?

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,777
How is that me?

74
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,364
I'm Chandler.

75
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,035
That is so you!

76
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,789
- When have I ever done that?
- When have I ever done that?

77
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,462
Trick or treat.

78
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,553
- You're the prettiest ballerina ever.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,432
That deserves another candy.

80
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,600
Thank you.

81
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,482
I have to say,
that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.

82
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,234
I love you!

83
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,738
Honey, here, take it all.

84
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,788
Monica? We need more candy.

85
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,582
- There's only been four kids.
- I know.

86
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,544
But one said she loved me,
so I gave her everything.

87
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,713
No wonder you're pregnant.

88
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:32,017
- What are you supposed to be?
- Remember the satellite, Sputnik?

89
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:37,022
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"...

90
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,275
...and these are my antenna.

91
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,570
So Sputnik becomes...?

92
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,495
Spud-nik!

93
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,500
Wow! I don't have
the worst costume anymore.

94
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,338
All right! Ross came as doodie.

95
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,677
- No, I'm not doodie.
- No, space-doodie.

96
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,187
Hey, sweetie.

97
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,193
- Aren't you gonna kiss me?
- Okay.

98
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,988
But right after, you have to tell me
who you are.

99
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,365
- Ursula?
- Ursula's fiance?

100
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:33,912
You're the sister. I just slapped
my future sister-in-law's ass.

101
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,499
Is your mother here?
I could slap her on the butt.

102
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,753
- My mother killed herself.
- See, and I knew that.

103
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,757
Now I'm sweating.

104
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:51,096
I'm sweating. Now I'm saying look
at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.

105
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,015
No. We'll start over.

106
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,101
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- Eric.

107
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:01,023
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Sweat's burning my eyes.

108
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,649
- Thank you.
- There.

109
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,569
- What are you?
- There's no name for it.

110
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,906
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.

111
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,870
- No, I meant your costume.
- I'm a solar system.

112
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,289
My second graders helped.

113
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,375
- I love the second grade.
- Really?

114
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:26,382
It's much better than first grade,
and definitely better than third.

115
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:30,136
With all the politics
and the mind games.

116
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:35,599
- So, what do you do?
- I'm a masseuse, by day.

117
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,229
- You don't have to stay with me.
- I'm having fun.

118
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:45,609
- I'm excited for you and Ursula.
- I feel very lucky. She's great.

119
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:50,614
- She's the most beautiful woman ever.
- Thank you.

120
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,163
- Hey, Joey?
- Yeah?

121
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:02,250
- You read comic books, right?
- Exclusively.

122
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:06,047
Who would win in a fight,
Catwoman or Supergirl?

123
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,423
- Catwoman, hands down.
- Yeah.

124
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,052
Between you and Phoebe?
I'd give Phoebe the edge.

125
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,054
- What? Really?
- You kidding?

126
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:19,852
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
Plus, she's got a crazy temper.

127
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,771
She's not right behind me, is she?

128
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,648
- No, you're fine.
- Okay.

129
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,734
- Could I take Rachel?
- I'm not sure.

130
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,487
What? Come on, I am tough!

131
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,448
Punch me here, as hard as you can!

132
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,119
Relax. Why are you so serious?
It doesn't matter.

133
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:42,207
Really? What if I told you
Ross or Chandler could beat you up?

134
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,584
I would say, "Woman, please."

135
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,882
Ursula's fiance is really sweet.

136
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,802
He's a teacher,
he does volunteer work.

137
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:59,641
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
But I could just mop him up.

138
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,060
- Oh, my God, Phoebe?
- What?

139
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:07,358
- You're getting a crush on him.
- No, I'm not, you are!

140
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,444
Here comes the temper.

141
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,322
Trick or treat.

142
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,077
Know what? We're out of candy.
But someone went for more.

143
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:24,291
And I've been giving out money,
but I'm out of that too.

144
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,835
- Can I write you a check?
- Okay.

145
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:31,923
- Okay. What's your name?
- Lelani Mayolanofavich.

146
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:37,763
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out
to "cash."

147
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,142
- Hi.
- Hi, Mona.

148
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,232
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was
hoping you'd be a slutty nurse.

149
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,568
Actually, I'm just a nurse.

150
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:56,949
You'd think that would embarrass me,
but I'm maxed out.

151
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,035
- You made it.
- Wait.

152
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:04,581
- You're a potato?
- Well, I'm a spud...?

153
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,127
- And the antenna... You're Spud-nik!
- Yes!

154
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,214
Marry her.

155
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:17,970
Here's a good one. Who'd win
a fight between Ross and Chandler?

156
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,639
I can't. Chandler's my husband.

157
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,266
- So Ross?
- Yeah.

158
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,853
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hello, handsome.

159
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,272
Oh, God.

160
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,402
Look at you two.
When did you guys meet?

161
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,362
- Two weeks ago.
- That's it?

162
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,950
I know. It sounds crazy,
and I'm not impulsive, but...

163
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:44,288
...we have so much in common.
- Oh, really?

164
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,832
We're both teachers.

165
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:53,088
- And we were both in the Peace Corps.
- Peace Corps, really?

166
00:11:54,631 --> 00:12:00,804
When we were building in Uruguay,
we were two towns apart and never met.

167
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:06,185
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got
there, but it was a town when I left.

168
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,272
- Shall we get me really drunk?
- Sure.

169
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,114
Howdy, doodie.

170
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,282
That's funny, yeah.

171
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:25,245
You're the funniest man here in a
bunny costume his wife made him wear.

172
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,958
Relax, man. You're looking
a little "flushed."

173
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,508
- Our question might get answered.
- What question?

174
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,304
Who could kick whose ass in a fight,
you or Ross?

175
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,433
- There's no question.
- So you think Ross too?

176
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,730
- You picked Ross?
- Ross is strong.

177
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,693
He's the strongest out of all three
of you. Except for Joey.

178
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,948
- I can't believe you didn't pick me.
- She's right. I am stronger.

179
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,410
I would destroy you.

180
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:09,414
Really? You think you're stronger?
Why don't you prove it?

181
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,043
I'll prove it like a theorem!

182
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,379
All right! Stop it!

183
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,799
Stop! No one's gonna fight.

184
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,594
People came to see a fight,
let's give them one!

185
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,976
- You guys could arm-wrestle.
- Listen to the slutty nurse.

186
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:34,106
- You're going down.
- Oh, yeah? You're going downtown!

187
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:38,360
Seriously, guys, the trash talk
is embarrassing.

188
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,246
Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much.

189
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,333
- You are so sweet.
- Really?

190
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:57,379
You are gonna make some man
the luckiest guy in the world.

191
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,465
- Got to go.
- Trick or treat.

192
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:04,470
Hi! Wow! There you go.

193
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:09,433
My friend Lewis told me
you were giving out money.

194
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,603
We were, but now we've got candy.

195
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,898
I'd rather have the money.

196
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,985
That's not your choice.
Happy Halloween!

197
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,570
This isn't fair.

198
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,073
Is it fair that you put on a cape
and get stuff?

199
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,409
Shut up!

200
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,078
You shut up!

201
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:35,083
- You can't tell me to shut up.
- I think I just did.

202
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,711
And here it comes again. Shut up!

203
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,174
No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.

204
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:47,262
Wait, I had one more thing to say.
Right. Shut up.

205
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,098
You're a mean old woman.

206
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,142
Wait! Shut... Don't cry!

207
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,352
Let me get my checkbook!

208
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:59,692
You don't have to do this. The
strength inside you means the most.

209
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:04,238
You're loyal, you're honest
and you have integrity.

210
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,283
That's the strength I want in a man.

211
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,703
That means nothing to me. Come on!

212
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,498
- Hi, liar.
- Hey.

213
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:21,130
He's marrying you because he thinks
the things you were saying were true.

214
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,965
- They could be true.
- But they're not.

215
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,469
It's a fine line.

216
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,222
- Why are you lying?
- I don't know.

217
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:35,811
He did this stuff, I said I did it
too. He got so excited, it was fun.

218
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:41,692
It's a disgusting habit,
and I want you to quit now!

219
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,444
She's helped so many people quit.

220
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,030
We'd better get going.

221
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,117
- You have a church group meeting.
- Right.

222
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,125
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

223
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,254
And, Ursula, it was really nice
meeting you tonight!

224
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:06,634
Come on! Bunny versus Doodie.
We're waiting!

225
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,931
Okay, guys. One match,
winner take all.

226
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,434
Wait. What does the winner get?

227
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,602
- Pride.
- And dignity.

228
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,439
Okay, if you say so.

229
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,691
All right, ready, set, go!

230
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,444
- Come on!
- Come on!

231
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:38,124
- Wow, they're both really strong.
- Or equally weak.

232
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,169
Oh, God. Chandler's making
his sex face.

233
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:53,055
- So you getting tired?
- No. I could do this all day.

234
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,682
Yeah. Me too.

235
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,772
- Getting a little tired, though.
- God, I'm exhausted.

236
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:07,152
This is starting to look bad for me,
okay? Mona's standing right there.

237
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:12,408
She's talking to Joey!
You've got to let me win!

238
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,452
Let me win.
My wife thinks I'm a wimp.

239
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:21,291
At least you have a wife.
I get divorces and knock people up.

240
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,754
And I'm dressed as doodie.

241
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,386
- You're Spud-nik.
- Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.

242
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,472
Please? She's watching.

243
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,643
- Fine.
- Thanks.

244
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,189
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah!

245
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,108
My hero!

246
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,652
You're a weird lady.

247
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,783
Ursula said she left her purse.

248
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,703
What a relief. It has the numbers
for her prayer chain.

249
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,040
I'm sure it does.

250
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,292
Guess I'll see you at the wedding.

251
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,340
I don't think I'm gonna make it
to the wedding.

252
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:13,301
- I wish you all the luck in the world.
- We'll be okay.

253
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,806
It's so perfect,
and she's been saving herself for me.

254
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:23,645
- I can't let you do this. She's lying.
- What?

255
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:28,066
She is lying. And I bet
I could prove it. Excuse me.

256
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:31,487
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

257
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:37,200
But what looks like a detailed drawing
of a bank floor plan.

258
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:42,331
Here's the name tag from
where she works as a waitress.

259
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,834
Not a teacher, a waitress.

260
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,669
Here, she always lies about this.

261
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:52,674
- How old did she say she was?
- She told me she was 25.

262
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,469
I almost don't want to show you.

263
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,764
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.

264
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,685
I am so stupid.

265
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,188
Of course she's not a teacher.

266
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:11,860
There's no such thing as a "Top Secret
School for the Children of Spies."

267
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,240
No, you're not stupid.

268
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,326
I'm not smart.

269
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:27,209
I just wanted so much
to be impulsive for once.

270
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,378
- To be romantic.
- Good.

271
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:35,509
You should be impulsive and romantic.
You did it with the wrong person.

272
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,890
- What?
- It's weird, two people look so alike.

273
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,892
And so different.

274
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,190
Eric! Let's go!

275
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:54,194
- Better go deal with it.
- Yeah, you should.

276
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,744
Hurry up! I gotta pray!

277
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:17,551
I had to give the kid
50 bucks to stop crying.

278
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:18,927
That's not bad.

279
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:23,182
I also had to go to a few houses
as his girlfriend.

280
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,435
I am awful with children.

281
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,106
You're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.

282
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,818
They're all greedy,
hopped up on sugar.

283
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,612
- That's all it is?
- Absolutely.

284
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:44,453
Halloween is the worst. Except
for Christmas. And their birthdays.

285
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,831
They get crazy during the summer too.

286
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,501
And any time they're
hungry or sleepy.

287
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,838
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that.

288
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,179
Look, I'm sorry you lost.

289
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,099
I got a secret for you.
I let him win.

290
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,478
Was that a secret, or a lie?

291
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,814
- No, I let him... Ross?
- Yeah?

292
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:15,150
Would you tell her
I let you win, please?

293
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,070
Chandler "let me win."

294
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:25,577
No, Chandler's really strong.
My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

295
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,913
I am strong. I'll show you.

296
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,540
Chandler, please.

297
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,709
What's the matter? Scared?

298
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,588
Let's go, big bunny!

299
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,550
One, two, three. Go!

300
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:48,016
I'm gonna kill myself!

301
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:53,772
