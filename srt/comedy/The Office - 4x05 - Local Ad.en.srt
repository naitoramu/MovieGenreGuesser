1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,089
Yeah, everything!
It's all good! Phyllis.

2
00:00:02,249 --> 00:00:04,741
- Dancing babies!
- Dancing babies. I love it!

3
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:08,052
We are making a commercial
for Dunder Mifflin today.

4
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:09,597
Our first ad ever.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,973
Corporate purchased
some airtime in local markets

6
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,143
to spread the word
about Dunder Mifflin Infinity,

7
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:17,490
and they are even sending up
a professional ad company

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,679
to help us make it later, so...

9
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:22,109
it's not too shabby.

10
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:23,795
Best ad ever?

11
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:25,352
 Gimme a break 

12
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:26,947
 Gimme a break 

13
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:29,500
 Break me off a piece of that... 

14
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:35,539
I am totally blanking.
What is the thing?

15
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:38,501
- Nobody tell him!
- What? No... Why?

16
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:40,002
You got it.
You're so close.

17
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:41,802
 Break me off a piece of that 

18
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:46,258
 Bre... apple sauce 

19
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:48,844
Break me off a piece
of that apple sauce. I don't think...

20
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,930
 piece of that chrysler car 

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,212
- Nope.
-  football cream 

22
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:54,225
Okay.

23
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:55,947
Football cream.
It's football cream.

24
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:57,615
All right, so anybody else?

25
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,690
I'm taking a computer animation class,
so I could try to do a logo.

26
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:02,009
Look at that.

27
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,402
Even the receptionist is getting in
on the creativity.

28
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:05,569
Very good.

29
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:06,806
Hello, hello.

30
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,281
- How you doing?
- Michael Scott, regional manager.

31
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:11,784
- Nice to meet you. Us too, man.
- Excited to talk ideas.

32
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:14,172
You know what?
I want this to be cutting edge.

33
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:17,391
I want it to be fast,
quick cuts, you know?

34
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:20,960
Youthful,
sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.

35
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,594
- That sounds great.
- All right.

36
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:24,255
This is what we have to work with.

37
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:26,662
I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard.

38
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:29,799
The 'nard dog.
Who let the 'nard dog out?

39
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:33,222
He gives
the best back rubs in the office.

40
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:36,539
That's true. I give a mean back rub.
I also do good aromatherapy.

41
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:39,395
Not!
You just got 'nard dogged!

42
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:44,533
Now this gentleman right here
is the key to our...

43
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,360
- urban vibe.
- Urban?

44
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:50,873
I grew up in a small town.
What about me seems urban to you?

45
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:52,154
Stanley's hilarious.

46
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:54,595
Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth.

47
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:57,248
Kind of a less urban aunt Jemima.

48
00:01:58,782 --> 00:02:00,545
These are our accountants.

49
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,276
And as you can see,

50
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:05,171
they are very different sizes.

51
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:07,048
What you might wanna do

52
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:11,398
is kind of a papa bear,
mama bear, baby bear thing.

53
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:13,729
- That might be kind of fun.
- Mama bear.

54
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:14,889
Who else?

55
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:17,414
I think it's great
that the company's making a commercial.

56
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:20,286
Because
not very many people have heard of us.

57
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,913
When I tell people
that I work at Dunder Mifflin,

58
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:24,914
they think that we sell mufflers,

59
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:28,777
or muffins, or mittens, or...

60
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:33,569
And frankly, all of those sound better
than paper, so I let it slide.

"LOCAL AD"

96
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,226
- You playing that game again?
- Second life is not a game.

97
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:18,031
It is a multi-user virtual environment.

98
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:21,455
It doesn't have points or scores.
It doesn't have winners or losers.

99
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:23,346
Oh, it has losers.

100
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:26,269
I signed up for Second Life
about a year ago.

101
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:29,880
Back then my life was so great
that I literally wanted a second one.

102
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:32,466
In my second life,
I was also a paper salesman,

103
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,677
and I was also named Dwight.

104
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:37,025
Absolutely everything was the same,

105
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,909
except I could fly.

106
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:40,724
Little girl

107
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:44,687
in a field holding a flower.
We zoom back

108
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:47,123
to find that she's in the desert,

109
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:49,816
and the field is an oasis.

110
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:51,509
We zoom back further.

111
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:56,657
The desert is a sandbox
in the world's largest resort hotel.

112
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:58,993
Zoom back further.
The hotel

113
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,862
is actually the playground...

114
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:04,472
of the world's largest prison.

115
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:08,335
- Zoom back further...
- Okay. I can tell your time's valuable.

116
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:12,193
Actually I don't get paid
by the hour anymore, but thank you.

117
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,633
I get paid by the year, so...

118
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:16,260
That all sounds really ambitious.

119
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:17,431
Yeah, I know.

120
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:20,128
Why don't we show you
what we did with the national branch.

121
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:23,085
Okay.

122
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:56,038
That's what national came up with?

123
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:57,238
That sucks!

124
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,554
That's what we came up with.

125
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:02,014
We can do better than that.

126
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:04,422
The main part of the ad
must stay the same, actually.

127
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:07,165
Yeah, it's the last five seconds
where we've some leeway.

128
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,390
The waving?

129
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:13,226
Well no. You won't be waving.
That was just what they did.

130
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:15,945
You guys can be clapping, sitting.

131
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:18,046
Standing outside, inside, whatever.

132
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:20,783
I mean, this is where you really get
to be creative.

133
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,618
I need some advice.

134
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:25,579
Been spending a lot of time
making out with Angela lately.

135
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,103
We've been necking,
but only necking, right?

136
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,648
Not actually kissing...

137
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:34,505
our mouths.

138
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:36,145
Just a neck on neck.

139
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,219
It's just like rubbing/nuzzling
our necks together.

140
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:44,126
It's hot, I'm not gonna lie to you.
But it's a little weird.

141
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:46,492
But you seem like a guy with answers.

142
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:49,520
So how do I fast-track this,
get to first base?

143
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,287
We cannot talk about this,

144
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:54,432
because...

145
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,902
someone might hear us.

146
00:05:58,272 --> 00:05:59,571
We'll use code names.

147
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,850
Angela can stay the same,

148
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:06,518
but we'll change Andy to Dwight.

149
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,707
That's not different enough.

150
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:12,334
Dwike?

151
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:17,923
You have a call from Eddie Murphy.

152
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:24,166
Hello?

153
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:26,693
<i>Shrek!
Shrek, I'm a donkey!</i>

154
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:28,667
<i>I'm a donkey, Shrek!</i>

155
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,867
I'm just kidding.

156
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:33,147
It's me.
Hello, Ry.

157
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:34,690
- What?
- <i>Okay,</i>

158
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:36,863
calm down.
I just have a small problem.

159
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:38,828
<i>I told you not to call
about small problems.</i>

160
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:42,101
Well when I call about big problems,
you don't like that either,

161
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:44,299
so make up your mind, kiddo.

162
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:45,950
Here is the deal.

163
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,539
The ad guys that you sent
are locking me in a creative box

164
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,664
<i>and sort of ignoring my ideas.</i>

165
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:54,626
That's good.
They're creative, you're not.

166
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,164
I'm creative, Ryan.

167
00:06:57,324 --> 00:06:58,757
<i>It's not part of your job.</i>

168
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,299
<i>It's like, maybe you can cook,</i>

169
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,676
but that doesn't mean
you should start a restaurant.

170
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:05,347
Well, actually I can't cook,
and I'm starting a restaurant.

171
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,041
"Mike's Cereal Shack."

172
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:11,014
<i>I'm thinking we'll have as many
varieties as you can buy in the store.</i>

173
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:12,978
I'm not really interested
in that right now.

174
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:15,622
<i>I'm delegating creativity
to creative professionals.</i>

175
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,055
<i>It's a different skill set.</i>

176
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:19,401
<i>Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
But I'm good</i>

177
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:21,695
- at managing people who do sales.
- <i>Are you?</i>

178
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,369
I don't think you're doing
such a great job here,

179
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,925
suppressing ideas and creativity.

180
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:30,680
All right, let me ask you this.
Tell me if you think this is creative.

181
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,090
When I was five,

182
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:37,110
I imagined that there was such a thing
as a unicorn.

183
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:41,939
And this is before I had even
heard of one or seen one.

184
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:45,453
I just drew a picture of a horse

185
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:48,436
that could fly over rainbows

186
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,893
and had a huge spike in its head.

187
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,140
I was five.
Five years old.

188
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:56,891
Couldn't even talk yet.

189
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,993
Hey, guys.
You know what?

190
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:03,487
We cannot shoot this ad today.

191
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:09,284
- Okay, when should we come back?
- How about never hundred hours, sir?

192
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:13,057
- Wait, we were sent here to he...
- I'm not gonna argue with this guy.

193
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:14,915
Let's go.
Good luck, dude.

194
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:16,708
- Hey thanks. Thank you.
- Thank you.

195
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:18,492
<i>Michael, David Wallace.</i>

196
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,918
<i>What is this
about dismissing the ad people?</i>

197
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,363
Yeah, I'm glad you called.

198
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:24,808
Ryan is being a little bitch again.

199
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:27,728
- <i>I'm on, Michael.</i>
- What's up, my brother?

200
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,180
Listen, David.

201
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:34,372
I would like to do this ad in house.
I want to use only

202
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,745
the creativity
that we have right here in the office.

203
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:41,084
And I will send it to you
tomorrow morning. Take a look at it.

204
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:46,050
If you don't think it's ready to air,
send the ad agency back down here

205
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:48,407
and we'll do it on my dime.

206
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:50,951
<i>This is weird.</i>

207
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:54,215
I'm willing to stake
my entire reputation on it.

208
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:56,039
<i>Okay.</i>

209
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,833
<i>I'll see it tomorrow.</i>

210
00:08:58,154 --> 00:08:59,543
- Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

211
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:02,010
And thus...

212
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:05,300
Michael Scott sealed his own destiny.

213
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:11,774
Has anyone ever come up to you and said,
"You're not creative."

214
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:13,484
Yes.

215
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,237
Well, they're wrong.
You are creative.

216
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,109
You are damn creative.

217
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:19,546
Each and every one of you.

218
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:21,784
You are so much more creative

219
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,038
than all of the other dry, boring morons
that you work with.

220
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,249
Who you talking to specifically?

221
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,671
I kind of know
what it's like to be in commercials.

222
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:35,683
My nickname in high school
used to be kool-aid man.

223
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:40,323
Younger, I always wanted
to be an actor in commercials,

224
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,305
then I realized I had a brain.

225
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:44,057
I'm excited about doing the ad,

226
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:48,594
but I'm not really used to doing videos
with so many people around.

227
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:51,474
We have three scenes to film,
big scenes.

228
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,719
We have a song to write,
so let's get cracking.

229
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,669
Kelly, I want you to do make-up.

230
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:59,363
Oscar, I would like you
to do costume design obviously.

231
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,973
I'd like you to look around town
and see if we have any celebrities

232
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,556
in our local area.

233
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:08,998
Sue Grafton is at the steamtown mall!
She's doing a book signing right now.

234
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:10,974
Phyllis, this is what I want you to do.

235
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:14,079
I want you to go down to the mall.
I want you to get in line.

236
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,964
I want you to get her
to be in this commercial.

237
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:21,838
This would be a huge coupe,
people, all right?

238
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:23,763
- Do not take no for an answer.
- Okay.

239
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:26,483
Does anyone actually know
what Sue Grafton looks like?

240
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:29,018
- I mean, is she hot or...
- She's crazy hot.

241
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:33,194
Well then maybe we should just use
Angela and say she's Sue Grafton.

242
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:35,566
- Would anyone notice?
- That's not happening.

243
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,261
I find the mystery genre disgusting.

244
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,363
I hate being titillated.

245
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:43,366
- Light it up!
- Get her, Phyl.

246
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:55,434

00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:18,768
I thought...

255
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:22,780
I was under the impression
that this was going to be a rap.

256
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,314
What's rap?

257
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:26,016
Okay, Darryl...

258
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:29,620
You need to learn about
your own culture. I'll make you a mix.

259
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:30,997
Great.

260
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,775
News flash.

261
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,422
I got some juicy updates
on operation fallen angel.

262
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,646
Remind me to tell you later.

263
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:50,516
Hey.

264
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,310
Eh, no talk.
I'm animating.

265
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,984
Why don't we take
a quick ten second break from that

266
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:57,059
so I can show you what's going on here.

267
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:59,170
Okay, this is Dwight's second life.

268
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,985
He's on it all the time.

269
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:04,661
So much so that his little guy here
has created his own world.

270
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:06,324
It's called Second Second Life,

271
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:09,495
for those people who want to be removed
even further from reality.

272
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:10,933
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

273
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:13,192
Oh, my god.
He's really in pain.

274
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:15,329
Who's that?

275
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,965
Oh, it's just my avatar guy, whatever.

276
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,670
He looks a lot like you!

277
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:22,420
How much time did you spend on that?

278
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,580
Not much.

279
00:12:23,897 --> 00:12:26,719
- It's just for tracking Dwight.
- Right.

280
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:29,244
You're a sportswriter in Philadelphia?

281
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,126
Nice build too.

282
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,090
Yep.

283
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,437
You have a guitar slung on your back.
I did not know you played guitar.

284
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,121
I...

285
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,485
Why don't we go back to the animation?

286
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:44,561
No, no!
I want to see more of Philly Jim.

287
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:45,984
I want Philly Jim.

288
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:47,517
Ah, show me how this works.

289
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:48,699
Oh, boy.

290
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,033

00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:36,831
I don't hate it.
I just don't like it at all.

308
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:38,574
And it's terrible.

00:13:47,882 --> 00:13:49,093
I hate the style.

It's a pivotal scene in the ad.

318

And if we don't get this,
if we don't nail it,

319
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:06,819
we're gonna lose
the whole triumph of the moment.

320
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,438
The triumph of the will.

321
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,436
Now?
God, what?

322
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,746
What, Phyllis?

323
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:12,933
Well,

324
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:15,619
I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book.

325
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,368
On my turn, I asked her
if she wanted to be in the ad,

326
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:21,625
and she said "No, thanks," but I wasn't
supposed to take "no" for an answer.

327
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:23,627
- That a girl.
- So I kept on asking,

328
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:27,048
and they finally threw me out
of the store in front of all my friends.

329
00:14:30,643 --> 00:14:32,589
Did you or did you not get Sue Grafton?

330
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:35,806
No.

331
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:40,822
Can somebody give her a tissue, please?

332
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:46,734
Hope you're not killing yourself on it.
'Cause I'm sure it's good enough

333
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:49,737
for Michael's ad
that will probably be seen by no one.

334
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,531
Maybe,
but it's not good enough for me yet.

335
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:54,909
Okay.
Do you want me to stay?

336
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:57,453
No, no, you can go home.
I'm good.

337
00:14:57,924 --> 00:15:01,246
Pam is staying late tonight
to achieve her dreams.

338
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:03,299
So I'm pretty proud of her.

339
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:06,612
- Unfortunately, she was my ride home.
- You comin'?

340
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,239
I...

341
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:11,450
Piss or get off the pot.

342
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,920
- Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
- Good morning.

343
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:25,553
Yeah, sorry. I looked away for a second,
and Creed snatched your hash browns.

344
00:15:26,303 --> 00:15:27,763
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

345
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:30,207
I worked until about 2:45 AM.

346
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:32,893
And then I had to decide
if I wanted to spend the night

347
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,376
with Michael editing in his office,

348
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:38,286
and Dwight
watching Michael edit in his office,

349
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:40,939
or drive home
and probably fall asleep at the wheel

350
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:42,486
and die in a fiery car wreck.

351
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:45,623
I passed out on my keyboard
trying to decide.

352
00:15:47,694 --> 00:15:48,997
Let me pour you some bubbly,

353
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,246
because somebody got
to a whole new level last night.

354
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,441
Andy, I can't hear this right now.

355
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:56,000
No, no, this is good.

356
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:59,876
You know how we haven't gotten anywhere
that I want to get to physically yet?

357
00:16:00,036 --> 00:16:02,715
Well, last night that changed.

358
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:04,439
We're making out.

359
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:08,014
I'm kissing her neck,
and her cheek, and her earlobe.

360
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,306
And she's not really kissing me back,

361
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:13,018
but she closes her eyes
and she's, like,

362
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:17,313
"Oh, D.
Oh, D."

363
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:21,879
She called you D?

364
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:23,374
Yeah.

365
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:25,348
D for Andy.

366
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,407
Oh, D.

367
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:30,539
Oh, D.

368
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:48,469
I'm about to send the ad to corporate.

369
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:50,392
And it is sent.

370
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,991
They'll probably watch it right away.
I would.

371
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:57,084
Okay.

372
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:04,144
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Pam, please clear my phone lines.

373
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:05,308
<i>Certainly.</i>

374
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:10,575
<i>Okay, clear.</i>

375
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:14,190
They could call any second now.

376
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:19,257
Oh, god.

377
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,111
I better call.

378
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,090
Well, it's been tough.

379
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,286
The geniuses at corporate
rejected my commercial.

380
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:40,895
And tonight
they are airing the brain-dead version.

381
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:43,007
So welcome one and all

382
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:46,519
to the world premiere
of corporate crapfest!

383
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:08,895
- Hey, seemed like a big hit.
- No, people are stupid.

384
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,297
People like waving.

385
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:13,478
Waving sells.
It's not art.

386
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:15,848
Yet we made our ad.

387
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:20,388
The real one was full of humor,
and full of depth,

388
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:21,729
and full of heart.

389
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,490
And it was real.

390
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,610
Hey, could you do me a favor?
Could you put that in the dvd player?

391
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,587
Hey, everybody. Just want
to welcome you all to the premiere

392
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:34,151
of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial.

393
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:36,708
The Michael Scott director's cut.

394
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:38,435
Hope you like it.

395
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,869
<i>It all starts with an idea.</i>

396
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:47,732
<i>But you can never tell
where an idea will end up.</i>

397
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:54,238
<i>Because ideas spread.</i>

398
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:56,787
<i>They change, grow.</i>

399
00:18:58,423 --> 00:19:00,476
<i>They connect us with the world.</i>

400
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:07,775
<i>And in a fast moving world,</i>

401
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,273
<i>where good news
moves at the speed of time...</i>

402
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:22,643
<i>and bad news
isn't always what it seems.</i>

403
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,965
<i>Because when push comes to shove,</i>

404
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:44,590
<i>we all deserve a second chance...</i>

405
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,400
<i>to score.</i>

406
00:19:57,717 --> 00:19:59,062
<i>Dunder Mifflin.</i>

407
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:02,446
<i>Limitless paper in a paperless world.</i>

408
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,666
Really good.

409
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:15,480
Animation?
All her, by the way.

410
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,586
- Really? The animation was cool.
- Thanks.

411
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:20,347
You ever been on a motorcycle?

412
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:23,535
Michael, that was fun.

413
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:25,737
That was fun.

414
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:29,264
Next round of drinks is on me, people.

415
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:32,633
 Claude Van Damme 

416
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:36,872
 Hair for men 

417
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:39,658
 Poison gas 
 Nutrasweet 

418
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:42,072
It's gotta rhyme with "piece."

419
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:43,610
Fancy feast!

420
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:46,457
 Break me off a piece
of that fancy feast 

421
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:48,509
It's a cat food.

422
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:49,753
Nailed it.



9999
