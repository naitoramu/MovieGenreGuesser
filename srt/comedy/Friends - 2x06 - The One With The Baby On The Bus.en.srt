I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

3
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,589
Who the winny-binny boy?

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,428
You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,639
Don't cry.

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,476
Don't cry.

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,978
Why is he still crying?

8
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,273
Let me hold him for a sec.

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,984
Here we go.

10
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,611
There we are.

11
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,155
Maybe it's me.

12
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:33,283
Don't be silly. Ben loves you.
He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.

13
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,163
You know, I once dated
a Miss Cranky Pants.

14
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,540
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

15
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,876
There we go, all better.

16
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,671
There's my little boy.

17
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,430
Can I see something?

18
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,569
Cool!

19
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,322
He hates me.
My nephew hates me!

20
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,782
Come on, don't do this.

21
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,700
What if my own baby hates me?
What do I do then?

22
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,494
Monica, stop! This is nuts.

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:22,332
Do you know how long it'll be
before you have to deal with this?

24
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,712
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

25
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,716
Joey, she does not look fat.

Here you go.

29
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,188
Goo, goo, goo!

30
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:33,278
That is so funny!
Let me see that a sec.

31
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,201
You okay?

32
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,246
I don't know.

33
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,416
What's in this pie?

34
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,336
I don't know. Butter and eggs
and flour and lime and kiwi...

35
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,172
Kiwi? Kiwi?!

36
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,882
You said it was a key lime pie.

37
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:58,053
No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.
That's what makes it so special.

38
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,807
That's what's gonna kill me.

39
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,851
I'm allergic to kiwi.

40
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:09,315
No, you're not. You're allergic
to lobster and peanuts and...

41
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,275
Oh, my God!

42
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,902
It's definitely getting worse.

43
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,987
Is your tongue swelling up?

44
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,408
Either that or my mouth
is getting smaller!

45
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,827
Get your coat.
We're going to the hospital.

46
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,288
- Will he be okay?
- He's gotta get a shot.

47
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,833
You know, actually,
it's getting better. It is.

48
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,420
Let's not go.
Anyone up for Scrabble?

49
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,630
Jacket, now!

50
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,676
What about Ben? We can't
bring a baby to the hospital.

51
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,678
We'll watch him.

52
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,472
I don't think so.

53
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:47,269
I have seven Catholic sisters.
I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

54
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,438
Come on, we want to do it.
Don't we?

55
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,732
I was gonna play basketball...

56
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,860
...but I guess that's out the window.

57
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,196
If you take him out for a walk,
remember to bring his hat.

58
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,200
There's milk in the refrigerator
and diapers in the bag.

59
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,868
Hat, milk...

60
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,454
Got it!

61
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,131
Consider it done!

62
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,214
You understood?

63
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:20,844
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

64
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:25,015
Is he the one
with the beautiful wife?

65
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:33,065
You want to hear the song
I'm singing this afternoon?

66
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:37,319
I wrote it this morning in the shower.

67
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:42,949
<i>I'm in the shower</i>
<i>And I'm writing a song</i>

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,414
<i>Stop me if you've heard it</i>

69
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:53,043
<i>My skin is soapy and my hair is wet</i>

70
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:59,007
<i>And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget</i>

71
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:06,932
Rachel, sweetheart,
could I see you for a minute?

72
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,769
What's up?

73
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,729
FYl:

74
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,109
I've decided to pay a professional
musician to play here on Sundays.

75
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:21,488
Her name is Stephanie something.
She's supposed to be very good.

76
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,449
But what about Phoebe?

77
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,120
It's not that your friend is bad.

78
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,957
It's that she's so bad...

79
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:36,712
...she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye into my brain...

80
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,132
...and swirl it around.

81
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,719
Okay, so you're not a fan.

82
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:48,432
But, I mean, come on.
You cannot do this to her.

83
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,395
I have to do this to her?

84
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,729
<i>Lather, rinse, repeat</i>

85
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,149
<i>And lather, rinse, repeat</i>

86
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,861
<i>And lather, rinse, repeat</i>

87
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,323
<i>As needed</i>

88
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,121
We didn't bring enough stuff.

89
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,874
Did you forget to pack
the baby's anvil?

90
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,335
I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.

91
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,046
It's a known fact
that women love babies.

92
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,675
Women love guys who love babies.
It's the sensitive thing.

93
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:28,264
Aim him at that pack of babes.
Maybe one of them will break away.

94
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,767
Wait, forget them.
We got one. Hard left.

95
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,852
- Give me the baby.
- No, I got him.

96
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,228
Come on, seriously.

97
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,899
Oh, seriously, you want him?

98
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,821
Who is this little cutie-pie?

99
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,740
Well, don't think me immodest, but...

100
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,618
...me.

101
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:50,786
Want to smell him?

102
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,665
I assume we're talking about the baby?

103
00:06:55,832 --> 00:07:00,628
He's got that great baby smell.
Get a whiff of his head.

104
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,216
My uterus just skipped a beat.

105
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,634
What'd I tell you?

106
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,552
It's great you're doing this.

107
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,722
Well, we are great guys.

108
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:13,100
My brother and his boyfriend
have been trying to adopt.

109
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,271
What agency did you two go through?

110
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,942
But this is my gig.

111
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,610
This is where I play.

112
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,322
My name is written out there in chalk.

113
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:30,826
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

114
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,913
Honey, I'm sorry.

115
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,414
And he's going to
be paying this woman?

116
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,543
Why doesn't he just give her
a throne and a crown?

117
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:45,299
And, like, a gold stick
with a ball on top?

118
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,136
Terry is a jerk! That's why
we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"

119
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:53,348
That's where that came from.

120
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,104
You probably did everything you could.

121
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:03,775
You know what? Let me just
see what else I could do.

122
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,113
Just let her go on after
Stephanie whatever her name is.

123
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,032
You won't be here.
You don't pay her.

124
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,534
I don't know.

125
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,619
I'll clean the cappuccino machine!

126
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,749
You don't clean
the cappuccino machine?

127
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,668
Of course I clean it.

128
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,588
I mean, I will clean it.

129
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,381
I mean, I will clean it.

130
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:31,053
All right, fine, fine, fine!

131
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,891
- Done.
- Really?

132
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,143
Who's working for you, babe?

133
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,981
Oh, my God! This is so exciting!
How much am I gonna get?

134
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,734
What?

135
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,111
He's paying the people
who were playing.

136
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:53,492
I meant, he's paying that other woman
because she's a professional.

137
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:58,163
I'm not gonna be the only one
who's not getting paid.

138
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,832
I'm sorry, no!

139
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:04,378
No, I'm not some sloppy second,
you know, charity band.

140
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,131
There are thousands of places
in this city...

141
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,050
...where people would pay
to hear me play.

142
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,177
<i>When I play, I play for me</i>

143
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,429
<i>I don't need your charity</i>

144
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,600
Thank you!

145
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,567
I'm not getting a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle...

146
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:31,905
...and squirt it into my mouth.
Like a squirt gun.

147
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,658
Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.

148
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,620
I see someone's having
a little allergic reaction.

149
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:42,833
Doctor, can I see you
for just a moment?

150
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:47,171
My brother has
a slight phobia about needles.

151
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:51,800
Did you tell him
about my squirt gun idea?

152
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,261
My brother, the Ph.D.,
would like to know...

153
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,723
...if there's any way
to treat this orally?

154
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:02,978
Under these circumstances, it has to be
an injection, and it has to be now.

155
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,981
So?

156
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,777
Go and have a seat. The doctor
says it's got to be a needle.

157
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:17,243
You're just going to have to be brave.
Can you do that for me?

158
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:23,332
Oh, boy! You are doing so good.

159
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,210
You want to squeeze my hand?

160
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,462
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

161
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,215
Honey, really.
Don't squeeze it so hard!

162
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,718
Let go of my hand!

163
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,264
Good plan. Next time
we want to pick up women...

164
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:42,268
...we should go to
the park and make out.

165
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,563
Taxi! Taxi!

166
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,065
Look at that talent.

167
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,987
Just practicing. You're good.

168
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,989
Carry on.

169
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,199
Wait, wait, wait!

170
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,577
Hey, you. He's just adorable.

171
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:06,583
Can you tell him that?
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

172
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:11,463
- What are you guys out doing today?
- We're not out.

173
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,550
We're two heterosexual guys
hanging with the son...

174
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,139
...of our other heterosexual friend,
doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

175
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,600
You done?

176
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,352
There's our stop.

177
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,229
Get out of here!
This is our stop.

178
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,398
You guys live around here too?

179
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:33,986
We live in the building
by the sidewalk.

180
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,281
You know it?

181
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:43,120
Since we're neighbors, what do you say
we get together for a drink?

182
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,376
So you want to go to Markel's?

183
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,586
Sure, they love us over there.

184
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,631
Where's your baby?

185
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,144
Ben! Ben!

186
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,856
That's good. Maybe he'll
hear you and pull the cord!

187
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:14,026
Stop the bus!

188
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,702
Are you sure he didn't break it?
It hurts.

189
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,789
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

190
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,670
And right here is
the puncture wound from your ring.

191
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,589
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

192
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,382
Sorry.

193
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:41,554
Sorry! I got my S's back!

194
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,806
Which we can celebrate later.

195
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:48,018
Celebrate. Celebrate...

196
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,061
<i>He was a double, double</i>

197
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:54,691
<i>Double-jointed boy</i>

198
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:59,280
So are you the
professional guitar player?

199
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,449
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

200
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:07,037
Right. My name was on there,
but now it just says carrot cake.

201
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:11,333
So how many chords do you know?

202
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,420
- All of them.
- So you know D?

203
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,757
Do you know A-minor?

204
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:24,430
Do you know how to go
from D to A-minor?

205
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:31,604
So does your guitar have a strap?

206
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,816
Mine does.

207
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:41,780
<i>Stephanie knows all the chords</i>

208
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:46,201
Come on! Pick up, pick up!

209
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,579
Transit Authority?

210
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,456
I'm doing research for a book.

211
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:56,378
I was wondering what somebody might do
if they left a baby on a city bus.

212
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:59,297
Yes, I realize that would be
a stupid character.

213
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,134
Here's the deal:
We lost a car seat on a bus.

214
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,762
It's white plastic and
it fits onto a stroller.

215
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,933
And there was a baby in it.

216
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,977
He wants to talk to you.

217
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,773
Everybody, let's give a warm
Central Perk welcome to...

218
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,817
<i>Terry's a jerk</i>
<i>And he won't let me work</i>

219
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,487
<i>And I hate Central Perk</i>

220
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,578
To Stephanie Schiffer!

221
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:39,171
I'd like to start with a song I wrote
for the first man I ever loved.

222
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,466
<i>Zachary...</i>

223
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:47,095
<i>Are all invited to bite me</i>

224
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,941
We're the guys that called
about the baby! Is he here?!

225
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:02,319
He's here.

226
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,989
I assume one of you is the father.

227
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,159
- That's me.
- I'm him.

228
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:15,040
Actually, we're both the father.

229
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:26,426
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.

230
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:35,269
Please tell me you know
which one is our baby.

231
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,355
That one has ducks on his T-shirt
and this one has clowns.

232
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,649
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

233
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,069
Or clowns.

234
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:48,949
That one's Ben! Remember he had
that cute little mole by his mouth!

235
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,452
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

236
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:55,748
Okay, the mole came off.

237
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:59,043
What are we gonna do?

238
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,086
We'll flip for it.
Ducks or clowns.

239
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,505
- Flip for the baby?
- You got a better idea?

240
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,883
All right, call it in the air.

241
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,218
Heads.

242
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,221
Heads, it is.

243
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:16,310
We have to assign heads to something!

244
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,480
Right!

245
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:25,944
Ducks is heads
because ducks have heads.

246
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:33,869
What kind of scary-ass clowns
came to your birthday?

247
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:43,712
<i>Just call me angel</i>
<i>Of the morning, angel</i>

248
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:48,633
<i>Just touch my cheek</i>
<i>Before you leave me, baby</i>

249
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:53,514
<i>Just call me angel</i>
<i>Of the morning, angel</i>

250
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:58,352
<i>Then slowly turn away</i>

251
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:02,397
<i>I won't beg you to stay</i>

252
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:06,610
<i>With me</i>

253
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,038
Here. I thought you might be cold.

254
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,999
Thank you.

255
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,424
Look at you!
You did pretty well.

256
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,553
$8.27.

257
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:36,307
But not really, because
I put in the first two.

258
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:41,103
Just to get the ball rolling
and to make myself feel better.

259
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,981
Do you?

260
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:48,944
You know, this whole playing
for money thing is so not good for me.

261
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:53,448
I don't know, when I
sang "Su-su-suicide"...

262
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:57,453
...I got, like, $ 1.75.

263
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:01,081
But then "Smelly Cat"?

264
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:05,835
I got 25 cents and a condom.

265
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:11,050
So, you know, now I just feel
really bad for "Smelly Cat".

266
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:16,221
Honey, I don't think
everybody gets "Smelly Cat".

267
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:23,103
I mean, if all you've ever actually
had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

268
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,814
But it's not even that, you know?

269
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,858
I used to do my songs
because it made me happy.

270
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:34,531
Now it's just all
about the money, you know?

271
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,826
Well, people missed you in there.

272
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,413
In fact, there was actually
a request for "Smelly Cat".

273
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,456
Really? From who?

274
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,460
Well, me.

275
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:52,340
And I know it's not your big
money song, but it's my favorite.

276
00:18:54,676 --> 00:19:00,056
Did I accidentally drop
a condom in your case?

277
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,437
It's kind of an emergency.

278
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,105
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot.

279
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:11,068
Hey, Christine! I got it!

280
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:18,701
I want to thank you
for being there for me.

281
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:21,287
And I'm sorry
I almost broke your hand.

282
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:26,000
That's okay.
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

283
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,628
Remember the time I jammed
that pencil into your hand?

284
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:34,883
Remember it? What do
you think this is, a freckle?

285
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,928
What about the time I hit you
in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

286
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,723
Remember when I stuck
that broom in your spokes...

287
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:45,728
...and you hit your head on the curb?

288
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:49,689
But I remember
people telling me about it.

289
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,527
I hope Ben has a little sister.

290
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:57,323
And I hope she can kick his ass.

291
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,992
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

292
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,620
How about the time I cut
the legs off your Malibu Ken?

293
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,707
That was you?

294
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:12,337
They were infected.
He wouldn't have made it.

295
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,342
My little nephew.

296
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,803
Come here, little one!

297
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:24,516
There's my little baby, Ben!

298
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:30,814
Hey, he's not crying!

299
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:37,029
Hey, he's not crying!

300
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,286
There's still pie!

301
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,247
I'm here. I'm here.

302
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,749
How's my little boy?

303
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,713
You want Daddy to change
your diaper? I know, I know.

304
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:59,551
Did you have fun with Uncle Joey
and Uncle Chandler today?

305
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,722
He rode the bus today.

306
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:09,353
Big boy riding the bus...

307
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,898
Hey, I have a question.

308
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:18,528
How come it says,
"Property of Human Services"?

309
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,118
You are gonna love this.

310
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,496
Can you hold Ben for a sec?

311
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:28,705
Come here. Come here.

312
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:33,544
Stay back! I've got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!

313
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:41,635
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

314
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,554
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

315
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:45,806
No, no. I'm sorry, it's:

316
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:50,727
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

317
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:57,692
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

318
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:58,944
Better!

319
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,195
Much better. Good.

320
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,658
Don't feel bad,
because it's a hard song.

321
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,703
- You want to try it again?
- From the top?

322
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:11,039
There is no "top", all right?

323
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,919
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat".

324
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,464
Why don't you just follow me.

325
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:23,260
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

326
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,680

<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

328
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:33,896
<i>It's not your fault</i>

329
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:37,983
That's too much. Sorry.
