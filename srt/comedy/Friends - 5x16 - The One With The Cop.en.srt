1
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,098
- What are you guys doing up?
- Finishing the crossword.

2
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,978
Do you know a six-letter
word for "red"?

3
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,939
Dark-red.

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:27,277
Wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots
in here for you later.

5
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,406
Hey, how about maroon?

6
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:34,451
Yes! You are so smart!

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,244
You guys are so cute.

8
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,539
I know.

9
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,959
See you in the morning.

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,308
I love doing crossword
puzzles with you.

11
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,392
Me too.

12
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,228
Now let's finish this
and go to bed.

13
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,813
Only one left.

14
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,484
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but...

15
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,487
Cat.

16
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,367
You are so smart!

17
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,411
I love you.

18
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,622
I love you too.

19
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,638
The One with a Cop

20
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,397
We still need a tip.

21
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,108
All right. Hold on.

22
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,318
I got it.

23
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,403
Nickel.

24
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,574
- How much do we need?
- Couple of bucks.

25
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,908
Okay, dime.

26
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,162
You guys keep talking.
This could take a while.

27
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,123
Wait, look it!

28
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,251
This is a police badge!

29
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:53,132
Cool. But why would a cop come
in here? They don't serve doughnuts.

30
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:58,679
Can you discover the badge again?
I can do better than that.

31
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,973
I bet somebody's
missing that badge.

32
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,435
I should take it back.
But at the police station...

33
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,604
...I'll check their
Ten Most Wanted.

34
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:12,151
My friend's been Number 11 forever.
This could be her year!

35
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,114
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Joey.

36
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,325
Is that my sweatshirt?

37
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,954
Yes, it is. I'm sorry.
I was cold. I hope it's okay.

38
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,708
It's just that if you wear
someone's sweatshirt...

39
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,210
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?

40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,380
And I'm not him.

41
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,050
I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.

42
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,512
It's going to be all
smelling like Monica.

43
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,846
Do I smell bad?

44
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:46,143
You smell like a meadow.

45
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,479
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,274
What's with him?

47
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:58,405
The last time Joey went to a meadow,
his mother was shot by a hunter.

48
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,382
I still don't know.

49
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:20,553
I want to make sure I bought
the right couch, one that says...

50
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:25,056
..."Kids welcome here",
but that also says...

51
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,352
..."Come here to me."

52
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:34,190
What? You say that to kids?

53
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:40,030
The "Come here to me" is,
you know, for the ladies.

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,910
Honey, it's a nice couch,
not a magic couch.

55
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,788
Well, you picked a great couch.

56
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,499
- Sign here please.
- Sure.

57
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,753
The delivery charge
is almost as much as the couch!

58
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,964
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.

59
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,552
I'll take it myself.
Thank you.

60
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,973
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.

61
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,521
Are you kidding?

62
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:18,443
Come on. It's only three blocks.
It's not very heavy. Try it.

63
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,283
Oh, I can do it.

64
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,619
You two will really
enjoy that couch.

65
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,165
We're not together.

66
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:35,628
Something didn't quite add up there.

67
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,510
What's that supposed to mean?

68
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,096
Well, you. Her.

69
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,139
I mean, she's very...

70
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,600
...you know.

71
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,602
And you're, like...

72
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,355
...you know?

73
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,818
Not that it's any of your business,
but we did go out.

74
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,487
Really? You two?

75
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:06,200
I don't want to do this now.
I'm carrying a heavy couch.

76
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,078
Then tell him quickly.

77
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,163
Fine. We went out.

78
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,707
Not only did we go out...

79
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,295
...we did it 298 times!

80
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:25,594
You kept count?
You are such a loser!

81
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:31,308
A loser you did it with 298 times!

82
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:40,525
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put
your cigarette out on a tree.

83
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,070
Yeah, I can.
It worked well.

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,365
But you shouldn't.
So don't ever do that again.

85
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,535
I won't till I have
my next cigarette.

86
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:50,995
Hold it!

87
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,707
NYPD. Freeze, punk!

88
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,627
That's right. You are so busted.

89
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,505
Book them.

90
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,884
- Who are you talking to?
- Save it, red!

91
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:09,387
Apologize to the tree or
spend the night in the slammer.

92
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,432
I am not apologizing to a tree.

93
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:17,813
Apologize to the tree now,
or I am calling for backup.

94
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,981
Backup! Backup!

95
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,817
I'm sorry! Sorry!

96
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:26,697
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!

97
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,201
Didn't you say there was
an elevator in here?

98
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,747
Yes, I did, but there isn't.
Here we go!

99
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,916
Okay, go left.

100
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,835
Left. Left.

101
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:44,131
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.

102
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,717
Lift it straight up over your head.

103
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,136
Straight up. You can do it!

104
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,679
You can do it!

105
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,472
Okay. You got it?

106
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,266
- Go, go.
- Good, good.

107
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:59,104
You got it, right?
You got it, right? You got...

108
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,778
Any chance you think
it looks good there?

109
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,198
This guy was all...

110
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:13,160
And I'm all,
"Buffay! Homicide!"

111
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,412
It was just so cool!

112
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:20,667
- You were supposed to take it back.
- I'm having fun doing good deeds.

113
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,588
You can get arrested
for impersonating a police officer.

114
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,508
You could get arrested
right now!

115
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:35,015
I'd better take it back.
I'm totally drunk with power.

116
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,985
Yeah. I didn't know
you guys would be here.

117
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,823
- Do me a favor. Taste this.
- What? Why?

118
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,700
- What is with you?
- Nothing.

119
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,910
You're acting strange.

120
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,747
All right. There is something.

121
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,000
I kind of had a dream.

122
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,503
But I don't want to talk about it.

123
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:09,132
What if Martin Luther King
had said that?

124
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,636
I kind of have a dream.

125
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,515
I don't want to talk about it.

126
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,017
Look, it involved Monica.

127
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:22,062
You dreamt about the girl I'm seeing?
Cool.

128
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,523
I dreamt about the girls he was seeing.

129
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,568
Let's talk about your dream.
I love you. Your dream?

130
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,989
There was no sex.
I haven't dreamt of her like that...

131
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,410
...since I found out
about you two-ish.

132
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:43,334
What was the dream about?

133
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,671
You were my girlfriend.
We were doing the crossword puzzle.

134
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,714
Like you did last night.

135
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,135
That's it. I'm in love
with Monica. I'll move out.

136
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:57,598
Joey, come on. That doesn't mean
you're in love with me.

137
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:58,807
It doesn't?

138
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,767
It could mean anything.
Like...

139
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:05,147
...you're jealous that I've become
the apartment stud.

140
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,650
Sounds like your dream.

141
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:14,781
Or it could mean you saw Chandler
and me being close and stuff...

142
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,951
...and you want that too.

143
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,995
In the dream
I did enjoy the closeness.

144
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,289
Are you attracted to Monica?

145
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:27,753
Right here, right now,
are you attracted to her?

146
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,506
- Not really.
- There you have it!

147
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:35,386
Well, sure!
I'm just wearing sweats!

148
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,720
But that's good!

149
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,056
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.

150
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,893
It's not just about
getting a girlfriend.

151
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:47,689
I could get a girlfriend.
We could sit and do crossword puzzles.

152
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,068
But could we have
the closeness like you have?

153
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,280
Monica and I were friends
before we dated. Maybe that's it.

154
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,450
Friends first?

155
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,160
That's interesting.

156
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,165
- You become friends after?
- No, never done that either.

157
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,584
Do you guys have the tape measure?

158
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:11,422
Yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.

159
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,592
That's right.

160
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:29,106
What's up, Joey?

161
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,485
How you doing?

162
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,121
Excuse me. Is this your car?

163
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,541
Don't park here.
You're blocking the entrance.

164
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,668
Don't worry.
It's not a problem.

165
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:56,383
It's a problem for me, so it's a
problem for you because I'm a cop.

166
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:00,096
So am I.

167
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,811
Okay. So you're a cop.
You can park anywhere.

168
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,063
I know because I'm a cop too.

169
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,691
Keep up the good work.
Ten four.

170
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,944
Wait. So what precinct
are you with?

171
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,447
I'm with the 57th.

172
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,992
- I know a guy in Homicide up there.
- I'm in Vice.

173
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:27,247
In fact, I'm undercover
right now. I'm a whore.

174
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,250
Who else is in Vice there?

175
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,794
Do you know...

176
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,879
...Sipowitz?

177
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,089
Sipowitz? I don't think so.

178
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,635
Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.

179
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:42,721
I don't know him.

180
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,266
Don't try to call him.
He's not there. He's out.

181
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:50,021
His partner just died.

182
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,981
Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorry
for his loss.

183
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,693
I sure will. Take care.

184
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,571
By the way, Sipowitz
will be all right.

185
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,241
That kid from "Silver Spoons"
is really good.

186
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,038
Where'd you find my badge?

187
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:20,467
Could you give me and Ross
a hand moving his couch?

188
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,221
I'd love to but I got acting class.
But you know what?

189
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:29,184
I guess I could blow that off...
...or you.

190
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:37,192
Let me ask you something.
I was talking with Monica and Chandler.

191
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,361
Boy, they are really tight.

192
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,570
I know.

193
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:45,242
That's not a bad situation
they got there.

194
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:48,704
Think I'll get me one of those.

195
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,291
What's up, Joe?

196
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,711
I think Monica and Chandler
are so great...

197
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,547
...because they were friends first.

198
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:03,093
So I asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.

199
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,180
I saw you first, so...

200
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:14,771
- What are you saying?
- Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.

201
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,734
You know, honey...

202
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,278
...as flattered as I am...

203
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,698
...that you saw me first...

204
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:29,911
...I just don't think we should be
cranking anything up.

205
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:34,041
I'll treat you real nice.

206
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:42,215
Yeah. Well, you know...

207
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:47,513
I think it's a great idea to become
friends with someone before you date.

208
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:51,850
But the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend...

209
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,562
...build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.

210
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,816
Don't hit on your existing friends.

211
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:04,071
Won't that take longer?

212
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,116
Oh, but once you find it...

213
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,995
...it's so worth the wait.

214
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,830
I understand.

215
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,832
Good.

216
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:19,211
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.

217
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,965
Come here to me.

218
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:28,261
No, no. You come here to me.

219
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:33,308
- I brought reinforcements.
- Great! You brought Joey?

220
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,479
The next best thing.

221
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:42,109
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!

222
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:46,697
I would be offended, but Monica
is freakishly strong, so...

223
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,366
I drew a sketch
of how we'll do it.

224
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,493
Rach, that's you.

225
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,371
That's the couch.

226
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,039
What's that?

227
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,293
That's me.

228
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,966
Certainly think a lot of yourself.

229
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:09,595
No. That's my arm.

230
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:18,103
I see. I thought you just really,
really liked your new couch.

231
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,899
Just follow my lead.

232
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,987
Come on, Chandler.

233
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,572
- All right.
- Okay.

234
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,991
Here we go.

235
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,660
All right. Ready?

236
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:34,954
Turn!

237
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,205
Turn!

238
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,457
Turn!

239
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,794
- I don't think we can turn anymore!
- I don't think it'll fit!

240
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:46,090
Yeah, it will.
Come on! Up, up, up!

241
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,509
Up! Yes!

242
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,220
Here we go! Pivot!

243
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,098
Pivot!

244
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,099
Pivot!

245
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,894
Pivot!

246
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,522
Pivot!

247
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:02,564
Pivot!

248
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:07,110
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

249
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,324
I don't think it'll pivot anymore.

250
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,494
You think?

251
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:21,583
All right, let's bring it
back down and try again.

252
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:32,177
I think it's really stuck now.

253
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:35,806
- I can't believe that didn't work.
- I know. Me neither.

254
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,226
I mean, you had a sketch.

255
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:43,772
What did you mean when
you said "pivot"?

256
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,946
How's it going?
Make any new friends?

257
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:54,783
Yeah.
I met this woman.

258
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,411
What's she like?

259
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,204
Well, she's...

260
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,332
...really good in bed.

261
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:06,837
- You were going to be friends first.
- Hey, it's all your fault.

262
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:07,879
Why?

263
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,175
You didn't give me advice.
You gave me a pickup line.

264
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:15,220
I told her I wanted to
"build a foundation and be friends".

265
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:21,059
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,
I became irresistible to her!

266
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,104
And her roommate!

267
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,732
What about the "closeness"?

268
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:32,821
Closeness, schmosness! There was
three of us, for crying out loud!

269
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,534
Who wants pizza?

270
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,661
I do! I do! I do!

271
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:45,334
This is great! Can you believe
I found it on the second floor?

272
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,754
- Who is it?
- NYPD.

273
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,131
Oh, my God!

274
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,551
Just a minute, officer!

275
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,105
- I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
- My God, it's him! It's that cop!

276
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:11,569
- I can't believe he found me!
- Are you going to go to jail?

277
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:16,197
If I go down,
you guys go down with me.

278
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:20,411
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one-to-three years minimum.

279
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:24,123
Good luck, Chandler.

280
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,920
Arrest me, but you'll never
make it stick and you know it.

281
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,465
I have no choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?

282
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,509
And you understand that
I'm calling my lawyer.

283
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,140
And once he puts you on the stand
he'll make you look like a fool!

284
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,643
I don't like looking foolish.

285
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:49,022
Maybe I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.

286
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,901
I'd love it if I weren't here!

287
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,196
Since you're not going to jail tonight,
I was wondering if you'd...

288
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,115
...like to go to dinner with me?

289
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,534
Me?

290
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:04,621
Ever since you flashed my badge,
I can't stop thinking about you.

291
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:10,211
You're the prettiest fake
undercover whore I've ever seen.

292
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:13,047
Nice.

293
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:17,718
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.

294
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:22,014
I could've done it better,
but they're staring at me.

295
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:26,393
I'd like to go out
with you, officer.

296
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,395
- Gary.
- Gary.

297
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,522
Okay, so it's a date.

298
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,400
I got to ask you, though.
How'd you find me?

299
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,528
I ran your fingerprints
through the computer.

300
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,489
This was listed
as your last known address.

301
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,741
Impressive.

302
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:45,829
Not as impressive as you. Your record
shows you've done some weird stuff.

303
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,707
We'll talk at dinner.

304
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:52,461
- So I'll come by and pick you up?
- I can't wait.

305
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:57,132
Don't worry, I won't just
take you out for doughnuts.

306
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,846
He has a gun!

307
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:12,022
I'd like to return this couch.
I'm not satisfied with it.

308
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,113
You want to return this couch?

309
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:22,741
It's cut in half.

310
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:28,288
- That's what I'm telling you.
- Did you cut this couch in half?

311
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:32,835
This couch is cut in half!

312
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:38,090
I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half.

313
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,844
You're saying this couch was
delivered to you like this?

314
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:44,179
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

315
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,058
I will accept store credit.

316
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:53,855
I'll give you store credit
in the amount of four dollars.

317
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,903
I will take it.
