1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,712
Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:07,466
I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,885
Why do you want to see Burrows so bad, anyhow?

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,261
Because he's my brother.

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,972
So you get yourself tossed into Fox River with him?

6
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,475
To what... save him?

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,893
...and whoever it was that set me up,

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,770
wants me in the ground as quickly was possible.

9
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,146
Look, the closer it gets,

10
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,191
the more I'm worried that the bottom is gonna fall out of this whole thing.

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,271
That's the son of a bitch that fingered Abruzzi.

12
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:27,778
Someone found Fibanacci.

13
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,405
Who was this someone?

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,739
Why'd you hire him?

15
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,409
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

16
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,994
Hey, come at me, John.

17
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,246
I'm coming after you.

18
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,288
I doubt it.

19
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,084
I'm getting you out of here.

20
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:42,960
It's impossible.

21
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,711
Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

22
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,921
You've seen the blueprints.

23
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,339
Better than that.

24
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,716
I've got them on me.

25
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:08,819
You're anticipating every one of my moves, three moves in advance.

26
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,737
You're a hell of a strategist, Fish.

27
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,698
You ever think about Boston?

28
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,532
Sure.

29
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,367
Think you'll ever see it again?

30
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,787
I'm a 60-year-old man with 60 years left on my ticket.

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,497
What do you think?

32
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,374
I'm thinking about going.

33
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,252
Well, there's goin' and there's goin'.

34
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,712
Which one you mean?

35
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,089
The one you think I mean.

36
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:36,972
Three days inside, and he's already thinking about turning rabbit.

37
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,016
It'll pass.

38
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,684
It always does.

39
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,563
There's bigger things to worry about at the moment.

40
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,482
I've been in here long enough to know it when I see it.

41
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,568
The calm before the storm.

42
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,780
Whites and blacks are going at each other real soon here.

43
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,950
Everybody chooses sides, and a lot of guys bleed.

44
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,911
There a reason?

45
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,122
Same reason you don't put cats and dogs in the same cage.

46
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,707
They don't get along.

47
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,613
Hmm.

48
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,489
What?

49
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,990
Toilet won't flush.

50
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:37,908
So?

51
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,536
Means only one thing--

52
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,043
The DIRT shuts off the water, so you can't flush your contraband.

53
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,711
We got nothing to worry about.

54
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,296
Says you!

55
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,094
Under the table...

56
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,183
What the hell is this?

57
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,978
Insurance, white boy. Now dump it!

58
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,608
Open it.

59
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,154
So...

60
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,241
tooling up for the race riot, are we?

61
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,326
Hand it over.

62
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,915
Rugheads and the billies.

63
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,294
Now, which side are you on anyhow, Fish?

64
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,837
That would be neither, boss.

65
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,173
Maybe you're gonna go extracurricular with it then.

66
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,841
Stick a C.O., maybe.

67
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,468
Is there a problem here, Deputy?

68
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,803
Got a shank in here.

69
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,224
Is this yours?

70
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,318
You're not a good liar.

71
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,279
Come on, Sucre, you're going to the SHU.

72
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,288
Move along, Deputy.

73
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,998
I'm not done shaking this cell down yet.

74
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,291
I said move along.

75
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,089
In the old man's back pocket, are you?

76
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,799
Well, I got news for you, Fish.

77
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,843
He may run this place during the day,

78
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,262
but I run it during the night.

79
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:30,160

80
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,136
The hell were you thinking, Michael?

81
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,266
How are we doing it?

82
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,101
The infirmary.

83
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,519
Infirmary?

84
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,106
It's the weakest link in the security chain.

85
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,149
As long as I get that PUGNAc,

86
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,734
I'll get all the access I need.

87
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,236
What the hell's a PUGNAc?

88
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,155
It lowers my insulin levels to the point that I'm hyperglycemic.

89
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,575
As long as the good doctor thinks I'm diabetic,

90
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,619
I'll have plenty of time in there to do what I need to do.

91
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:28,245
Which is?

92
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,079
A little work.

93
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,039
A little prep for your arrival.

94
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,125
That's the idea, anyway.

95
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,084
The idea?

96
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,712
There's a little hitch in getting the PUGNAc, that's all.

97
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,590
They don't exactly stock it at the commissary.

98
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,800
You're telling me this whole thing's riding on a bunch of pills.

99
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,969
Someone's working on it as we speak.

100
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,643
Now's not the time to be trusting a black inmate, Michael.

101
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,687
Our  relationship transcends race.

102
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,273
Nothing transcends race in here.

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,608
I can't let you do it.

104
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,776
Good behavior, you're out of here in three years.

105
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,236
Gonna be a whole lot sooner than that.

106
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,154
Can't be done...

107
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,448
Can't be done, Michael.

108
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,949
No one's ever broken out of Fox River.

109
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,868
Every  single step's already been mapped out.

110
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:08,744
Every contingency.

111
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,454
Every contingency?

112
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,581
You may have the blueprints of this place,

113
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,334
but there's one thing those plans can't show you-- people,

114
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,627
guys like Abruzzi--

115
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,421
you so much as look at these cats the wrong way, they'll cut you up.

116
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,090
As far as the rest of these guys are concerned

117
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,551
I'm just another con doing his time.

118
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,719
Staying out of trouble.

119
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,347
Your don't go looking for trouble in here, it just finds you.

120
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,057
And when it does, we'll be long gone.

121
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,600
This is madness.

122
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,185
You can't even get out of your cell.

123
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,353
Not true.

124
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,479
What, you got a key?

125
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,189
Something like that.

126
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,907
Wrong piece of real estate, Fish.

127
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,283
Belongs to T-Bag.

128
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,534
Who?

129
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,370
You best speak with respect, Fish.

130
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,081
Man kidnapped half a dozen boys and girls down in 'Bama,

131
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,416
raped 'em and killed 'em.

132
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,418
Wasn't always in that order, either.

133
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,504
Does T-Bag have a real name?

134
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,215
That is my real name.

135
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,012
No, no, no. Please... sit.

136
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:38,519
So you're the new one I been hearin' all the rave reviews about.

137
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,437
Scofield.

138
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,440
One thing's for sure, you're just as pretty as advertised.

139
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:45,901
Prettier, even.

140
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,073
Rugheads got you scared, do they?

141
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:51,865
Sorry?

142
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,408
Assume that's why you're over here.

143
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,785
Few days on the inside,

144
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,871
any God-fearing white man realizes the correctional system's

145
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:01,798
got a serious lean toward the African-American persuasion.

146
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:02,625
I hadn't noticed.

147
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,712
They got the numbers all right, so they think they do as they please.

148
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,673
We got one thing they don't--

149
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,174
surprise.

150
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,261
We gonna take the ball game to them real soon.

151
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,721
It's gonna be nasty for a first-timer like you,

152
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,349
but we'll protect you. I'll protect you.

153
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,101
All you got to do is...

154
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,729
take this pocket right here,

155
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,815
and your life'll be all peaches and cream.

156
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,859
I walk, you walk with me.

157
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,736
Keep you real close, so no one up in here can hurt you.

158
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,031
Looks to me you already got a girlfriend.

159
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,829
I got a whole 'nother pocket over here.

160
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,289
I'll pass.

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,293
I don't protect you,

162
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,629
them  rugheads gonna gobble you up like a plate of black-eyed peas.

163
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:48,630
I said no.

164
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,507
Then you best move, then.

165
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,050
Now.

166
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,473
You come around these bleachers again,

167
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,894
it's gonna be more than just words we're exchanging.

168
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,146
Know what I'm saying?

169
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,733
Excuse me.

170
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,694
Are you the Tim Giles that represented Lincoln Burrows?

171
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:11,653
Okay, if you're a reporter...

172
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,031
I'm not a reporter. I know the defendant personally.

173
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,867
Huh. You family?

174
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,035
Not exactly.

175
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,330
We were in a relationship a few years back.

176
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,748
Well, look, ma'am, I, uh...

177
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,083
I-I don't know what to tell you. I mean, the man was guilty.

178
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,794
The prosecution's case was a slam dunk.

179
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,963
Because the victim was the Vice President's brother.

180
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,342
If you're suggesting that the federal government rammed this thing through,

181
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,302
okay, I take offense to that, 'cause I fought for that guy.

182
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,012
That's not what I meant.

183
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,223
The evidence was there.

184
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,767
Lincoln worked for Steadman's company.

185
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,686
He gets into a public altercation with the guy, so, he gets fired.

186
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,104
Two weeks later, Steadman's shot dead.

187
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,940
The murder weapon is found in Lincoln's house,

188
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,234
and the victim's blood found on his clothes.

189
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,736
Trust me, there are cases you lose sleep over, but

190
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,321
this isn't one of 'em.

191
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,324
What about Crab Simmons?

192
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,201
Lincoln said he could exonerate him.

193
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,744
Why didn't you put him on the stand?

194
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,163
The man's a five-time felon, all right?

195
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,873
He-He... He had no credibility.

196
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,875
So, you wouldn't mind if I paid him a visit.

197
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,628
Be my guest, but I don't think it'd do you any good.

198
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,944
Strange feeling. I don't know how to explain it.

199
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,781
Now, um...

200
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,660
usually, my whole life, it's always been crazy,

201
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,328
noisy,

202
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,332
maddening, you know, in my head, but...

203
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,585
right now, it's quiet.

204
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,337
It's perfect.

205
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,174
Glad you came back.

206
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,887
I thought about you the whole time.

207
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,099
You know, I, uh, made a lot of mistakes in my life.

208
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,142
I know that.

209
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,936
I'm gonna make it right.

210
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,730
I know you will.

211
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,365
What are you doing?

212
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:21,617
I want to remember this.

213
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:22,326
No.

214
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,494
Oh, come on. Oh, come on, V, please, just one.

215
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:25,787
Okay.

216
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,007
Easy, man.

217
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,342
How we doin' on the PUGNAc?

218
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,760
Hey, I'm workin' on it.

219
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,054
Well, work faster. I need that stuff tonight.

220
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:46,266
What's up there in that infirmary that you need so bad?

221
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,645
You get me that PUGNAc, and maybe I'll tell you.

222
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,908
Uh-uh... uh!

223
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,122
Thought we had an understanding.

224
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,124
This here's for the family.

225
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,710
You made it pretty clear you ain't blood.

226
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:15,712
How 'bout you hand that over?

227
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,769
Nice-looking piece of steel; bit of work.

228
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,688
You could do some serious damage with it.

229
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,984
Question is, who was it you was plannin' on damaging?

230
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,070
I seen you with the Negroes, you know.

231
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,447
Well, maybe you're one of them milk chickens.

232
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,699
All confused-like.

233
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,827
White on the outside, black as tar on the inside.

234
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,664
Maybe we ought to take a look at them insides and find out, hmm?

235
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,999
Girl Scouts!

236
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,251
Is there a problem over there?

237
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,590
Think we'll just hang onto this, if that's okay with you.

238
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:04,803
Hey,  I'm not gonna ask you again. Let's break up the party, ladies.

239
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,182
You heard the man, little dogie.

240
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,894
Get along.

241
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,698
What's it take to shake down another inmate,

242
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,616
get something he's taken from you?

243
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,827
It would take Fibonacci.

244
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,370
I'll give you Fibonacci--

245
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:54,997
I promise you that--

246
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,957
when the time is right.

247
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,750
Time is right now.

248
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,795
No, the time is right when you and I are both standing outside those walls.

249
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,381
You're sitting on life without parole.

250
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,175
You're never gonna stand outside those walls again.

251
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:07,885
Not unless you knew someone.

252
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,387
Someone who knew a way out.

253
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,139
What do you say, John?

254
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,641
I say I've heard nothing but blabber.

255
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,372
Philly Falzone.

256
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:38,999
It's an honor.

257
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,502
What are you doing here?

258
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,587
Well, I, um...

259
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,839
I just thought we'd, you know, fraternize.

260
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,008
He looks like it, doesn't he?

261
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,510
Looks what?

262
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,512
Like everybody's been saying.

263
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:52,846
You got no sack.

264
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,515
You've been neutered.

265
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,559
You shouldn't talk to me like that.

266
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,353
You used to pick up my laundry.

267
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,604
Not anymore, John.

268
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:04,733
John, word is that someone in here knows where Fibonacci is,

269
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,276
and you're not doing anything about it.

270
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,236
I'm working on it.

271
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,446
Well, you're not working on it fast enough.

272
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,157
Apparently, Fibonacci's coming up for air again.

273
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,785
Next month, a Congressional hearing.

274
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,288
Now, if he testifies at that hearing,

275
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,457
a  lot of people are going down,

276
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,917
including me.

277
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,503
Now, I've known you a long time.

278
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,547
Our wives are friends,

279
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,382
our kids go to the same Catholic school.

280
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,177
Now, it would be a shame

281
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,555
if anything were to happen to your kids.

282
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,223
I know my kids would miss them.

283
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,683
You don't need to do this.

284
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,600
I do.

285
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,602
I'll get this guy.

286
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,437
We'll get Fibonacci.

287
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,233
Well, for everyone's sake, I hope you're right.

288
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,651
I am.

289
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,069
Be well, John.

290
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,239
Thank you.

291
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,251
Yo, Badge, I gotta use the phone!

292
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,882
Sure, no problem. You want a pizza and a pedicure, too?

293
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,008
No. It's-It's Monday, man.

294
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,885
I got to call my girl. She's expecting my call...

295
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,678
Put a sock in it. You got nothin' comin'.

296
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,054
No, no, no...

297
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,190
Hey, pull up the manifest.

298
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:31,361
There an Allen Schweitzer in GenPop?

299
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,032
Nope.

300
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,700
You about the SHU?

301
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:37,951
Nope.

302
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,286
Why are you asking?

303
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:40,579
Curious, that's all.

304
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,537
You hear the trumpets, Fish?

305
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,413
I know you hear 'em.

306
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,374
That's Judgment Day.

307
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,669
It's comin'... real soon.

308
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,156
What are you doing in my cell?

309
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,288
I want in.

310
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,133
I'm not quite sure I heard that, Fish.

311
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:17,593
Did you just say you're in?

312
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:18,510
That's right.

313
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,720
You know the old saying, don't you?

314
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,763
In for an inch, in for a mile.

315
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,015
Whatever it takes.

316
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,433
You want me to fight, I'll fight.

317
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,476
The bolt from the bleachers-- that's what it was for.

318
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:30,189
Well, you want to fight, you gonna get your chance.

319
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:31,940
Next count.

320
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,984
- Tonight?
- Problem with that?

321
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,694
'Cause we goin' straight at 'em.

322
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,155
Better catch a square, Fish.

323
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,115
We undermanned in a big way.

324
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,450
All I need's a weapon.

325
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,160
You  want a weapon, bitch?

326
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,079
There you go.

327
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:48,916
All prisoners return to cells.

328
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,961
You gonna have to prove yourself 'fore we trust you with the heavy artillery.

329
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:54,296
Know what I'm sayin'?

330
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,255
Gates closing!

331
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,518
I wanted to apologize for being so short with you before.

332
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,352
No problem.

333
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,853
Closer it gets to an execution,

334
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,106
the harder it becomes, so that's why I wanted to give you this.

335
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,319
It's the, uh, surveillance tape of the garage that night.

336
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:20,280
It was a closed trial, so no one outside of the courtroom saw it.

337
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,324
I thought it could help you out.

338
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,951
- With what?
- Closure.

339
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,626
Allen Schweitzer.

340
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,254
That name mean anything to you?

341
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,299
Should it?

342
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,675
I don't know. You tell me.

343
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,013
Never heard of the guy.

344
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:27,556
Are you sure?

345
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,016
Positive.

346
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,584
Uh, what's up, Snowflake?

347
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,676
Do you think I'm a fool?

348
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:07,429
What are you talking about?

349
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:10,224
I see you up there with the Hitler Youth.

350
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,853
You know, I got a good mind to slash you open right now.

351
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,355
It's not what you think.

352
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,649
They've got something I need.

353
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,527
Now, see, that's funny.

354
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,904
Because I got something you need, too.

355
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,534
You want your PUGNAc, Fish, huh?

356
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:34,164
Right here, baby. It's all you.

357
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,379
Listen, white boy, your luck just ran out.

358
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,507
You chose the wrong side.

359
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:27,050
Man... it's great to see your face.

360
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,141
I think it's time you quit the charade, don't you?

361
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:35,601
What?

362
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,436
It's starting to ruin people's lives.

363
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,107
Michael's in here because he thinks you're innocent.

364
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:43,650
He told you.

365
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,528
He hasn't told me anything, but I know, Lincoln.

366
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,197
I know what he's planning.

367
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,407
Call him off.

368
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,868
If you love him, call him off.

369
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,663
I saw the tape.

370
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,624
What's on the tape's not how it went down.

371
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,666
I know what I saw.

372
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,793
I know what I saw.

373
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,920
I was there, remember?

374
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:08,967
I got high that night.

375
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,177
I had to.

376
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,304
It was the only way I could go through with it.

377
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,070
I never pulled the trigger.

378
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,530
The guy was already dead.

379
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,033
Yeah, I know. You've told me a thousand...

380
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,202
Then listen! I was set up!

381
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:36,745
I went there that night to clear a debt.

382
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,706
Crab Simmons was on my ass for the 90 grand I owed him.

383
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,583
He told me the mark was some scumbag drug dealer

384
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,335
and if I took it, we'd be clean.

385
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:44,795
I never pulled the trigger.

386
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:48,090
All I know is that somebody wanted me in the same garage as Terrence Steadman that night.

387
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,842
Why would somebody want to set you up?

388
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,180
It wasn't about me. It was about him.

389
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:56,390
Steadman?

390
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,266
Yes!

391
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:58,517
The guy was like a saint.

392
00:25:58,642 --> 00:25:59,726
All the charity work,

393
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:02,396
the environmental progress his company was making...

394
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:06,275
About the only person in this entire country who had motive to kill him was you.

395
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,069
You came all the way down here to tell me how guilty I am?

396
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,657
I don't know why I came here.

397
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,539
You have your life now--

398
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:21,874
I know that--

399
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,294
but if what we had before meant anything to you,

400
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:27,546
you'd find out the truth.

401
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,967
Maybe all this is the truth.

402
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,095
Maybe they got it right.

403
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:12,591
Badge!

404
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,593
Open up, Badge!

405
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:15,928
You talking again?

406
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:16,929
It's my girl's birthday.

407
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,180
Happy birthday to her, then.

408
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,306
You gotta let me call her! Please!

409
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,058
I'll give you a million dollars, if you let me use the phone.

410
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,392
I seen your kicks, Sucre.

411
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:24,561
You got something like 40 cents to your name.

412
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:25,354
Please!

413
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,231
God, no!

414
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:53,382
All right. Maricruz. What are you doing? Come on.

415
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,134
Yeah, it's okay, Hector. You go ahead.

416
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,427
What are you talking about?

417
00:27:57,803 --> 00:27:59,263
I think I'm just going to take a cab.

418
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,391
What do you mean, like, go home? I mean, you just got here.

419
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,480
He didn't call you, did he?

420
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:16,488
Look... I love Fernando to death, but the guy's a deadbeat.

421
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,031
You got to move on with your life.

422
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:27,916
Mr. Giles,

423
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,209
we'd like to have a word with you, if we could.

424
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:30,544
I really don't have time.

425
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:32,254
I'm afraid we're going to have to insist.

426
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,341
It's come to our attention that you made a FOIL request

427
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,177
a couple of days ago, on the Burrows case.

428
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:42,055
Yeah. So?

429
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,474
Records show that you made a dupe of the surveillance tape.

430
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:45,350
That's right.

431
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,561
Mind us asking why?

432
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,398
It's for one of Burrows' old girlfriends, man.

433
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:53,942
She was under the impression that the guy was innocent.

434
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,861
I figured it'd, you know, help her with closure.

435
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,654
She's in possession of the tape now, then?

436
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,364
Don't pull that card on me.

437
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,200
It's the Freedom of Information Act.

438
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,036
She's entitled to that tape as much as you or I are.

439
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,538
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, by all means, by all means.

440
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,624
- May I go now?
- Just one more thing.

441
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,709
This old girlfriend of his...

442
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,544
what's her name?

443
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,350
Excuse me.

444
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,893
Is this the Simmons residence?

445
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:29,478
I'm Ms. Simmons.

446
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,188
I'm sorry, um...

447
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,440
I'm Veronica Donovan.

448
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:36,276
I'm looking for Crab Simmons. Are you related?

449
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:37,778
He's my son.

450
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:38,820
Is he around?

451
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,405
No.

452
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:41,949
Could you tell me where I could find him?

453
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,826
Lady, go away. I can't help you. Can't you understand that?

454
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,495
I'm sorry. It's just...

455
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,999
a man's life is at stake, and maybe your son can help him.

456
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,710
Crab can't help nobody, lady.

457
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:55,587
He's dead.

458
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,466
I'm sorry.

459
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:16,108
Heads up! 7-up, cons, stand your gate!

460
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,698
'Bout to jump off, Fish.

461
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,632
Ballard, get back on your number.

462
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:43,802
I need backup.

463
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,596
I said back on your number!

464
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,868
Help me...

465
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,083
Scofield!

466
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,290
You're a dead man, Scofield!

467
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,250
You hear me?!

468
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,627
You're a dead man!

469
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,049
I really don't know what to say to you gentlemen.

470
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,427
I try to give you the benefit of the doubt,

471
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:32,596
I try to treat you with respect.

472
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:36,725
You can't even respect yourselves.

473
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:40,062
So, there's going to be a 48-hour lockdown.

474
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,189
No mess. No showers.

475
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,440
No visitation.

476
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:48,737
And I strongly suggest that you all learn to get along.

477
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,156
Otherwise, the next time, it's going to be a week,

478
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,492
and the time after that, it's going to be a month.

479
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,202
Think about it.

480
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,070
Got a Leticia Barres on the line.

481
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,239
I don't know who that is. Take a message.

482
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,199
She says she used to date Crab Simmons.

483
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:40,205
Leticia, thank you for calling.

484
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:41,665
You want to hear what I have to say,

485
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:44,042
we meet in a public place, where they can't get to us.

486
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:46,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where who can't get to us?

487
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:48,172
You want to hear what I have to say or not?

488
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:50,340
'Cause if you don't, I'm going to hang up right now.

489
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:53,051
No, no, no-- you just name the time and the place.

490
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,016
Over here.

491
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:00,475
Leticia, thanks for coming..

492
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,476
Go easy, lady.

493
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,061
We don't know each other, you got that?

494
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,647
We'll stay out here in the open where they can't get to us.

495
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,441
Where they can't do what they do.

496
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:10,444
Only reason why I'm talking to you

497
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,571
'cause they gonna kill your boy like they killed mine.

498
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:15,073
Coroner's report says smack killed your boyfriend, Leticia.

499
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:17,117
- It was an overdose.
- Wasn't no overdose.

500
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:18,035
What do you mean?

501
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:20,287
Crab didn't use. He had a bad heart.

502
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:22,289
If he touched the stuff, it'd kill him.

503
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:24,458
I mean, don't you think it's just the slightest bit of a coincidence

504
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,002
he OD'd a week after your boyfriend's crime?

505
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:29,880
They killed him 'cause he knew things.

506
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:31,507
Things they didn't want to get out.

507
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:32,216
Like what?

508
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,301
Like who was really behind that hit that night.

509
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:35,844
Wasn't Crab, that's for damn sure.

510
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,513
And it sure as hell wasn't Lincoln.

511
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,556
Neither of them boys knew what they were getting into.

512
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,350
They were just pawns in a big game.

513
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:42,434
What?

514
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:43,894
- They're here.
- Who's here, Leticia?

515
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,062
Don't try to follow me.

516
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:46,688
Don't find me. I won't testify.

517
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,315
Just slow down and talk to me.

518
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,526
I'd get as far away from here as you can, girl.

519
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,611
'Cause there ain't nobody they can't get to.

520
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:55,781
Leticia!

521
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:32,025
Hello?

522
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,736
We have a small complication.

523
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,488
There's a lawyer poking around.

524
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,365
Veronica Donovan.

525
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:40,409
Yes.

526
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:43,662
You can handle a girl who graduated

527
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:46,582
in the middle of her Baylor law school class.

528
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,168
At least I'd like to think so,

529
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,962
given the stakes of what we're dealing with here.

530
00:36:57,843 --> 00:37:01,680
Anyone that's a threat to what we're doing is expendable.

531
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,307
Anyone.

532
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,600
Understood.

533
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,810
Then do what you need to do to make this go away.

534
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:22,784
You there, Pretty?

535
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,082
I know you're there.

536
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:33,086
Just want you to know I'm coming for you.

537
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:36,006
You got nowhere to run.

538
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:40,010
You're trapped in that little hole of yours.

539
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:44,097
Trapped like a pig I'm going to slaughter.

540
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:16,064
Who's my 1:00?

541
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,316
Uh, Michael Scofield.

542
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,989
I was wrong about you, Scofield. Here's your PUGNAc.

543
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:25,324
Little bit late.

544
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,117
Better late than never, right?

545
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,119
Scofield! Infirmary!

546
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,038
- We'll see about that.
- Mm-hmm.

547
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,667
I'm gonna find out, you know...

548
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:37,836
what it is you're doing up there.

549
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:49,932
How long does this take?

550
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,391
It used to take hours.

551
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:53,060
They've come a long way with the new glucose kits.

552
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:54,811
This'll take us about ten seconds.

553
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,606
Slide the strip into the meter, we're ready to go.

554
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:01,985
I'm sure you know this,

555
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:06,031
but average glucose for the non-diabetic is about 100 milligrams per deciliter,

556
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:09,117
so we see a number like that here, and we know you've been misdiagnosed.

557
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:18,794
You seem nervous.

558
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:21,338
I do?

559
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:22,798
You're sweating.

560
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,299
Must be the needles.

561
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:27,094
Never really got used to them.

562
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:30,514
Somehow, with diabetes and that tattoo, I find that hard to believe.

563
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:32,766
Ah...

564
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:36,979
Bad news, I'm afraid.

565
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,694
180 milligrams per deciliter. You're definitely diabetic.

566
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,578
Do you need anything else from me?

567
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,080
Arm to stick a needle in.

568
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:56,123
Okay.

569
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:57,791
I'll see you Wednesday.

570
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,753
- Cute.
- Prisoner.

571
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,300
I don't know. There's something strange about him.

572
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:07,509
What do you mean?

573
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:08,969
I gave him the results of his blood test,

574
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:10,512
and there was this look on his face.

575
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,638
It was, um...

576
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,558
relief.

577
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,021
It's all right.

578
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,272
I got it.

579
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:22,566
I'm headed over to A-Wing anyhow.

580
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,820
You're positively beaming, boss.

581
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:30,032
Got up on the right side of the bed this morning, I guess.

582
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:31,867
Hold up.

583
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:32,910
Sugar.

584
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:34,620
Don't you move, Fishy.

585
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:37,956
Hey, what are you doing?

586
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,124
You're coming with us, Fish.

587
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:58,060
This little polka you and I have been doing for a while--

588
00:41:58,352 --> 00:41:59,728
as of this moment...

589
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:02,981
...it's over.

590
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:10,531
Fibonacci.

591
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,659
I want to know how you got to him...

592
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,286
and where he is, right now.

593
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,996
Not going to happen, John.

594
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,516
Now, I'm going to count to three.

595
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:40,477
One...

596
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,896
I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

597
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:46,024
You know it and I know it.

598
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:47,234
Two...

599
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:50,737
I'll tell you the moment we're outside those walls,

600
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:52,114
not a second before.

601
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:53,282
You tell me now.

602
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:57,202
Not gonna happen, John.

603
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:58,287
Hey...

604
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:00,831
I'm going to give you one last chance.

605
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:12,843
Three.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
