1
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,007
You know,
someday, weeks will go by,

2
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,803
maybe even years, it won't
even cross our minds.

3
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:23,006
We'll come home,
and we'll talk about work.

4
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:26,410
And what we want
for dinner...

5
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:27,811
movies.

6
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,212
Nursery schools.

7
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:34,551
It's going to be great.

8
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:41,858
Yeah. Yeah, all we got to do
is survive.

9
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:43,693
We will.

10
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:46,229
I promise.

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,033
What happened?

12
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,669
Nothing. The detonator
must have failed.

13
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:54,704
Distract them.
We'll be there in five minutes.

14
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:56,506
No, we don't have
five seconds, Michael.

15
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:58,575
Then you'll have
to trigger it manually.

16
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:01,111
How much time
is that gonna give me?

17
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:06,783
Out. Now.

18
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,753
<i>Alex?</i>

19
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:13,957
Alex?!

20
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:15,592
It's wiped clean.

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,861
That's not possible.
- Really?

22
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,246
Well, then where is it?
Where's the data?

23
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:20,564
It was intact

24
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:21,998
when I took it.

25
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:23,433
I'll tell you what,

26
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,068
If it doesn't boot up

27
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:26,470
in ten seconds,
I'm gonna

28
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:28,638
splatter your skull
all over these walls.

29
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:29,606
I came to you. I want this over.

30
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:32,075
Why would I jeopardize that?

31
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:36,813
I don't believe that Michael
just let you have it.

32
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:39,583
He didn't-- he left me alone
in a room, and I took it.

33
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,587
And that wasn't the least bit
suspicious to you?

34
00:01:43,654 --> 00:01:46,590
Maybe. I...

35
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:48,925
I don't know.

36
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:52,062
Or you're lying.

37
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,766
Kill the junkie.

38
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,124
Oh! You pathetic slug.

39
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:24,427
Sara was the only
leverage we had.

40
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:25,996
Scofield's donned
many a chapeaux,

41
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,064
but human fly?

42
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:31,268
I should anticipate him
scaling the building?

43
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:33,136
Move on Panama.

44
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:35,038
Proffer your nine.

45
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,714
Men in my employ, Bagwell...

46
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:46,449
anticipate.

47
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:48,785
They cover their bases.

48
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:51,521
They refuse to fail--

49
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:55,692
which you seem to do
with unyielding consistency.

50
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:01,064
That's got to be Sara's phone.

51
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:02,832
I should answer it.

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,569
What do you got
to lose, General?

53
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:09,306
Yello?

54
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,508
Who the hell is this?

55
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:12,943
Is this Fernando Sucre?

56
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,477
Oh, thank you, God.

57
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:15,478
Bagwell?

58
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:17,147
Yeah.

59
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:18,014
And we're on the same team,

60
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:19,716
brother, same team.

61
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,418
Our boys are
in a hell of a pickle.

62
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:22,752
Where's Michael?

63
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,188
Uh, his mother snatched
him and Tancredi.

64
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:27,123
Linc, too-- and I personally

65
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:29,292
took a nasty beat-down.

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,460
Where does she have them?

67
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:31,628
I got an idea,

68
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:32,862
but I can't say on the phone.

69
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,064
I'm running scared, amigo.

70
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,265
Okay, cool it. You know what?

71
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,634
Um, we got somebody
who can help us out,

72
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:39,703
but I need to get ahold
of Michael.

73
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,405
We should, uh, we should get
together and pool our resources.

74
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:45,375
The park on 72nd Avenue,
uh, in an hour?

75
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:48,745
Okay, I'll be there.

76
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,981
Excellent, <i>perfecto.</i>

77
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,318
He's got someone
who can help on his cause,

78
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:57,487
I'm certain can
draw out Scofield.

79
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:59,089
You're certain of nothing.

80
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,423
Yet I do have

81
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,926
a sit-down with Scofield's
friend in an hour.

82
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,262
You got no better hand, General.

83
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:15,038
Your breathing is short.
Does it hurt to inhale?

84
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:17,774
I'm fine.
- Hell, you've collapsed your lung.

85
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:20,043
No hospital.
Hospital means jail.

86
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,578
Come on, Michael come on!

87
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:23,013
Can you treat him?
- I don't know.

88
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,981
I need a better look
before I can try.

89
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:26,449
Christina?

90
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,286
Buried.

91
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,111
You are a sight
for sore eyes, my friend.

92
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:56,179
Can the reunion.

93
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:58,214
Where can I find
Michael and Lincoln?

94
00:04:58,282 --> 00:05:00,283
Admittedly, they're
in dire straits.

95
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,818
Are you deaf?

96
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:05,288
Unlikely, amigo--  I just heard
the dime drop on your sorry ass.

97
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:06,523
And from the bench

98
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,924
over my left shoulder,

99
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,793
the gentlemen
in the Wayfarers?

100
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,696
Just like in Fox River,
you never thought things through.

101
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:14,731
Now, are you gonna
name the friend

102
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:16,133
who said he'd show up
and help out the brothers?

103
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:17,867
No.

104
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:21,504
You're gonna hand Sara's phone,
or I'll break your face.

105
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,741
Accuse me of being deaf, but you're the
one that's going blind, Puerto Rican.

106
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:27,644
The man's a Company operative
trained assassin.

107
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:34,050
What's up, Jethro?

108
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,822
We're a long way from Fox
River, T-Bag. Let's go.

109
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,528
Yeah, I got Tancredi's phone.

110
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:48,631
Paging Dr. Bender.

111
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:51,534
Do you know if he's diabetic?

112
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,036
On some medication
he may have missed?

113
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,205
I have no idea.
Any chance he's faking it?

114
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,140
No. His pupils are dilated.

115
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,909
He needs a head CT stat,
EKG and a chest X-ray.

116
00:05:59,977 --> 00:06:02,545
He may have bled into his
brain or had a heart attack.

117
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,247
Franco.

118
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:05,515
It wasn't just Scofield

119
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,250
and Burrows; this is the team

120
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,252
that Self had at the warehouse.

121
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:12,756
Former federal agent.

122
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:15,158
Yeah, Self was into
something nasty.

123
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:16,559
Agent Self, can you hear me?

124
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,328
Agent Franco, we have to move him.

125
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:19,662
Where are Scofield
and Burrows?

126
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,731
We're going now.

127
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,902
His finger moved.
He can hear me.

128
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,771
Agent Self,
can you help us?

129
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,107
He's not going anywhere.

130
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,746
Michael,
what's the plan?

131
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,581
Who do we trust?

132
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,016
No one.

133
00:06:40,084 --> 00:06:42,318
We're out of options.

134
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:46,089
Destroy Scylla.

135
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:50,894
Is that it?

136
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:53,430
Is that where we're at?

137
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:57,434
What if the General
decides to retaliate?

138
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,803
He will even if we
give it to him.

139
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,305
We can crush it, incinerate it,

140
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:03,640
throw it in the ocean.

141
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,475
All three sound good.

142
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:07,310
Alex?

143
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,616
All right.

144
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:15,685
Then it's decided.

145
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,494
Hello.

146
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:26,763
Hello, Michael.

147
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:34,404
You're a tough man
to get ahold of.

148
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:36,406
Kellerman!

149
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:11,783
I heard you were dead.

150
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:15,251
Those rumors
were greatly exaggerated.

151
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,687
No, I was, um... freed

152
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:20,288
by a group working
against the Company.

153
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,022
The same group
founded by your father.

154
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,022
I'm working with them.

155
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,357
Could've used
a hand, Paul.

156
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:26,624
Do you have Scylla?

157
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:27,858
What do you think?

158
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:29,258
I think you do.

159
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:31,193
Michael, there is a

160
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,628
UN attaché, who will be in Miami
today at 5:00

161
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:35,128
to receive Scylla from you.

162
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:37,463
Why should I trust a word
coming out of your mouth?

163
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,796
I assume you know that
what you have can--

164
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:43,131
and this is no exaggeration--
change the world

165
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:45,466
for the better.

166
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:48,700
All you have to do
is deliver it.

167
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:50,135
And you don't need to trust me;

168
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:53,737
just trust the people that work
at the United Nations.

169
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:58,739
The phone died.

170
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,573
He's not getting

171
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,773
any better.
- All right, come on.

172
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:02,774
Let's get him up.

173
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,608
I got to get some supplies.

174
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:14,380
Yeah.

175
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:15,880
Okay.

176
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,715
That was Kellerman.

177
00:09:20,783 --> 00:09:23,617
This Alabama trailer trash
has been making good.

178
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:25,984
He hooked up with
General Krantz.

179
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:27,885
What's it to you, rughead?

180
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:29,086
Well, where is the General now?

181
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:30,920
Same place as your daddy.

182
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,988
Location unknown.

183
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,093
Do you remember that day

184
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:48,095
we were in the chow line,
Fox River,

185
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:51,063
you made that offhanded comment
to me?

186
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:53,331
I believe it had a racial bent
to it.

187
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,865
Yeah.

188
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:56,766
Do you remember your broken jaw?

189
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:00,668
Now, just imagine what I can do
to you right now

190
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:02,101
with something real on the line.

191
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,835
Such as?

192
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,236
We need the General's location.

193
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,837
What's in it for me?

194
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:10,472
If we take Scylla to the place
it's supposed to be,

195
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,973
there'll be an immunity list.

196
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,640
You could be on it.
- No.

197
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,642
Where I'm sitting, albeit
momentarily compromised,

198
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,643
you're backing the wrong horse.

199
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:21,244
Scofield cannot pull this out.

200
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,311
You help me get him to the
General and we are set for life!

201
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,012
Man, I don't have
time for this, man.

202
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,847
Time? It's time you backed a
winner for once, my chocolate

203
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:31,181
friend!
Ow!

204
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:32,783
Sit down!

205
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,050
Now where is the General?

206
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,120
Where... is... the General?

207
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:47,856
No word from Agent Frost
or Bagwell.

208
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:49,190
That slippery little rat.

209
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:51,458
If he's AWOL, I'll
skin him alive.

210
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,858
No way he got over on Frost.

211
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:54,359
He's... he's captured...

212
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:55,726
or dead.

213
00:10:55,794 --> 00:10:57,794
So we're exposed here.

214
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:01,328
Is this the end?

215
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:02,996
Whimpering?

216
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:06,964
There's no shame in retreating
to regroup, sir.

217
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:09,766
That, son, is a tremendous load.

218
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:14,601
Yeah?

219
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:21,238
Lincoln Burrows' phone
pinged a cell tower downtown.

220
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,572
We have his location.

221
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,707
Then what are you doing here?

222
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:34,344
<i>You holding up?</i>

223
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,813
You're going to give
Scylla to Kellerman?

224
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:42,681
I don't know.

225
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,415
Do you trust him?

226
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,284
No.

227
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,784
The thought of walking free
from this

228
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:51,119
sounds pretty good right now.

229
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:52,553
I mean, that-that was the goal.

230
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,554
5:00, Declan Plaza.

231
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:56,188
It's right across town.

232
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:58,622
If you have to leave, Michael,
you should.

233
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,656
I'm not leaving
you, Linc.

234
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:02,724
You're my brother.

235
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,826
Not according to Christina.

236
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,227
Don't let her mess
with your head.

237
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,295
Well, maybe it's true.

238
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:15,130
I keep... I keep playing things

239
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:17,397
over in my head
from-from our childhood...

240
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:18,765
Doesn't matter what she said.

241
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,733
It doesn't change anything.

242
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:27,302
You're stuck with me
whether you like it or not.

243
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:32,804
The doc said
the CT scanner is free.

244
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:34,839
We got to take him now.
No, he stays till he talks.

245
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:36,172
He's worse than he was
ten minutes ago.

246
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,607
He won't be talking
anytime soon.

247
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,241
Yeah, but you can write,
can't you, Don?

248
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:40,675
So you give me
what I need,

249
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:43,043
and you'll get top-notch
care and a pension.

250
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:45,677
Or you can waste away
in front of us

251
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:49,178
until you have the brain
capacity of a peanut.

252
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:52,147
Your choice.

253
00:12:58,318 --> 00:12:59,584
All right, all right,
all right, all right,

254
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:00,984
all right, come on.

255
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:47,739
Excuse me, um...

256
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:49,206
May I speak to you
for a second?

257
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,083
Paging Dr. Stateman.
Dr. Stateman, please.

258
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,554
Alex was arrested.
Federal agents.

259
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:20,988
We need to get him.

260
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:25,056
If we give Scylla to Kellerman,
Alex gets exonerated.

261
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:26,323
He's fine.

262
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:28,358
He's fine.

263
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:30,359
We need to get the fluid out.

264
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:32,927
It should ease the pressure
and help him breathe.

265
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:37,462
Can you hold that?

266
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:43,331
That won't last long,
but we can go.

267
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,235
Mind if I drive?

268
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:05,179
In two minutes, your eyeballs

269
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:07,682
are gonna pop out of your head.

270
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:12,086
Now, that's worse than death.

271
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:16,657
I can't betray.

272
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:19,927
My destiny is to be...

273
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:23,765
a respected gentleman.

274
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:25,967
Where's the General,
you son of a bitch?!

275
00:15:37,546 --> 00:15:39,480
Battered and bruised.

276
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:43,217
Staring death in the face.

277
00:15:43,285 --> 00:15:45,119
Surprising that you still need

278
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:47,655
more assurance that you've come
to the end of the line.

279
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,357
We don't have Scylla.

280
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,859
Michael...

281
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:55,163
your brother is dying.

282
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,231
It's fascinating...

283
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:03,070
watching the blood
drain from his face.

284
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:04,906
Do you suppose

285
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:08,476
that he would like to see
that happen to his girlfriend?

286
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,321
Sofia...

287
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:25,026
You give me Scylla or he can
sit there and watch

288
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:28,095
as Sofia's throat is slit.

289
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:34,168
<i>The gun that killed</i>
<i>Naveen Banerjee.</i>

290
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:36,804
We pulled Lincoln Burrows'
thumbprint off the stock.

291
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,439
We got video of you
outside the crime scene

292
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:39,807
with Burrows.

293
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,209
Isn't that a coincidence?

294
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,313
Lincoln didn't kill Banerjee.

295
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,349
He was set up.

296
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:50,051
By whom?

297
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:00,061
It was the Company.

298
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:02,029
The Company-- you know
what I'm talking about?

299
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:05,333
They've developed a device
that's called Scylla.

300
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,868
If you want to see
the light of day again

301
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,536
as a free man, you'll give us

302
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:10,037
Scofield and Burrows...
- You're missing what's

303
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:12,807
right in front of your face!

304
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,843
The brothers
didn't kill anybody.

305
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:19,013
You say you're here

306
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,581
'cause you want
to do the right thing?

307
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:22,917
Then listen to me.

308
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:24,986
Listen to what I'm telling you.

309
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:29,490
Scofield and Burrows.

310
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:32,093
Where are they?

311
00:17:33,128 --> 00:17:35,596
Sofia...

312
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,801
Granted, it is
a dreadful decision.

313
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,271
You have me.

314
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,273
I don't really care
about you, Lincoln.

315
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,208
I just want my property.

316
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,376
All right.

317
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,111
Let's say I <i>do</i> know where it is.

318
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:51,312
Why should I tell you?

319
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,114
You're just gonna
kill us anyway.

320
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:56,284
True, you and your brother
are walking dead,

321
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:59,654
but if I get Scylla
within the next half hour,

322
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,622
I'll release Sofia.

323
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,757
And what about Sara?

324
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:08,462
We're negotiating
for Sofia right now.

325
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,730
I want you to let her go.

326
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,732
And I want a decision, Michael.

327
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,401
Let her go!

328
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:21,442
All right.

329
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,077
Don't move.

330
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,147
Let Sofia go.

331
00:18:26,214 --> 00:18:27,148
Now.

332
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:28,349
Make the call.

333
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,727
Stand down.

334
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:41,629
Just let her walk.

335
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:44,765
Yes, immediately!

336
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,182
All right.

337
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:03,184
And this is where
we say good-bye.

338
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,585
Michael, no.

339
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:05,619
Kill him.

340
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,822
No. We leave.

341
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:10,825
Listen to her, Michael.

342
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:11,959
Kill him.

343
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,495
I'm just an old man

344
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:16,197
who's lost everything.

345
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:19,433
You win, Michael.

346
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,802
And you, Lincoln.

347
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,537
You win, Michael!

348
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,473
You both win.

349
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,845
Because it's all
just a game, isn't it?

350
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:34,248
When you get to be
as old as I am, Michael,

351
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:36,450
should you survive so long,

352
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:43,024
you, too, will see that's
exactly what it all is-- a game.

353
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,392
Kill him.

354
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:49,163
Listen to me, huh,
just listen to me.

355
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:54,068
I didn't risk everything
to come down here for revenge.

356
00:19:57,606 --> 00:20:00,408
I'm here to clear my name.

357
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:06,547
Do you have Scylla?

358
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:09,917
Yes.

359
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:12,353
Then let's go.

360
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:20,327
Come on, General.

361
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,834
Never thought I'd be
so happy to see you.

362
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,336
Tell me something.
- Yeah?

363
00:20:29,404 --> 00:20:32,006
Are you sure we can
trust Kellerman?

364
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:34,341
You know, the only
thing I'm sure of

365
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:36,077
is that he's our last option.

366
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:38,612
Gentlemen, we gotta leave.

367
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,062
Wait for me!

368
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:06,807
Michael?

369
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:10,544
Freeze! I'll shoot!

370
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,080
Go! Go!

371
00:21:14,683 --> 00:21:15,749
Michael, go.

372
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:40,663
He's not going to make it
much longer without a hospital.

373
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:41,864
No.

374
00:21:41,932 --> 00:21:43,065
Not till this is done.

375
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:46,936
Hey, Linc,
I need your phone.

376
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:50,506
Here.

377
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:53,175
Dial Kellerman's number.

378
00:21:53,243 --> 00:21:55,511
Don't tell me
you're getting cold feet.

379
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:57,780
Just dial it, please.

380
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,519
It's voice mail.

381
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:12,094
And you'd better come through
for us in the end.

382
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:15,898
Yeah, he will.

383
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:17,266
Yeah, well...

384
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:21,404
We know him a little bit
better than you do.

385
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,139
Be sure to turn
the phone off.

386
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:26,208
That's how Krantz
found us before.

387
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:28,210
And somebody already has.

388
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:29,879
Yo, hey, hey, get out, get out!

389
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,080
Get out! Get out!

390
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,767
Just make the call.

391
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:53,302
Get Scofield or Burrows

392
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,937
or whoever they're
in business with.

393
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:56,072
Get them on the phone.

394
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:57,239
This is your last chance

395
00:22:57,307 --> 00:22:59,608
before we take the deal
to Mahone.

396
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:01,944
If Mahone was talking,
you guys wouldn't be here.

397
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:03,512
What kind of man are you?

398
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,848
I mean, you got your woman
and your baby up north.

399
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,249
Don't you want
to look out for them?

400
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:08,517
Don't you want
to get their back?

401
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:09,652
Why the hell you gonna
give all that up

402
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,886
for two guys
you did time with?

403
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,888
Unless something went down
at Fox River that we

404
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,557
don't know about.
- Are you guys blind?!

405
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:16,225
Don't you see, they're trying
to do something

406
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:17,660
that's bigger than all this.

407
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:19,161
Then you're dumber
than you look.

408
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:21,864
Are you going to make
the call or not?

409
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:23,499
Last chance.

410
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:27,203
No.

411
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:09,779
Drop it!

412
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:14,483
Where do you think you're going?

413
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,986
Turn around...

414
00:24:17,053 --> 00:24:18,721
slowly.

415
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:26,662
Drop the gun.

416
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,330
Do it now.

417
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:30,533
Michael, when you were eight years old...
- Save it.

418
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:33,102
I don't care.

419
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:35,371
Drop the gun.

420
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,473
Put Scylla
on the ground,

421
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,942
and I'll let you walk
out of here.

422
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,644
If you don't...

423
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:43,012
I'll kill you.

424
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,081
You can't kill
your mother, Michael.

425
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:47,583
You were never my mother.

426
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:49,652
And I'm no longer your son.

427
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:54,757
Fine.

428
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:56,258
Then pull the trigger.

429
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:57,860
Don't tempt me.

430
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:01,363
Pull the trigger,
Michael.

431
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:02,698
Do it for Lincoln.

432
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,133
Drop the gun!

433
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:10,272
You can't do it, can you?

434
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:18,781
Oh... dear.

435
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:21,016
Misfire.

436
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:25,855
You were born a Scofield...

437
00:25:25,922 --> 00:25:28,090
but you'll die
a Burrows.

438
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,010
Okay?

439
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:50,613
I have to get Lincoln
to the hospital.

440
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,082
I'll get this to Kellerman.

441
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:57,653
It's all on you again.

442
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:00,890
Thank you.

443
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:17,806
Ooh... sorry.

444
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:20,943
Sorry. Sorry.

445
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:33,856
Nice and easy.
You're coming with us.

446
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:36,926
Let's go.
- Nice and easy. Stay calm.

447
00:26:58,674 --> 00:27:01,176
Sorry about all of that.

448
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:03,178
I had to make sure
you weren't followed.

449
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:04,979
Solomon Okella
from United Nations--

450
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:06,948
he's the man
to get that thing done.

451
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,785
Lincoln.

452
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:12,554
Sara.

453
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:14,489
Mahone, Sucre.

454
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:17,125
Exonerated-- all of them.

455
00:27:19,795 --> 00:27:21,129
I'm telling you,

456
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:23,364
it's okay.

457
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,534
It's okay.

458
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:39,280
Something's wrong.

459
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:40,982
There's a piece missing.

460
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:44,085
What the hell are you doing?

461
00:27:44,153 --> 00:27:45,420
How is someone from the UN

462
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:47,488
supposed to get us
exonerated here?

463
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:49,107
You are wasting time,
and we are all in danger.

464
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:50,658
What is going on here, Paul?

465
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:52,193
Need to know exactly
who his contacts are

466
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:53,428
in the U.S. Government.

467
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:54,996
I've been telling everybody
what a genius you are.

468
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:56,598
Don't get stupid on me now.

469
00:27:56,665 --> 00:27:57,599
I'm not waiting.

470
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,167
He either has it or he doesn't.

471
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:12,780
Michael...

472
00:28:12,848 --> 00:28:14,616
if you have it,

473
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:17,151
please give it to me,

474
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:18,686
and we can be done

475
00:28:18,754 --> 00:28:21,656
with all of this finally.

476
00:28:21,724 --> 00:28:22,991
And if you don't,

477
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:24,926
fine... but just tell me,

478
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,895
so we can hurry up
and run for our lives.

479
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,045
I don't want
to run anymore.

480
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,015
Neither do I.

481
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:30,892
I'll make the call.

482
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:46,307
You did it.

483
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:52,814
It's over.

484
00:30:25,948 --> 00:30:27,849
Hands up!

485
00:30:29,418 --> 00:30:31,319
Jonathan Krantz?

486
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:33,321
General Jonathan Krantz.

487
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:35,022
Put your hands
behind your back.

488
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:38,726
Sir.

489
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:41,496
Okay, we got everything
we need. We're done here.

490
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:06,587
And this is it?

491
00:31:06,655 --> 00:31:09,590
There will be some follow-up
interviews, but...

492
00:31:09,658 --> 00:31:12,026
this is it.

493
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:14,762
Sign it,

494
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,531
and you're free to go.

495
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:17,258
Can I keep the pen?

496
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,759
Sure.

497
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:33,423
Alex?

498
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,894
Pam's been located.
She's safe.

499
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,367
Mr. Burrows,

500
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:46,936
Sofia and LJ are
safe, as well.

501
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:50,240
Police station in Panama.

502
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,215
Now, last bit
of business, um,

503
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:00,950
Bagwell, T-Bag...

504
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:04,287
claims he helped find Scylla.

505
00:33:04,355 --> 00:33:05,622
He was helpful
here in Miami.

506
00:33:05,689 --> 00:33:07,390
He wants
exoneration, as well.

507
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,728
I can make that happen.

508
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:13,596
I'll leave it up to you.

509
00:33:22,273 --> 00:33:25,508
"And be kind to one another,
tenderhearted,

510
00:33:25,576 --> 00:33:29,879
forgiving each other, just
as God in Christ forgave you."

511
00:33:29,947 --> 00:33:31,681
Ephesians 4:32.
Let's forgive each other,

512
00:33:31,749 --> 00:33:33,583
Lincoln, Michael.

513
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:35,918
In God's name,
'cause there's too much pain.

514
00:33:38,222 --> 00:33:40,723
There's too much hate
in our hearts.

515
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,725
We took a vote.

516
00:33:42,793 --> 00:33:44,594
You're in luck.

517
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:46,329
Oh, lucky day.

518
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:48,264
What we voted on

519
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:52,268
was whether or not
you took a stick of gum

520
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:54,270
on the van ride back

521
00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:56,039
to prison.

522
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:02,178
You rot in hell,
both of you!

523
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:20,776
I want you to know,

524
00:34:20,844 --> 00:34:22,778
I'm totally going to
be a hands-on dad.

525
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:25,447
Okay.

526
00:34:25,515 --> 00:34:27,816
Like, if the baby needs a bottle
in the middle of the night,

527
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:30,419
I will totally keep
your side of the bed warm

528
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:32,521
until you get back.

529
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:36,325
Thank you.

530
00:34:36,392 --> 00:34:39,294
When do they start walking?

531
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:41,997
Uh... a year?

532
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:44,867
We'd better get
some baby books,

533
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:46,235
because I plan

534
00:34:46,302 --> 00:34:48,537
on being the most
overinformed dad in Chicago.

535
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,341
No kidding.

536
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:03,185
I'm happy right now.

537
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:05,687
So am I.

538
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,830
Oh.

539
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:20,269
Thanks.

540
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:26,975
I love you.

541
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:30,012
I love you, too.

542
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:22,197
When do you leave?

543
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:24,266
Eight o'clock.

544
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:28,637
I'm going to miss you.

545
00:36:28,705 --> 00:36:30,806
I'll be back soon.

546
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,255
Did LJ make any decision?

547
00:36:46,322 --> 00:36:47,589
I made it for him.

548
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:49,424
I told him
to take his finals.

549
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:51,093
Next year.

550
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,494
Yeah.

551
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:54,029
Always next year.

552
00:36:54,097 --> 00:36:55,330
All right, sweetheart.

553
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:56,598
Love you.

554
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:58,834
Mmm. Love you, too.

555
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:03,405
Get home safe.

556
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,140
I will.

557
00:37:24,394 --> 00:37:26,328
Hi.

558
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:29,331
Daddy's going to come
back in two days, okay?

559
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:19,715
It's been a pleasure
meeting you,

560
00:38:19,782 --> 00:38:20,882
Congressman
Kellerman.

561
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,317
And meeting you,
as well.

562
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:23,952
You fight those bastards
in Washington.

563
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:26,955
Don't let them
give you any guff.

564
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:28,523
You watch me.
I'm not gonna.

565
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:30,392
Anne, thank you
for your support.

566
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,693
It's all right.

567
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:32,928
Thank you.

568
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:35,897
Remember me, Paul?

569
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:38,333
I'm Danny Hale's widow.

570
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:39,835
Remember Danny?

571
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,203
Of course, Allison.

572
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,771
Danny was a true
American hero.

573
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,574
Okay.

574
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:47,909
It's okay. It's okay.

575
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,311
It's okay.

576
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:34,823
...the captivity
of negativity...

577
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,426
What's that?

578
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:40,595
It's just this book I got.

579
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:52,808
I don't ever want
to see this book again.

580
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,477
You hear?

581
00:39:55,545 --> 00:39:57,546
Yes, sir.

582
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:29,511
Those right there.

583
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:32,347
Right. Thank you so much.

584
00:40:35,418 --> 00:40:37,652
Michael, we got to go.

585
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:44,693
Here.

586
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,029
Oh, you're so tough.

587
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:51,399
<i>¿Quanto cuesta? ¿Tres?</i>

588
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:53,535
Here you go.
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

589
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:55,203
Come on. Let's go
see your daddy.

590
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:56,538
Give me your hand.

591
00:40:56,606 --> 00:40:57,939
Thank you
very much, sir.

592
00:41:00,743 --> 00:41:02,310
You want to do a skip?

593
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:03,645
All right, I'll skip.

594
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:05,580
# Skip down! #

595
00:41:05,648 --> 00:41:07,482
Then on three,
biggest jump you got.

596
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,518
One, two, three!

597
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:12,220
Not two! On three!

598
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:14,789
Buddy.

599
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:17,692
Ooh!

600
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,761
Oh, my goodness.

601
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:17,244
