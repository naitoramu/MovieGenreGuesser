1
00:00:00,372 --> 00:00:02,442
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:04,506
Hey, yo, we're headed out man.

3
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:06,324
Good luck.

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:08,440
I hope you find
the girl, buddy.

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,847
Baby, what the
hell is going on?

6
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,811
Yeah, well Hector says that you
can serve your full sentence.

7
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:14,454
What are you doing here,
where's Maricruz?

8
00:00:14,484 --> 00:00:15,656
She's with me now.

9
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:18,336
What's this I hear about
you coming home soon?

10
00:00:18,387 --> 00:00:20,510
You're not getting your
daughter's hopes up are you?

11
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:24,070
You sitting down?
Your man is coming home this week.

12
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:25,958
We can make it to the
courthouse on foot from here.

13
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:28,574
You don't understand,
everything is in that car.

14
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:31,811
I've been clean
for 18 months now.

15
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,722
I want to help people get from
where I've been to where I am.

16
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:41,750
You were right. I should never
have gotten you involved in this.

17
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:45,831
I just need to know what
Michael Scofield wanted from you

18
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:47,430
in exchange for the green card.

19
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:49,510
Caroline, I've been
doing this for 15 years

20
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:52,002
and it's never been about anything
other than you, your family

21
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:53,962
and, most importantly,
this country.

22
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:56,180
Now, I need to know who
I'm working for here.

23
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:58,331
You are working for me.

24
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:02,002
Are you aware of any arrangement
Officer Bellick had with any inmate

25
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:03,551
regarding Prison Industries?

26
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:05,892
Yeah, he sold it
to John Abruzzi.

27
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:09,632
Officer Brad Bellick, you're terminated,
effective immediately.

28
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,843
They just announced
the rewards on the TV.

29
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:16,512
- How much?
- $100,000 a piece.

30
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:21,223
The money is just
outside of Tooele, Utah.

31
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,203
Truck!

32
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:33,010
Get men in all the
area hospitals.

33
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:34,982
Wherever they are,
one of them is bleeding good.

34
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:37,462
- We got to move.
- I can't.

35
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:45,513
You put in all that work,
break out of prison,

36
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:48,000
only to end up dead at
the bottom of a ditch.

37
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:52,240
Kind of sad really.
So which one of them was it?

38
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:05,931
We've got a blanket
on all the hospitals.

39
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:06,992
Free clinics?

40
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:10,212
If they've got Band-Aids and Bactine,
we've got a body in there.

41
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,712
The brothers come
in for medical,

42
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:13,821
they're getting it in a van
on the way back to Fox River.

43
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:15,642
Anything break on
the other six?

44
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,741
Eyes and ears on the families.
So far, no hits.

45
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:20,083
Maybe just laying low.

46
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:22,871
What's the hardest thing in
the world for a con to do?

47
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:23,731
Nothing?

48
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:25,582
Few things in life
are certain, Ms....?

49
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:26,070
Lang.

50
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:29,041
Death, taxes and the fact
that a man on the run

51
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:31,633
will make a mistake sometime
in the first 72 hours.

52
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:32,901
Needing distance,
he'll steal a car.

53
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,493
Needing money,
he'll rob a store.

54
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:37,682
Needing help,
he'll trust someone that he shouldn't.

55
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:39,322
And when he does...

56
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:42,701
he will leave behind the crumbs
that will take us right to him.

57
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:50,440
I need your help.

58
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,850
- Michael, what are you doing?
- Cayenne pepper.

59
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:53,621
What?

60
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:59,470
- In your kitchen, do you have any?
- Um... yeah, maybe.

61
00:02:59,797 --> 00:03:01,591
I'm gonna need some
rubbing alcohol,

62
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:04,671
some towels and pain killers,
whatever you got.

63
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,602
- Some booze.
- Please!

64
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:16,470
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

65
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,931
It's fine, man,
let's just keep moving.

66
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:26,462
We keep moving and that
leg keeps bleeding.

67
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:29,672
The leg keeps bleeding and we're
not getting out of Illinois.

68
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:31,451
This is going to hurt.

69
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:35,660
That's good, that's good,
that's good.

70
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,991
- This will seal the capillaries.
- Michael, you should not have come here.

71
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:44,970
- The police have been here asking questions.
- We didn't have a choice.

72
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:47,511
Listen, you know I'm thankful
for the help with the green card,

73
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:48,962
but I just don't want
to get involved.

74
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,792
I know, I know it wasn't part
of our deal, I know, Inow.

75
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:56,861
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
But there was nowhere else to go.

76
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:59,400
When I saw you on the news,
I was worried.

77
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:02,513
I just hoped you crossed
the border by now.

78
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,291
So did I.

79
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:08,850
Keep giving him these.

80
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:11,292
See if you can find
him some clean clothes.

81
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,083
Okay.

82
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:14,470
I got to go back
and get our car.

83
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:18,090
Forget the car.
We can get another.

84
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:20,250
I don't need a car,
I need that car.

85
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,272
Why?

86
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:28,572
Because in that car is
everything we need to disappear.

87
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:11,462
- What have you got?
- Here we go boss,

88
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:14,231
one of the blues hauled in a
vagrant a couple hours ago.

89
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,353
Seems the man was in
possession of an item or two

90
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:18,443
that didn't exactly
belong to him.

91
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,811
Looks like we got
our first mistake.

92
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:17,800
Hey, you got any of
that oriental jerky?

93
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:18,970
Excuse me?

94
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:21,783
Teriyaki flavor.

95
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:23,520
No.

96
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:26,283
You got any in the back?

97
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,420
Uh, let me check.

98
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,681
And, give me a bottle of that Early
Times while you're back there, junior.

99
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:34,511
Feel free to earn
your paycheck today.

100
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:36,713
Watch the store,
I'll be right back.

101
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,233
How goes it, Roy?

102
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:58,182
To be honest, Roy, I could've done
without the knee to the junk.

103
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,740
You bit me, Brad.
Like a little girl, you bite me.

104
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,613
- Well, you had it coming.
- Yeah, probably did.

105
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:07,392
You know it's crazy,

106
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:10,132
us taking it out on each other
for how things turned out.

107
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:11,302
You want someone to blame,

108
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:15,242
how about those convicts staring up
at us from the papers every morning.

109
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:21,322
They took my job,
my pension, my dignity.

110
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:24,593
When they went over that wall, they
took all of it right along with them.

111
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:27,773
Everything I worked
for my whole life.

112
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:30,171
See that reward they got?

113
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,562
Those ass-hats are worth more
dead than you and I are alive.

114
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:36,240
- Not for long.
- What do you mean?

115
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:40,481
I mean somebody's going to get
that money, might as well be me.

116
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,401
You know a job like that might

117
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,941
go a little smoother with
an extra pair of hands.

118
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:49,353
You really think I'm going to
split that reward with you?

119
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:52,883
I'm just saying, you run into those
brothers, two of them, one of you.

120
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:55,591
You might find yourself
wishing for a good wingman.

121
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,463
Just get it done, Mike.

122
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:16,891
- How are you doing?
- May I help you?

123
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:19,102
Yeah, I hope so, Chuck.

124
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:22,091
I think you may
have towed my car.

125
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:25,613
- What did it look like?
- What did it look like?

126
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:29,140
The car you stole the backpack from.
What did it look like?

127
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:33,941
- I don't know, man, maybe it was gray.
- It's a gray Accord.

128
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:35,901
License number?

129
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:38,862
Look, man, that's all I know.
I wasn't after the car.

130
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:41,913
Thought the bag had
some clothes in it.

131
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:43,763
You remember where
the car was parked?

132
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:47,372
- Where'd you park it?
- Corner of Hancock and 15th.

133
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:50,140
I don't know,
maybe around 15th somewhere,

134
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:52,541
but it ain't going
to be there anymore.

135
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,681
What do you mean?

136
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:56,512
That's the reason I didn't
get to grab anything else.

137
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:59,502
- Tow truck rolls up.
- Already on it.

138
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:04,580
Okay. It's going to be
60 bucks for the tow,

139
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,831
and 24 for the overnight.

140
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:22,720
All right,
be right back with your vehicle.

141
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,560
Shouldn't take
but a few minutes.

142
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,533
- Hello?
- Petey, it's Sucre.

143
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:40,250
- As in, Fernando Sucre?
- Is there another one?

144
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:44,280
Man, I hope not. But my boy Sucre would
not be calling me on the telephone,

145
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:48,338
thereby making me an accessory
to his dumb-ass escape, man.

146
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:50,484
I'm sorry, bro, I just...
I just...

147
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:52,553
I just need you to get
a hold of Maricruz.

148
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:55,423
I can't call her cell because the
Feds will be all over the place...

149
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,512
Homie, listen, man,
you have got to forget about that girl.

150
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:00,502
If I could forget
about her, pendejo,

151
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:03,692
I'd still be at Fox River,
sitting in cell 40 on your old bunk.

152
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:06,051
Yeah, well, I hope you're
holding on to something tight

153
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,072
'cause I'm about to break
it down for you, brother.

154
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,262
She's getting married
to Hector on Saturday.

155
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:16,433
- What day is today?
- Thursday, bro. Sorry, man.

156
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:23,920
All right, you got to get
her to your place tonight.

157
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:27,212
I got one last shot to make
her change her mind, dude.

158
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:29,722
Just find a way to
get her there, okay?

159
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:32,362
Wait... Sucre, hang on, man.

160
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:09,160
About the, uh...
about the broken window.

161
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:11,102
Yeah, we got a disclaimer
posted right there on the wall,

162
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,412
says we're not responsible...

163
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:15,502
Yeah, I don't... I don't care
about the broken window, Chuck.

164
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:21,590
- I had a backpack inside.
- Not when we got it.

165
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:24,220
I got some paperwork
for you to fill out.

166
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:31,163
You look familiar.

167
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:39,261
Yeah, you... you were the attending
when I first started here.

168
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:40,341
Sure.

169
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:45,221
Um, would one of you mind
calling me a cab, please?

170
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:47,561
I don't think so.

171
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:50,940
Look, Dr. Tancredi, I...

172
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:53,453
I just want to say good luck.

173
00:11:53,556 --> 00:11:55,240
- Sara Tancredi?
- I'm sorry.

174
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:56,801
You have the right
to remain silent.

175
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:58,880
Please place your
hands behind your back.

176
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,493
If you have any questions,
I'm happy to come down to...

177
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:03,471
Ms. Tancredi,
out of respect for your father,

178
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,943
- I'm going to ask you again.
- My father?

179
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:09,712
I'm sure he'd prefer that
this went without incident.

180
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:13,033
You have the right to speak to an
attorney before you speak to the police.

181
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,642
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

182
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:20,332
And to have an attorney present during
questioning now or in the future.

183
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,161
Caroline, they're
taking her in.

184
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:27,771
Of course.
I'll keep an eye on her.

185
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:33,331
All you got to do is sign
here at the bottom...

186
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:35,112
and be on your way.

187
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:37,032
Excuse me, please.

188
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:40,192
Brewster's Towing.

189
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:44,291
This is Agent Mahone with the FBI.
Who am I speaking with?

190
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,543
Chuck.

191
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:48,282
Okay, Chuck, I want to alert
you to a possible situation.

192
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:49,730
Are you listening to me, Chuck?

193
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,040
An individual may be coming
there to inquire about a vehicle.

194
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:55,221
A gray Accord,
probably with a busted rear window.

195
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:58,912
Has anyone come by looking for a
vehicle that matches that description?

196
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,570
Yes, sir.

197
00:13:05,907 --> 00:13:06,880
When?

198
00:13:07,768 --> 00:13:10,393
Uh...

199
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:12,071
Chuck.

200
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:14,222
Will you tell me
when he was there?

201
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,730
Right now.

202
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:27,592
Scofield's there.
Chuck, stall him.

203
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:29,861
We've got people on the way--
do not let him leave.

204
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:32,962
- Do not let him leave.
- It's my supervisor, he...

205
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:36,470
I just got to get clearance
before I can release the car.

206
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:40,003
Chuck, you there? Hey, Chuck.

207
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:42,590
Okay, come on, come on,
Chuck, you still with me?

208
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:48,171
Yeah, that vehicle might not
be here when you get here.

209
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:52,503
- You need to send somebody now.
- Do not let him leave!

210
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:56,731
Oh, he got the keys.

211
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:04,992
- Where the hell are those units?!
- Still six or seven minutes out, sir.

212
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:14,241
We got chatter; it's Franklin.
He's at a payphone Downtown.

213
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,691
Mistake number two.

214
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:21,452
Look, I know. I know, baby,
just let me explain, all right?

215
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:23,512
Were you ever even
in the military?

216
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:27,942
I served my country,
and my country served me up. All right?

217
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:31,572
Look, I wish I could lay this all
out for you right here, right now.

218
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:35,413
But just know, baby,
I am sorry, and I love you,

219
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:38,293
and when the time comes,
I will explain everything.

220
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:43,673
Give me one good reason why I
shouldn't turn you in right now.

221
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,743
You know what?
I'll give you three.

222
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:50,550
Me, you,
and that beautiful little girl of ours.

223
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:55,440
I got a plan. I got a plan that
is going to get us some money,

224
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:58,502
where you and I and our baby--

225
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:01,511
nobody can ever find
us or bother us again.

226
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:02,801
You got to trust me.

227
00:15:02,898 --> 00:15:06,952
That's all I need is the opportunity
for you to hear me out. All right?

228
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:10,842
All right.

229
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:18,651
All right, listen. Has anybody
tried to contact you about me?

230
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,413
- No.
- Okay.

231
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:23,762
Okay, that's good, that's good.

232
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:26,710
Listen.

233
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:32,210
In the Rainbow Room...
Restaurant, New York City.

234
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:37,313
Do you remember that beautiful
spot where we took that picture?

235
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:40,673
The one by the window?

236
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:43,933
Mm-hmm.

237
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:51,993
I am going a be waiting in
that spot one week from now.

238
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,030
And that's all that I
want in this whole world

239
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:58,251
is for my two girls to
be waiting there for me.

240
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:00,212
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

241
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,093
Look, I got to go.

242
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:06,462
Baby, I just want to know,
are you going to be there?

243
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,442
I don't know.

244
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,053
But you know me.

245
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:13,103
- Do I?
- Yes!

246
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:16,242
Good-bye, Miles.

247
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:25,301
I'll alert the field
office in Manhattan,

248
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,893
have them send Franklin's picture to
every employee at the Rainbow Room.

249
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:30,290
Then go have a chat with
his wife, woman-to-woman.

250
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:33,250
Ask her why she never once
visited her husband at Fox River.

251
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:35,552
Pretend you don't know the answer.
That relationship is fragile.

252
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:38,070
We keep tapping on cracks,
and she's going to break.

253
00:16:38,105 --> 00:16:40,211
Yes, sir,
I appreciate the assignment. I...

254
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:43,872
Lang, I don't need gratitude.
I need leads, answers, progress.

255
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:46,793
Anybody that can't deliver
that just don't even unpack.

256
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:48,673
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.

257
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:54,323
- Mr. Wheeler.
- Stand by.

258
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:56,973
Stay on Scofield. I want the
license plate number on that Accord

259
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:59,263
and I want you to get
it out on the wire.

260
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,990
- Yeah.
- Now.

261
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:03,351
I'll call you back.

262
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,001
What's going on?

263
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,831
Apparently, I wasn't the only
one looking for this car.

264
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,630
Great! Let's get out of here.

265
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,862
I'm sorry I had to
involve you in this.

266
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:31,050
I mean,
any more than I already have.

267
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,323
Good luck.

268
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:38,632
To you, too.

269
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:42,081
So, um...

270
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:48,530
I'll see you.

271
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,511
Yeah, I hope so.

272
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:06,112
You all right?

273
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,441
- Yeah.
- Good.

274
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,862
We're heading west,
toward the money, toward LJ.

275
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:15,920
We just got one
more stop to make.

276
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:17,631
What for?

277
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:21,252
You trust me?

278
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:23,033
Of course I trust you, Brad.

279
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:26,472
It's just that if anybody
finds out about this, I...

280
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:27,590
They won't.

281
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,941
Let me handle this.

282
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,850
Humpty Dumpty
climbed up a wall.

283
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:45,661
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

284
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:50,390
Look... I already told the feds
I don't know anything, okay?

285
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:54,022
Those suits with pedicures and
penny loafers. Why would you?

286
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:56,473
They have rules to follow,
codes of conduct.

287
00:18:56,565 --> 00:19:00,190
They got jobs to protect.
Now me, on the other hand.

288
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:02,403
Come on, Boss. I swear.

289
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:04,792
Those guys didn't let
me in on any plans.

290
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:09,081
Then you're telling me in all
your little powwows in the yard,

291
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:11,732
they never once mentioned
what they were going to do

292
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:14,913
- once they went over that wall?
- That's right.

293
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:25,000
Now... I may not work
here anymore, Big-uns,

294
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:27,170
but I still got influence
with people who do,

295
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:33,861
people who will do whatever I ask
them to to whoever I ask them to.

296
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:41,311
And a...
curvy man like yourself,

297
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:44,561
well, let's just say there's
some filthy individuals

298
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:49,371
who might enjoy a cellie
with womanly attributes.

299
00:19:52,518 --> 00:19:56,093
Now, you're going to tell
me everything you know

300
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,392
about where those
convicts are headed,

301
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:04,562
or I'm going to throw your
fat ass to the wolves.

302
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:10,781
Okay, thanks.

303
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:13,563
Mistake number three:
someone reported seeing a man

304
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:16,993
matching Fernando Sucre's
description stealing a car.

305
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:21,283
- Where?
- Defiance, Ohio.

306
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:24,253
Someone's going down today.

307
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,842
I know, mami, I know.

308
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:50,910
- Sara... I paid your bail.
- You took your time.

309
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:53,221
I'm the governor.
I do have things that...

310
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:55,140
Go to hell, Dad.

311
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:56,160
You keep this up,

312
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:58,853
this may be the only place
I'll be able to see you.

313
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:01,193
Do you even want to
hear my side of things?

314
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:03,633
Not particularly, Sara, no.

315
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:07,971
Especially when I have no
idea whose "side" you're on.

316
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:09,853
But I do know this.

317
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:13,291
Somebody is going to go down because
of what happened at Fox River.

318
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:18,041
And it would be in both of our best
interests if that someone was not you.

319
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,731
And to ensure this,
certain steps need to be taken.

320
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,663
One: you should go to a
daily recovery meeting.

321
00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:27,873
Two: you need to go before a
judge and plead not guilty,

322
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,701
- and three,
- Dad, I don't...

323
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:31,622
You need to tell the D.O.C.

324
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,110
everything you know about how
that prison was being run.

325
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:36,752
And that Warden Pope,
how he was granting favors to Scofield

326
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:39,191
because Scofield helped him
with his personal projects,

327
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:42,382
thereby exposing him to
certain restricted areas

328
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:46,241
where he may have been able to
obtain a key to the infirmary.

329
00:21:47,176 --> 00:21:48,762
I can't do that.

330
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:52,150
Oh, yes you can, Sara.
You can do that and you will.

331
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:55,393
I did it, Dad.

332
00:21:57,106 --> 00:22:00,220
I left the door open,
me and no one else.

333
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,553
That's not true.

334
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,562
- Yes, it is.
- That's not true.

335
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:13,071
Sara... just do
what you're told,

336
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:17,253
otherwise there will
be consequences...

337
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:20,072
that will affect us all.

338
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:23,130
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

339
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:24,763
Yes, sir.

340
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:26,771
Good.

341
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,561
In one week...

342
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:34,820
I will be appointed the new Vice
President of the United States.

343
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,443
There will be a ceremony,
you will be invited,

344
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:40,390
but you will not attend.

345
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:44,540
Good-bye, Sara.

346
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:01,801
- Let's put some music on.
- Don't.

347
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:05,791
I forgot. No radio.

348
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:10,920
Man, it's quiet out here. Inside,
there was always noise, you know?

349
00:23:11,018 --> 00:23:14,781
Someone yelling, guards making rounds.
I got used to it.

350
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:17,743
You're right.
We should go back.

351
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:25,912
The tats... they weren't just
for getting out, were they?

352
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:29,290
Breaking out was
just the beginning.

353
00:23:29,385 --> 00:23:30,940
Now, it gets a little
more interesting.

354
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:34,571
Mm-hmm, 'cause me being strapped to the
electric chair wasn't
interesting enough.

355
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:37,951
All I'm saying is inside,
we had the element of surprise.

356
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:40,301
No one knew what
we were planning.

357
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:45,320
There's something about this guy--
the one in the elevator.

358
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:47,922
It's like...

359
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:50,832
it's like he knows
where we're going,

360
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:53,073
what we're thinking.
If that's true,

361
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:56,243
it's just a matter of time before he
finds out about the money in Utah,

362
00:23:56,277 --> 00:23:58,670
Bolshoi Booze,
our way into Mexico.

363
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:01,440
Everything.

364
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:13,260
- Are you ready for this?
- Make the call.

365
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:20,262
Please leave a message.

366
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:26,100
Hey, it's me. I've got Linc.

367
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:28,631
We're on our way there.

368
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:34,191
If for some reason you can't make it,
call me back at 9-1-7-4-5...

369
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,313
We just got this
from surveillance.

370
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:39,590
You remember that voicemail Scofield
prepaid for when he went off to prison?

371
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:40,232
Yeah.

372
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:42,583
Someone just left
a message on it.

373
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:45,002
- Who?
- Scofield.

374
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:47,490
Something... something
about a meeting,

375
00:24:47,597 --> 00:24:49,393
it sounded like he was
waiting for someone else

376
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:51,223
to check the message
and then call him back.

377
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,052
This prefix,
that's a cell phone number.

378
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:54,120
As long as it's turned on...

379
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:56,551
We can track
exactly where he is.

380
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:20,360
Don't do anything stupid.

381
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:22,563
Don't do anything stupid.

382
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:51,490
Is there a problem, officer?

383
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:54,262
You know why I pulled
you over today, sir?

384
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:55,992
Speeding?

385
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:59,041
Let me see your license
and registration please?

386
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:03,282
The thing is, I, uh...
I lost my wallet.

387
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:07,281
Well, I guess your registration
will have to do just fine then.

388
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:23,172
So... this is your car,
Mrs. Miller?

389
00:26:23,637 --> 00:26:29,010
Mrs. Miller's my wife.
I'm Mr. Miller.

390
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:35,651
Well... your tags are expired.
I'll be right back.

391
00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:02,512
Did he sing?

392
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:06,540
Like a fat, sweaty bird.

393
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:21,923
Hey, sweet pea.

394
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:23,750
- Daddy?
- Hey, come here.

395
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:27,453
Oh, look at you. You're so big.

396
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:32,422
Hey, why don't you do me a
favor and grab a piece of chalk

397
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,342
and draw Daddy a picture
on the ground, okay?

398
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:42,221
So, how're you feeling, huh?

399
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:44,661
You keeping your appetite up?

400
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:47,620
Sorta. I guess.

401
00:27:47,856 --> 00:27:50,870
That's good. That's real good.

402
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:55,522
Oh, God, it's so good to see you,
baby girl.

403
00:27:57,828 --> 00:28:00,562
Do you understand what Daddy
is going through right now?

404
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,621
Sorta.

405
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:05,100
But the kids at school
have been sayin' stuff.

406
00:28:05,297 --> 00:28:07,401
Okay, what have
they been saying?

407
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:10,890
They're saying you're on TV
because you're a bad man.

408
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,272
And what do you think?

409
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:18,652
I think if I were someplace

410
00:28:18,746 --> 00:28:21,190
and they wouldn't let
me leave to see you,

411
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:23,920
I wouldn't do what
they said, either.

412
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:29,050
Well, you know what?

413
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:33,482
We are gonna be together real soon.
I promise you.

414
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,330
But Daddy needs you
to do him a favor.

415
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:37,620
I need you to get a
message to Mommy, okay?

416
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:38,830
Okay.

417
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:44,471
Now I need you to tell her if
she understood what I told her

418
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:48,243
and if she is willing
to trust Daddy...

419
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:55,491
that she needs to turn on the
porch light at 7:00, okay?

420
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:57,271
Can you remember that?

421
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:59,062
That's a good girl.

422
00:28:59,158 --> 00:29:01,981
Dede, stay away from
the gate, honey.

423
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:07,681
Daddy gotta get going,
okay sweet pea?

424
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:13,510
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too, baby.

425
00:29:22,568 --> 00:29:23,782
There.

426
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:33,853
It's not much further now.

427
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:47,712
Okay, they moved off the Interstate,
heading North on Route 38.

428
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:48,883
Talk to me.

429
00:29:50,595 --> 00:29:52,071
Where?

430
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:54,621
There's a patrolman who thinks
he's has Fernando Sucre

431
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:56,690
pulled over outside of
Latrobe, Pennsylvania.

432
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:58,093
Get in touch with
the local dispatch.

433
00:29:58,127 --> 00:30:01,511
Make it clear that we want this
man in custody, not in a body bag.

434
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:05,890
Dead men can't tell us where their
friends are. Yeah, you got it.

435
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:50,300
It's gotta be,
it looks just like him.

436
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:53,692
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

437
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:55,721
I will.

438
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,022
Mr. Miller...

439
00:31:06,627 --> 00:31:10,721
I'm gonna have to ask you to place
your arms outside the vehicle please.

440
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:14,872
Mr. Miller,
I need to see some hands.

441
00:31:50,246 --> 00:31:52,451
- You ready?
- Yeah.

442
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:55,591
Now.

443
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:11,511
This is the one.

444
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:20,590
Do you see him?

445
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,803
Nope. Maybe he didn't
get your message.

446
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:37,462
They've stopped.
Couple miles up ahead. There's...

447
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,251
There's nothing up
there. What...?

448
00:32:39,637 --> 00:32:41,321
What are they waiting on?

449
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:43,951
Or who?

450
00:32:49,137 --> 00:32:51,582
All right, that's good,
that's good, that's good.

451
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:14,591
Oh, come on.

452
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:16,091
Come on!

453
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:20,082
Go red.

454
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,002
Now, go red!

455
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:50,330
Just one more thing.

456
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:53,490
Do you trust me?

457
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:57,213
Of course.

458
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:00,721
How do you throw the
hunter off the scent?

459
00:34:01,057 --> 00:34:02,793
Get rid of the prey.

460
00:34:03,348 --> 00:34:04,231
Remember,

461
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:08,601
once I hit scan, we'll have about
30 seconds before it reaches 103.7.

462
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:09,821
And then she blows?

463
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,011
- That's right. Ready?
- Yeah.

464
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:33,353
All right, let's go.

465
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:40,472
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

466
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:45,672
Something's wrong.

467
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:47,863
What happened?

468
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:51,612
I don't know.
But we're going to need the explosion.

469
00:34:54,997 --> 00:34:55,883
He's here.

470
00:34:56,996 --> 00:34:58,210
He's here.

471
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:08,953
The radio must have jammed.

472
00:35:09,098 --> 00:35:11,242
We're going to have to
set it off manually.

473
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:12,822
The car could blow
any second, Michael.

474
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:15,633
Well, the feds are going to
be here in about two minutes.

475
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:18,391
If it doesn't look like we're dead,
we will be.

476
00:35:18,587 --> 00:35:20,031
Rock, paper, scissors?

477
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:22,800
- Linc?
- It's my turn.

478
00:35:38,908 --> 00:35:40,972
Better pray for reception.

479
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:53,783
How many stations
between 102.1 and 103.7?

480
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:58,070
Way out here?
Just one, probably.

481
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:22,772
Oh!

482
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:36,711
Where's Maricruz?

483
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:39,861
- Hey. Hey, look, man...
- No, no, no, Petey. You look.

484
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:42,023
I haven't slept in 72 hours,

485
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:43,960
I've seen a man's
hand get chopped off,

486
00:36:43,997 --> 00:36:46,393
I've been...
I've been shot at, dug up a grave,

487
00:36:46,488 --> 00:36:49,211
stolen a car,
jumped on a fricking a train,

488
00:36:49,537 --> 00:36:51,651
so please,
just tell me where she is.

489
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:53,480
Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

490
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:56,270
I was trying to tell you,
but you hung up the phone, man.

491
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:58,513
The wedding-- it's in Vegas.

492
00:36:59,908 --> 00:37:01,170
The city?

493
00:37:01,356 --> 00:37:03,851
Yeah, and they left
a few hours ago.

494
00:37:14,085 --> 00:37:15,932
Wait, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

495
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:18,412
Come on, hey,
come on. Fernando!

496
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:19,741
It's pristine, man.
It's just...

497
00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:22,023
Gonna be back to you in one piece,
I promise.

498
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:24,172
Can we go back to the
part where I said no?

499
00:37:24,187 --> 00:37:27,860
- I wish I had another choice.
- You do have a choice. Come on, man.

500
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:32,433
It's a 1952 Ural motorbike, bro.
If you so much as scratch it...

501
00:37:32,488 --> 00:37:34,831
No scratches... I promise.

502
00:37:37,515 --> 00:37:42,510
She's the love of my life, bro.
I got to do something.

503
00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:45,812
- You look like hell.
- I've been through hell, papi.

504
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,203
Now I just got to get to Vegas.

505
00:37:56,787 --> 00:38:00,703
Um, hi, I'm Sara, and I, uh...

506
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:04,780
Um...

507
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,693
over the years,
I've worked with...

508
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:15,683
more than a few people who had a
history of addiction, and, uh...

509
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:21,410
I would tell 'em that I could understand
what they were going through
because I...

510
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:23,470
used to be just like them.

511
00:38:23,616 --> 00:38:26,061
I used to be an addict, too.

512
00:38:26,528 --> 00:38:29,013
And I think, uh...

513
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:34,802
I think that what's becoming
clear to me is that...

514
00:38:35,078 --> 00:38:36,942
the reason I
understood them is...

515
00:38:37,036 --> 00:38:38,963
because I am like them.

516
00:38:39,196 --> 00:38:40,832
Um...

517
00:38:41,627 --> 00:38:44,583
I never used to be an addict.
I, uh...

518
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,361
Hi, my name is Sara,
and I'm an addict.

519
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:52,151
Hi, Sara.

520
00:38:57,005 --> 00:38:59,311
Hi, my name's Lance,
and I'm an addict.

521
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:00,602
Hi, Lance.

522
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:06,080
I guess a lot of what Sara
just said resonates with me

523
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:08,002
in what I'm going through.

524
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:12,490
Put in all that work,
break out of prison,

525
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:15,262
only to end up dead at
the bottom of a ditch.

526
00:39:15,408 --> 00:39:17,002
Kind of sad really.

527
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:19,060
So, which one of them was it?

528
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:26,142
- Shales.
- Shales?

529
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,681
Scofield. Might be Scofield.

530
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:31,792
You're probably going to find
his brother in there, too.

531
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:35,960
Oscar Shales is this guy
Mahone tracked for a while.

532
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:38,780
Nasty little bottom feeder.
You know the type.

533
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:42,871
- He's still in the wind.
- Can't get 'em all, right?

534
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:09,351
We should have a pretty
clear path to Utah now.

535
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,962
They'll turn their
attention to the other guys,

536
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:14,742
which means we'll be off
their radar for a while.

537
00:40:14,978 --> 00:40:17,571
They're going to get the lab
results back from the accident, man.

538
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:21,942
- We'll be in Mexico by that time.
- Provided the transport comes through.

539
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:33,591
Oh, come on, baby.

540
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:48,081
In the Rainbow Room.

541
00:40:48,736 --> 00:40:53,210
Do you remember that beautiful
spot where we took that picture,

542
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:56,032
the one by the window?

543
00:40:56,546 --> 00:41:03,002
I am going to be waiting in
that spot one week from now.

544
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:40,922
- She sleeping okay?
- Yeah. Like a baby.

545
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:41,713
Good.

546
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:48,332
So, you said you had some information
you wanted to tell me about
your husband?

547
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,283
Looks like I owe
you another one.

548
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:03,913
- It's okay.
- Okay.

549
00:42:04,786 --> 00:42:08,652
Well, uh, once we get to Mexico,
I'll send you $10,000,

550
00:42:08,798 --> 00:42:11,990
like I promised.
Plus another three for the car.

551
00:42:12,788 --> 00:42:16,310
Are you meeting up with her,
the doctor?

552
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,672
Sara?

553
00:42:19,528 --> 00:42:22,352
I, uh... I don't know.

554
00:42:23,555 --> 00:42:26,421
We should get moving.
Next town is a few miles away.

555
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:29,851
Yeah, that's fine.
I can catch a bus from there.

556
00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:32,562
Thanks again, Nika.

557
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:53,101
I knew the little whore
would take us right to 'em.

558
