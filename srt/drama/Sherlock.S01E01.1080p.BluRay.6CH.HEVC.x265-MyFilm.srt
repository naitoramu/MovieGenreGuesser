You just wrote

a while to adjust to civilian life,

9

He loved his family and his work,

and that he should have taken
his own life in this way

20
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,999
is a mystery

21

Two minutes, all right?

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,359
She still dancing?

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,159
Yeah, if you can call it that.

28
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,279

The body of Beth Davenport,
Junior Minister for Transport,

31
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,839
was found late last night
on a building site in Greater London.

32
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,479
Preliminary investigations suggest
that this was suicide.

33
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,399
We can confirm that this apparent
suicide closely resembles those

34
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,199
of SirJeffrey Patterson
and James Phillimore.

35
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,839
In the light of this, these incidents
are now being treated as linked.

36
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,399
The investigation is ongoing,

37
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,879
but Detective Inspector Lestrade
will take questions now.

38
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,199
Detective Inspector,
how can suicides be linked?

39
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,359
Well, they all took the same poison.

40
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,479
They were all found in places
they had no reason to be.

41
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,999
None of them had shown

42
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,679
- any prior indication.
- But you can't have serial suicides.

43
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,359
Well, apparently you can.

44
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,399
These three people,
there's nothing that links them?

45
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,919
There's no link we've found yet,

46
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,759
but we're looking for it -
there has to be one.

for Detective Inspector Lestrade,

I'm going to bring
this session to an end.

53
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,199
If they're suicides,
what are you investigating?

54
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,479
As I say,
these suicides are clearly linked.

55
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,279
It's an unusual situation.
We've got our best people investigating.

- One more question.

58
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,239
Is there any chance
that these are murders?

59
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,879
And if they are,
is this the work of a serial killer?

60
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,879
I know that you like writing about these,
but these do appear to be suicides.

61
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,879
We know the difference.
The poison was clearly self-administered.

62
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,999
Yes, but if they are murders,
how do people keep themselves safe?

63
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,559
Well, don't commit suicide.

and sometimes I don't talk
for days on end. Would that bother you?

a difficult man to find a flatmate for.

from Afghanistan.

148

You've got a brother worried about you,
but you won't go to him for help

149
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,999
because you don't approve of him,
possibly because he's an alcoholic,

150
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,399
more likely because
he recently walked out on his wife.

And I know your therapist thinks
your limp's psychosomatic,

152
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,999
quite correctly, I'm afraid.

153
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,559
That's enough to be going on with,
don't you think?

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,119
Hello.

157
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,239
- Ah, Mr Holmes.
- Sherlock, please.

158
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,479
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.

159
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,479
Mrs Hudson, the landlady -
she's given me a special deal.

160
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,759
Owes me a favour. A few years back,

161
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,559
her husband got himself sentenced to death
in Florida. I was able to help out.

162
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,199
Sorry, you stopped her husband
being executed?

163
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,799
Oh, no, I ensured it.

164
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,359
Sherlock!

165
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,959
Mrs Hudson, DrJohn Watson.

166
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,919
- Hello. Come in.
- Thank you.

167
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,039
Shall we...?

168
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,679
Well, this could be very nice.

169
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,999
Very nice indeed.

170
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,439
Yes.

171
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,839
Yes, I think so, my thoughts precisely.

172
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,839
- So I went straight ahead and moved in.
- Soon as we get this rubbish cleaned up.

173
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,359
Oh.

174
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,079
So this is all...

175
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,959
Well, obviously
I can straighten things up a bit.

176
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,039
- That's a skull.
- Friend of mine.

177
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,679
When I say friend...

178
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,719
What do you think, then, Dr Watson?

179
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,799
There's another bedroom upstairs,
if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

180
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,719
Of course we'll be needing two.

181
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,199
Oh, don't worry,
there's all sorts round here.

182
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,599
Mrs Turner next door's got married ones.

183
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,519
Oh...Sherlock! The mess you've made.

184
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,719
I looked you up
on the internet last night.

185
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,279
Anything interesting?

186
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,119
Found your website.
The Science Of Deduction.

187
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,559
What did you think?

188
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,599
You said you could identify
a software designer by his tie

189
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,399
and an airline pilot by his left thumb?

190
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,639
Yes.

191
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,279
And I can read your military career
in your face and your leg,

192
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,359
and your brother's drinking habits
in your mobile phone.

193
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,559
How?

194
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,959
What about these suicides, then, Sherlock?

195
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,559
I thought that'd be right up your street.

196
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,079
Three exactly the same.

197
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,399
Four.

198
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,199
There's been a fourth.
And there's something different

199
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,959
- this time.
- A fourth?

200
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,519
- Where?
- Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

201
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,359
What's new about this one?
You wouldn't have come to me otherwise.

202
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,039
You know how they never leave notes?
This one did.

203
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,159
- Will you come?
- Who's on forensics?

204
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,599
- Anderson.
- He doesn't work well with me.

205
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,199
- Well, he won't be your assistant.
- I needan assistant.

206
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,239
Will you come?

207
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,919
Not in a police car, I'll be right behind.

208
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,719
Thank you.

209
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,359
Brilliant! Yes!

210
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,519
Four serial suicides and now a note.

211
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,639
Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs Hudson,
I'll be late. Might need some food.

212
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,439
I'm your landlady, dear,
not your housekeeper.

213
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,039
Something cold will do. John,
have a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

214
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,799
Don't wait up!

215
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,279
Look at him, dashing about...

216
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,759
My husband was just the same.

217
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,479
But you're more
the sitting-down type, I can tell.

218
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,519
I'll make you that cuppa,
you rest your leg.

219
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,119
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry.

220
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,039
It's just sometimes this bloody thing...

221
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,839
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

222
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,519
Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you.

223
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,919
Just this once, dear,
I'm not your housekeeper.

224
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,599
Couple of biscuits too,
if you've got 'em.

225
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,799
Not your housekeeper!

226
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,879
You're a doctor.

227
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,599
In fact, you're an Army doctor.

228
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,879
Yes.

229
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,439
Any good?

230
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,479
Very good.

231
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,239
Seen a lot of injuries, then.
Violent deaths.

232
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,239
Well, yes.

233
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,839
Bit of trouble too, I bet?

234
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,159
Of course. Yes.
Enough for a lifetime, far too much.

235
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,199
- Want to see some more?
- Oh, God, yes.

236
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,239
Sorry, Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea.
Off out.

237
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,239
- Both of you?
- Impossible suicides? Four of them?

238
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,439
No point sitting at home when
there's finally something fun going on!

239
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,799
- Look at you, all happy. It's not decent.
- Who cares about decent?

240
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,279
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

241
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,439
Taxi!

242
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,719
- OK, you've got questions...
- Yeah, where are we going?

243
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,119
Crime scene. Next?

244
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,279
- Who are you? What do you do?
- What do you think?

245
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,839
- I'd say...private detective.
- But...?

246
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,839
But the police don't go
to private detectives.

247
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,479
I'm a consulting detective.
Only one in the world. I invented the job.

248
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,919
What does that mean?

249
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,759
It means when the police are
out of their depth, which is always,

250
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,639
- they consult me.
- The police don't consult amateurs.

251
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,599
When I met you for the first time
yesterday, I said Afghanistan or Iraq.

252
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,599
- You looked surprised.
- Yes, how didyou know?

253
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,679
I didn't know, I saw.

254
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,399
Your haircut, the way you hold yourself
says military. But your conversation...

255
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,079
Bit different from my day.

256
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,759
...said trained at Barts -
so Army doctor, obvious.

257
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,759
Your face is tanned...

258
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,159
but no tan above the wrists.
You've been abroad, but not sunbathing.

259
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,399
Your limp's bad when you walk, but you
don't ask for a chair when you stand,

260
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,279
like you've forgotten about it,
so it's at least partly psychosomatic.

261
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,439
That says the original circumstances
of the injury were traumatic.

262
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,359
Wounded in action, then. Wounded
in action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

263
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,039
You said I had a therapist.

264
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,159
You've got a psychosomatic limp,
of course you've got a therapist.

265
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,079
Then there's your brother. Your phone.

266
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,839
It's expensive,
e-mail enabled, MP3 player.

267
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,319
You're looking for a flatshare.
You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.

268
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,599
Scratches.
Not one, many over time -

269
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,519
it's been in the same pocket
as keys and coins.

270
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,759
You wouldn't treat
your one luxury item like this,

271
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,919
so it's had a previous owner.
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

272
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,399
The engraving?

273
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,439
Harry Watson. Clearly a family member
who's given you his old phone.

274
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,679
Not your father,
this is a young man's gadget.

275
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,719
Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero
who can't find a place to live.

276
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,599
Unlikely you've got an extended family,
not one you're close to.

277
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,719
So brother it is.

278
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,639
Now, who's Clara? Three kisses
says it's a romantic attachment.

279
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,039
The expense of the phone
says wife, not girlfriend.

280
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,639
Must have given it to him recently,
the model's only six months old.

281
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,199
Marriage in trouble, then -
six months on he's given it away.

282
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,559
If she'd left him,
he would have kept it. Sentiment.

283
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,399
No, he wanted rid of it. He left her.

284
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,799
He gave the phone to you,
so he wants you to stay in touch.

285
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,999
You're looking for cheap accommodation,
but not going to your brother for help.

286
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,359
That says you've got problems with him.

287
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,599
Maybe you liked his wife
or don't like his drinking.

288
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,719
How can you possibly know
about the drinking?

289
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,799
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

290
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,079
Power connection -
tiny little scuff marks round the edge.

291
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,599
Every night he plugs it in
to charge, but his hands are shaking.

292
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,639
You never see those marks
on a sober man's phone,

293
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,999
never see a drunk's without them.
There you go, you were right.

294
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,079
Iwas right? Right about what?

295
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,399
The police don't consult amateurs.

296
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,879
That...was amazing.

297
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,799
- Do you think so?
- Of course it was.

298
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,159
It was extraordinary,
quite extraordinary.

299
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,079
- That's not what people normally say.
- What do people normally say?

300
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,599
Piss off!

301
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,119
Did I get anything wrong?

302
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,879
Harry and me don't get on, never have.

303
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,079
Clara and Harry split up
three months ago

304
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,159
and they're getting a divorce.

305
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,119
And Harry is a drinker.

306
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,719
Spot on, then. I didn't expect
to be right about everything.

307
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,319
Harry's short for Harriet.

308
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,559
Harry's your sister.

309
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,479
What exactly am I supposed
to be doing here?

310
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,039
- Sister!
- No, seriously, what am I doing here?

311
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,559
There's always something.

312
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,759
Hello, freak!

313
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,239
I'm here to see
Detective Inspector Lestrade.

314
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,919
- Why?
- I was invited.

315
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,919
- Why?
- I think he wants me to take a look.

316
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,479
- You know what I think, don't you?
- Always, Sally.

317
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,519
I even know
you didn't make it home last night.

318
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,359
- Er...who's this?
- Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

319
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,199
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

320
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,759
Old friend.

321
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,439
A colleague?
How do you get a colleague?

322
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,719
Did he follow you home?

323
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,399
- Would it be better if I just waited...?
- No.

324
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,479
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

325
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,079
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

326
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,999
It's a crime scene. I don't want it
contaminated. Are we clear on that?

327
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,119
Quite clear.

328
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,919
And is your wife away for long?

329
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,679
Oh, don't pretend you worked that out.
Somebody told you that.

330
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,119
Your deodorant told me that.

331
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,679
- My deodorant?
- It's for men.

332
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,999
Well, of course it's for men -
I'm wearing it.

333
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,239
So's Sergeant Donovan.

334
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,959
<font color="#DF01D7">(HOLMES SNIFFS)</font>

335
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,599
Ooh...I think it just vaporised.
May I go in?

336
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,119
Whatever you're trying to imply...

337
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,239
I'm not implying anything. I'm sure
Sally came round for a nice little chat

338
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,919
and just happened to stay over.

339
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,159
And I assume she scrubbed your floors,
going by the state of her knees.

340
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,439
You'll need to wear one of these.

341
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,879
Who's this?

342
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,439
He's with me.

343
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,159
- But who is he?
- I said he's with me.

344
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,399
Aren't you going to put one on?

345
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,159
- So where are we?
- Upstairs.

346
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,639
I can give you two minutes.

347
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,959
May need longer.

348
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,679
Her name's Jennifer Wilson,
according to her credit cards.

349
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,359
We're running them now
for contact details.

350
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,119
Hasn't been here long.

351
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,799
Some kids found her.

352
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,639
Shut up.

353
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,679
- I didn't say anything.
- You were thinking. It's annoying.

354
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,039
Got anything?

355
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,079
Not much.

356
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,759
She's German.
Rache. It's German for revenge.

357
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,799
- She could be trying to tell us...
- Yes, thank you for your input.

358
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,239
- So she's German?
- Of course she's not.

359
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,759
She's from out of town, though.
Intended to stay in London for one night

360
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,919
before returning home to Cardiff -
so far, so obvious.

361
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,959
- Sorry, obvious?
- What about the message, though?

362
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,479
Dr Watson, what do you think?

363
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,839
- Of the message?
- Of the body. You're a medical man.

364
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,559
- We have a whole team outside.
- They won't work with me.

365
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,559
I'm breaking every rule
letting you in here...

366
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,999
Yes, because you need me.

367
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,279
Yes, I do.

368
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,559
God help me.

369
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,359
- Dr Watson!
- Hm?

370
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,119
Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.

371
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,999
<font color="#404040">LESTRADE:</font> Anderson, keep everyone out
for a couple of minutes...

372
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,239
- Well?
- What am I doing here?

373
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,839
- Helping me make a point.
- I'm supposed to help you pay the rent.

374
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,279
- This is more fun.
- Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

375
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,919
Perfectly sound analysis,
but I was hoping you'd go deeper.

376
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,079
Yeah...

377
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,679
Asphyxiation...probably.
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.

378
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,399
Can't smell any alcohol on her.

379
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,639
It could have been a seizure.
Possibly drugs.

380
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,559
You know what it was,
you've read the papers.

381
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,759
Well, she's one of the suicides.
The fourth...?

382
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,759
Sherlock, two minutes, I said.
I need anything you've got.

383
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,399
Victim is in her late 30s.
Professional person, going by her clothes.

384
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,599
I'm guessing the media, going by
the frankly alarming shade of pink.

385
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,679
Travelled from Cardiff today,
intending to stay in London

386
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,999
for one night
from the size of her suitcase.

387
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,079
- Suitcase?
- Yes.

388
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,559
She's been married
at least ten years, but not happily.

389
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,439
She's had a string of lovers,
but none of them knew she was married.

390
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,639
Oh, for God's sake,
if you're just making this up...

391
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,199
Her wedding ring.
Ten years old at least.

392
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,119
The rest of herjewellery
has been regularly cleaned,

393
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,439
but not her wedding ring.
State of her marriage right there.

394
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,839
The inside is shinier than the outside,
so it's regularly removed.

395
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,039
The only polishing it gets
is when she works it off her finger.

396
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,039
It's not for work, look at her nails.
She doesn't work with her hands,

397
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,439
so what or who does she remove
her rings for?

398
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,119
Not one lover, she'd never sustain
the fiction of being single for that long,

399
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,879
- so more likely a string of them. Simple.
- That's brilliant.

400
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,519
- Sorry.
- Cardiff?

401
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,839
- It's obvious, isn't it?
- It's not obvious to me.

402
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,959
Dear God, what is it like in your funny
little brains? It must be so boring.

403
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,799
Her coat - it's slightly damp, she's been
in heavy rain in the last few hours -

404
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,479
no rain anywhere in London in that time.

405
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,159
Under her coat collar is damp too.
She's turned it up against the wind.

406
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,679
She's got an umbrella in her pocket,
but it's dry and unused.

407
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,239
Not just wind, strong wind -
too strong to use her umbrella.

408
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,159
We know from her suitcase
that she was intending to stay overnight,

409
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,759
but she can't have travelled
more than two or three hours,

410
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,479
because her coat still hasn't dried.

411
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,519
So, where has there been heavy rain
and strong wind

412
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,999
within the radius of that travel time?
Cardiff.

413
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,319
- That's fantastic.
- Do you know you do that out loud?

414
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,919
- Sorry, I'll shut up.
- No, it's...fine.

415
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,959
- Why do you keep saying suitcase?
- Yes, where is it?

416
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,559
She must have had a phone or an organiser.
Find out who Rachel is.

417
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,999
She was writing Rachel?

418
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,399
No, she was leaving an angry note
in German!

419
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,679
Of course she was writing Rachel,
no other word it can be.

420
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,119
But why did she wait until she was dying
to write it?

421
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,599
How do you know she had a suitcase?

422
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,639
Tiny splash marks on her right heel
and calf not present on the left.

423
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,399
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase
behind her with her right hand.

424
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,239
Don't get that splash pattern
any other way.

425
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,359
Smallish case, going by the spread.

426
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,159
Case that size,
woman this clothes-conscious -

427
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,079
could only be an overnight bag
so we know she was staying one night.

428
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,599
Where is it?
What have you done with it?

429
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,479
There wasn't a case.

430
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,119
- Say that again.
- There wasn't a case.

431
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,359
There was never any suitcase.

432
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,839
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase?
Was there a suitcase in this house?

433
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,439
Sherlock, there was no case!

434
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,199
But they take the poison themselves,
they swallow the pills.

435
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,479
There are clear signs,
even you lot couldn't miss them.

436
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,839
Right, thanks. And...?

437
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,719
It's murder, all of them.
I don't know how.

438
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,239
But they're not suicides,
they're serial killings.

439
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,799
We've got a serial killer. Love those.

440
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,679
There's always something
to look forward to.

441
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,719
- Why are you saying that?
- Her case!

442
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,679
Come on, where is her case?

443
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,639
Did she eat it<font color="#DF01D7">(?)</font> Someone else was here
and they took her case.

444
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,759
So the killer must have driven here.
Forgot the case was in the car.

445
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,919
She could have checked into a hotel,
left it there.

446
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,199
No, she never got to the hotel.
Look at her hair.

447
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,559
She colour-coordinates
her lipstick and shoes.

448
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,799
She'd never have left any hotel
with her hair still looking...

449
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,359
Oh...

450
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,719
Oh!

451
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,279
Sherlock? What is it, what?

452
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,079
Serial killers, always hard. You have
to wait for them to make a mistake.

453
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,159
- We can't just wait!
- Oh, we're done waiting.

454
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,519
Look at her, really look! Houston,
we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff.

455
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,639
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's
family and friends were. Find Rachel!

456
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,599
Of course, yeah - but what mistake?!

457
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,759
Pink!

458

- Who, Sherlock Holmes?

460
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,879
Yeah, he just took off.
He does that.

461
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,079
- Is he coming back?
- Didn't look like it.

462

Right.

463
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,679
Right...

464
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,599
Yes. Sorry, where am I?

465

Thanks.

473
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,319
But you're not his friend.

474
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,399
He doesn't have friends.

475
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,479
So who are you?

476
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,319
I'm...I'm nobody. I just met him.

477
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,399
OK, bit of advice, then.
Stay away from that guy.

478
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,399

479
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,519
You know why he's here?

480
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,759
He's not paid or anything.

481
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,119
He likes it. He gets off on it.

482
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,359
The weirder the crime, the more
he gets off. And you know what...?

483
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,559
One day just showing up
won't be enough.

484
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,919
One day we'll be standing round a body,
and he'll be the one that put it there.

485
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,039
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a psychopath.

486

Yes. I know.

517
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,319
Any point in asking...where I'm going?

518
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,199
None at all...

OK.

521
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,999
Have a seat, John.

522
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,399
You know, I've got a phone.

523
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,359
I mean, very clever and all that,

524

What is your connection
to Sherlock Holmes?

537
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,999
I don't have one. I barely know him.
I met him...yesterday.

538
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,319
Mmm, and since yesterday,
you've moved in with him

539
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,319
and now you're solving crimes together.

540
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,599
Might we expect a happy announcement
by the end of the week?

541
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,159
- Who are you?
- An interested party.

542
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,079
Interested in Sherlock? Why?

543
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,199
I'm guessing you're not friends.

544
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,639
You've met him. How many friends
do you imagine he has?

545
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,239
I am the closest thing to a friend that
Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.

546
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,239
- And what's that?
- An enemy.

547
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,759
- An enemy?
- In his mind, certainly.

548
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,439
If you were to ask him,
he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

549
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,319
He does love to be dramatic.

- Because you're not a wealthy man.

Nothing you'd feel...uncomfortable with.

- Just tell me what he's up to.
- Why?

You have an intermittent tremor

Your therapist thinks
it's post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,079
- What are you doing?
- Nicotine patch.

616
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,439
Helps me think.

617
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,279
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit
in London these days.

618
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,959
Bad news for brain work.

619
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,039
- It's good news for breathing.
- Oh, breathing! Breathing's boring.

620
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,839
Is that...three patches?

621
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,719
It's a three-patch problem.

622
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,039
Well...?

623
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,039
You asked me to come,
I'm assuming it's important.

624
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,119
Oh, yeah, of course.
Can I borrow your phone?

625
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,039
My phone?

626
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,959
Always a chance that my number will be
recognised. It's on the website.

627
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,959
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.

628
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,759
She's downstairs.
I shouted, but she didn't hear.

629
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,919
- I wasthe other side of London...
- There was no hurry.

630
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,359
Here...

631
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,199
So what's this about - the case?

632
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,719
- Her case...
- Hercase?

633
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,639
Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

634
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,079
The murderer took her suitcase,
first big mistake.

635
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,759
OK, he took her case. So?

636
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,999
It's no use, there's no other way.
We'll have to risk it.

637
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,519
On my desk there's a number.
I want you to send a text.

638
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,439
You've brought me here...
to send a text.

639
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,039
Text, yes. The number on my desk.

640
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,759
- What's wrong?
- Just met a friend of yours.

641
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,759
- A friend?
- An enemy.

642
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,279
Oh. Which one?

643
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,519
Well, your arch-enemy, according to him.
Do people have arch-enemies?

644
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,199
Did he offer you money to spy on me?

645
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,919
- Yes.
- Did you take it?

646
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,039
- No.
- Pity, we could have split the fee.

647
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,399
- Think it through next time.
- Who is he?

648
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,319
The most dangerous man you've ever met
and not my problem right now.

649
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,039
On my desk, the number!

650
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,199
Jennifer Wilson. That was...

651
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,359
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

652
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,279
Yes. That's not important.
Just enter the number.

653
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,759
- Are you doing it?
- Yes.

654
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,159
- Have you done it?
- Yeah, hang on!

655
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,759
These words exactly.

656
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,239
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?

657
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,039
"I must have blacked out.

658
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,639
"22 Northumberland Street,
please come."

659
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,119
- You blacked out?
- What? No... No!

660
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,879
Type and send it. Quickly.

661
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,879
- Have you sent it?
- What's the address?

662
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,319
22 Northumberland Street. Hurry up!

663
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,879
That's...

664
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,799
That's the pink lady's case,
that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

665
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,159
Yes, obviously.

666
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,839
Oh, perhaps I should mention -
Ididn't kill her.

667
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,519
- I never said you did.
- Why not?

668
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,959
Given that text and the fact I have her
case, it's a perfectly logical assumption.

669
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,319
Do people usually assume
you're the murderer?

670
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,959
Now and then, yes.

671
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,559
OK...

672
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,679
- How did you get this?
- By looking.

673
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,719
Where?

674
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,519
The killer must have driven her
to Lauriston Gardens.

675
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,399
He could only keep her case by accident
if it was in a car.

676
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,159
Nobody could be seen with this case
without drawing attention -

677
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,119
particularly a man,
which is statistically more likely.

678
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,679
So obviously he'd feel compelled
to get rid of it.

679
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,839
Wouldn't have taken him more than
five minutes to realise his mistake.

680
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,439
I checked every backstreet
wide enough for a car

681
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,519
five minutes from Lauriston Gardens

682
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,039
and anywhere you could dispose of
a bulky object without being observed.

683
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,479
Took me less than an hour
to find the right skip.

684
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,559
Pink. You got all that because
you realised the case would be pink?

685
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,919
- It had to be pink, obviously.
- Why didn't I think of that<font color="#DF01D7">(?)</font>

686
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,439
Because you're an idiot.

687
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,199
No, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.

688
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,879
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?

689
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,159
From the case? How could I?

690
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,799
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?

691
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,359
There was no phone on the body,
there's no phone in the case.

692
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,919
We know she had one.
You just texted it.

693
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,199
Maybe she left it at home.

694
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,359
She has a string of lovers
and she's careful about it.

695
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,479
She never leaves her phone at home.

696
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,159
Er...

697
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,919
Why did I just send that text?

698
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,239
Well, the question is
where is her phone now?

699
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,919
- She could have lost it.
- Yes, or?

700
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,839
The murderer... You think
the murderer has the phone?

701
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,479
Maybe she...left it
when she left her case.

702
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,079
Maybe he took it from her for some reason.

703
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,479
Either way, the balance of probability
is the murderer has her phone.

704
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,639
Sorry...what are we doing?
Did I just text a murderer?

705
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,039
What good will that do?

706
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,399
<font color="#DF01D7">(PHONE RINGS)</font>

707
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,079
A few hours after his last victim,

708
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,599
and now he receives a text
that can only be from her.

709
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,359
If somebody had just found that phone,

710
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,559
they'd ignore a text like that,
but the murderer...

711
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,319
would panic.

712
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,399
- Have you talked to the police?
- Four people are dead, there isn't time.

713
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,119
So why are you talking to me?

714
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,959
Mrs Hudson took my skull.

715
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,039
So I'm basically filling in
for your skull?

716
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,319
Relax, you're doing fine.

717
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,839
- Well?
- Well, what?

718
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,559
Well...you could just sit there
and...watch telly.

719
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,999
You want me to come with you?

720
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,239
I like company when I go out
and I think better when I talk aloud.

721
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,719
The skull just attracts attention, so...

722
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,159
- Problem?
- Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

723
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,999
What about her?

724
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,399
She said you get off on this,
you enjoy it.

725
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,959
And I said "dangerous",
and here you are.

726
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,079
Damn it!

727
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,759
Where are we going?

728
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,359
Northumberland Street's
a five-minute walk from here.

729
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,279
You think he's stupid enough
to go there?

730
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,919
No, I think he's brilliant enough.

731
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,959
I love the brilliant ones.
They're all so desperate to get caught.

732
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,199
- Why?
- Appreciation!

733
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,839
Applause! At long last the spotlight.

734
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,879
That's the frailty of genius, John,

735
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,519
- it needs an audience.
- Yeah.

736
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,879
This is his hunting ground.
Right here in the heart of the city.

737
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,239
Now that we know his victims were
abducted, that changes everything.

738
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,159
Because all of his victims
disappeared from busy streets,

739
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,319
crowded places,
but nobody saw them go.

740
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,559
Think! Who do we trust,
even though we don't know them?

741
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,919
Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

742
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,279
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

743
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,359
Don't know. Who?

744
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,359
Haven't the faintest. Hungry?

745
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,639
Thank you, Billy.

746
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,719
22 Northumberland Street.

747
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,959
Keep your eyes on it.

748
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,999
He's not just going to ring the doorbell.
He'd need to be mad.

749
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,519
He has killed four people.

750
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,079
OK.

751
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,159
Sherlock!

752
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,719
Anything on the menu,
whatever you want, free.

753
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,039
On the house, for you
and for your date.

754
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,799
- Do you want to eat?
- I'm not his date.

755
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,999
This man got me off a murder charge.

756
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,159
This is Angelo. Three years ago,
I proved to Lestrade,

757
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,479
at the time
of a particularly vicious triple murder,

758
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,559
that Angelo was in a different
part of town, house-breaking.

759
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,599
- He cleared my name.
- I cleared it a bit.

760
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,239
Anything happening opposite?

761
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,479
Nothing.

762
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,279
But for this man, I'd have gone to prison.

763
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,999
- You didgo to prison.
- I'll get a candle for the table.

764
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,599
- It's more romantic.
- I'm not his date!

765
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,479
You may as well eat.
We might have a long wait.

766
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,999
Thanks.

767
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,119
People don't have arch-enemies.

768
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,119
- I'm sorry?
- In real life.

769
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,479
There are no arch-enemies
in real life. Doesn't happen.

770
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,839
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.

771
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,839
So who did I meet?

772
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,719
What do real people have, then,
in their..."real lives"?

773
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,079
Friends?

774
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,359
People they know, people they like,
people they don't like...

775
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,279
- Girlfriends, boyfriends.
- Yes, well, as I was saying, dull.

776
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,839
You don't have a girlfriend, then?

777
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,919
Girlfriend? No, not really my area.

778
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,439
Mm.

779
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,039
Oh, right.

780
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,559
Do you have a boyfriend?
Which is fine, by the way.

781
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,759
I know it's fine.

782
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,479
- So you've got a boyfriend, then.
- No.

783
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,359
Right. OK.

784
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,239
You're unattached. Like me.

785
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,359
Fine. Good.

786
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,119
John, um...I think you should know

787
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,719
I consider myself married to my work
and while I'm flattered,

788
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,079
- I'm really not looking for any...
- No, I'm...not asking. No.

789
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,039
I'm just saying, it's all fine.

790
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,439
Good.

791

Thank you.

Look across the street.
Taxi. It's stopped.

793
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,399
Nobody getting in
and nobody getting out.

794
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,599
Why a taxi? Oh, that's clever.

795
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,919
- Is it clever? Why is it clever?
- That's him.

796
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,519
- Don't stare.
- You're staring.

797
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,639
We can't both stare.

- How could you possibly know that?
- The luggage.

814
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,439
First trip to London, right?

815
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,919
Going by your final destination
and the cabbie's route.

Yeah.

Welcome to London.

820
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,439
Er, any problems, just let us know.

821
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,959
Basically just a cab
that happened to slow down.

822
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,519
- Basically.
- Not the murderer.

823

- Not the murderer, no.
- Wrong country, good alibi.

- As they go.
- Hey, where did you get this?

825

- Detective Inspector Lestrade?
- Yeah.

I pickpocket him when he's annoying.

827
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,519
You can keep that one,
I've got plenty at the flat.

- Nothing, just..."Welcome to London."

Why aren't we back at the restaurant?

It was a long shot anyway.

So what were we doing there?

00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,999
Oh, just passing the time.

839
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,679
And proving a point.

840
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,239
- What point?
- You.

Sherlock, what have you done?

850
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,919
- Mrs Hudson?
- Upstairs.

851
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,079
What are you doing?

852
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,759
I knew you'd find the case,

You can't just break into my flat.

854
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,999
You can't withhold evidence -
and I didn't break in.

855
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,319
What do you call this, then?

856
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,439
It's a drugs bust.

857
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,999
Seriously? This guy - a junkie?

858

- Have you met him?
- John...

859
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,599
You could search this flat all day,

860
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,319
you wouldn't find anything
you could call recreational.

861
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,679
- John, you probably want to shut up now.
- But come on...

00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,919
- No...
- What?

- You?
- Shut up!

00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,599
- I'm not your sniffer dog.
- No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.

865
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,279
Anderson, what are you doing here
on a drugs bust?

866
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,839
- Oh, I volunteered.
- They all did.

867
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,119
They're not strictly speaking
on the drug squad, but they're very keen.

868
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,079
- Are these human eyes?
- Put those back!

869
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,519
- They were in the microwave.
- It's an experiment.

870
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,959
Keep looking, guys.

871
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,239
Or you could help us properly,
and I'll stand them down.

872
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,399
- This is childish.
- Well, I'm dealing with a child.

873
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,439
Sherlock, this is ourcase. I'm letting
you in, but you do not go off on your own.

874
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,359
Clear?

875
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,559
So you set up a pretend drugs bust
to bully me?

876
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,279
It stops being pretend
if we find anything.

877
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,959
I am clean!

878
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,439
- Is your flat? All of it?
- I don't even smoke.

879
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,719
Neither do I.

880
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,919
So let's work together.

881
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,519
- We've found Rachel.
- Who is she?

882
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,159
Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.

883
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,119
Her daughter?

884
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,679
Why would she write
her daughter's name? Why?

885
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,039
Never mind that, we found the case.

886
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,319
According to someone,
the murderer has the case,

887
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,919
and we found it in the hands
of our favourite psychopath.

888
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,119
Not a psychopath, I'm a high-functioning
sociopath. Do your research.

889
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,799
You need to bring Rachel in
to question her. Ineed to question her.

890
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,199
She's dead.

891
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,759
Excellent. How, when and why?
Is there a connection? There has to be.

892
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,239
Well, I doubt it,
since she's been dead for 1 4 years.

893
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,919
Technically, she was never alive.

894
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,079
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's
stillborn daughter, 1 4 years ago.

895
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,519
Oh, that's...

896
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,359
...that's not right. How...

897
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,199
Why would she do that? Why?

898
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,559
Why would she think of her daughter
in her last moments?

899
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,439
Yep - sociopath, I'm seeing it now.

900
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,399
She didn't think about her daughter.

901
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,159
She scratched her name on the floor
with her fingernails. She was dying.

902
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,039
It took effort, it would have hurt.

903
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,039
You said that the victims
all took the poison themselves,

904
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,479
that he makesthem take it.

905
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,959
Well, maybe he...I don't know,
talks to them.

906
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,559
Maybe he used the death
of her daughter somehow.

907
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,959
But that was ages ago.
Why would she still be upset?

908
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,079
Not good?

909
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,159
Bit not good, yeah.

910
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,199
If you were dying,
if you'd been murdered,

911
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,479
in your very last few seconds,
what would you say?

912
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,399
- "Please, God, let me live."
- Use your imagination!

913
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,999
I don't have to.

914
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,959
Yeah, but if you were clever,
really clever.

915
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,399
Jennifer Wilson running
all those lovers - she was clever.

916
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,239
She's trying to tell us something.

917
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,919
Isn't the doorbell working?
Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

918
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,159
- I didn't order a taxi. Go away.
- Oh, dear. They're making such a mess.

919
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,119
- What are they looking for?
- It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.

920
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,959
But they're just for my hip.
They're herbal soothers...

921
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,559
Shut up, everybody!
Don't move, don't speak, don't breathe.

922
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,679
I'm trying to think. Anderson,
face the other way. You're putting me off.

923

- What? My face is<font color="#DF01D7">(?)</font>
- Everybody quiet and still.

924
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,559
- Anderson, turn your back.
- Oh, for God's sake!

925
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,239
Your back, now, please!

926
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,279
- Come on, think. Quick!
- What about your taxi?

927
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,559
<font color="#DF01D7">(SHOUTING)</font> Mrs Hudson!

928
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,959
Oh...

929
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,159
Ah!

930
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,719
She was clever. Clever, yes!

931
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:49,159
She's cleverer than you lot
and she's dead. Do you see? Do you get it?

932
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,719
She didn't lose her phone,
she never lost it. She planted it on him.

933
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,759
When she got out of the car,
she knew that she was going to her death.

934
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,839
She left the phone
in order to lead us to her killer.

935
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,799
- But how?
- What do you mean, how?

936
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,519
Rachel!

937
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,399
Don't you see? Rachel!

938
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,399
Oh...

939
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,119
Look at you lot.
You're all so vacant.

940
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,919
Is it nice not being me?
It must be so relaxing.

941
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,919
- Rachel is not a name.
- Then what is it?

942
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,999
John, on the luggage, there's a label.

943
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,119
E-mail address.

944
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,839
Er, jenny.pink@mephone.org.uk.

945
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,359
She didn't have a laptop, which means
she did her business on her phone.

946
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,199
So it's a smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.

947
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,839
So there was a website
for her account.

948
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,959
The username is her e-mail address,
and all together now, the password is...?

949
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,239
- Rachel.
- So we can read her e-mails. So what?

950
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,239
Anderson, don't talk out loud.
You lower the IQ of the whole street.

951
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,039
We can do much more than that.
It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

952
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,159
Which means if you lose it,
you can locate it online.

953
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,879
She's leading us
to the man who killed her.

954
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,959
- Unless he got rid of it.
- We know he didn't.

955
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,479
- Come on, come on. Quickly!
- Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

956
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,239
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time
for your evening soother?

957
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,279
Get vehicles, get a helicopter.
This phone battery won't last for ever.

958
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,759
We'll just have a map reference,
not a name.

959
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,399
<font color="#404040">HOLMES:</font> It's a start!

960
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,559
Sherlock...

961
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,319
Narrows it down
from just anyone in London.

962
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,439
- It's the first proper lead we've had.
- Sherlock...

963
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,919
Where is it? Quickly, where?

964
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,959
Here. It's...in 22 1 Baker Street.

965
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,719
How can it be here?

966
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,039
How?

967
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,639
Maybe it was in the case
when you brought it back

968
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,239
- and it fell out somewhere.
- And I didn't notice it?

969
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,399
Ididn't notice?

970
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,199
<font color="#404040">WATSON:</font> Anyway, we texted him,
and he called back.

somewhere here, belonged to the victim.

Who do we trust,
even if we don't know them?

973

- What...?

977
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,199
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

978
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,159
So, how can the phone be here?

979
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,399
Don't know.

980
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,519
- I'll try it again.
- Good idea.

981
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,119
Where are you going?

982
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,639
Fresh air, just popping outside
for a moment. Won't be long.

983
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,839
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

984
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,719
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

985
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,119
I didn't order a taxi.

986
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,319
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

987
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,239
You're the cabbie.

988
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,119
The one who stopped outside
Northumberland Street.

989
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,239
It was you. Not your passenger.

990
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,439
See?
No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

991
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,439
It's like you're invisible.

992
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,319
Just the back of an 'ead.

993
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,999
Proper advantage for a serial killer.

994
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,279
- Is this a confession?
- Oh, yeah.

995
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,519
I'll tell you what else...

996
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,679
If you call the coppers now,
I won't run.

997
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:52,359
I'll sit quiet,
and they can take me down, I promise.

998
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,679
Why?

999
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,719
- Cos you're not going to do that.
- Am I not?

1000
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,479
I didn't kill those four people,
Mr Holmes.

1001
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,639
I spoke to 'em...

1002
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,799
and they killed themselves.

1003
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,519
If you get the coppers now,
I'll promise you one thing.

1004
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,239
I will never tell you what I said.

1005
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,999
No-one else will die, though,
and I believe they call that a result.

1006
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:27,039
And you won't ever understand
how those people died.

1007
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,439
What kind of result do you care about?

1008
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,119
If I wanted to understand...

1009

- ...what would I do?
- Let me take you for a ride.

1010
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,799
- So you can kill me too?
- I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.

1011
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,999
I'm going to talk to you...

1012
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,599

1033
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,359
I was warned about you.

I've been on your website too.
Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

1035
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,479
Who warned you about me?

1036
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,959
Just someone out there who's noticed.

1037
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,079
Who?

1038
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,879
Who would notice me?

1039
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,039
- You're too modest, Mr Holmes.
- I'm really not.

Got yourself a fan.

1041
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,079
Tell me more.

1042
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,799
That's all you're going to know.

1043
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,919
In this lifetime.

1044
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,359
Why did he do that?
Why did he have to leave?

1045
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,679
You know him better than I do.

1046
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,999
I've known him for five years
and, no, I don't.

1047
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,159
So why do you put up with him?

1048
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,119
Because I'm desperate, that's why.

1049
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,759
And because Sherlock Holmes
is a great man,

1050
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,479
and I think one day,
if we're very, very lucky,

1051
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,759
he might even be a good one.

- It's open.

One thing about being a cabbie -

1057
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,479
you always know
a nice quiet spot for a murder.

And Mrs Hudson will remember you.

1077
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,439
You call that a risk? Nah...

1078
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,599
This...is a risk.

1079
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,839
Oh, I like this bit.

1080
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,759
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya?

1081
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,759
But you're about to.

1082
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,439
I just have to do this...

1083
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,279
Weren't expecting that, were ya?

1084
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,879
Oh, you're gonna love this.

1085
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,679
- Love what?
- Sherlock Holmes...look at you!

1086
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:38,119
Here in the flesh. That website of yours,
your fan told me about it.

1087
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,799
My fan?

1088
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,399
You are brilliant.

1089
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,879
You are a proper genius.

1090
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,759
The Science Of Deduction. Now, that...

1091
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,959
is proper thinking.

1092
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,159
Between you and me sitting here,
why can't people think?

1093
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,119
Don't it make you mad?

1094
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,879
Why can't people just think?

1095
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,239
Oh, I see...
So you're a proper genius too.

1096
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,439
Don't look it, do I?

1097
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,519
Funny little man driving a cab.

1098
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,719
But you'll know better in a minute.

1099
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,799
Chances are
it'll be the last thing you everknow.

1100
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,079
OK, two bottles. Explain.

1101
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,399
There's a good bottle
and a bad bottle.

1102
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,999
You take the pill
from the good bottle, you live.

1103
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,119
You take the pill
from the bad bottle...you die.

1104
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,759
- Both bottles are of course identical.
- In every way.

1105
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,879
- And you know which is which.
- Of course Iknow.

1106
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,799
- But I don't.
- Wouldn't be a game

1107
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,599
if you knew -
you're the one who chooses.

1108
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:48,639
Why should I? I've got nothing
to go on. What's in it for me?

1109
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,439
I haven't told you the best bit yet.

1110
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,599
Whatever bottle you choose,

1111
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,319
I take the pill from the other one.

1112
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,759
And then together...

1113
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,319
we take our medicine.

1114
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,359
I won't cheat. It's your choice.

1115
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,719
I'll take whatever pill you don't.

1116
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,999
Didn't expect that, did you,
Mr Holmes?

1117
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,519
This is what you did
to the rest of them,

1118
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,039
- you gave them a choice?
- And now I'm giving you one.

1119
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,519
You take your time.

1120
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,439
Get yourself together.

1121
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,359
- I want your best game.
- It's not a game, it's chance.

1122
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,119
I've played four times. I'm alive.

1123
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,039
It's not chance, Mr Holmes - it's chess.

1124
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,239
It's a game of chess,
with one move...

1125
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,319
...and one survivor.

1126
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,079
And this...this...

1127
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,919
is the move.

1128
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,479
Did I just give you the good bottle
or the bad bottle?

1129
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,799
You can choose either one.

1130
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,239
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade -
I need to speak to him.

1131
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,999
It's important. It's an emergency.

1132
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,319
Er, left here, please. Left here...

1133
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,359
You ready yet, Mr Holmes?

1134
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,119
- Ready to play?
- Play what? It's a 50:50 chance.

1135
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,839
You're not playing the numbers -
you're playing me.

1136
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,879
Did I just give you the good pill
or the bad pill?

1137
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,999
Is it a bluff

1138
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,039
or a double bluff?

1139
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,199
- Or a triple bluff?
- It's still just chance.

1140
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,199
Four people, in a row?
It's not chance.

1141
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,959
- Luck.
- It's genius!

1142
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,039
I know how people think.

1143
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,119
I know how people think Ithink.

1144
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,559
I can see it all
like a map inside my head.

1145
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,799
Everyone's so stupid, even you.

1146
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,519
Or maybe God just loves me.

1147
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,759
Either way,
you're wasted as a cabbie.

1148
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,999
So...

1149
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,959
...you risked your life four times
just to kill strangers - why?

1150
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,559
Time to play.

1151
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,359
Oh, I am playing. This is my turn.

1152
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:36,759
There's shaving foam behind your
left ear. Nobody's pointed it out to you.

1153
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,239
Traces of where it's happened before,
so obviously you live on your own -

1154
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,559
there's no-one to tell you.

1155
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,479
But there's a photograph of children.
The children's mother's been cut out.

1156
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,199
If she'd died, she'd still be there.

1157
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,159
The photograph's old,
but the frame's new.

1158
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,599
You think of your children,
but you don't get to see them.

1159
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,879
Estranged father.

1160
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,759
She took the kids,

1161
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,319
but you still love them,
and it still hurts.

1162
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,639
Ah, but there's more.

1163
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,519
Your clothes. Recently laundered,

1164
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,319
but everything you're wearing
is at least...three years old?

1165
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,239
Keeping up appearances,
but not planning ahead.

1166
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:16,239
And here you are on a kamikaze
murder spree. What's that about?

1167
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,479
Ah...

1168
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,719
three years ago.
Is that when they told you?

1169
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,079
Told me what?

1170
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,199
- That you're a dead man walking.
- So are you.

1171
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,839
You don't have long, though. Am I right?

1172
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,399
Aneurism. Right in 'ere.

1173
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,119
Any breath could be my last.

1174
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,639
And because you're dying,
you've just murdered four people.

1175
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,599
I've outlived four people.

1176
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,039
That's the most fun you can have
with an aneurism.

1177
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,599
No... No, there's something else.

1178
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:00,639
You didn't just kill four people because
you're bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic.

1179
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:04,679
Love is a much more vicious motivator.

1180
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,279
Somehow, this is about your children.

1181
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,719
Oh...

1182
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,239
- You are good, in't ya?
- But how?

1183
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,479
When I die, they won't get much,
my kids.

1184
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,719
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.

1185
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,119
- Or serial killing.
- You'd be surprised.

1186
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,799
Surprise me.

1187
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,479
- I have a sponsor.
- You have a what?

1188
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:36,759
For every life I take,
money goes to my kids.

1189
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,879
The more I kill...
the better off they'll be.

1190
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,359
You see? It's nicer than you think.

1191
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,279
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

1192
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,999
Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?

1193
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,319
You're not the only one
to enjoy a good murder.

1194
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,519
There's others out there just like you,
except you're just a man.

1195
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,159
And they're so much more than that.

1196
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,599
What do you mean...

1197
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,759
more than a man?

1198
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,799
An organisation...what?

1199
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,999
There's a name that no-one says.

1200
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,879
And I'm not going to say it either.

1201
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,679
Now, enough chatter.

1202
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,439
Time to choose.

1203
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:37,799
Sherlock!

1204
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,319
What if I don't choose either?
I could just walk out of here.

1205
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,239
You can take a 50:50 chance,

1206
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,279
or I can shoot you in the head.

1207
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,199
Funnily enough,

1208
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,199
no-one's ever gone for that option.

1209
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,359
I'll have the gun, please.

1210
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,999
Are you sure?

1211
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,679
Definitely. The gun.

1212
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,839
You don't want to phone a friend <font color="#DF01D7">(?)</font>

1213
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,199
The gun.

1214
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,879
I know a real gun when I see one.

1215
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,039
- None of the others did.
- Clearly.

1216
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,439
Well, this has been very interesting.

1217
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,039
I look forward to the court case.

1218
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,839
Just before you go,
did you figure it out?

1219
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,359
Which one's the good bottle?

1220
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,599
Course. Child's play.

1221
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,879
Well, which one, then?

1222
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,759
Which one would you have picked?

1223
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,959
Just so I know whether
I could have beaten you.

1224
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,959
Come on!

1225
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,839
Play the game.

1226
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,759
Oh!

1227
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,159
Interesting.

1228
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,959
So what do you think?

1229
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,079
Shall we?

1230
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,079
Really...what do you think?

1231
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,719
Can you beat me?

1232
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,919
Are you clever enough...

1233
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,839
to bet your life?

1234
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,159
<font color="#DF01D7">(MUFFLED)</font> Sherlock!

1235
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,479
I bet you get bored, don't you?

1236
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,359
I know you do.

1237
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:02,159
A man like you. So clever.

1238
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:07,559
But what's the point of being clever
if you can't prove it?

1239
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,359
Still the addict.

1240
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,719
But this...this is what
you're really addicted to.

1241
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,039
You'll do anything...

1242
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,279
...anything at all,
to stop being bored.

1243
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,039
You're not bored now, are ya?

1244
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,279
Isn't it good?

1247
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,079
Was I right?

1248
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,839
I was, wasn't I?

1249
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,319
Did I get it right?

1250
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,079
OK...tell me this.

1251
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,799
Your sponsor. Who was it?

1252
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,879
The one who told you about me,
my fan.

1253
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,759
I want a name.

1254
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,279
No...

1255
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,439
You're dying,
but there's still time to hurt you.

1256
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,119
Give me...a name.

<font color="#DF01D7">(GASPS)</font>

1258
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,639
A name! Now!

1259
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,799
The name!

1260
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,559
Moriarty!

1261
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,399
<font color="#DF01D7">(MOUTHS)</font>

1263
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,079
Why have I got this blanket?
They keep putting this blanket on me.

1264
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,799
- Yeah, it's for shock.
- I'm not in shock.

1265
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,599
Yeah, but some of the guys
want to take photographs.

1266
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,879
So, the shooter - no sign?

1267
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,399
Cleared off before we got here.

1268
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,039
But a guy like that
would have had enemies, I suppose.

1269
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,239
One of them could have been
following him, but...

1270
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,319
we've got nothing to go on.

1271
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,959
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1272
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,039
OK. Give me.

1273
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,039
The bullet they just dug
out of the wall's from a handgun.

1274
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,159
A kill shot over that distance,
from that kind of a weapon,

1275
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,599
that's a crack shot.
But not just a marksman, a fighter.

1276
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:22,239
His hands couldn't have shaken at all,
so clearly he's acclimatised to violence.

1277
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,119
He didn't fire until I was in immediate
danger, though, so strong moral principle.

1278
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:30,239
You're looking for a man probably
with a history of military service and...

1279
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,599
nerves of steel...

1280
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,839
Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.

1281
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,559
- Sorry?
- Ignore all of that.

1282
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,999
- It's just the, er...the shock talking.
- Where are you going?

1283
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,079
I just need to...talk about
the...the rent.

1284
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,679
- I've still got questions.
- Oh, what now?!

1285
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,519
I'm in shock - look, I've got a blanket.

1286
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,799
- Sherlock!
- And...

1287
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,839
I just caught you a serial killer...
more or less.

1288
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,879
OK. We'll pull you in tomorrow.
Off you go.

1289
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:15,959
Erm...Sergeant Donovan's...just been
explaining...everything. Two pills...

1290
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,199
Dreadful business, isn't it? Dreadful.

1291
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,399
Good shot.

1292
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,679
Yes. Yes, must have been.
Through that window.

1293
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,639
Well, you'd know.

1294
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,039
Need to get the powder burns
out of your fingers.

1295
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,199
I don't suppose you'd serve time
for this, but let's avoid the court case.

1296
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,919
- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course I'm all right.

1297
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,719
- Well, you have just killed a man.
- Yes, I...

1298
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,759
That's true, isn't it?

1299
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,079
But he wasn't a very nice man.

1300
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,439
- No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?
- Frankly, a bloody awful cabbie.

1301
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,399
<font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLES)</font> That's true,
he was a bad cabbie.

1302
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,119
You should have seen the route
he took us to get here.

1303
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,919
Stop! We can't giggle,
it's a crime scene. Stop it.

1304
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,359
- You're the one who shot him.
- Keep your voice down!

1305
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,559
Sorry, it's just, erm...nerves, I think.

1306
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,919
Sorry.

1307
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,039
You were going to take that damn pill,
weren't you?

1308
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:13,199
Course I wasn't. Biding my time.
Knew you'd turn up.

1309
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,839
No, you didn't.

1310
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,639
That's how you get your kicks, isn't it?

1311
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,599
You risk your life to prove you're clever.

1312
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:21,599
- Why would I do that?
- Because you're an idiot.

1313
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,679
- Dinner?
- Starving.

1314
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,479
End of Baker Street, there's
a good Chinese. Stays open till two.

1315
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,039
You can tell a good Chinese
by the bottom third of the door handle.

1316
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,999
Sherlock...that's him, that's the man
I was talking to you about.

1317
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,559
I know exactly who that is.

1318
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,159
So...another case cracked.

1319
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,679
How very public-spirited.

1320
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,119
Though that's never really
your motivation, is it?

1321
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,719
What are you doing here?

1322
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,279
As ever, I'm concerned about you.

1323
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,679
Yes, I've been hearing
about your "concern".

1324
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,399
Always so aggressive.

1325
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:56,319
Did it never occur to you that
you and I belong on the same side?

1326
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,399
Oddly enough...no.

1327
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,479
We have more in common
than you'd like to believe.

1328
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,599
This petty feud between us
is simply childish. People will suffer.

1329
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:08,439
And you know how it always upset Mummy.

1330
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,159
Iupset her?

1331
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,479
Me?

1332
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,839
It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.

1333
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,279
No. No, wait...

1334
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,639
Mummy? Who's Mummy?

1335
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,079
Mother. Our mother.

1336
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:24,759
This is my brother, Mycroft.
Putting on weight again?

1337
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,159
- Losing it, in fact.
- He's your brother?

1338
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,119
Course he's my brother.

1339
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,639
- So he's not...
- Not what?

1340
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:38,519
- I don't know...criminal mastermind?
- Close enough.

1341
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,839
For goodness' sake,

1342
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,119
I occupy a minor position
in the British Government.

1343
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,719
He isthe British Government,

1344
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,039
when he's not too busy
being the British Secret Service

1345
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,719
or the CIA on a freelance basis.

1346
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,239
Good evening, Mycroft.
Try not to start a war before I get home -

1347
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,959
you know what it does for the traffic.

1348
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,159
So, when you say you're concerned
about him, you actually are concerned?

1349
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,759
Yes, of course.

1350
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,839
It actually is a childish feud?

1351
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,799
He's always been so resentful.

1352
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,719
You can imagine the Christmas dinners.

1353
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,399
Yeah...

1354
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,519
No... God, no.

1355
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,439
I'd better, erm... Hello again.

1356
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,799
- Hello.
- We met earlier on this evening.

1357
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,599
Oh!

1358
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,519
- OK. Good night.
- Good night, Dr Watson.

1359
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,079
- So, dim sum.
- Mmm!

1360
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:31,919
I can always predict the fortune cookies.

1361
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,399
- No, you can't.
- Almost can.

1362
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,599
You did get shot, though.

1363
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,759
- Sorry?
- In Afghanistan.

1364
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:36,999
There was an actual wound.

1365
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,399
- Oh. Yeah, shoulder.
- Shoulder! I thought so.

1366
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,079
- No, you didn't.
- The left one.

1367
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,679
- Lucky guess.
- I never guess.

1368
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,239
Yes, you do.

1369
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,879
- What are you so happy about?
- Moriarty.

1370
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,159
- What's Moriarty?
- I've absolutely no idea.

1371
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,359
Sir, shall we go?

1372
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,079
Interesting, that soldier fellow.

1373
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,879
He could be the making of my brother...

1374
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,599
or make him worse than ever.

1375
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,519
Either way, we'd better upgrade
their surveillance status.

1376
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,959
Grade 3 active.

1377
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,039
Sorry, sir - whose status?
