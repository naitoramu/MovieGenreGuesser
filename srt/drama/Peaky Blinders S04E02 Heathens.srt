00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,936
My son's not here to speak...

163
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,210
So I'll speak on behalf of us both.

164
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,460
Truce.

165
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,420
Five for peace.

166
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,938
Two for truce, one abstension.

167
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,970
Let's get on with the war.

Whoa. Curly, how are ya?

171
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,577
Here, catch.

172
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,134
Right, come on then,
boys, unload, unload.

plays in goal for the Blues

and TommyJackson for the Villa.

177
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,890
Fair enough.

178
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,853
- Charlie?
- What is it, Curly?

179
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,534
We've run out of bullets Charlie.

180
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,534
We need more ammunition.

181
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,574
More ammunition.

182
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,892
Johnny, more ammo.

(IN ROMANI)

184
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,897
We're like sitting ducks
here if the wops come.

185
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,174
Yeah, well, Tommy said
we should do it in the open.

186
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,538
This is howJohn wanted to go.

187
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,175
On the smoke.

188
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,260
And the truth is...

189
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,617
we died together once before.

190
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,890

191
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,890

Jeremiah,

195
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,135
and John.

196
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,933
We were cut off from the retreat...

197
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,896
No bullets left, waiting for
the Prussian cavalry

198
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,733
to come and to finish us off.

199
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,779
And while we waited...

200
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,615
Jeremiah said, "We should sing,
'In the Bleak Midwinter.'"

201
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,860
But we were spared.

202
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,420
The enemy never came.

203
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,580
And we all agreed...

204
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,619
that everything after that was extra.

205
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,774
And when our time came...

206
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,929
we'd all remember.

207
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,057
POLLY: You remember that God spared you.

208
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,220
But what did you do with that
extra time that he gave you, eh, Thomas?

I repeat, do not return fire.
Stand down.

214
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,454
The men doing the firing
are on our side.

215
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,660
I took the trouble...

216
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,130
of giving an invitation
to Aberama Gold.

217
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,780
Oh fuck! Now it's begun.

218
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,376
Put it out in the open on purpose.

219
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,934
You used John's funeral fire
as a fucking beacon.

220
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,380
ARTHUR: We were never
in any danger Polly.

221
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,530
You set a trap.

222
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,053
Finn? Finn? Go to
the yard and light the fires.

223
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,934
You set a trap with us as fucking bait.

224
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,090
Who's dead?

225
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,854
TOMMY: Our enemies.

226
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,932
- Who's dead?
- You wanna know, Poll?

227
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,055
Two fucking no good Italians
heard about the vendetta,

228
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,615
tried to make a fucking name
for themselves, that's who.

229
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,579
We got word to them about the funeral,

230
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,935
the where, the when...

231
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,537
Told them where to
stand for the best shot.

232
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,256
TOMMY: And Aberama Gold
would do the rest.

233
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,893
That's the language of vendetta,

234
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,939
they take one of ours,
we take two of theirs.

235
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,657
You used your own brother's funeral.

236
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,815
When did we vote on this, Tommy?

237
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,574
Curly, get a boat ready
to take the bodies to the city.

238
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,175
And another boat for anyone,

239
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,900
anyone who wants no more part of this.

240
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,613
'Cause this is how it's gonna be.

241
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,813
Polly?

242
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,691
I'm not staying for
this, Arthur, I'm going home.

243
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,372
Oh, yeah? Home's 57, Watery Lane.

244
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,697
You go there, lock
the doors, you wait for me.

245
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,816
Key to number 57.

246
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,050
I'm going home to the country.

247
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,939
You will stay here until it's over.
Take the fucking key, Linda.

248
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,935
Look, away from here
you are a weakness to all of us.

249
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,660
They will take you hostage and the baby,

250
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,538
they will use the baby.

251
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,536
Take it. Put the kettle on,
wait for your husband.

The only way any of you
Shelbys will leave this place

253
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,411
is on a cloud of smoke like John.

254
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,171
Well, you're a Shelby now too, Linda.

255
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,618
Five hundred each.
A thousand for the brace.

256
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,900
Where do you want them?

257
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,051
Charlie, take him to the yard.

258
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,498
TOMMY: Not too far
and not too deep, Curly,

259
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,014
I need the message to get through.

260
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,420
Okay, Tommy.

261
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,335
Finn, you go with him.

262
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,051
Go on. Go with him.

263
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,773
Oh, Tom, uh, tellJanet to
save me some goose, please.

264
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,131
On your feet.

265
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,740
Wait outside.

266
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,540
Hello, Mum.

267
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,532
POLLY: They said you'd be out cold.

268
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,297
- No, don't move.

269
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,057
The doctor said they've
sewn you up like a football.

270
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,815
What else did he say?

271
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,940
He said you took four bullets.

272
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,651
Only one was live, one was ricochet...

273
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,734
Two were already spent.

274
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,978
Two had passed through John.

275
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,654
Last thing I remember
was his face.

276
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,859
I watched him go.

277
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,257
Where's Tommy?

278
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,411
Oh, don't worry about Tommy,
just get better.

279
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,980
Where is he?

280
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,017
Tommy's back.

281
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,253
We're all back. Garrison,
Watery Lane, Charlie's...

282
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,771
- I need a cigarette.
- No.

283
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,331
I made a decision.

284
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,093
Give me a cigarette, Mum.

285
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,820
- It's not allowed.
- It's not allowed?

286
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,859
- I've decided we're gonna get away.
- Mm, yeah?

287
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,574
Just me and you, Australia.

288
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,935
I've been to the Cunard office
and I've got a magazine.

289
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,969
- Hmm.
- Now, America's no good

290
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,700
because that's where they are,
but there's no Italians in Australia.

291
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,453
I think there are, Mum.

292
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,740
Bad ones, I mean.

293
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,299
Have you stopped taking
those prison tablets?

294
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,780
Don't you worry about me.

295
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,089
Well, I do.

296
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,418
And just you get better.

297
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,412
The doctor says it'll be five weeks,
then you'll be up and walking.

298
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,457
Now, there's a boat that
leaves on February the 13th.

299
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,372
Tell Tommy I need to see him.

300
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,014
Tell him to bring a gun small enough
to fit in the chamber pot, in case...

301
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,331
I've banned Tommy from coming.

302
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,574
The factory's coming
back to work tomorrow.

303
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,060
Just forget about the fucking factories.

304
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,699
Is there any word of
them going out on strike?

305
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,009
We can go to Australia,

306
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,376
it'll just be you, me, and your sister,

307
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,493
'cause I've found out where she was
buried, somewhere outside Melbourne.

308
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,849
Listen, Mum...

309
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,772
I'm gonna get better slowly.

310
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,698
But you need to get better fast.

311
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,100
Without you he falls apart
and without him...

312
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,932
without him, they'll take us all.

313
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,817
You've got to get us through this.

314
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,254
And I promise...

315
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,774
I'll board that train with
you and we'll go to Australia.

316
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,094
I like your yard, Mr Strong.
How much would you take for it?

317
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,814
It's not for sale.

318
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,495
Not for sale?

319
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,535
Okay.

320
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,660
I just took a look around.
I like this place.

321
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,851
Fire for melting silver,
canal to get it away.

322
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,056
How much?

323
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,097
Nothing you see here
is for sale, Mr Gold.

324
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,780
Oh, everything's for sale, everything.

325
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,930
You tell Mr Strong
I'm going to buy his yard.

326
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,851
This yard has been in
his family since they settled.

327
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,336
But I've decided to
make it part of our deal.

328
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,295
Charlie?

329
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,140
Charlie, come here.

330
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,218
I'm gonna spin a coin
for your yard, Charlie.

331
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,575
You're going to what?

332
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,454
If it's heads...

333
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,492
Abbie here takes all
of this with my blessing.

334
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,176
Tommy?

335
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,900
And if it's tails...

336
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,338
I fuck your daughter, Mr Gold.

337
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,899
You have three daughters I hear,

338
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,056
and Esmeralda is the oldest
and also the prettiest,

339
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,853
so I'll have her.

340
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,819
So make her part of the deal
and spin against the yard.

341
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,372
Tommy, for fuck's sake.

342
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,211
Here, you toss the coin, Mr Gold.

343
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,375
No.

344
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,531
Please don't believe this is a joke,

345
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,539
the coin to us is sacred, yes, Arthur?

346
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,895
Sacred.

347
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,938
You toss that coin, you take
a bet before witnesses,

348
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,694
and if I win...

349
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,140
Then we'll insist

350
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:48,136
that the terms of this agreement...
wager are fulfilled.

351
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,855
Toss the coin, Mr Gold.

352
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,737
Tommy Shelby, OBE...

353
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,733
No wager today...

354
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,097
but with this penny I will buy
a flower to put on your grave...

355
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,380
When the time comes.

356
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,540
And before that time...

357
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,776
please don't again disrespect
my friends or their valued property.

358
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,695
We missed Christmas, let's have it now.

359
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,651
Peace on earth, goodwill to all men.

360
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,375
Drink?

361
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,419
Rum, Curly?

362
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,297
Toast to my brother, John,
raise your glasses all of you.

363
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,339
Raise them up, all of you.

364
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,249
John Shelby.

365
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,612
I've got wire, I've got chains,
I've got the steel rods. Now what?

366
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,255
Right, put the steel rods
up the geese's arse there,

367
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,576
and then you put those
steel rods above the fire,

368
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,856
spinning the rod to stop
the bird from burning.

369
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,899
ALL: Cheers!

370
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,620
JOHNNY: You did get potatoes, Charlie?

371
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,896
No, I didn't get fucking potatoes,
what's the matter with you?

372
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,019
I don't want that bastard Aberama Gold

373
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,456
putting it around that we live
like Diddycoys.

374
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,853
I want him to see that we live proper,
that we eat proper, in the proper way.

375
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,977
What the fuck are you talking about?

376
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,972
I'll get the potatoes meself.

377
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,820
Never thought my high
fucking heels from Paris

378
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,735
would be stepping through the horse shit
of Small Heath ever again.

379
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,499
Temporary, Polly.

380
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,890
LIZZIE: Yeah, until hell freezes over.

381
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,253
(CLEARS THROAT) How's Michael?

382
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,575
You said eight men from New York,
seven from Sicily, at £500 each?

383
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,133
Course you can afford it.

384
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,100
Most we'll do ourselves.

385
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,656
How many of your factories
are in the safe territories?

386
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,935
Seventy percent.

387
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,534
Shelby Company Limited
will continue to manufacture.

388
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,290
Lizzie says its only whores these days?

389
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,616
Yeah.

390
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,012
Have them smuggled in, I suppose.

391
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,894
I need you back, Polly.

392
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,057
Paying whores for sex.

393
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,733
Paying killers to kill.

394
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,015
Yep, nothing for nothing.

395
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,460
Poor Thomas.

396
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,380
You know, our mother went this way.

397
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,699
Spirits and ghosts, tablets,
fucking... fucking séances,

398
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,737
scaring us kids
halfway to fuckin' death.

399
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,779
Yeah, well. I'm not going that way.

400
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,936
'Cause in the smoke
I realised something.

401
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,454
I'm just like you now.

402
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,854
You and Arthur.

403
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,020
I was dead in that noose
and then I was saved,

404
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,097
so everything from now on is extra.

405
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,976
But what I didn't understand until today

406
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,812
is when you're dead already...

407
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,500
you're free.

408
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,379
Fucking love it.

409
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,135
I'll help you because
Michael wants me to help you.

410
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,780
Starting now...

411
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,218
Get your whores vetted by Lizzie,
they'll use your weakness.

412
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,059
Don't take any new men on
in the factories

413
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,132
unless you know their families.

414
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,810
And your new friend,
Mr Aberama Gold...

415
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,699
he wants something
other than just money.

416
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,175
I see things in the air around people,
but it's not just the tablets.

417
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,054
It's real.

418
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,496
Ask him what he really wants.

419
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,656
She's a fine beast this one.

420
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,410
Nothing you see is for sale, Mr Shelby.

421
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,655
You know your grandfather
camped with mine for a while?

422
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,649
Yep...

423
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,376
And didn't last.

424
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,613
No, it ended badly
in a pub called the Wenlock.

425
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,255
We were owed money, still are.

426
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,897
Other than money, and this
scrapyard that's clearly not for sale,

427
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,539
what is it that you
want from me, Mr Gold?

428
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,572
How do you know
I want anything from you?

429
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,900
Well, because my company treasurer

430
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,656
is a certified accountant
and also apparently, a witch.

431
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,853
You're a sporting man.

432
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,535
- Yes, I am.
- And a gambling man.

433
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,411
Bonnie, take off your shirt.

434
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,418
What I want from you, Mr Shelby,
is for you to take a gamble on him.

435
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,733
I want you to help
my son achieve his ambition.

436
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,250
(GRUNTING)

437
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,331
What ambition might that be?

438
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,454
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

439
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,773
(KNOCKING)

440
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,130
Who is it?

441
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,531
Inspector Moss.

442
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,980
- I'm looking for Tommy.
- He's at Charlie's.

443
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,374
But I wouldn't go there,
some bad men have arrived.

444
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,215
Yes, I've heard.

445
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,458
They'll be drunk by now, or worse.

446
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,974
Can you take a message?

447
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,256
The, uh, intelligence service in London

448
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,650
have sent seven officers up
to Birmingham

449
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,257
to check out the investigation
into communists and seditionists.

450
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,538
They've got a list of people
of great interest and, uh,

451
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,136
top of that list is
Ada Thorne, formerly Shelby.

452
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,691
Now, they seem to think that
she came back from New York

453
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,340
to organise a revolution in Birmingham.

454
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,980
Well, tell them they're wrong.

455
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,254
Ada Shelby's now firmly back
in place in the family business.

456
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,253
Thing is, when you get
a mark against your name...

457
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,096
it's very hard to shift it.

458
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,414
They will come looking for her.

459
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,130
Well, tell them there's a queue.
Everybody wants a Shelby.

460
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,814
Mrs Shelby...

461
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,691
These are military men,
no less dangerous than any Italians.

462
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,176
You tell Tommy,
I think he'll understand.

463
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,819
Say goodnight to you then.

464
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,415
- Hello, Curly.
- Oh, hello.

465
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,937
I'm here to collect Mr Shelby's
horse. I'm a little early, I think.

466
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,053
Are you going
to train the horse to race?

467
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,250
Yes.

468
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,971
Don't use a crop, she's very gentle.

469
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,539
- I won't.
- CHARLIE: Yo.

470
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,849
I, I...

471
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,372
MAY: How is Mr Shelby?

472
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,331
CURLY: Well, now he's got the Americans
after him, he's a bit hard on people.

473
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,050
- The Americans?
- Yeah, they call them the Mafia.

474
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,450
Dear God.

475
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,698
Yeah, there's 15 of them.
Yeah, they want to kill us all,

476
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,976
but we got guns and grenades
and, and Polly's back,

477
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,972
so it's gonna be okay, yeah.

478
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,254
I'll get the horse.

479
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,570
Mr Shelby, thank God you're back,
we've got real trouble.

480
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,420
TOMMY: What meetings do I have today?

481
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,971
Um, well, uh, there's a supplier
from Coventry at 10:00,

482
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,336
uh, the convener with
the boiler makers unit at 11:00,

483
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,940
and then Chamber of Commerce at 1:00.

484
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,130
But that isn't the thing...

485
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,530
Right. Clear a space here,
move this car back,

486
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,811
give me a hundred feet of rope
and a bell.

487
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,732
- Rope?
- Yep, and a bell.

488
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,337
Mr Shelby, this place
is about to explode.

489
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,093
A rope and a bell, Devlin.

490
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,574
Bonnie, this way.

491
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,015
Yes, Mr Shelby.

492
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,770
And by the way, the revolution
is scheduled to begin at noon.

493
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,660
TOMMY: There he is, Billy Mills,

494
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,732
former heavyweight champion,

495
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,777
Staffordshire, Warwickshire
and Worcestershire.

496
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,936
Hello, Billy.

497
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,137
Yeah.

498
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,010
And now I work for you, Mr Shelby,

499
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,733
for not enough money.

500
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,894
Right. That enough for you?

501
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,935
Enough for what?

502
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,696
Someone here who wants to fight you.
Bonnie Gold, come here, son.

503
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,813
I'm a heavyweight,

504
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,454
he's a welterweight at best.

505
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,458
Nevertheless, he wants to fight you.

506
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,009
Yeah. And then when I damage him,
the Blinders will take my eyes.

507
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,051
No comeback, Billy,
just a fight, Queensbury Rules.

508
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,858
BILLY: When?
TOMMY: Now.

509
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,260
BILLY: Where?
TOMMY: Here!

510
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,935
ARTHUR: Right, you lot, come here.

511
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,570
Let's make it interesting.
Come place a wager with me.

512
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,299
I'll give you good odds.

513
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,010
I'll give you good odds on the boy,
even better on the big lad.

514
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,132
There you go, what you want?

515
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,892
Bonnie, come here, son.

516
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,259
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

517
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,100
- Give him one!
- Let's have it then!

518
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,695
Your boy knows he can hit back, right?

519
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,935
Told him in the professional game
people want their money's worth,

520
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,500
don't win too fast.

521
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,260
But if you've seen enough...

522
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,619
Finish it, Bonnie.

523
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,053
Fuck me. That was a punch.

524
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,732
What's he got, horseshoes
in those gloves or what?

525
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,337
No, just his dad's strength
and his mother's temper.

526
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,810
TOMMY: Does he have fits?
ABARAMAH: No.

527
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,579
- Asthma?
- No.

528
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,855
How's he cut?

529
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,136
Well, no one's cut him
yet, but his skin's thick.

530
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,333
- Does he drink?
- Water, sometimes.

531
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,651
- How many fights?
- Twenty-five, bare knuckle,

532
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,051
all knockouts, five with gloves
in pastures, all knockouts.

533
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,052
Against Romany fighters?

534
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,132
That's why they won't let us in the
fairs no more, he keeps winning.

535
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,610
I could fight a fucking tree
and knock it out, Mr Shelby.

536
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,056
(LAUGHS) I like him. I like it.

537
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,730
- Mrs Eden is waiting upstairs
- I'll be there in a minute. Arthur?

538
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,900
Mr Shelby's on his way.

539
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,460
Fight in the workshop?

540
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,414
No, no, just a bit of sport.

541
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,490
Do you want some more tea?

542
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,054
No, what kind of sport?

543
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,210
Sport between men, Mrs Eden.

544
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,213
Actually, I'm Miss Eden.

545
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,774
Be patient, a good man will come.

546
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,693
TOMMY: What do you think?
ARTHUR: No, that was over fast.

547
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,499
Yeah, but you can tell, eh?

548
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,049
I'd give him to the Irish boys
at Digbeth, they can teach him.

549
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,894
- And then what?
- We promote him.

550
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,059
Big money in London,
New York, if he's good.

551
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,614
We control him.

552
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,534
On the book, control the odds,
like a horse.

553
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,779
Control when he wins, when he loses.
Alfie Solomon runs a fighter,

554
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,536
says it's fuckin' money for nothing,
fighting's been good for us,

555
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,134
better if you know who's gonna win.

556
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,176
But we got a lot going on, that's all.

557
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,611
Yeah. That's why it'd be good
to have the kid around.

558
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,100
We take the fucking kid on,

559
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,380
one day he may end up
fucking taking a bullet for you.

560
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,897
Can't afford to lose
another brother, can I?

561
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,177
No one else is like him,
so he's all right.

562
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,055
Come on.

563
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,893
All right, I'll do it.

564
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,770
ABARAMAH: But we need to
do a deal about money.

565
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,295
- ARTHUR: Hmm.
- Yeah. Speak to my accountant.

566
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,774
- The witch?
- Yeah.

567
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,329
So when will my first real
fight be do you think, Mr Shelby?

568
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,692
Soon as we can find anyone stupid
enough to get in the ring with you.

569
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,089
God help him.

570
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,614
There you go, Bonnie.

571
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,139
You're a Peaky Blinder now, son.

572
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:26,011
- There you go, the lion's share.
- Thank you.

573
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,734
Mr Shelby...
I understand you've had a bereavement.

574
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,732
TOMMY: I'm here to talk business.

575
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,340
Then I'll be blunt.

576
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,290
As will I.

577
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,173
What you're doing here is robbery.

578
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,740
Every man is free to leave.

579
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,211
You cut five shillings
from the weekly wage.

580
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,334
And you said, if I did that

581
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,737
you'd bring every man and woman
in all my factories out on strike.

582
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,615
Yes.

583
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,296
Do you have a whistle?

584
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,936
If so, blow it.

585
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,890
I thought at least
we might have a discussion,

586
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,499
as I do with other owners.

587
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,853
I'm not other owners.

588
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,456
No.

589
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,456
You believe because coal is expensive
and it's been a cold winter

590
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,736
and because wages have been
cut over the past twelve months,

591
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,497
you think because of all that
nobody will walk out on strike,

592
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,139
because no one can afford to.

593
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,976
And until recently
that would've been true.

594
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,531
But something has changed
this past year.

595
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:00,300
Cold winter in the east,
people are not afraid anymore.

596
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,977
I have it on very good authority

597
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,019
that the Bolsheviks couldn't
organise a fucking picnic.

598
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,139
You know, Mr Shelby...

599
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,856
It's almost as if you want trouble.

600
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,529
If the rule of law
in Birmingham were to break down

601
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,172
during this period
of turmoil for my family,

602
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,970
then yes, that would
indeed have its benefits

603
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,779
for reasons you could not understand.

604
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,214
I've heard rumours.

605
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,013
Sport between men.

606
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,980
Just blow your fucking whistle, eh?

I did say this would happen.

Who's next?

618
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:12,858
Um, he's a, a delegate from
the European Council for Trade.

619
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,133
He's here to talk about
the import of car parts to France.

620
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,695
- Right.
- He's come all the way from Paris,

621
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,937
but given the circumstances
I could send him away?

622

Given what circumstances? Send him in.

623
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:54,772
Mr Shelby, this is
Monsieur Paz from Paris.

624
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,019
I heard you had trouble.

625

It's good of you to see me.

You know Paris?

628
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,257
I left Paris in a cattle truck.

629
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,453
They said you were French.

630
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:32,220
Well, I came here from Paris.

631
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,532
That does not mean I'm French.

632
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,339
Guess where I'm from.

633
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,334
Well, in my cattle truck in Paris...

634
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:58,974
There were American
soldiers who played cards.

635
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,454
They sound like you.

Yeah. Did you win?

You didn't come on a train. Your suit
is pressed, your shoes are clean.

Where do you get your suits made?

639

I have a tailor in New York City.

00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,096
Look.

641
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,857
Funacci, Italian.

642
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,539
He's my uncle.

643
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,010
He makes suits in
the basement of Madge Street.

644
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,174
He is my uncle,

645
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,213
so every stitch, stitched with blood.

646
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,451
I heard you dress well, Mr Shelby,

647
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,860
but now I see...

648
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,139
not so well as me.

649
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,132
You know, I have uncles as well...

650
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,691
But they're not the sort of men who
would, who would work in a basement

651
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,139
with a needle and thread,

652
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,529
Mr Changretta.

653
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,180
I am surprised how easy it was
to get into a room with you.

654
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,210
And now?

655
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,651
And now?

656
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,852
And now you should know

657
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,973
that during the trouble you
had earlier on your factory floor

658
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:57,333
I sent an accomplice
into your office in overalls.

659
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,980
He found your gun...

660
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,014
and unloaded it.

661
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,060
Arthur Shelby.

662
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,497
Polly Gray.

663
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,820
Michael Gray.

664
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,414
John Shelby.

665
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,814
Spent.

666
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,532
Ada Thorne.

667
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,932
And finally...

668
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,979
Tommy Shelby.

669
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,498
None of you will survive.

670
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,380
You're level of security is pitiful

671
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:12,730
and we are an organisation
of a different dimension.

672
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,014
I could've killed you when
I walked through the door.

673
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,774
But you see...

674
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,012
I want you to be the last.

675
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:33,293
I want you to be alive after
your entire family is dead

676
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,496
'cause my mother says

677
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,849
that is what will hurt you the most.

678
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:47,897
You people have
traditions of honour, as do we.

679
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:57,020
Instead of sending you a black hand,
I could've had you killed in the night.

680
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,493
I don't know why...

681
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,609
But I want you to know why

682
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:17,899
and I wanna suggest to you that
we fight this vendetta with honour.

683
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,973
No civilians, no children.

684
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,533
No police.

685
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,773
Welcome to Birmingham, Mr Changretta.

686
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,254
<i>Grazie.</i>

687
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,411
<i># Where the road is dark</i>

688
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:57,093
<i># And the seed is sown
Where the gun is cocked... #</i>

689
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:01,379
Ah, that smell. I miss it.

690
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,059
What, the shithouse?

691
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,580
No. I don't know what it is.

692
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:13,137
Birmingham, I suppose. Small Heath.

693
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:18,171
- That smell.
- The smell brings it back.

694
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,219
Where'sJohn do you think, Tom?

695
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,940
Fuck knows.

696
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,971
Well, he's gone, though.

697
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,779
Like a hole behind your head.

698
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,211
Thought you thought
there was are heaven.

699
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:37,495
No. More like hell for ourJohn.

700
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,420
No, neither one.

701
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,413
He's just not here anymore.

702
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,092
<i># Now I been out in the desert</i>

703
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,690
<i># Just doin' my time</i>

704
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,570
<i># Searchin' through the dust</i>

705
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,131
<i># Lookin' for a sign</i>

706
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,617
<i># If there's a light up ahead... #</i>

707
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,499
It's like with Grace, Arthur...

708
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,940
They're just gone,

709
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,219
just fucking gone.

710
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,890
<i># I got this fever burnin '
in my soul #</i>

711
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:47,372
<i># On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man #</i>

712
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:51,574
<i># In a dusty black coat
with a red right hand #</i>
