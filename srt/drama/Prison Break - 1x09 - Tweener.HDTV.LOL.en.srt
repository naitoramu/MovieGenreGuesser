1
00:00:02,232 --> 00:00:04,374
Think of this place
like a map of the U.S.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,040
Our cell over there--
that's New York City.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,332
The infirmary, our exit--
that's California.

4
00:00:09,507 --> 00:00:12,057
The pipes beneath our feet,
they're connected to...

5
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,213
- Route 66.
- Our ticket out of here.

6
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:16,489
Route 66 runs directly
beneath that building.

7
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:19,178
It's the only building sitting
on top of those tunnels.

8
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,066
All we got to do is
get in there on P.I.

9
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:24,198
and dig ourselves an on-ramp.

10
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,954
- Which one?
- Right there.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,301
This goes down four feet,
connects to the main line below.

12
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:31,798
All we've got to
do is widen it,

13
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:34,535
and we've got ourselves
an on-ramp to Route 66.

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,067
I'm going to find out,
you know--

15
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:37,678
what it is you're
doing up there.

16
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,258
You told me that you had
been up in the crawl space

17
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:42,370
for P.I., and...

18
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,072
P.I. was never
assigned to go there.

19
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:48,404
We got you a little
get-well gift.

20
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:50,285
What's your name?

21
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,359
There was an explosion.

22
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:55,591
Gas line.
Everyone inside was killed.

23
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:57,553
The people we're dealing with
won't stop until we're dead.

24
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,815
We can't hide forever.

25
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:01,446
How about that kid,
the one they say killed his parents?

26
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:02,916
- Oh, they got him.
- They did?

27
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:03,797
He's in custody.

28
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,996
I know what you look like,
you son of a bitch!

29
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:07,163
Philly Falzone.

30
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:08,695
Words is there's
someone in here

31
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:10,149
who knows where Fibonacci is

32
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,239
and you're not doing
anything about it.

33
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:20,993
Help me.

34
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,322
Please.

35
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:36,807
You'll have to forgive my boy.

36
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:42,703
He has the, uh, propensity to be a
bit gregarious when he shouldn't be.

37
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,643
Fraternizing in the prison shower.
Come on.

38
00:01:46,783 --> 00:01:48,780
Maybe you ought to
cut the kid a break.

39
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:52,722
You wouldn't be meddling in my
affairs now, would you, Scofield?

40
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:54,703
You can't be that stupid.

41
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,627
Not when I'm so fully
invested in your affairs.

42
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:05,402
What's between you and him...

43
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:07,780
is between you and him.

44
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:10,626
That's what I thought you said.

45
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:23,936
You've got to help me.

46
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:34,161
You've got to help me.

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,560
You're talking to the wrong man.
This is a matter for the police.

48
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,222
This is my son
we're talking about.

49
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:40,631
For God's sake, he's missing.
Do something!

50
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:43,868
You have got to understand,
I am the warden of a prison.

51
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,530
When it comes to the law,
there is absolutely nothing I can do.

52
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:50,334
Whatever happens out there
is out of my jurisdiction

53
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,914
until it comes
through those gates.

54
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:54,276
It just did. Let me out.

55
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,355
What?

56
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:56,489
Let me find him.

57
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:58,820
I know how he thinks.
I know where he'd run.

58
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,971
Burrows, I would've thought that by now,
under the circumstances,

59
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:04,539
you'd understand your position
as a death row inmate.

60
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,903
There is no way I can
honor that request.

61
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,224
That ain't true.

62
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:09,504
You got the power.

63
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:12,852
In case of a family emergency, you
can grant an inmate supervised leave.

64
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:15,496
Your son is a prime suspect
in a double homicide.

65
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:33,535
Hey!

66
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:37,467
What do you think
this is, siesta?

67
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:40,355
You see that?
See my face up there?

68
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:42,233
Any idea how it got there?

69
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,731
Work ethic.

70
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:47,445
Those two words mean
anything in your country?

71
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:50,332
You're on PI.
Quit slow-walking me.

72
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:53,940
I'm not going to warn you again.
What are you looking at?

73
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,592
Bulls find this stuff,
they'll know we're digging.

74
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:30,972
That's why we got
to get rid of it...

75
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,670
one piece at a time.

76
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,464
Freshmen.

77
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:31,969
Best put on a jail face, BG.

78
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:33,591
These crabs see you puckerin',

79
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:35,638
they gonna bitchify
you in a heartbeat.

80
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:03,903
Looks like I got to find
something else to call you now.

81
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:04,930
Why is that?

82
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:08,723
'Cause you ain't a fish no more. You
ain't the newest con in the tank no...

83
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:58,154
I could've done something.

84
00:06:58,367 --> 00:06:59,122
No.

85
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,600
T-Bag had his hooks in that kid.
There was nothing you could've done.

86
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,976
I could've told the pope.

87
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,798
He could've transferred the kid
to AdSeg. He would've been safe.

88
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:12,064
Go easy, Michael.
You didn't even know him.

89
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:14,712
That makes it okay?

90
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,823
I turned my back on him

91
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,467
because I didn't want to make waves.
It was just...

92
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:22,514
easier...

93
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,022
to look the other way...

94
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,340
keep the plan safe.

95
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,474
And you did.

96
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:31,560
But at what price?

97
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:33,936
That's not how she raised us.

98
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,289
A man's down,
you give him your hand.

99
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,320
She'd roll over in her grave
if she knew what I'd become.

100
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,882
No, she wouldn't.

101
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:45,888
You've  given me
your hand, Michael.

102
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:49,285
My son's out there with
a bull's-eye on his back.

103
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:54,488
Do whatever you got to do to
get us out of here, please.

104
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:38,834
What are you doing?

105
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:42,338
I was just looking
for some coffee.

106
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,296
Yeah, there isn't any.

107
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:48,572
They belonged to my father,
if you were wondering.

108
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:51,468
How long they been in there?

109
00:08:52,202 --> 00:08:54,284
I  don't know, five years.

110
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:01,939
You know, Veronica,
we've been through a lot, and, uh,

111
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,804
I'm freaking out here
as much as you are.

112
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,324
But you get this look in
your eyes sometimes like...

113
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:07,778
like I'm the bad guy.

114
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:09,860
I don't know who you are, Nick.

115
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,778
You just magically show up like
some knight in shining armor,

116
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:14,261
ready to save the day...

117
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,554
You know, I... I think you seem
to be forgetting something here.

118
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:19,536
I'm in the crosshairs
the same way you are,

119
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:20,720
all for your ex-boyfriend,

120
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,763
who, unlike my father,
is a scumbag criminal

121
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:26,366
who just happens to be in prison
for the one crime he didn't commit.

122
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,237
You know something? I've got enough
of my own crap to deal with.

123
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,074
You want to go, you go.

124
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:49,878
Mind if I lamp with you, Cuzzo?

125
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:51,490
Roll, snowflake.

126
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:53,605
Hey, man, I'm just...

127
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:56,678
I'm just-just new, you know?
I'm lookin' for some homies.

128
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,562
I said roll.

129
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:02,020
What? I... I'm just lawnchin'.

130
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:05,261
Yeah? Well,
lawnch somewhere else, white boy.

131
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:09,313
A'ight, y'all.

132
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:12,560
I'm fittin' to bounce.

133
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:14,540
Peace.

134
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:24,189
Boy's a bit confused
about his pigmentation,

135
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,234
but he sure does have spunk,
doesn't he?

136
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:35,471
Abruzzi?

137
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:37,538
Yeah?

138
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:38,989
What are you doing?

139
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,747
What do you mean,
"What am I doing?"

140
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:46,592
First of the month's
coming up, John.

141
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,052
Yeah, so?

142
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:50,862
I haven't got my monthly.

143
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:54,251
What?

144
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,441
I checked my balance online,
it's looking seriously deficient.

145
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:04,668
Got to be some kind of a mistake,
like an accounting error or...

146
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:06,275
Yeah.

147
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:09,275
Tell Falzone that I don't
stand for "accounting errors."

148
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:12,346
I'm going back into my office
at the end of the day.

149
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,522
Going to check my
balance again.

150
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:17,000
If it's not up to where
it's supposed to be...

151
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:20,904
all these privileges you got,
like running P.I....

152
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,218
they're gone.

153
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,715
Get it done, John.

154
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,392
- Falzone Enterprises.
- Get Philly.

155
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,379
Mr. Falzone's not available.

156
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,805
You tell him it's
John Abruzzi calling.

157
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

158
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:38,863
Well, now you do.

159
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:45,418
I'm sorry,
he's going to have to call you back.

160
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:48,063
What? Hey...

161
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:01,961
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,536
About  before.

163
00:12:05,362 --> 00:12:07,212
Pressure's getting to us,
that's all.

164
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,673
Good news is nobody
can reach us out here.

165
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:12,153
My old man made sure of that.

166
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,352
Never even hooked
up a telephone.

167
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:16,565
Same with the well
and the generator.

168
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:20,487
You know, I used to think he was some
kind of conspiracy theory wacko.

169
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,316
Turns out maybe he was right.

170
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:23,680
I can't stay, Nick.

171
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,650
I got to get back.

172
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,257
He's got less than two weeks.

173
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,213
The old man used to call
this his "serious" tie.

174
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:34,495
He only wore it
when he really...

175
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:36,642
really meant business.

176
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,974
Be dangerous, you know,
showing our faces again.

177
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,000
Not if they're not
looking for us.

178
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:45,307
They think we're dead, right?

179
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:47,367
I know.
How long's that going to last?

180
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:50,109
Got to be quick,
be smart about it.

181
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,588
Way I see it, we're just
going to be running in circles

182
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:55,591
if we think we're going to find
exculpatory evidence before
the execution--

183
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:56,721
proof he didn't do it.

184
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,694
I've gone up against pretty much
every prosecutor in Cook County.

185
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:00,549
A man gets murdered,

186
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,826
the first person they want to talk to
to see who his real enemies were--

187
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:04,850
the wife.

188
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,104
You want to go after
the queen bee herself?

189
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:09,289
Leslie Steadman.

190
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:13,596
Everyone in town knows the old bird
lunches at the Lexington every day.

191
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:19,526
With the society set.

192
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:24,703
Hey. Hey! Hey!

193
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:26,225
Hey, slow it down.

194
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,307
Slow it down!

195
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:28,679
Easy, my man.

196
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:30,243
You're going to give us away.

197
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,174
Bull's coming.

198
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:39,847
Let's move.
Hurry up, guys. Move it!

199
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,083
Everybody out.

200
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:47,288
What?

201
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:49,905
I said, everybody out! Now.

202
00:13:58,141 --> 00:13:59,184
Move it!

203
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:03,661
Where are we going?

204
00:14:03,737 --> 00:14:04,937
Down there. Around the corner.

205
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,545
And don't move a damn
muscle till I come get you.

206
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:09,000
Go.

207
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,029
What the hell's going on?

208
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:20,560
We're so bad, aren't we?

209
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:22,929
Damn skimpy. Let's go.

210
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,636
You got to give us more
of a warning next time.

211
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,668
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:32,559
He just showed up.

213
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,718
Oh, we're going to get caught.

214
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:39,124
- By who?
- By the warden.

215
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:42,936
Baby, right now, in this room...
at this moment...

216
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:46,268
I... am the warden.

217
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:47,585
Say it.

218
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:48,735
No, I'm not going to say it.

219
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:50,428
Come on, baby. Say it.

220
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:52,638
Say it, baby. Come on!

221
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:53,945
You're the warden, Louis!

222
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,847
The sneaky son of a bitch.

223
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:13,871
You think he found the hole?

224
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:20,597
Another inch and
he'd have found it.

225
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,102
We need to find something
to cover this hole ASAP.

226
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:28,734
Broke? What do you mean broke?

227
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,753
The C-Corp.

228
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,127
The investment accounts.

229
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,571
Even the offshore stuff,
Caymans, Bermuda.

230
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,065
Philly Falzone
liquidated everything.

231
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:40,811
Hey, I told you
from the beginning

232
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,719
what would happen
if you screwed me.

233
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:45,364
And I heeded it.

234
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:48,927
That's why I warned you from the get-go
not to give Philly power of attorney.

235
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:50,707
We had that
conversation, remember?

236
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,477
Look, the only real
funds you have left

237
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:57,381
are the 30,000 in your
wife's pocket account.

238
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:59,328
-  Now, I could...
- Don't...

239
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,849
Don't touch that.

240
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:02,938
Nobody touches that but her.

241
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,237
What do I tell her?
You know, about all of this?

242
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,046
Don't tell her anything. Okay?

243
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:11,509
The statements
are going to come.

244
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:14,409
- She's going to know.
- Hey, I told you...

245
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:21,701
Don't... tell... her. Right?

246
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,242
Is that a problem?

247
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:27,468
Okay, John.

248
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:31,356
You know where to contact me
if you need anything else.

249
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:33,123
The same goes for you.

250
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:45,613
Hey.

251
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:47,878
Hey!

252
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:52,839
Philly.

253
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,253
How are you?

254
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:56,846
So good to see you.

255
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,409
For you,
the answer is always yes, Philly.

256
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:00,916
Sit down.

257
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,334
Sit down.

258
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:07,028
Come on, John.

259
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:15,865
Looks like there's no record of
a Fox River Medical Practice

260
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:18,839
on our list of
participating HMOs or PPOs.

261
00:17:18,978 --> 00:17:21,185
Okay, that's because we're
a state penitentiary,

262
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:24,120
and we're actually in kind
of a unique situation here.

263
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:28,365
Mr. Scofield's insurance policy from
his previous employer hasn't lapsed yet.

264
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,418
For that reason,
the state's demanding that

265
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:33,019
you pay for his treatment
and not the taxpayers.

266
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:37,501
Okay... Well, it says here he
already met his deductible...

267
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:38,301
Okay.

268
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:42,573
Oh, no, wait, that's his psych
deductible, not his medical.

269
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,135
Sorry, "psych" as
in "psychiatric"?

270
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:54,979
I give you permission
to call to Philly?

271
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:57,449
Hey, I asked you
a question, man.

272
00:17:57,865 --> 00:17:59,724
Listen, there, uh...

273
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:01,629
there's been a restructuring.

274
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,571
This comes from Philly himself.

275
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:07,458
You  couldn't
deliver Fibonacci...

276
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:09,651
so I'm The Man in here now.

277
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:11,086
Hey, jelly wad...

278
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,265
run to the commissary,
get me a bag of chips,

279
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:15,165
we'll pretend this
never happened, right?

280
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,221
Yeah, I'm telling you, John.

281
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:19,667
the sooner you face these facts,
the better off we will all be.

282
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,997
I could kill you
in a heartbeat.

283
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:29,975
Somehow I doubt that.

284
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:34,348
The sooner you face facts,
the better off we will all be.

285
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,520
You're yesterday's news, John.

286
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:51,844


287
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:54,334
What's the word, brother man?
You all cooking brownies or what?

288
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:55,937
Act your race, milk chicken.

289
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:58,937
What's your deal, yo?
You got tough buckets or somethin'?

290
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,777
You're a disgrace to your skin,
you know that?

291
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,244
The boy just slipped.

292
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,246
The boy just slipped.

293
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:10,326
Ain't that right?

294
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:14,041
Come on, stand up.

295
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:17,503
All right, cons,
back to your cells. Go!

296
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,569
What's your name, boy?

297
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:32,203
Who's that?

298
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,386
Shearing.

299
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,243
Shearing, you've heard
about my kid, right?

300
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:37,940
Take the tray, Linc.

301
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:39,114
I, uh...

302
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:42,359
I just need to call him.

303
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:44,935
Just...

304
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,251
take the tray,

305
00:19:46,345 --> 00:19:49,745
or I'm going to shove it in there
and you can eat it off the ground.

306
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,770
You had a son.

307
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:57,845
Josh.

308
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:00,596
Don't do anything stupid, Linc.

309
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,144
I'm not, I...

310
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:06,406
I just want to ask you a question
then I'm going to let go.

311
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:10,587
What if it were, Josh?

312
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,809
What if it were your son?

313
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:18,145
Please.

314
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:04,685
- Dad?
- LJ. Thank God.

315
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:05,958
Are you all right?

316
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:08,823
No. I'm nowhere near it.

317
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:10,778
What do you mean?
Where are you?

318
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,263
What they're saying about me--
it's not true.

319
00:21:14,346 --> 00:21:15,356
I know it's not true.

320
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:18,197
They-They killed her.
They killed her. They...

321
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,621
Right in front of me,
right in front of my eyes, man...

322
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:22,568
- You got to... you got to...
- Why are they doing this?

323
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:25,373
Listen, listen, you got to step up.
You got to be the man now.

324
00:21:25,403 --> 00:21:28,033
You understand me?
You understand me, LJ?

325
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:29,233
Y eah.

326
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:30,595
Okay, I want you
to call Veronica.

327
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,825
Her number is disconnected.
I already tried.

328
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:37,087
Nick Savrinn. You call Nick Savrinn,
works for Project Justice.

329
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:39,848
You call him once we're done.
You got it?

330
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:41,484
Nick Savrinn.

331
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:44,988
Okay. Okay, I'll call.
I'll call.

332
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:50,637
All right then.
It's gonna be all right. Okay?

333
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,484
They're here.

334
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:54,761
Who's here?

335
00:21:55,162 --> 00:21:58,514
LJ? LJ?!

336
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:03,711
Did you hear that?

337
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:06,902
Did you hear it?

338
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:10,342
Do you know what that means?

339
00:23:12,406 --> 00:23:14,904
Why don't you ask your
mom what it means?

340
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:16,266
Oh, I'm sorry.

341
00:23:16,357 --> 00:23:20,007
You might have trouble getting an
answer out of her right about now, huh?

342
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:25,389
LJ?

343
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,698
I saw that.

344
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,540
Just getting connected,
that's all.

345
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:12,728
There she is.

346
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:16,140
Mrs. Steadman?

347
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:19,753
I'm Dick Sisler.
This is my associate, Francette Kelly.

348
00:24:19,783 --> 00:24:22,227
We're with the National
Victims' Rights Association.

349
00:24:22,257 --> 00:24:24,857
We provide assistance for
victims of violent crimes.

350
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:27,379
Gather support for tough-on-crime
political candidates.

351
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:28,486
Bravo.

352
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:31,544
Look, if your organization's
looking for a handout, young man,

353
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:33,110
you can go  through
my business manager.

354
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,190
Ma'am, that is not why we're here.
Actually, may we sit down?

355
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,507
We were hoping you could help us
with one of our more public cases--

356
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:42,074
the Lincoln Burrows case.

357
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:45,056
As you know, he's making unfounded
claims that he's innocent.

358
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:46,841
That others had motive
to murder your husband.

359
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,980
I really don't have time
for a long conversation.

360
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,167
Mrs. Steadman, it doesn't have
to be a long conversation.

361
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:54,967
If we talked about who had motive to
kill Terrence, we'd be here all day.

362
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:57,196
- I'm sorry?
- Look around.

363
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,494
Half the people in this place
were shareholders in his company.

364
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:03,308
Every one of them sat at
my husband's memorial,

365
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:05,763
and every one of them was
thinking the same thing.

366
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:07,586
"Thank God he's gone."

367
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:09,159
Why would they think that?

368
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,485
Money.

369
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:12,486
As soon as rumors of
the indictment started,

370
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:14,716
you should have seen
them run for the exits.

371
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:16,572
I wasn't aware of
any indictment.

372
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:18,954
It never came down.
He died before it could.

373
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:20,432
Have anything to
do with EcoField?

374
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:21,318
Do the math.

375
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,739
CEO of a corporation gets indicted for
fraud, investors start losing money.

376
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:26,194
Lots of money.

377
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:28,250
If I didn't know for sure
Burrows pulled that trigger,

378
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,025
I'd say it was any one of these
people in this restaurant.

379
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:34,116
We're talking half a billion of dollars,
Mr. Sisler.

380
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:36,861
People have killed
for a lot less.

381
00:25:57,992 --> 00:26:01,100
Not a good position you
find yourself in, is it?

382
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:05,732
Whites don't want you,
blacks don't want you.

383
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,400
You're just caught in the middle,
aren't you?

384
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:11,029
A regular Tweener.

385
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:16,249
We're different,
you and me, lot of ways.

386
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:18,612
But, you know,
the funny thing is,

387
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,080
we're also a lot alike.

388
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:26,156
Couple of dogs with runny
noses that nobody loves.

389
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:32,475
How's that knee, by the way?

390
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:34,112
What the hell you doin'?

391
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:36,842
No. No, no, no. Don't get me wrong.
I'm just a friend.

392
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,139
Yeah, a fruity friend.
I don't need none of that.

393
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:40,369
- Easy now.
- No, no, no.

394
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:42,893
You think you gettin' up in this,
you got another think comin',

395
00:26:42,923 --> 00:26:44,060
you homo.

396
00:26:47,618 --> 00:26:49,418
You got a foul mouth,
you know that?

397
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:54,070
Yeah, I do, and you come near me again,
I'm gonna kill you.

398
00:26:57,594 --> 00:27:00,388
Well, then, you're just gonna have to,
little man.

399
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:08,316
You got to sleep with
one eye open, girlie.

400
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:10,154
- Bring it on, bitch.
- Oh, I'm gonna.

401
00:27:10,184 --> 00:27:11,642
I'm gonna bring
it on in spades.

402
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,627
Maybe you ought to
leave the kid alone.

403
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:17,991
And maybe you're in no position to
be telling me my business, hmm?

404
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:20,610
That's what I thought.

405
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:28,811
I'm sure you can understand my
reluctance to discuss past patients.

406
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:30,319
Absolutely.

407
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:33,797
Uh, my understanding is that under
HIPAA, we're allowed to
share information

408
00:27:33,827 --> 00:27:36,703
as long as it furthers
the care of the patient.

409
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:41,227
I'm not accustomed to making
inquiries like this, but, I, uh...

410
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:45,835
I feel like I can
get through to him.

411
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,866
I can help him.

412
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:50,319
I imagine he needs it in there.

413
00:27:50,413 --> 00:27:51,763
What did you treat him for?

414
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:55,307
Well, Michael suffered
from a couple of things.

415
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:58,368
One was a condition called
low-latent inhibition.

416
00:27:58,852 --> 00:28:00,952
I'm sorry.
I'm not familiar with the term.

417
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:04,622
Well, people who suffer
from low-latent inhibition

418
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:07,834
see everyday things
just like you or I do.

419
00:28:07,926 --> 00:28:09,508
Like this lamp, for instance.

420
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:13,332
But where we just process
the image of a lamp,

421
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,961
they process everything.

422
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:19,727
The stem, the bulb, the bolts,
even the washers inside.

423
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:24,458
Their brains are more open to incoming
stimuli in the surrounding environment.

424
00:28:25,614 --> 00:28:27,284
Other people's brains--

425
00:28:27,446 --> 00:28:28,700
yours and mine--

426
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:30,503
shut out the same information.

427
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:32,985
We have to do it in
order to keep our sanity.

428
00:28:33,906 --> 00:28:37,210
If someone with a low IQ
has low-latent inhibition,

429
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:40,420
it almost always results
in mental illness.

430
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:44,070
But if someone has a high IQ,

431
00:28:44,443 --> 00:28:47,034
it almost always results
in creative genius.

432
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:52,107
Do you think
Michael's a genius?

433
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:54,313
Well, I think

434
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:56,956
that word's been derogated
in the media these days,

435
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:00,866
but in the classic sense of the word,
yes, I do.

436
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:06,166
You said there was something
else you treated him for.

437
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:09,980
He came to me with absolutely
no sense of self-worth.

438
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:13,579
The loss of both parents very
often does that to a child.

439
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:16,245
But with the
low-latent inhibition,

440
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:18,894
something interesting
happened to Michael.

441
00:29:19,506 --> 00:29:22,949
He became very attuned to
all the suffering around him.

442
00:29:23,313 --> 00:29:25,407
He couldn't shut it out.

443
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,841
He became a rescuer,

444
00:29:28,003 --> 00:29:32,303
one of those people who are more
concerned with other people's welfare
than their own.

445
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:35,479
I didn't know all
this about him.

446
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:39,155
Then maybe you don't
know Michael Scofield.

447
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:41,609
Yeah.

448
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:54,819
Oh, Tweener

449
00:29:55,076 --> 00:30:00,871
I... I'm a-comin' I'm a-comin'

450
00:30:01,473 --> 00:30:08,661
Oh, my Tweener Oh, Tweener,
I'm a-comin' for you

451
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:15,388
I'm a-comin', comin' for you

452
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:16,942
Is you ready?

453
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:18,191
Are you ready?

454
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:20,819
However you want to say,
I don't care

455
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,820
I'm comin' for you

456
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:39,140
I'm comin', comin',
I'm comin' I'm comin' for you.

457
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:01,884
Checking my voicemail at work.

458
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:06,313
Lincoln's son LJ just
left me a message.

459
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:07,715
He's in trouble.

460
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:21,464
Hello?

461
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:23,801
LJ, it's Veronica.
Where are you?

462
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:27,421
Oh, Veronica, I don't know.
You got to come get me.

463
00:31:27,475 --> 00:31:30,525
We can't, okay? We're not in Chicago.
You have to come to us.

464
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:33,357
All right. Where's that?

465
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,678
Oh. Oh.

466
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:39,869
How the hell do they
know where I am?

467
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,005
What's going on?

468
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:42,762
How the hell do they
know where I am?

469
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:43,899
LJ...

470
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:45,787
LJ, I want you to listen to me.

471
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:47,895
You don't understand.
Everywhere I go, they're there.

472
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:49,575
I want you to
listen to me, okay?

473
00:31:49,612 --> 00:31:52,313
I need you to come to us.
We're in Lake Mercer.

474
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:53,222
Where's that?

475
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,579
It's a small town. It's on the Iowa
border. There's a bus station.

476
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,769
Buy a ticket,
and we'll meet you there.

477
00:31:57,894 --> 00:31:59,196
They're still alive.

478
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:02,329
Looks like a bird in the
hand just became three.

479
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:04,568
Let's go.

480
00:32:05,228 --> 00:32:07,220
- But the kid's right...
- Let's go.

481
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:13,955
They're leaving.
They're leaving.

482
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,208
LJ, I need to know that you hear me,
okay? Lake Mercer.

483
00:32:17,617 --> 00:32:19,318
Lake Mercer, okay.

484
00:32:19,683 --> 00:32:21,691
All right, bye.

485
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:53,672
What the hell are you doing?

486
00:32:56,482 --> 00:32:59,437
Delivering yesterday's news.

487
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,434
Your bus leaves from depot
six in just a few minutes.

488
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:12,713
Thanks.

489
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:54,747
I, uh...
Uh, just wanted you to know

490
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,151
that if you're looking for someone to
talk to in here, you're not alone.

491
00:33:58,181 --> 00:34:02,343
It's part of my job to counsel inmates
and help them with their problems.

492
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:04,849
I think I have things
pretty well figured out.

493
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:09,509
I sort of backed into some
information about you.

494
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:12,783
I hope you don't mind.

495
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,877
But you have to understand that
there's a reason I became a doctor.

496
00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:17,809
It's in my nature
to want to help.

497
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:23,034
From what I understand,
it's in your nature, too.

498
00:34:23,673 --> 00:34:26,373
You did a lot of good things
before you were in here--

499
00:34:26,386 --> 00:34:29,457
a lot of community work,
a lot of charity work.

500
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,637
What happened?

501
00:34:36,182 --> 00:34:41,167
The man you're talking about died the
moment I stepped inside these walls.

502
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,376
All right.

503
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:26,810
Ladies and gentlemen,
United States Secret Service.

504
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:28,708
Please remain calm.

505
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:30,460
Remain where you are.

506
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,490
Hey.

507
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:49,779
Come here.

508
00:36:55,303 --> 00:36:56,383
It's okay.

509
00:36:58,971 --> 00:36:59,867
They're leaving.

510
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,863
Dump the phone, they're tracking you.
We're in New Glarus.

511
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:16,456
You're safe now, all right?

512
00:37:37,414 --> 00:37:39,537
Received communication
from your attorney.

513
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:42,134
Please sign this document,

514
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:45,214
certifying that I inspected the
communication for contraband,

515
00:37:45,282 --> 00:37:48,475
without at any time breaching
attorney-client privilege

516
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,784
by reading the materials
enclosed herein.

517
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:42,766
It's LJ, I'm with Veronica.
I'm okay. I love you.

518
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:55,869
What are you grinning about?

519
00:38:55,899 --> 00:39:00,029
Just the fact that I'm gonna be out on
the real world here in a little bit.

520
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:06,049
The fact that I'm gonna get me one final
piece of tail certainly don't
hurt either.

521
00:39:06,815 --> 00:39:09,852
Nothing like tail,
eh, Scofield?

522
00:39:19,831 --> 00:39:21,314
Son of a bitch!

523
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:23,073
It ends right now.

524
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:26,601
Oh, you just screwed some
major league pooch, Pretty.

525
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:29,642
I'm gonna sing like a whole
tree full of birds now.

526
00:39:29,797 --> 00:39:30,630
Badge!

527
00:39:30,722 --> 00:39:33,252
You want to sing, then sing.

528
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:35,779
But you know what I think?

529
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,184
You don't have the guts.

530
00:39:39,017 --> 00:39:41,649
You want out of here just
as much as the rest of us.

531
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:45,449
We got a problem here?

532
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:51,842
No.

533
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,202
I, uh...

534
00:39:55,758 --> 00:40:00,997
I thought we was, uh,
missing some tools here. My bad.

535
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:05,611
Get back to work.

536
00:40:07,507 --> 00:40:09,225
Now...

537
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:14,419
You and I may be stuck together in this
little dance, but I call the shots.

538
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:17,234
First shot: that kid out there?

539
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:19,854
You don't touch him ever.

540
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:25,007
Do we understand each other?

541
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:37,432
We do.

542
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:40,117
Out of the way, Julio.

543
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:41,994
Abruzzi.

544
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:49,291
You and me,
we got to have a conversation.

545
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:06,381
How come he didn't
fall through?

546
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,576
What?

547
00:41:23,862 --> 00:41:24,813
I warned you.

548
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:28,678
I'll get it together.
You got to give me more time.

549
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:31,810
You've had your time, John.

550
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,475
You tripping on
something, Alice?

551
00:42:02,434 --> 00:42:04,619
Yeah, that's what I thought.

552
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:08,979
Lamp it up in here again,
I'm fittin' to wreck some shop.

553
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:18,991
Uh-oh. We got a problem.

554
00:42:25,637 --> 00:42:26,600
Bellick.

555
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:32,990
Boss? Boss.

556
00:42:33,085 --> 00:42:35,098
What's happening?
What they doing?

557
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:36,508
Fixing the break room.

558
00:42:36,605 --> 00:42:38,087
What are you talking about?

559
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:40,060
That's P.I.

560
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:41,796
I run it.

561
00:42:44,717 --> 00:42:46,233
Not anymore you don't.

562
00:43:04,117 --> 00:43:09,233
