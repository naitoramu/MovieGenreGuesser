1
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:38,625
The ear has fluid,
but it's not infected.

2
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:41,461
If he develops a fever,
or the pain gets worse,

3
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:44,464
call me, and I'll write
a prescription, hmm?

4
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,132
Yes, thank you, Dr. Delgado.

5
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:49,052
- Tell the doctor thank you.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,680
How's Max?

7
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:56,226
He must be turning nine?

8
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,061
Yes, this month.

9
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:05,068
See you tomorrow, Lucía.

10
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:06,361
See you later, Doctor.

11
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:33,596
- Dr. Delgado?
- Yes?

12
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:01,499
- Hurry!
- Let's go!

13
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:13,303
This is a mistake.

14
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:15,889
- I'm not a wealthy man.
- Shut up.

15
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,267
You don't want to do this.

16
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:22,437
I know people.

17
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:24,731
Powerful men.

18
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:28,318
You don't want to mess with them.

19
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:30,444
Yeah.

20
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,614
I bet you do, Doc.

21
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,283
All clear.

22
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:39,463
Turns out, those are just the
assholes we want to talk to you about.

23
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:44,084
You remember this guy? No?

24
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:47,504
Well, we sure as fuck do.

25
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:56,216
Don't move.

26
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:01,572
Jesus. Check this out.

27
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:03,514
Fucking pharmacy in here.

28
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:05,808
I got dibs on anything fun.

29
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,772
This is not right.

30
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:13,691
- Take that shit off.
- It's not right.

31
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,208
The men who killed your agent...

32
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,086
they're all in prison.

33
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,080
Not all of them.

34
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,759
It wasn't what you think.

35
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:44,264
I was brought to the house
where the American was held.

36
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,432
They didn't tell me why.

37
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,394
I had nothing to do with it!

38
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:52,355
I only gave him medical care.

39
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:54,857
And pleaded with them to let him go.

40
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,778
With everything I had, I pleaded!

41
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:07,371
Need him conscious.

42
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,205
Fucker keeps passing out, Doc.

43
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:12,041
Adrenaline will keep him up.
Hold him.

44
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,603
Got this from our buddies at the CIA.

45
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:18,840
See? I told you so.

46
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:21,134
Hey, asshole! Not gonna talk?

47
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:25,263
Wait, hold on.
Let him finish waking up.

48
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,890
Got any cigarettes? I'm out.

49
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:31,352
Go on, Doc.
We're following your lead.

50
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:33,956
That the point where you
plead to let him go, Doc?

51
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:52,332
We've been on you for weeks, Doc.

52
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:56,627
We know what you are.
We know what you did.

53
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:01,257
So I'm not gonna ask you this twice...

54
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,680
unless you want me to blow
the back of your skull

55
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,471
all over that wall over there.

56
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:09,474
Give me a name.

57
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:16,981
The other person on the tape...

58
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:19,567
tell me his name.

59
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:27,533
No, please! No!

60
00:07:57,897 --> 00:07:59,937
Miguel Ángel, what time is it?

61
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:03,361
Very early, darling.

62
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:06,823
Couldn't sleep again?

63
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:09,075
Yeah.

64
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:10,868
Not even a little.

65
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,630
Happy birthday, my love.

66
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,812
I've never fucked
a 40-year-old.

67
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:50,158
Excuse me.

68
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:51,576
Zuno's here, sir.

69
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:53,618
Good.

70
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,456
- Have him wait on the patio, Clavel.
- Got it.

71
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:00,769
I think she needs to be changed.

72
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:01,793
Yes, ma'am.

73
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:11,471
Excited for the party tonight?

74
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:14,098
Sure.

75
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:19,061
Cynthia, I'll take my
coffee on the patio.

76
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:21,105
- Yes, sir.
- Love, wait.

77
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:28,070
Open it.

78
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:30,281
Oh, wow.

79
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:33,117
You don't have that one, right?

80
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:36,954
No, I don't think so.

81
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:39,248
It's very nice.

82
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,834
Put it with the others.

83
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:44,754
Thank you.

84
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:53,846
What's the word on your uncle?

85
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:56,474
Sends his regrets.

86
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:59,435
Turns out he won't be
able to make it tonight.

87
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:01,729
Oh, really.

88
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:03,898
Cabinet meetings.

89
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:07,860
I want three fucking governors tonight.

90
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:12,406
The government is my partner. It
doesn't look good if they're not here.

91
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:15,325
Hey...

92
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:18,412
everybody loves a party.

93
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:20,122
That's good.

94
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,463
The envelope for this
month hasn't arrived yet.

95
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,672
I'll look into it.

96
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:29,674
Usually, it comes first of the month.

97
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:32,343
- People are asking...
- You'll get your money.

98
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:33,426
Like always.

99
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:37,807
But I don't want to
have political problems.

100
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:41,394
The government's shitting
itself over the quake.

101
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:44,146
People know they're being lied to.

102
00:10:46,023 --> 00:10:47,900
They'll get over it.

103
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:50,236
Where else can they go?

104
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:53,489
It's the government.

105
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,078
Life goes on.

106
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:02,123
The past is the past.

107
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:10,673
Yeah. Except when it isn't.

108
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:14,051
The Aztecs thought a lot
about the end of the world.

109
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:15,928
Fuck, who doesn't?

110
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:19,432
They believed the world had
already ended four times.

111
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:22,295
Once in darkness, once with a hurricane,

112
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:25,730
once in fire, and once in a flood.

113
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:28,229
And they were pretty sure they knew

114
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,900
how it was going to end the next time.

115
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,866
On September 19th, 1985,

116
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:40,286
an earthquake measuring
8.1 hit Mexico City.

117
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:42,747
Entire neighborhoods collapsed.

118
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:45,625
The government claimed
6,000 people died.

119
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,920
Community activists put the
death toll closer to 35,000.

120
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:53,799
It looked like a fucking
bomb had hit Mexico City.

121
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:57,011
People dug through
rubble with bare hands,

122
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:58,596
searching for loved ones.

123
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:01,320
When the army showed up,
folks figured...

124
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,517
Great. Here comes the cavalry.

125
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:08,606
But instead of searching for
survivors, the soldiers just watched.

126
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:11,692
Their only order?
Prevent looting.

127
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:13,819
A week after the quake,

128
00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:18,741
thousands of protesters hit the
streets, demanding water, electricity,

129
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:20,159
some fucking answers.

130
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:23,412
And when all the government
gave them was more bullshit,

131
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:26,415
they started wondering if it
wasn't time for Mexico to move on

132
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:28,918
from decades of one-party PRI rule.

133
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:32,713
Maybe the quake wasn't the
Armageddon the Aztecs predicted,

134
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:35,257
but the PRI's shitty
response to the crisis

135
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,009
created an opposition movement.

136
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,305
And one day, that would come
back to bite them in the ass.

137
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:46,602
Just 'cause things have stopped shaking

138
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:49,150
doesn't mean there isn't
some serious structural damage

139
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,273
underneath the surface.

140
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,881
Don't forget these.

141
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:19,969
Fuck you.

142
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:22,471
Enjoy your trip up north.

143
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:25,474
Call me when it's done.

144
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:27,017
What happens if we get pulled over?

145
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:29,937
Don't get pulled over.

146
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:11,103
Miss Isabella, how are you?

147
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:13,230
The boss is expecting you.

148
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:15,107
Lead the way.

149
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:16,692
Careful not to slip.

150
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,277
Wait here.

151
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:43,928
Business looks good.

152
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,138
Everything looks good.

153
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:51,310
I just wish we were meeting
somewhere more comfortable.

154
00:14:52,228 --> 00:14:54,021
This is where our business is done.

155
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:57,316
Please.

156
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:07,785
Ramón!

157
00:15:10,204 --> 00:15:11,497
'Mon!

158
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:13,332
Let's go!

159
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,296
- All our stuff's broken down?
- Yeah, boss, ready to move.

160
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:24,093
How long am I gonna have to look
at this Sinaloan shit, Néstor?

161
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:25,405
Haven't heard anything

162
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:27,180
since they dropped
it off a few days ago.

163
00:15:27,263 --> 00:15:30,140
Maybe Héctor Palma
forgot how a phone works.

164
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:33,936
I mean, if I left 618 kilos
in someone else's warehouse,

165
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:37,356
I'd show a little more courtesy.

166
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:38,858
You counted it.

167
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:40,693
You didn't?

168
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:42,486
Take that shit somewhere else.

169
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:47,449
Maybe using our plaza
isn't enough, Benjamín.

170
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,119
We're supposed to move
it for them now too.

171
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:54,039
Put it somewhere else, Néstor.

172
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,500
Just get it out of the fucking way.

173
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:57,584
Yes, boss.

174
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:01,797
You ready for tonight?

175
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:02,882
Yeah.

176
00:16:03,757 --> 00:16:04,957
Know what you're going to say?

177
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,511
Yes, Enedina, I know
what I'm going to say.

178
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:09,555
It's important, Benjamín.

179
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,142
Our family is losing money every day.

180
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:15,305
We're getting fucked, and
it needs to be dealt with.

181
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:18,272
Well...

182
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:21,066
I just hope we're sending
the right person to handle it.

183
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,404
Ramón!

184
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,617
Don't wake up Mom when you get home.

185
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:34,079
- And don't let him drink too much.
- Anything else, Enedina?

186
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:36,916
- No.
- No.

187
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:40,919
Hey, 'Dina.

188
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:46,175
You look so handsome.

189
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:47,968
- Have fun tonight.
- Yeah.

190
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:49,136
Hey, man.

191
00:16:49,553 --> 00:16:50,721
What?

192
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:51,931
It's for the drive.

193
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:54,642
Tonight is business.
I need you to be cool.

194
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:55,893
I'm always cool, you be cool.

195
00:16:57,144 --> 00:16:58,729
Lighten up a little.

196
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:02,900
Let's go then.

197
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:17,456
Hit the horn again, Güero.

198
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:22,419
Hey, man!

199
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:25,339
When we get there, we need to check
on the boss's birthday present.

200
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:27,383
- The guy called me, it's already there.
- Good.

201
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:30,135
Everything's cool. We got it a room.

202
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:33,055
A fucking hotel, Cochi?

203
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:34,390
Sure, why not?

204
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:40,145
Your blessing, Ma.

205
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,191
May God bless and take care
of you. Be safe, my son.

206
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:48,696
- Have fun.
- Climb in, motherfucker.

207
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:51,991
- Hello, Mrs. Guzmán!
- Hello, ma'am.

208
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:53,325
What the fuck's that?

209
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,953
Trying to get your dick sucked or what?

210
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:57,830
Fuck off. Let me pack this in.

211
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,207
You know we were bringing wives?

212
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:01,917
Fucking Güero.

213
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,628
True love, Cochi.

214
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:11,260
Hey, Güero.

215
00:18:11,343 --> 00:18:12,803
Fucking Chapo.

216
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:13,887
Hey, Guadalupe.

217
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:24,898
It's Amado.

218
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:26,357
What happened?

219
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,750
What do you mean nothing?

220
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,030
I've been waiting like
an idiot at the airport.

221
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:31,488
Where's Acosta?

222
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:36,035
Fuck. He isn't coming?

223
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,335
He's the boss.
How does that look?

224
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,214
Asshole.

225
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,970
Hey, let's go now.

226
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:58,908
Next.

227
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:06,648
I just need my...
tourist visa renewed.

228
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:14,823
One moment, sir.

229
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:22,206
Next.

230
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:24,041
Please come forward.

231
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:35,219
Through this door.
Passport office downstairs.

232
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:37,315
By definition,

233
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:40,224
drug trafficking
networks are conspiracies.

234
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:44,061
So rolling them up?
That's basically DEA 101.

235
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:47,564
You start by taking whatever
junior varsity dipshit you can

236
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:48,690
off the street.

237
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:50,776
Then use leverage.

238
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,862
Double digit prison
sentences usually do the trick

239
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:56,615
and get him to flip on the
next asshole up the ladder.

240
00:19:57,074 --> 00:20:00,494
That was essentially the
Operation Leyenda playbook too.

241
00:20:00,577 --> 00:20:04,915
Put guys in custody, get them
talking, and move up the chain.

242
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,335
Except, this being Mexico,

243
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:10,546
we couldn't actually arrest anyone.

244
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,257
And if you want to be a lawyer about it,

245
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,426
the whole fucking thing
was probably illegal.

246
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:19,138
Come.

247
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:24,101
Afternoon, Walt.

248
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:25,435
Mike, can you step out?

249
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:45,413
So?

250
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:48,167
The doctor's taking a trip.

251
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,753
- There wasn't any trouble?
- Nah.

252
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:52,838
No, sir.

253
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:55,174
Clean. Clockwork.

254
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:58,218
He's gonna be a big hit
at L.A. County lockup.

255
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:05,100
This name Delgado gave you...
Captain Sergio Verdín?

256
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:06,852
Camarena's torturer.

257
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:08,228
Ex-DFS.

258
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:10,397
Whoever hired him can
put a name in the hat

259
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,649
that connects Félix
Gallardo and Mexico City.

260
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:14,985
Guy's an active duty
intelligence officer.

261
00:21:15,944 --> 00:21:17,400
Grabbing him's not gonna be as easy

262
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,200
as throwing a hood
over some pediatrician.

263
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:21,116
No one knows we're here.

264
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:25,037
Sooner or later, the
doctor's gonna be missed.

265
00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:30,209
When do you want to move?

266
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:33,295
Next 24 hours, 36 max.

267
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:35,172
Jesus Christ.

268
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:38,549
Listen,

269
00:21:39,343 --> 00:21:42,137
my guys have worked up a solid
plan to grab this asshole.

270
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:45,098
But we have to go now.

271
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,978
Mexico City says the
Camarena case is closed.

272
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:54,199
When what we're doing here comes
to light, there'll be repercussions.

273
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,818
Legal, diplomatic.

274
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,404
It's a good thing we're not diplomats.

275
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:03,075
I don't want you taking
unnecessary risks.

276
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,119
It's my understanding

277
00:22:07,246 --> 00:22:09,039
that you have...

278
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:12,042
experience with this kind of thing.

279
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:16,588
It's a unique situation,

280
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:20,259
but I'm confident that
we can get it done.

281
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,555
And the Mexicans on your team,
you trust them to stay quiet?

282
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:28,725
My guys are solid. All of them.

283
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:30,602
And they know why they're here.

284
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:35,399
You fuck with the DEA, nowhere is safe.

285
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:48,704
Move on Verdín.

286
00:22:51,665 --> 00:22:53,333
- Quietly.
- Yes, sir.

287
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:54,834
Walt.

288
00:22:56,837 --> 00:22:58,255
Do not get fucking caught.

289
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,799
Yes, sir.

290
00:23:16,565 --> 00:23:17,805
What happened?

291
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:19,359
I got the green light.

292
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:24,197
And you told him about our
surveillance on Verdín?

293
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:26,741
Bodyguards, fucked-up
schedule we can't pin down?

294
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:29,536
I mean, I kept it simple.

295
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:35,208
The man thinks we got a plan, so...
let's come up with one.

296
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:43,967
I put you down for two million.

297
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:46,330
That money we're collecting

298
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:49,181
to push those Sandinista
fuckers out of Nicaragua.

299
00:23:51,224 --> 00:23:52,517
Everyone's chipping in.

300
00:23:53,352 --> 00:23:54,728
It's good for business.

301
00:23:58,315 --> 00:23:59,524
Let's hope so.

302
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,320
I've got planes in the
air for you night and day.

303
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:07,032
We're pushing more volume
through Mexico than ever.

304
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:09,368
My problem isn't volume.

305
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,495
It's cash flow.

306
00:24:12,454 --> 00:24:15,415
That bullshit at the border
can't go on forever, right?

307
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,960
He's coming tonight, right?

308
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:21,046
They told me he'll be here.

309
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:22,964
Are you sure?

310
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:24,841
Try to relax.

311
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,849
You want an outsider's opinion?

312
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,479
What you're asking right now...

313
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:39,689
it's a lot,

314
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:42,859
given how things have been going.

315
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:47,155
My people are asking questions.

316
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:50,033
I'm out of time.

317
00:24:51,326 --> 00:24:52,994
I have to talk to him tonight.

318
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:55,747
Good luck.

319
00:25:01,962 --> 00:25:04,423
So, how much did you have in mind?

320
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:06,216
How much have you got?

321
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,053
Two hundred kilos.

322
00:25:10,846 --> 00:25:14,015
That's a lot of powder
for a house party.

323
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,936
What are your plans for it?

324
00:25:21,064 --> 00:25:24,985
I hope you know, anyone can buy merch.

325
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,278
It's easy.

326
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:28,488
What's tricky?

327
00:25:28,572 --> 00:25:30,949
Transportation and distribution.

328
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:34,536
Tell me something I don't know.

329
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:41,793
What will you tell your
friend in Guadalajara?

330
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:44,796
What will you tell your friends in Cali?

331
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,174
Nothing.

332
00:25:49,634 --> 00:25:52,888
You and I are going
to make a lot of money.

333
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:04,858
It's been a pleasure.

334
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,270
Güero.

335
00:26:44,397 --> 00:26:45,397
Amado.

336
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:48,026
- Hey, man.
- Nothing, just hanging.

337
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:50,529
- Lupita, how are you?
- Good, and you, Amado?

338
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:52,280
- All good.
- Where's Acosta?

339
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:54,366
Something came up.

340
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:56,243
- Everything cool?
- Yeah, all good.

341
00:26:56,326 --> 00:26:58,245
- See you inside.
- You got it.

342
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,958
What's up, Chapo?

343
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:05,293
- What's up, Amado?
- Nothing, just here. Hey, Cochi.

344
00:27:05,377 --> 00:27:06,628
Amado.

345
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:08,588
Nice shirt, man.

346
00:27:11,383 --> 00:27:13,093
He carried it here in a bag.

347
00:27:13,176 --> 00:27:16,638
- His mommy ironed it for him.
- Shut up!

348
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:17,721
Let's go.

349
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,544
You hear what we got the boss?

350
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:52,674
Fucking blow your mind, brother.

351
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:55,558
If you want, we can cut you in on it.

352
00:27:56,094 --> 00:27:58,471
Sell you, like... 20, 25%.

353
00:27:58,555 --> 00:28:01,683
Maybe 15, since it was our idea.

354
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:04,102
I'm good, Cochi.

355
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:06,813
- See you around.
- All right.

356
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:14,654
Look at these two motherfuckers.

357
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:18,700
Tijuana pussies made an appearance.

358
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:23,288
Fucking donkeys.

359
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:27,500
If they didn't kiss Félix's ass...

360
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:31,004
they'd starve.

361
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:33,632
For sure.

362
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:52,484
You awake?

363
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:53,568
Let's go!

364
00:29:06,665 --> 00:29:08,792
Put your fucking head down!

365
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,756
That looked like it hurt.

366
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,883
Looks like you got a
live one here, Frank.

367
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,320
I got a feeling there's
a grand jury indictment

368
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:20,804
up in L.A. with his name on it.

369
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:24,224
So long, you motherfucker.
Thanks again, Frank.

370
00:29:24,307 --> 00:29:25,684
Let's get him in the truck.

371
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:28,436
All right, get up.

372
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:41,408
Come in.

373
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:46,246
Zuno's here.

374
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:47,664
With the governors.

375
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:49,791
Stay sharp.

376
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:51,876
They might steal the silverware.

377
00:29:54,504 --> 00:29:57,215
They're asking for you.
Everyone is.

378
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,803
You find out what time his plane lands?

379
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:04,806
Not yet.

380
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:07,392
Do it.

381
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:09,436
Let me know.

382
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:13,064
- The governors...
- I heard you, Azul.

383
00:31:09,913 --> 00:31:11,664
How are you all doing tonight?

384
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:13,750
You came through.

385
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,376
Of course.

386
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,505
- Governor, how are you?
- Hey, how are you?

387
00:31:18,588 --> 00:31:20,131
Nice to finally meet you.

388
00:31:25,412 --> 00:31:26,499
All right, fellas.

389
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,974
Listen up. Here comes our dirtbag.

390
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:40,693
Two bird dogs tag along
carrying Walther PPK's.

391
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:46,616
Same piece Hitler used
to blow his brains out.

392
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:48,076
It's a quality sidearm.

393
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:53,331
Our boys take the service
elevator from the fifth floor

394
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:54,958
down to the parking garage...

395
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,004
where a burgundy Marquis
with Jalisco plates awaits.

396
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:06,094
Nazi gun-packing buddies follow
in a blue LTD. Jalisco plates.

397
00:32:06,177 --> 00:32:07,290
Hey, Walt.

398
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:10,265
Yesterday, some whip-dick was
riding shotgun in Verdín's car.

399
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:11,516
Duly noted.

400
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,976
Everyone got that?

401
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,769
Whip-dick in shotgun.

402
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:20,024
Sal and me will follow the two cars
until they pass Calle Matamoros.

403
00:32:20,817 --> 00:32:24,112
At the intersection of
Constitución and Calle Analco,

404
00:32:24,195 --> 00:32:27,448
Danilo steps up, does his thing,

405
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:30,368
and makes some new friends.

406
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:31,870
Did somebody grab the cement?

407
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:35,707
Yep. Two dozen bags.
Heavy as fuck.

408
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,790
Perfect.

409
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:39,460
Verdín continues north
onto a quiet street

410
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:42,213
with shitty visibility
and one-way traffic,

411
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:46,634
where he comes to a stop.

412
00:32:47,385 --> 00:32:49,470
Hope everyone's wearing seat belts.

413
00:32:49,554 --> 00:32:52,515
Verdín's out of the car
and into the baker's truck.

414
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,892
And we are gone.

415
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,185
Not a goddamn whisper.

416
00:32:57,228 --> 00:32:58,228
Fucking A.

417
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:03,526
This guy tortured a DEA agent.

418
00:33:04,944 --> 00:33:06,404
Tonight, he starts paying for it.

419
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:09,657
Gear up.

420
00:33:36,476 --> 00:33:37,685
Got a light, man?

421
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:40,646
Yeah.

422
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:52,617
Think this shit's gonna work?

423
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,957
You go back with all these gabachos?

424
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,125
Just Walt.

425
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:04,003
A few years.

426
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,965
Me too.

427
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:11,386
Motherfucker. Gets around, huh?

428
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:22,730
Who you with?

429
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:25,525
What kind of badge you carrying?

430
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,195
Used to be MFJP.

431
00:34:30,196 --> 00:34:31,364
Up near Juárez.

432
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,327
Jalisco State Police.

433
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:42,000
Used to be?

434
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:45,753
You retire or something?

435
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:53,761
You writing a book?

436
00:35:06,357 --> 00:35:07,400
Hey, there.

437
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:09,569
This is where all the action is?

438
00:35:10,987 --> 00:35:12,655
Just having some drinks, man.

439
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:16,868
Heard you got the boss
some crazy present.

440
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,704
It's a surprise, man.

441
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:21,789
Wait around a bit,
and we'll bring it out.

442
00:35:21,873 --> 00:35:23,750
Yeah, we'll bring it out later.

443
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:27,086
Who's that?

444
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,714
Clavel, Félix's new guy.

445
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:31,549
Pussy.

446
00:35:40,183 --> 00:35:41,350
What's up, Amado?

447
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:43,853
Hey, man.

448
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,981
What's going on, you hiding from me?

449
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:51,319
Not at all, just admiring the view.

450
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:54,822
How's Juárez?

451
00:35:56,616 --> 00:35:58,868
It's Juárez. You know.

452
00:36:00,578 --> 00:36:02,205
So, what's the deal?

453
00:36:02,288 --> 00:36:03,998
Why isn't Acosta here?

454
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:05,458
He trying to tell me something?

455
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:08,461
No, some shit came up.

456
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:10,755
He sends his best.

457
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,261
I've been thinking, man,

458
00:36:17,345 --> 00:36:20,890
what if I came home
and got back to transpo?

459
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,850
With planes and shit.

460
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:26,312
Acosta's on top of Juárez.
He can handle it.

461
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,356
That's not what I'm hearing.

462
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:32,777
I paid for two new runways
that are still unpaved.

463
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:36,739
The man's respected in his plaza, but...

464
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:39,325
he's old-fashioned.

465
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:41,244
Doesn't see the future.

466
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:44,705
Juárez is very important.

467
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:48,626
Trust me, Amado.

468
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,546
One day, you'll see why.

469
00:36:51,629 --> 00:36:53,297
I need someone I can rely on.

470
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:57,385
If that's not you, let me
know, and I find someone else.

471
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:00,138
We're good.

472
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:07,478
Talked to your uncle?

473
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:10,898
Just a few times.

474
00:37:10,982 --> 00:37:13,109
Says he doesn't want visitors.

475
00:37:15,778 --> 00:37:17,905
If you talk to Neto, tell him...

476
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:20,408
tell him I think about him a lot.

477
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:23,661
Will do.

478
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,832
Hey, testing.

479
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,919
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

480
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:36,174
Some fucking party the
boss put together, no?

481
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:43,764
I'm going to ask you to take a seat
and clear the area a bit, please.

482
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:45,725
Clear that side, please.

483
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,979
We have a very special surprise today.

484
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:55,275
Boss...

485
00:37:57,737 --> 00:37:58,988
Bring it, Chapo!

486
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:25,556
A fucking tiger?

487
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,434
Every jungle needs a king!

488
00:39:10,518 --> 00:39:12,436
Here's to ours.

489
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:15,273
Happy birthday, Miguel Ángel.

490
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:18,818
Your friends from Sinaloa...
salute you.

491
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,779
Happy birthday!

492
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:23,239
Happy birthday!

493
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:24,407
Thank you, Güero!

494
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:26,927
- Best wishes, boss.
- It's a lovely animal.

495
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:28,244
Thank you, everybody!

496
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:30,454
Hit it!

497
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,820
- Miguel Ángel.
- What's up?

498
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:44,593
Where are we going to keep it?

499
00:39:44,677 --> 00:39:47,054
What kind of people give
a wild animal like that?

500
00:39:47,138 --> 00:39:49,432
I know. What can you do?
That's how they are.

501
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:51,434
It's a gift, darling, no big deal.

502
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,645
Wait till they get back to Sinaloa,
and we'll donate it to a zoo.

503
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:56,314
They're endangered, you know?

504
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:58,024
I know.

505
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:02,570
Miguel Ángel.

506
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:04,155
You remember Lupita?

507
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:06,324
- Of course.
- Happy birthday, Miguel Ángel.

508
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:08,868
- Thank you. You look pretty.
- Thank you.

509
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,579
- Amazing gift, man.
- So beautiful, no?

510
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:12,662
Félix...

511
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:15,750
Know what's cool?

512
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:19,420
Look at them in the eye,
they won't fuck with you.

513
00:40:20,129 --> 00:40:23,591
Tigers kill from behind.
By ambush.

514
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:28,012
Dudes in India walk around with
masks tied to the back of their heads,

515
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:30,473
with eyes painted, to keep 'em safe.

516
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:34,727
- What a good idea.
- Yeah, like a second face.

517
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,104
I'll have to get one, right?

518
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:38,898
I should have it on right now.

519
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,192
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

520
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:46,989
That's María?

521
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:50,409
María is the old wife.

522
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:51,744
This is the new one.

523
00:40:52,328 --> 00:40:53,329
Daniela.

524
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:55,539
She doesn't like your gift.

525
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:57,792
After all the trouble you went through.

526
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,210
She doesn't get it, Lupita.

527
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,045
It's a symbol.

528
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,714
Seemed like Félix liked it, right?

529
00:41:07,093 --> 00:41:09,470
- She's a fucking snob.
- Yeah.

530
00:41:10,054 --> 00:41:12,723
- So, anything?
- No.

531
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:13,974
Shit.

532
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:15,142
It's late already.

533
00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:17,144
Find out if his plane landed.

534
00:41:17,228 --> 00:41:18,270
I'll ask.

535
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:21,607
He's coming.

536
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,067
Don't worry.

537
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,276
Let's hope.

538
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:30,157
Heard your new pet ate one of
the peacocks before it came out.

539
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:31,409
What?

540
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:32,660
Just kidding!

541
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:36,789
Miguel Ángel.

542
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:39,333
Happy birthday.

543
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:40,459
Benjamín.

544
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:43,045
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

545
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,298
There someplace we can talk?

546
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,095
I'll see you later.

547
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:53,389
Okay, follow me.

548
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:14,243
Anything yet?

549
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:21,500
Nothing.

550
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,382
No. Stay put.

551
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:35,323
Tijuana's the top
plaza in the federation.

552
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:38,309
We have the best operations,
the best contacts.

553
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,935
We work harder.

554
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:44,440
Right now, Sinaloa moves 20, 30%
of their coke through Tijuana.

555
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,609
Why shouldn't it be moved by my family?

556
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,820
And what about Sinaloa?

557
00:42:49,904 --> 00:42:51,238
What about them?

558
00:42:54,158 --> 00:42:55,743
My family can handle more.

559
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:58,037
My family wants more.

560
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,330
We've earned it.

561
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:03,918
Cash flow is down.

562
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,503
Give us an opportunity.

563
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,385
More money is coming, Benjamín.

564
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:19,767
But, for now, things stay as they are.

565
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,645
All we want is what's ours,
Miguel Ángel.

566
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:31,028
What's yours is also mine, Benjamín.

567
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:34,698
Don't forget that.

568
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,203
Things stay as they are.

569
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:48,963
You had a baby, right?

570
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:51,799
A girl.

571
00:43:54,552 --> 00:43:56,887
Ruth. After her mother.

572
00:43:57,513 --> 00:43:58,973
That's a pretty name.

573
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,100
Congratulations.

574
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:03,727
It's a party.

575
00:44:03,811 --> 00:44:04,812
Come on.

576
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:06,063
Enjoy it.

577
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:27,209
Where the fuck is this guy?

578
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:13,547
- Car's pulling up.
- Really?

579
00:45:13,631 --> 00:45:15,466
- Yeah.
- Good.

580
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,218
It's a nice party.

581
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,890
Every one of these assholes
would put a bullet in my head

582
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:24,767
if they could get away with it.

583
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,642
Cheers!

584
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,269
Thank you all!

585
00:46:16,694 --> 00:46:18,737
Who's the slick dude wearing silk?

586
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:20,489
That's Pacho Herrera,

587
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,157
one of the Cali guys.

588
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:25,494
Probably came up here
to show his respect.

589
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:27,329
Hopefully he brought cash, no?

590
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,832
Fucking Colombians.

591
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,050
What's up?

592
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:45,389
I hear there's a tiger at the party.

593
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:48,684
I would like to touch it.

594
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,562
Watch him eat something.

595
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:53,188
Whatever.

596
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:56,483
That's fine, man.

597
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:59,486
Yeah, okay, it's out back.

598
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,574
Excuse me. It was a pleasure.

599
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:15,878
Lights out.

600
00:47:17,463 --> 00:47:18,881
He's on the move.

601
00:47:18,964 --> 00:47:20,090
Over and out.

602
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:50,621
Thank you for coming.

603
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,584
Means a lot that you made the trip here.

604
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:57,169
That'll be all.

605
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:02,716
I wanted to speak with you in person.

606
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:06,553
About the business.

607
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:08,931
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

608
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,393
Some issues have come up.

609
00:48:14,812 --> 00:48:17,815
We have to adjust the
terms of our arrangement.

610
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,778
$3000 a kilo is our number.

611
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,617
I came all this way so
you could ask for a raise?

612
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,244
It's not like that.

613
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:32,371
No, that's not what I'm getting at.

614
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:33,831
Please, sit.

615
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,965
There's a more pressing issue.

616
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:50,472
You see, we move your
coke over the border,

617
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:54,643
deliver it to whatever
warehouse you ask,

618
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:56,895
and then we wait.

619
00:48:58,397 --> 00:49:00,732
For weeks, sometimes months.

620
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:05,195
The money we're owed
by you, it's adding up.

621
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:12,077
You haven't been working
with coke as long as us.

622
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,372
Maybe you don't understand how it works.

623
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:19,167
Product's easier to move than cash.

624
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:22,921
Weighs less, packs tighter...

625
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,383
Powder is fast, cash is slow.

626
00:49:27,175 --> 00:49:30,053
We always pay our bills though.

627
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:33,015
Yes, I understand.

628
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:37,019
The thing is,

629
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:40,564
your organization owes
us over $200 million.

630
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:42,482
Is that a lot to you?

631
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:45,903
For me, no.

632
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,990
For my people, yes.

633
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,619
See, I control a lot of plazas...

634
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:57,831
and, right now, they're short.

635
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:03,128
I've used my own money
to keep them going.

636
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:08,132
Look...

637
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,469
all the people you see out there...

638
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:13,722
generals, governors...

639
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:15,933
that's Mexico.

640
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:18,685
The neighbors to your biggest customer.

641
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:23,195
Don't get me wrong,

642
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:26,443
I don't want to disrupt what
our organizations have built.

643
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:31,615
But this debt I'm carrying,
it can't go on.

644
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,418
You have a nice house, Miguel Ángel.

645
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,630
Filled with...

646
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:49,925
nice-looking people.

647
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:52,636
Important people.

648
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:55,722
But I wonder...

649
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,477
how many of them tell you the truth.

650
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:10,445
I'm thinking none.

651
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:17,327
So, let me do you the favor
of telling you the truth.

652
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:24,835
Your organization has money trouble
because seizures are up over 40%.

653
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:26,795
Why?

654
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:30,202
Maybe because the DEA

655
00:51:30,203 --> 00:51:33,677
doubled its number of agents
in the last six months.

656
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:38,849
Now, why would that be?

657
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,479
Should I tell you,
or have you guessed?

658
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:50,610
The kidnapping and murder
of an American DEA agent.

659
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,780
Which my partners and I
had nothing to do with.

660
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,409
But if we were asked,

661
00:51:57,492 --> 00:52:00,245
we'd have told whoever
came up with the idea...

662
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:03,707
to put a gun in their mouth
and pull the fucking trigger.

663
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:06,626
'Cause that was bad for business.

664
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:14,092
The consequences of that...

665
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:17,971
are your problem.

666
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:21,892
Not ours.

667
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:26,855
That's the truth, Miguel Ángel.

668
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:31,193
But, hey...

669
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:36,198
if you're having trouble, we
can always send up more product.

670
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:38,575
If you can handle it.

671
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:44,706
Didn't think so.

672
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:49,961
We'll continue to pay you
to transport our cocaine.

673
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,048
In the exact same way we always have.

674
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:55,926
And you'll get your money...

675
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,177
when you get it.

676
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:02,099
If that doesn't work for you,

677
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:05,310
I'm sure we can figure
something else out.

678
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:12,400
And you can go back to doing
whatever it was you were doing

679
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:14,736
before we made you rich.

680
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,203
Happy birthday, Miguel Ángel.

681
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:25,997
Many more.

682
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:01,741
He's leaving already?

683
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:03,743
What did he say?

684
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:07,205
Told me that it's my problem.

685
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:14,421
What about the money they owe us?

686
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:18,633
When they get to it.

687
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:34,232
Félix, at the rate we're going,
we won't last six months.

688
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:38,653
You're right.

689
00:54:39,946 --> 00:54:41,156
We wouldn't.

690
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:44,409
But it won't matter.

691
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:48,705
In six months,
I'll own the Colombians.

692
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:53,168
Those bastards will work for me.

693
00:54:57,505 --> 00:54:59,507
I went on record tonight.

694
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:05,639
I'm going away on business tomorrow.

695
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:10,101
If it goes well, I'll explain
everything when I get back.

696
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:11,811
What do I tell the plazas?

697
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:15,232
They know you were talking to Pacho.

698
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:19,194
Tell them everything is being handled.

699
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:56,356
Coming your way.
Everyone in position.

700
00:56:02,153 --> 00:56:03,154
Copy that.

701
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:15,458
Son of a bitch.

702
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:28,930
Move it, asshole!

703
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:31,391
Move!

704
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:36,229
- Move that piece of junk.
- I'm trying.

705
00:56:37,188 --> 00:56:39,024
Son of a bitch isn't working.

706
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:42,569
What's this asshole doing?

707
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:46,281
- I said move your shit...
- I'm checking it out really quick.

708
00:56:47,073 --> 00:56:48,325
It's not working.

709
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:52,370
I don't see them, sir.

710
00:56:53,204 --> 00:56:54,414
Idiots.

711
00:56:55,373 --> 00:56:56,458
Keep going.

712
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,652
You know what, asshole? Close
that shit. We'll push you.

713
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:07,676
Okay.

714
00:57:08,678 --> 00:57:10,180
Let's push this idiot.

715
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:14,893
See if we can move it.
All that cement's heavy.

716
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:16,019
Move it, asshole.

717
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:26,946
What is this shit?

718
00:57:31,284 --> 00:57:33,703
You just sit there, motherfucker.

719
00:57:35,705 --> 00:57:36,705
Shit.

720
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:39,167
- We got a bogey.
- Ah, shit.

721
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:41,920
Come on, turn around, man.
Turn around.

722
00:57:44,255 --> 00:57:45,840
- Fuck.
- It's on.

723
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:50,512
- Walt, we got a problem.
- Too fucking late.

724
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:51,721
Go back.

725
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:56,851
What the fuck?

726
00:57:57,894 --> 00:57:59,938
Move, you bastard! Move, idiot!

727
00:58:03,066 --> 00:58:05,276
- Out of the car!
- Shut it off!

728
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,612
- The horn! Kill it!
- Quickly! Move!

729
00:58:07,695 --> 00:58:10,240
- Shut off the horn!
- Move it!

730
00:58:10,323 --> 00:58:11,323
Get out!

731
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:12,492
Now!

732
00:58:14,744 --> 00:58:15,912
Hear that?

733
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:19,165
Get in the car.

734
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:20,666
Something's up.

735
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:22,585
Move! Now!

736
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,712
Out of the car!

737
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:26,673
Get out!

738
00:58:26,756 --> 00:58:28,550
Don't move!

739
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:29,633
Now!

740
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:33,054
Hey, I thought you were
going to help me push.

741
00:58:42,522 --> 00:58:43,857
They're headed your way!
Copy?

742
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,733
Get out of the fucking car!

743
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:47,444
Too much time! We gotta go!

744
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:51,823
Oh, shit.

745
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:06,463
Cover me! Cover me! Get down!

746
00:59:06,546 --> 00:59:07,755
Fuck.

747
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,733
- Kenny, you hit?
- On the left!

748
00:59:09,757 --> 00:59:11,759
Two shooters, left side!

749
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:12,927
Over there!

750
00:59:13,928 --> 00:59:15,221
Let's go!

751
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:17,557
- Sal, you good?
- Yeah.

752
00:59:21,102 --> 00:59:22,896
Sirens, boss!

753
00:59:22,979 --> 00:59:24,105
Fuck.

754
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:25,231
Sal, go after me!

755
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:28,693
On the right!

756
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:32,322
Over there!

757
00:59:37,076 --> 00:59:38,369
Get out of the car!

758
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,340
All clear!

759
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:03,061
Holy fuck.

760
01:00:06,314 --> 01:00:07,774
Get out of the fucking car.

761
01:00:13,696 --> 01:00:15,114
Get out of the fucking car!

762
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:19,910
Prick.

763
01:00:30,838 --> 01:00:33,007
Move, you son of a bitch!

764
01:00:49,232 --> 01:00:51,109
No. No fucking way! No!

765
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:52,312
Please. No.

766
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,779
Let's get out of here.
We don't have time.

767
01:00:54,862 --> 01:00:57,132
- He saw everything, man.
- He's a fucking civilian.

768
01:00:57,156 --> 01:01:00,076
- He fucking saw everything.
- Put the fucking gun down, man!

769
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:01,160
Please.

770
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:07,000
Walt, we can't leave him here.
He's a witness.

771
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:09,460
Please. I won't say a thing.

772
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:12,338
Please.

773
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:24,684
Take out your wallet.

774
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:28,688
Give me your identification.

775
01:01:31,107 --> 01:01:32,233
Look at me.

776
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,152
Look at me!

777
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:36,863
If you make trouble for us,

778
01:01:37,405 --> 01:01:39,073
I'll find you.

779
01:01:39,949 --> 01:01:40,949
Understand?

780
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:42,619
Yes.

781
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,538
Everybody in the truck.

782
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:53,421
Go. Come on. Go.

783
01:03:05,368 --> 01:03:07,453
You're a fucking piece of shit.

784
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,893
Hurry, you son of a bitch!
Get down, asshole.

785
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:14,168
Hey!

786
01:03:14,252 --> 01:03:16,212
Stand up, fucker! Get up!

787
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:18,505
Hurry!

788
01:03:19,215 --> 01:03:20,258
Hurry!
