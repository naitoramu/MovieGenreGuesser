1
00:00:00,978 --> 00:00:02,734
My name is Michael Scofield.

2
00:00:03,117 --> 00:00:05,107
My brother is facing
the electric chair,

3
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:07,563
framed for a crime
he didn't commit.

4
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:11,096
What is it about this case that the
Secret Service is so interested in?

5
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:13,358
The man killed the vice
president's brother.

6
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:16,471
After his appeals
were exhausted,

7
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:19,084
I knew there was only
one way to get him out.

8
00:00:20,607 --> 00:00:23,652
This is the police.
Put down your weapon!

9
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:27,629
Michael.

10
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:30,291
- I'm getting you out of here.
- It's impossible.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,311
Not if you designed the place,
it isn't.

12
00:00:32,443 --> 00:00:33,838
Have you seen the blueprints?

13
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:36,425
Better than that.
I've got them on me.

14
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:39,408
I've been at Fox River
nearly a month now.

15
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:41,362
In that time,
I've assembled a group that

16
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:43,926
has all the resources we
need to not only break out,

17
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:44,996
but to stay out.

18
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:46,144
I'm Michael, by the way.

19
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:48,454
- Dr. Tancr...
- Tancredi like the governor?

20
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:49,968
While we dig on the inside,

21
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,194
our lawyer searches for
the truth on the outside.

22
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:57,329
I have information that will lead to
the exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.

23
00:00:57,468 --> 00:01:00,318
Somebody on the inside claims
they can exonerate Lincoln.

24
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:02,498
Someone's been talking.

25
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,157
Anyone that's a
threat is expendable.

26
00:01:05,389 --> 00:01:07,623
They're ready for you,
Madam Vice President.

27
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:17,682
24 hours from now,
my brother is scheduled to die,

28
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:21,087
but the way I see it,
24 hours from now,

29
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:22,696
we'll be out of the country.

30
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,825
It's there.

31
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:31,294
It can't be done.

32
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:34,076
We're not getting out of here.

33
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:40,492
Unfortunately, Pretty,
that ain't an option.

34
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:43,469
You are gonna get
us out of here.

35
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:57,915
Unless you're gonna use your
shank to take out the pipe,

36
00:01:58,102 --> 00:01:58,903
put it away.

37
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,956
I'll put it in your neck,
you don't get us out of here.

38
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:03,744
- Bring it down a peg, T-Bag.
- Shut your mouth!

39
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:08,767
Remember, Pretty,
I am serving life plus one.

40
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:11,644
So if I get busted
for attempted escape,

41
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,506
I'm gonna throw in a homicide,
no problem.

42
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:15,286
That's like a
parking ticket to me.

43
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,861
- You okay?
- Felt sick again.

44
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:29,709
Yeah, you took your I.V.s out.

45
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,550
Yeah, I didn't want to throw up on the
floor, so I just came to the drain.

46
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,952
Just let me walk this off.
I'll be fine.

47
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,758
Lincoln, there is no reason for you
to be here if your I.V. isn't in.

48
00:02:42,532 --> 00:02:44,430
Everything all right in here?

49
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:46,128
It's fine.

50
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:48,243
Why isn't he cuffed
to the table?

51
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,299
What's he gonna do,
steal a cotton ball?

52
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:54,505
Can't have him walking around, Doc.
You know that.

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,496
What was that?

54
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:13,676
Put your wrist out.

55
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,915
You gonna turn this
into something?

56
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,987
I'm not gonna say it again.
Put your wrist out.

57
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:18,489
Hey, Keith,
come check this out!

58
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,848
Keith?

59
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,648
We got to go. Now.

60
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:33,966
Give me the rope.

61
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,690
Give me the rope now!

62
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:44,896
Tie that off.

63
00:04:59,513 --> 00:05:00,696
Okay, I'm down.

64
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:12,679
We got to go, Michael.

65
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,687
It's done. Let's go.

66
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:33,159
Did it break off or
did someone break it?

67
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:34,145
I don't know.

68
00:05:37,697 --> 00:05:39,163
Here's the other half.

69
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:24,101
Hey, hey. What's up, Brad?

70
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,663
Heading over to Sharkey's.
It's two-fer Tuesday.

71
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,227
- Want to hoist a few?
- Man, I'd love to,

72
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,995
but my wife is cooking dinner,
and I told her I'd be home.

73
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,116
Wuss. Anybody else?

74
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:36,520
Suit yourselves.

75
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:46,202
Hey, none of the Sheetrock in front
of the break room's been touched.

76
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:47,990
Ah, the P.I.'s
letting it dry out.

77
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:48,835
Still?

78
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,530
- Westmoreland!
- I'm caught on something.

79
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:40,821
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

80
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:58,188
Stay there. Stay down there.

81
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,105
Why was this door locked?

82
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,199
Wasn't locked, boss.

83
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:16,996
The fan kept pushing it open,
so we just had to wedge it closed.

84
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:22,654
You've been in here all
night not doing a damn thing.

85
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:24,934
Room is still wet, boss.
Nothing we could do.

86
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:26,844
It's not like we were
having a picnic.

87
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:30,580
Bunch of shiftless,
no-good convicts.

88
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:38,346
You got something
to say, Scofield?

89
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,610
Wrap it up.

90
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:46,408
And all four of you,
get your asses back to the block.

91
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:58,042
Hey. Get these nitwits
back to the cell block.

92
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:15,326
You seem to be one light.

93
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:20,970
Right here, boss.

94
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:35,207
Oh, no. No way!

95
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,561
I should be halfway to
seeing my family right now!

96
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,359
Let's go.

97
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:52,595
Now!

98
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:37,795
Keep it moving.

99
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:41,616
Move it! Let's go, ladies!

100
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,387
You think he knows?

101
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:49,826
L incoln.

102
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:03,209
I'm here with Henry Pope, who is the
warden of Fox River Penitentiary,

103
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:07,381
where Lincoln Burrows is scheduled to
die by electrocution at 12:01
a.m. tomorrow.

104
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:10,421
Warden Pope, can you tell me what's
going to happen in the next few hours?

105
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:13,101
There are strict Department
of Corrections guidelines

106
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:15,345
that govern every
aspect of an execution.

107
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:18,715
Measures taken to make sure that the
process goes as smoothly as possible.

108
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:19,738
Such as?

109
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:21,983
The  correctional officers
will do a walk-through.

110
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,641
We'll review the
list of witnesses.

111
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:26,587
The chair will be checked and re-checked
to make sure there's no problem.

112
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:29,117
And Mr. Burrows himself?
Have you spoken with him?

113
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:31,414
What are his thoughts
in these final hours?

114
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,114
I'd say that's between
him and his God.

115
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:35,437
And maybe the governor.

116
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,351
I understand Burrows' attorneys
are going to request a stay.

117
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:39,831
I wish them the best of luck.

118
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,896
Does that mean you
believe he's innocent?

119
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:43,177
It means...

120
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,737
I believe in the process,

121
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:48,953
but I don't relish the prospect
of taking another man's life.

122
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:53,780
Whether it's just or not, there's
no joy that lies before us today.

123
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:55,561
Okay, thank you
very much Warden.

124
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:57,328
And we will be here with
you throughout the night

125
00:11:57,358 --> 00:12:00,372
watching and waiting to see if
Lincoln Burrows does, in fact,

126
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:05,977
become only the 13th person to be
executed in the State of Illinois
since 1976.

127
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,259
Just so you got one less
thing to worry about,

128
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:22,520
I want you to know
I ain't mad at you.

129
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,511
Thank you.

130
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:33,943
- How long until...
- 16 hours.

131
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:37,315
Are his lawyers
making any progress?

132
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:38,641
Is there still a
chance with that?

133
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:42,812
No. There's only one person who
can really stop this execution.

134
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:19,722
I need to see my brother.

135
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:23,259
Just to talk, for five minutes.

136
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:26,809
Yeah. Yeah, I'll try.

137
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:32,041
Hey.

138
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:54,529
Um... I'm sorry.

139
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:58,230
I'm told that you have to
wait until final visitation.

140
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:01,510
Would you talk to your
father for me? Please?

141
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:08,492
Believe me, my father knows where
I stand on the death penalty,

142
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,217
and I'm just as clear
on his stance...

143
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:13,947
Sara, uh, Dr.
Tancredi, I'm sorry. Um...

144
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,351
This isn't about the morality
of the death penalty.

145
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:18,148
This is...

146
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:23,385
This is about killing an innocent man:
my brother.

147
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:26,397
And, surely,
your father can't be in favor of that.

148
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,610
Just talk to Lincoln's attorneys,
just for an hour,

149
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,490
and I swear to God,
you'll be convinced of his innocence.

150
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:35,462
Michael, I would pick
up the phone right now

151
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:38,184
if I thought there was any chance
that I could make a difference.

152
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:40,209
But you have to understand.

153
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:44,146
I'm the last person in the
world that my father listens to.

154
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:46,822
He hates what I do,
he hates what I believe in.

155
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:49,698
And if I'm the one asking for
clemency for your brother,

156
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,265
your brother won't get it.

157
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,658
I'm sorry.

158
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:17,923
Look, if Terrence Steadman
is still alive, Lyle,

159
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:20,012
then it can't be Terrence
Steadman buried in the ground.

160
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:23,292
Yeah, but a secret informant claims
that Steadman is still alive?

161
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,311
I don't know, Nick,
it all sounds pretty far-fetched.

162
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,541
You're  his clerk,
just get us on the docket.

163
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:30,096
Nick, you're asking him to
commit political suicide

164
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:33,976
by granting a stay of execution to
Illinois' most notorious death
row inmate.

165
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:36,536
Officially, all we're asking
is for an exhumation order.

166
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:39,222
If he grants it, he can order a
stay until the tests are come in.

167
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:40,685
An exhumation order?

168
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:44,583
Well that's better-- digging up the
vice president's brother. No way.

169
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,300
Lyle, Lyle, look, we took Intro
to Civ Pro together, remember?

170
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,195
We studied for the bar,
day and night,

171
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,758
in that crappy little
apartment of yours,

172
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:52,438
talking about how we're
going to make a difference.

173
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:54,489
Nick, you filed an
eleventh hour motion,

174
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:56,747
and Judge Kessler's docket
is full this afternoon...

175
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:59,042
Come on, Lyle,
everyone knows you run that courtroom.

176
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:01,462
You can't adjust
things around a bit?

177
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:04,551
The informant that was killed yesterday?
I was there.

178
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:07,256
I know firsthand these people
will do whatever they can

179
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:09,376
to frame Lincoln for
Steadman's murder.

180
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,380
All we're asking
is to be heard.

181
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:20,321
I'll give you 15 minutes
this afternoon-- that's it!

182
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:22,651
- Thank you, thank you!
- Yeah, you're welcome.

183
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,489
He doesn't even
know what happened.

184
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:38,006
- He knows you tried.
- Do you think so?

185
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:41,297
He's your brother;
he knows you, so yes.

186
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:44,188
I promised I would
get him out of here.

187
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,039
You promised a lot
of people, Pretty.

188
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:49,401
- Enough, man, all right?
- This don't concern you, boy.

189
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,951
You don't get a man's hopes up
like that, and then just...

190
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:55,943
Back up or I'll beat your
skinny ass into the ground.

191
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,658
And it wouldn't
take much to do it.

192
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:04,226
All right, ladies, Rec time's over;
back on the block!

193
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:06,540
You owe me a ticket
out of here, Pretty.

194
00:17:08,884 --> 00:17:10,488
And I will collect.

195
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:20,262
I'm really am sorry
about your brother.

196
00:17:20,902 --> 00:17:22,181
Thanks.

197
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,653
Look, I know you were
counting on this, so...

198
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,405
Let me worry about my problems.

199
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:29,917
I know you've got enough
on your mind right now.

200
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:33,290
For what it's worth,
over the years, I've known

201
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,575
a few men who've sat on that chair,
and as the day gets near,

202
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:40,230
all you can really do
is pray it goes quick.

203
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:42,586
Once, about ten years ago,

204
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:46,835
there was a man caught a few sparks,
not enough to do the job.

205
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:51,439
Had to wait another three weeks
while they reset the whole process.

206
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:55,767
It may sound crazy, but he said it
was the worst three weeks of his life,

207
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:59,635
'cause it not the lightning that
kills you... it's the wait.

208
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,672
So take solace in the fact that
your brother's wait is over.

209
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,079
So if something
happens to the chair,

210
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:08,772
he's got three more weeks?

211
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:11,067
There's a lot of protocol
in killing a man.

212
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,284
A new death warrant,
another medical clearance...

213
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:16,337
A lot can happen
in three weeks.

214
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:19,875
- Yo, what the grapes, yo?
- Thanks.

215
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,354
- What y'all talking about?
- Nothing.

216
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,719
Keep it together, come on!
Go! Keep it together!

217
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:38,907
I'm going in.

218
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,687
It's daytime.

219
00:18:44,864 --> 00:18:46,000
I'll hang a sheet.

220
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,894
Do you have any
questions about...

221
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:24,681
what's going to happen tonight?

222
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:26,424
When I get to eat,

223
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:29,270
where I'm supposed to walk,

224
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:31,624
how it's gonna feel when
they tighten the belts...

225
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:33,878
Any of that gonna
help come midnight?

226
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,762
Some feel it's best
to be prepared.

227
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:40,956
- How's Michael?
- He's anxious to see you.

228
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:45,749
Unfortunately, we've been told that
that's not possible until
final visitation.

229
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,083
You've been through
this before?

230
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:53,533
No.

231
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,590
Just so you know,
a doctor needs to be present, so,

232
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:02,203
for what it's worth,
I'll be there tonight.

233
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:05,265
- Can I ask a favor?
- Yeah. What?

234
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:07,671
When I'm gone, can you...

235
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:11,291
Will you look out
for my brother?

236
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,248
What were you doing back there?

237
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:59,517
Hmm. So you like
doing that, too?

238
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,874
Dipping  the fry in a shake?
Hells yeah.

239
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:05,047
Mmm. Good times. Good times.

240
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:08,220
So what's going on out there?

241
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:11,025
Nothing, you know?
Just staying out of trouble.

242
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:16,016
I meant in terms of any...
"office gossip" you might have for me.

243
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:21,367
So check it. This one fool has
been trying to cop a joint.

244
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:24,745
So I'll keep ear
hustling for that.

245
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,486
We had an agreement.

246
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:30,285
You were supposed to bird-dog
Scofield and get back to me.

247
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:33,316
I been trying, man,
I've been working the corners. Trust me.

248
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:34,444
I ain't got nothing.

249
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,247
I seen you talking to him
in the yard and the geezer.

250
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:40,063
Yeah, I talked to Scofield
but he ain't told me nothing.

251
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:42,996
Then it's a hundred bucks
for the burger and fries.

252
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,936
Boss, you know I
ain't got no money.

253
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:47,122
Then you better start
selling your ass.

254
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,032
A hundred bucks by
the end of this shift,

255
00:21:49,062 --> 00:21:52,707
or there's gonna be a bidding war to
see who gets you as their new cellie.

256
00:21:52,737 --> 00:21:53,573
Beat it.

257
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:13,867
In the yard today,
I did hear Scofield say something.

258
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:14,667
And?

259
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,767
He said if something goes
wrong with the chair,

260
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:23,414
his brother gets three
more weeks to live.

261
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,182
We're square. Get out of here.

262
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,350
- How is it going in here?
- Ready for liftoff.

263
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,951
- Chair's working?
- Yeah. Why?

264
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:55,630
- Run a test.
- Already did.

265
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,496
The electrical contractor signed
off on the diagnostic this morning.

266
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:00,236
- We're good to go.
- Run it again.

267
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,078
Why?

268
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:02,769
Run it.

269
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,360
It ain't working.

270
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:17,719
Son of a bitch.
I don't know what could have happened.

271
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,416
So once they redo all the paperwork,
your brother gets three more weeks.

272
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:30,068
- Right.
- So we got time.

273
00:23:30,154 --> 00:23:31,364
Not a lot, but some.

274
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:33,136
Are we still going
through the infirmary?

275
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,066
If  I corrode that pipe again,
they'll know something's up.

276
00:23:36,594 --> 00:23:38,039
You got another way?

277
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:41,345
Right now, I'm just worried
about getting through tonight.

278
00:23:57,971 --> 00:24:01,303
Careful, there's 2,000 volts
running through that thing.

279
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:06,627
Oh, God.

280
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:15,176
Give me the strength to walk...

281
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:17,766
Give the strength to walk...

282
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:39,007
I want to see my brother.

283
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,997
When we move you to
Final Visitation.

284
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,926
- When's that?
- Right after we do this.

285
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:47,455
Just...

286
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:51,695
It's your last day, Linc.

287
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:55,831
I'd prefer to keep you out of
cuffs as much as possible, but

288
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:58,676
I need some assurances.

289
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:03,542
You've always been
straight-up with me, Stolte.

290
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:05,244
You have my word.

291
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:17,689
Your Honor, from the outset, Mr.
Burrows' case has been tainted by

292
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:20,111
a conspiracy characterized
by destruction of evidence,

293
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:22,293
distortion of the truth,
and witness intimidation.

294
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:24,009
Again, Judge, I have to object.

295
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:27,437
These are some serious accusations
with absolutely no proof.

296
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:30,418
No proof? What have I been
arguing for the past 20 minutes?

297
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:31,203
You got me.

298
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:34,290
Judge Kessler, Mr.
Tucci might not appreciate the weight

299
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:36,539
of what we've just presented,
but surely you must.

300
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,722
As Ms. Donovan stated,
a top video forensic analyst

301
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,269
has disputed the authenticity
of a surveillance tape

302
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,992
that was the key piece of evidence
in convicting Lincoln Burrows.

303
00:25:45,022 --> 00:25:47,111
That's the tape that no
longer exists, right?

304
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:48,838
Because your client
had it destroyed.

305
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:52,581
Unless my client is a rusted water
pipe in the County Records office,

306
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:53,900
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

307
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,154
Judge, Ms.
Donovan's apartment was blown up

308
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,205
in an attempt to
silence both her and me.

309
00:25:58,235 --> 00:26:01,441
That was independently corroborated
as a gas leak, Your Honor.

310
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:02,663
Judge, a month ago,

311
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:05,846
a Secret Service agent named Paul
Kellerman visited my office.

312
00:26:05,876 --> 00:26:09,959
I saw Kellerman last night, when he shot
and killed another agent, Daniel Hale,

313
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:13,702
right after Hale told me that
Terrence Steadman was alive and well.

314
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:16,550
Your Honor,
I'm presenting to the clerk an affidavit

315
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:19,283
from the Director of the
Secret Service agency.

316
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:22,047
It states that at no
time has there ever been

317
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:26,899
an agent of that organization by the
name of Paul Kellerman, or Daniel Hale.

318
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:29,815
In addition, there were no other
witnesses to this shooting.

319
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:33,589
pÑNo bullets were found,
no blood, no shell casings.

320
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,702
The only witness to this alleged
murder is Veronica Donovan,

321
00:26:38,006 --> 00:26:40,437
Lincoln Burrows' ex-girlfriend.

322
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:42,637
Now, Your Honor,
I feel for Ms. Donovan.

323
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:44,435
- Save it.
- I do.

324
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:47,608
But desperation causes
desperate acts.

325
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:50,343
And  that's what we're seeing here today,
Your Honor.

326
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:53,800
My client, the Vice President
of the United States...

327
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:54,904
Judge Kessler...

328
00:26:56,254 --> 00:27:00,249
Do either of you have any
evidence that is admissible?

329
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,849
Even just tangible?

330
00:27:01,942 --> 00:27:03,729
Your claims, if true,
are terrifying.

331
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,931
But anything, or anyone,
that could verify your story is either

332
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:10,335
gone, missing or dead.

333
00:27:13,277 --> 00:27:16,002
I know time is of the essence.

334
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:17,839
I'll reserve judgment for now.

335
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:20,182
I'll take your arguments
into consideration,

336
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:23,643
and I'll have a decision
within a few hours.

337
00:27:29,072 --> 00:27:32,783
These little bastards are the bane
of my existence, I swear to God.

338
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:34,706
You get this a lot?

339
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,428
Yeah, they're attracted to
the heat when they're cold,

340
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:38,620
plus, they got collapsible
vertebrae or some deal,

341
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,403
so they can squeeze through a crack
yea big, if they're determined.

342
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:43,500
And he shorted the wire
just by biting on it?

343
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,004
Not by chewing on
the wire alone,

344
00:27:45,034 --> 00:27:47,323
but if the tail touches metal,

345
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:50,503
it acts as a ground,
and boom, fuse pops.

346
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:53,242
- Along with the rat.
- I'll be damned.

347
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,096
So, can you change the fuse?

348
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:57,187
Yeah, there's another one
right here in the box.

349
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,554
Can do it now?

350
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,396
Right after I notify the State
and fill out the paperwork.

351
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:04,474
Now, hold up a minute, you two.

352
00:28:04,563 --> 00:28:05,460
Both of you.

353
00:28:06,582 --> 00:28:08,872
We're gonna give more time

354
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,622
to a guy who killed the
Vice President's brother?

355
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:12,859
This guy's a terrorist.

356
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:15,743
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Forget about losing our jobs,

357
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,126
we could all face charges.

358
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:19,182
Only the three of us know.

359
00:28:20,052 --> 00:28:22,659
Real easy to keep it that way.

360
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:31,941
It's your guys' call.

361
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:41,243
- How much longer?
- Six hours.

362
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:42,756
Open on 40!

363
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:52,294
Scofield, your brother's gonna be
transported to Final Visitation soon.

364
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:53,812
You can meet him there.

365
00:28:56,648 --> 00:28:58,118
You look surprised.

366
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:00,787
You knew it was
scheduled today.

367
00:29:06,714 --> 00:29:07,896
No, I...

368
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:17,405
You were saying?

369
00:29:50,486 --> 00:29:53,978
They'll be transporting you to
Final Visitation in a minute.

370
00:29:57,606 --> 00:29:59,801
Thanks for keeping
your word, Linc.

371
00:30:26,654 --> 00:30:29,564
Linc, you're gonna have
to change into these.

372
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:32,160
What's that?

373
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:35,925
At the moment of death,
the body becomes incontinent, so...

374
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:37,881
- It's a diaper?
- Yeah.

375
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:40,036
You need to wear it.

376
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,214
Make me.

377
00:30:47,477 --> 00:30:51,454
It's a good look, huh?
It's, uh, for the electricity.

378
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:54,105
Hair gets in the
way or something.

379
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:02,321
I did everything I could.

380
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:04,219
I know you did.

381
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:12,293
Last time I had my head shaved
was when I was running with Derek.

382
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,922
- Remember Derek?
- Uh, yeah.

383
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:18,438
Bet me 40 bucks I wouldn't shave it.
I said, make it 100.

384
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:19,951
Still owes me.

385
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:25,181
- Have you heard from Veronica?
- She's supposed to be coming.

386
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:28,535
Is there any news on the appeal?
'Cause there could still be a chance...

387
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:30,162
Stop it. Michael, please.

388
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:33,531
This thing's gonna happen.

389
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,705
I got to get my head straight.

390
00:31:37,777 --> 00:31:40,663
Let's just share memories,
swap stories,

391
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:42,428
talk about the damn weather,

392
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:45,121
anything but torturing myself
with the idea of hope.

393
00:31:45,976 --> 00:31:48,008
I can't take it anymore.

394
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:52,612
All right.

395
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:55,203
- You can't go, LJ.
- I don't care.

396
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,712
I have to see him.

397
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:59,522
You can't go to the prison.
You'll never make it through the gate.

398
00:31:59,552 --> 00:32:00,723
There will be cops everywhere.

399
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:04,053
Look, you got to wait until we get
all this cleared up, all right?

400
00:32:07,486 --> 00:32:09,169
It's the judge's clerk.

401
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,253
Lyle, what do you got?

402
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:14,135
Yeah.

403
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:17,721
Thanks, man.

404
00:32:17,907 --> 00:32:19,303
They ruled against us.

405
00:32:19,382 --> 00:32:19,845
Yeah.

406
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:21,886
I'm going to go and see him.

407
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:23,466
I'm going to stay here with LJ.

408
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:25,310
You gonna be okay going alone?

409
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,690
Yeah, I'm going to be fine.

410
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:28,197
Tell Lincoln...

411
00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:31,383
you know, just, we tried.

412
00:32:35,972 --> 00:32:38,181
Go to the back room. Go!

413
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:50,092
You're the attorneys
for Lincoln Burrows?

414
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:09,304
You letting me win, Michael?

415
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:10,250
No.

416
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:12,717
Mm-hmm. Show me your cards.

417
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:15,104
- I'm not going to show you my cards.
- Show me your cards.

418
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:18,034
- I'm not going to show you my cards.
- Give me your cards.

419
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:20,452
Gin.

420
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:22,317
Funny, that.

421
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:25,013
Three out of five.

422
00:33:27,323 --> 00:33:29,314
How often would you
make those for LJ?

423
00:33:29,473 --> 00:33:31,446
Whenever I had him on weekends.

424
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:34,603
Maybe the only decent
thing I ever did for him.

425
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:36,892
No. You were there for him.

426
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:38,183
Not enough.

427
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:43,709
I don't know how they can
stomach stuff before...

428
00:33:57,158 --> 00:33:58,974
We lost the appeal.

429
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:08,527
Your friend Sara
came by, though.

430
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:11,631
- Did she hear you out?
- She did.

431
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:13,024
Is she going to
talk to her father?

432
00:34:13,054 --> 00:34:14,204
I sure as hell hope so.

433
00:34:14,223 --> 00:34:16,211
It doesn't matter
any more, guys.

434
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:18,665
You've done more
than enough for me.

435
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:21,008
That's the most
important thing.

436
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,735
I couldn't bring LJ.

437
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,163
I know.

438
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:30,326
I can get him on
the phone, though.

439
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:32,622
What do I say?

440
00:34:39,025 --> 00:34:41,504
LJ... it's your dad.

441
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:51,005
- Hey, Dad.
- LJ.

442
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:53,985
- So, this is it.
- Yeah.

443
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:57,770
I am... I want you to, uh...

444
00:34:57,868 --> 00:35:01,434
stick with Veronica and Nick and
clear your name. You'll be all right.

445
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,929
I wish I could be there, Dad.

446
00:35:06,421 --> 00:35:07,890
Me, too.

447
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,851
'Cause there's something
I want to tell you.

448
00:35:12,418 --> 00:35:13,662
What's that?

449
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,233
I had a dream last night.

450
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:19,449
You and me were working on a house,
pounding nails.

451
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,727
And in the dream...

452
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:25,005
it felt like we were older.

453
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:29,333
It was so clear.
The whole dream.

454
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,346
And when I woke...

455
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:36,296
I knew that today wasn't
going to be the end.

456
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,800
That...

457
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,212
That we'll see each
other again, Dad.

458
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,759
I know it.

459
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:47,675
I love you, Dad.

460
00:35:57,009 --> 00:36:00,931
Those numbers support Burrows' claim
about Terrence Steadman's
pending indictment.

461
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:04,518
Now, with the related murders,
and then the confidential informant,

462
00:36:04,624 --> 00:36:07,781
I just wanted to make sure that you
were fully aware of the circumstances.

463
00:36:07,811 --> 00:36:09,699
I'm fully acquainted with
the Burrows case, Sara,

464
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:11,383
but I never heard
about any of this.

465
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:14,474
Well, I hadn't either until I spoke
with Burrows' attorneys this afternoon.

466
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:18,030
And I understand that most of this
evidence is technically
considered circumstantial,

467
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,932
but I think you'll agree
it's hard to ignore.

468
00:36:19,962 --> 00:36:21,389
How did you get
involved with all this?

469
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:24,096
These men are my patients.
It's my job advocate for them.

470
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:26,728
Come on, Sara, how many of these
guys say that they are innocent?

471
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:28,314
80, 90 percent?

472
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:31,787
I mean, it's not like you're asking
me for a new bike here, kid.

473
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,427
Being tough on crime,
capital punishment--

474
00:36:34,706 --> 00:36:37,106
it's all part of a philosophy
that I believe in.

475
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:40,984
Part of a philosophy that I
campaigned on, was elected for.

476
00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:45,544
I have to go back to Fox River.

477
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:48,410
I have to be there when
they kill this man.

478
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,541
The least you could do
is review his case.

479
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,786
And, Dad, if it helps...

480
00:36:52,953 --> 00:36:54,859
pretend it didn't come from me.

481
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:05,239
I've never given a damn about
what people thought of me.

482
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:06,805
Never.

483
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:08,496
The last couple of days...

484
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:10,395
I gotta admit, you know...

485
00:37:13,474 --> 00:37:17,673
Lee Harvey Oswald,
John Wilkes Booth...

486
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:19,378
Lincoln Burrows.

487
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:22,930
I'm gonna go down in
history with these freaks.

488
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:28,727
Bitch of it all is
I didn't do it.

489
00:37:32,885 --> 00:37:34,593
I didn't do it!

490
00:37:49,797 --> 00:37:51,115
I didn't do it.

491
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:07,119
It's time.

492
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,553
Warden!

493
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:53,789
- What is it?
- It's the governor.

494
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:01,455
Yes, Governor.

495
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,390
Okay.

496
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:20,548
I understand.

497
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:25,563
The governor has reviewed
your case fully.

498
00:39:26,924 --> 00:39:29,380
He's not granting clemency.

499
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:35,224
Let's proceed.

500
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:53,327
You did your country and
your party a great service.

501
00:39:53,982 --> 00:39:55,747
It won't go unnoticed.

502
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:59,740
- Thank you, Madame Vice President.
- Thank you, Governor.

503
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:19,256
Can't go past here.

504
00:40:19,578 --> 00:40:23,128
Once he's in the death chamber,
you'll be escorted to the viewing room.

505
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:27,059
Can I...

506
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:29,637
Yeah.

507
00:40:41,992 --> 00:40:45,593
I've loved you since the
first time I saw you.

508
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:24,154
Uncuff him.

509
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:26,677
Let's go, son.

510
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:36,895
- I didn't kill that man, Michael.
- Swear to me.

511
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:38,892
I swear to you.

512
00:41:39,674 --> 00:41:41,770
Preparation can only
take you so far.

513
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,116
After that,
you got to take a few leaps of faith.

514
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,924
Don't give up on me.

515
00:41:52,186 --> 00:41:53,747
What if something
happens to you?

516
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,566
You just have a little faith.

517
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:57,487
Just have a little faith.

518
00:41:57,591 --> 00:42:00,783
How about every Sunday,
we have our own special breakfast?

519
00:42:00,828 --> 00:42:02,886
- Just you and me.
- Yeah.

520
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,184
Give me your hand.
You got to have faith, LJ.

521
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:12,518
I love you, Dad.

522
00:42:13,557 --> 00:42:14,946
I came in here a man.

523
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:18,400
Give me the strength to
walk out of here a man.

524
00:42:35,134 --> 00:42:41,400
