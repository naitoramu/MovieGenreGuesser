1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,679
A vacancy has appeared
and you're going to fill it.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,919
From now on, Mr Shelby,
you shut your gypsy mouth

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,919
and listen to your instructions.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,759
I know it was you who carried
out the murder of Mr Duggan.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,639
You are on my hook, Mr Shelby.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,799
- Name?
- Harold Hancox.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,999
- Have you ever been arrested?
- No.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,919
Arthur, we can stand him up.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,239
Last night, one of our men had
his throat cut in Winston Green.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,839
I'm not real!

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,959
Gentlemen? This is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,519
- I want to go with them.
- Over my dead body.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,919
Do we hear 800 guineas? 850.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,719
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,479
- So will you consider me?
- I will consider you.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,319
Thomas Shelby?

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,519
Did they behave themselves?

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,159
They were really amazing.

19

20
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,199
You might think this is a curious
place for me to suggest a meeting,

21
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,799
but...

22
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,479
your surprises have only just begun.

23
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,679
You look a little unsteady, Mr Shelby.

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,039
Take a seat.

25
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,759
You're working together.

26
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,999
Blowing up the Garrison was your idea.

27
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,999
You chose me.

28
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,999
It's funny, I thought the
Fenians had a policy...

29
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,799
- Enough.
- Of not mixing

30
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,136
the personal with the political.

31
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,359
- I said enough.
- I think

32
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,999
I will decide on what is enough.

33
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,639
Who's in charge here then?
Who's in charge?

34
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,239
Right, let me understand this.

35
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,136
- You answer to an agent of the Crown.
- Perhaps we can just...

36
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,039
- Very interesting.
- Perhaps we can stick to the agenda.

37
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,559
- Whose agenda?
- There is a form of words here.

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,519
- Whose words?
- Arrogant bastard.

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm not accustomed
to being spoken to like that.

40
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
Just come to order.

41
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,559
I am here to listen,
but not to the fucking infantry.

42
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,879
Enough! Jesus!

43
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,399
Now...

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,159
Some weeks ago, Mr Shelby
carried out a military mission

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,119
on behalf of pro-treaty Republicans
here in Birmingham.

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,439
You...

47
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,319
Working for the King.

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,719
- There is a unique political situation.
- Yeah? How does that feel?

49
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,319
- Let us...
- Tell me. How does that fucking feel?

50
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,679
Stick to the form of words.

51
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,079
- Temporarily, we have a shared interest.
- I see.

52
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,760
- Shall we just stop him laughing?
- You want me to stop laughing?

53
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,879
Explain this, pal.

54
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,199
Following the success of your mission...

55
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,759
- We're going to make you do it again.
- Will you shut up?

56
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,199
Can we just conduct
ourselves here, please?

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,799
- Conduct ourselves!
- Please.

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,519
No one in this room wants to breathe
the same air as anyone else.

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,959
- Nevertheless...
- Nevertheless the pro-treaty Paddies

60
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,079
and the King want the same man dead.

61
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,439
Am I right?

62
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,599
- Why him?
- Did you ask why in France?

63
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,879
- Yeah.
- So, it's the same answer, because.

64
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,239
Why me?

65
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,519
- Because.
- Because.

66
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,279
Because if anybody connects me to this,

67
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,839
it will be assumed
that it was a criminal act

68
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,759
and not a political one.

69
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,439
No, you need not fear being
connected to the killing

70
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,879
because I will see to it that
no connection is ever made.

71
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,359
You will have complete
immunity after the fact.

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,759
But, in the execution, you will get
no help from agents of the Crown.

73
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,640
And we can't be seen to be involved.

74
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,719
You have been chosen, Mr Shelby,

75
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,799
and there really is no choice.

76
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,359
No equals bang,

77
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,199
and your man here will shed no tears
as he looks the other way.

78
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,719
Nevertheless...

79
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,799
I say no.

80
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,599
Mr Shelby?

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,199
What about your export licence,
Mr Shelby?

82
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,719
You had a deal with Mr Churchill.

83
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,239
The one with the mouth,
Donal Henry, he is a spy.

84
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,199
He is working for the Irregulars
against the pro-treaty Paddies.

85
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,519
He reports every fucking
word back to them.

86
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,799
No, it's not possible.

87
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,639
They've both been security vetted
by my own department.

88
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,079
I have men in places your men can't go.

89
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,039
Donal Henry meets the
anti-treaty Paddies in the back room

90
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,519
of the Mother Red Cap in Saltley,
sometimes twice a week.

91
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,439
These Irish enemies are
fucking brothers and cousins.

92
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,359
You are stepping into a world
you don't understand.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,839
If what you're saying is true,
he'll be dealt with.

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,479
Bring me proof the spy is dead
and we have a deal.

95
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,599
Mr Shelby.

96
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,399
- Billy boy.
- Watch it.

97
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,159
Now on you go.

98
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,719
Right, boys, let's go!

99
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,159
Fuck you!

100
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,159
Mario!

101
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,679
Mario!

102
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,479
Come here.

103
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,199
Sabini's day is done.

104
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,559
I'll protect you now.

105
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,719
Shut up!

106
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,359
Stop fucking whingeing.

107
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,399
Due to my razor blade,

108
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,559
and a few complaints from the neighbours

109
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,439
about the terrible fucking music...

110
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,719
Do you want to tell them or should I?

111
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,359
This place is under new management.

112
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,079
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

113
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,039
Yes?

114
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,959
Somebody to see you, Mr Shelby.

115
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,200
He says he's come about the
position of accounts clerk.

116
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,639
Send him in.

117
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,479
- Just through here, sir.
- Thank you.

118
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,959
Michael...

119
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,759
Vacancy's been filled.

120
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,639
Not according to this morning's paper.

121
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,119
At school, I was top of the
class in mathematics,

122
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,199
and I did a night school course in
accountancy at Worcester College.

123
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,616
Mum says you've had
six different accountant clerks

124
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,959
in the last six months.

125
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,999
When respectable men see the
other things you do, they leave.

126
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,199
But I, like Lizzie out there,
already know what you do.

127
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,199
Mum says you want to be 80% legal
within two years.

128
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,519
- Three.
- I can help.

129
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,759
I know both sides and
you know you can trust me.

130
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,439
I want to help you, Tommy, become legal.

131
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,279
Do the right thing.

132
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,799
I want to be proud of this family.

133
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,119
Does Polly know you're here, Michael?

134
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,199
I'm 18 on Friday, I go where I please.

135
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,399
You phone your mother.

136
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,999
Good luck.

137
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,119
We're not open for winnings yet.

138
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,119
I'm here to see Thomas Shelby.

139
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,239
I have an appointment.

140
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,959
Come in.

141
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,519
- May Carleton.
- Mr Shelby has his proper meetings

142
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,559
in his other office.

143
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,839
This was the address that he gave me.

144
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,599
- He gave you this address?
- He said it was a gambling den.

145
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,559
I told him that I'd wanted to see one

146
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,600
since I'm always reading
about them in the papers.

147
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,839
Quite the big scandal
in The Telegraph lately.

148
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,879
Anyway, he said that
I could come and have a look.

149
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,416
And now I feel like a bit of an idiot

150
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,000
because I'm early and he's late
and I have no idea how to behave.

151
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,519
In a gambling den?

152
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,519
I'll wait in the car.

153
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,079
If I open the door again,
they'll all want to come in.

154
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,199
Like flies.

155
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,999
So what are you?

156
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,799
What am I?

157
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,359
To Thomas?

158
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,439
I'm going to train his racehorse...
For Epsom.

159
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,999
You know horses?

160
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,879
Yes. You?

161
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,239
Born riding.

162
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,399
I slept in a manger when I was a baby.

163
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,879
I was born riding, too.

164
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,279
There's a fucking
great Riley parked out there

165
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,639
and nobody's watching it.

166
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,799
John, this woman says
she's training Thomas' horse.

167
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,959
He's told us a lot about you.

168
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,639
Don't know where he is, do you?

169
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,159
Sorry I'm late.
There was a family matter.

170
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,039
Esme, keep it locked up for a minute.

171
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,759
- Yes, Thomas.
- I'll show you around.

172
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,919
So, be my guest.

173
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,199
That's my brother Arthur's office.

174
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,719
Down there is my brotherJohn's office,

175
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,399
that's where we slate
the runners and the riders.

176
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,359
It's so out in the open.
What about the police?

177
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,159
What about them?

178
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,439
When I drove into Small Heath,
I thought I was going to get murdered...

179
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,679
Then I mentioned your name.

180
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,319
It was like being escorted
to see a king.

181
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,359
- You came here to get my girl, right?
- Right.

182
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,519
She looks in very good condition,

183
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,919
considering she's not been
out on the gallops.

184
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,999
Curly's the best horseman in England.

185
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,639
I have a man called Mickey
who'd argue the point.

186
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,199
Curly here is half horse himself.

187
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,439
She's blessed. Very blessed.

188
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,399
Well, she's from the best stock.

189
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,320
But I'd rather have a coloured pony.
Mixed blood is stronger.

190
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,199
Not to win the Derby, Curly.

191
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,561
Don't like them racing, Tommy,
not the way they beat them.

192
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,519
- She's all yours.
- Thank you.

193
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,839
He gets sad when one leaves.

194
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,839
- What time is your box van coming?
- Midday.

195
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,799
Maybe you've got time to take
the lady to the Garrison,

196
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,679
show her the spa and the tearooms.

197
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,999
I'd like that, why not?

198
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,039
I just had it done up.
There was a fire.

199
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,639
It's...

200
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,159
Yeah.

201
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,719
What do you drink?

202
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,719
So early, but gin.

203
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,119
Goodness. With something?

204
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,519
Like what?

205
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,479
Tonic water or...

206
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,559
Erm... We have, erm...

207
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,999
Cordial.

208
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,079
There's not much room in there but...

209
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,399
You want to fuck me, Mrs Carleton?

210
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,879
Perhaps because I...

211
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,079
Perhaps because I would represent
something to you?

212
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,479
We should have this conversation
before the booze

213
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,999
starts talking for us.

214
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,559
You have a horse.

215
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,599
Yes, I have a horse.

216
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,719
The horse is why I'm here.

217
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,399
Purely that.

218
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,199
And because you're paying me a
lot of money to train your horse,

219
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,759
that's why I'm here.

220
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,639
Purely that.

221
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,279
Good.

222
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,159
Good. Well, a toast, then.

223
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,839
To the horse, to the Derby.

224
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,799
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

225
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,039
So is that what you say to women?

226
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,919
Only if I don't know what they want.

227
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,759
And what if they don't want to fuck?

228
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,319
Then life is simpler.

229
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,959
You want a simple life?

230
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,759
Do I look like a man
who wants a simple life?

231
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,559
So what do you want?

232
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,719
For what I'm paying you, Mrs Carleton,

233
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,839
I want a horse that'll pay out
at Epsom on an each-way bet.

234
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,679
Before I took your account,

235
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,639
I did some credit checks on you.

236
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,359
Apparently, you don't exist.

237
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,839
My existence is questionable.

238
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,439
Gypsies don't like registers.

239
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,719
You see, I'm not gypsy like you mean.

240
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,719
But you did register for France.

241
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,679
I also sent your name to the War Office,

242
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,519
I have friends there.

243
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,839
You won two medals for gallantry.

244
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,319
Does that really impress you,
Mrs Carleton?

245
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,199
Call me May.

246
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,119
Charlie says the box van's here.

247
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,879
Thank you, Finn.

248
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,680
You know, I still don't know what
you're going to call your horse.

249
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,279
The horse will be called Grace's Secret.

250
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,559
Grace's Secret.

251
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,599
I told him he definitely
can't take the job.

252
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,759
He said, "All right,
I'll move to London, then."

253
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,679
I said, "I won't give in to blackmail.
No is no."

254
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,399
Well... That settles it, then.

255
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,279
I'll give the job
to the other candidate.

256
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,319
He's much better qualified anyway.

257
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,159
Michael did City and Guilds, six months.

258
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,399
Yeah, but he doesn't know racing, Poll.

259
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,399
He knows horses,
but he doesn't know racing.

260
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,959
This other boy, he knows racing.

261
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,919
He's good. He's a fast learner.

262
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,359
What if Michael really leaves?

263
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,879
You just got to let him go, Poll.

264
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,599
He'll get a job in an office in London.

265
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,159
I'm sure he'll write to you.

266
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,719
He made a big speech

267
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,159
about wanting to help you
build up a respectable business.

268
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,999
He's like his dad,
he could make me cry.

269
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,039
There are trains to London.

270
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,879
So I just let him leave?

271
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,279
Every month or so he'd be back.

272
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,519
Unless, of course, he meets a girl.

273
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,719
Then, who knows?

274
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,879
My God.

275
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,999
You want him to do this job.

276
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,079
Polly, I want what you want.

277
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,159
What about this other more
qualified candidate?

278
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,679
Well, I lied, there isn't one.

279
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,239
How much you paying?

280
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,879
- The advertised rate.
- Like hell.

281
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,639
- Three bob.
- Like hell.

282
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,439
- Three and six.
- Four.

283
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,359
Four it is.

284
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,879
- I love him, Tom.
- I know.

285
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,639
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business,

286
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,119
put him charge of the new. Agreed?

287
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,839
Agreed.

288
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,919
Well, Finn, you've got two choices,
mild or mild.

289
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,079
- Mild.
- There you go.

290
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,679
Here he is, look.

291
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,399
Happy birthday, Michael.

292
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,399
Eighteen years old. You're a man today.

293
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,759
Give him a drink, John boy.

294
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,360
- There you go, lad.
- And after that,

295
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,679
we'll go to find you
a lady of the night.

296
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,959
Arthur!

297
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,759
Michael.

298
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,439
What's that?

299
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,719
So you're never late for work.

300
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,399
Welcome to the business,
Michael.

301
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,719
- Welcome to the business.
- Thank you.

302
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,879
Right, come on, let's get him drunk.
Come here, you.

303
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,159
All right, whisky.

304
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,319
No whisky, he's at work tomorrow.
Give him only dark mild.

305
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,439
A toast.

306
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,279
- Toast.
- To Michael.

307
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,959
To Michael.

308
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,839
You all right?

309
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,879
- What is it? Just us?
- Just us.

310
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,279
We celebrating?

311
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,199
Just taste this.

312
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,759
What do you think, Arthur?

313
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,399
Yeah, it's good.
Good stuff, really nice.

314
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,399
Too good for the Garrison.

315
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,839
I suppose we could shift it
to the toffs at the Eden Club.

316
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,999
Why? What is it?

317
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,279
That is part of an export drive.

318
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,759
We now have a secure warehouse
in Camden Town

319
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,759
and secure passage to the Poplar Docks.

320
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,679
So, on Monday morning,

321
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,519
we'll be sending out
our first export crates.

322
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,239
A crate of Riley car spares,

323
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,399
bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia.

324
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,799
Where there's prohibition.

325
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,879
Where there is prohibition.

326
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,999
All over Canada and America,

327
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,039
people are making their own booze
in bathtubs.

328
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,359
But rich people in New York,
in Toronto and Boston

329
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
are still paying a lot of
money for the real stuff.

330
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,959
So, on Monday,
the first Shelby company crates

331
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,159
will contain a thousand
Riley carburettors.

332
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,839
But hidden in the packing
will be 500 bottles

333
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,119
of the finest quality
single malt Scotch whisky.

334
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,319
And we Shelbys, have a licence

335
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,479
granted by the
Minister Of The Empire himself,

336
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,759
which means our crates
won't be searched.

337
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,799
And, Polly, all of the whisky
will be packed at the docks,

338
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,199
so Michael can do the books
without being involved.

339
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,359
Like I've been telling
you all for a year now,

340
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,759
motor cars are the future.

341
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,599
So, how is your life then, Tom?

342
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,319
On the up, Johnny, on the up.

343
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,879
But, Tom, really, come on, how is it?

344
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,039
You know I hate to
see you not even married yet.

345
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,679
I have a fine looking cousin,
she'll make your life hell.

346
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,999
You deserve her!

347
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,479
We haven't had a good old
wedding in a long time.

348
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,959
Rather look inside these boxes,
then, Johnny?

349
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,599
What do I want to look
at car parts, Tommy,

350
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,119
when I haven't even got a car?

351
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,039
Faith in family's a fine thing?

352
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,199
And I wouldn't even be counting.

353
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,919
Twenty-five becomes 24, then 24 it is.

354
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,839
You know I'm no good
with numbers, Tom.

355
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,919
And if 24 ever became 23,

356
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,679
then that'd be tax.

357
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,119
We don't pay tax.

358
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,439
No, Tom.

359
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,719
Good man.

360
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,119
I put an iron door on,

361
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,079
and we've put iron bars on the
windows and across the skylights.

362
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,479
Good.

363
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,240
So what will you
be keeping in here, Tommy?

364
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,679
Temptation, Billy. Temptation.

365
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,759
Morning, Arthur. I was just passing.

366
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,199
I think I'm in fucking love.

367
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,559
Drink!

368
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,759
She don't know where to look.

369
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,519
Whisky, Tommy?

370
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,399
No, I've got a long drive ahead.

371
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,919
You off home?

372
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,359
Eventually.

373
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,079
To Birmingham.

374
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,999
What's this?

375
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,319
Olives.

376
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,999
Yes, it's miscellaneous.

377
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,239
It's, erm, olives.

378
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,519
Sticks, you know, with little bits
of fucking onion and things.

379
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,999
That's what that is.

380
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,199
We've taken 600 pounds on olives.

381
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,119
Yeah, with little bits of onion.

382
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,439
I told you, Arthur...

383
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,799
The dealers sell the cocaine,
we take a cut.

384
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,999
We don't sell direct.

385
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,079
The Home Secretary's cracking down

386
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,999
and I don't want this,

387
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,679
to fuck up everything else,
you understand?

388
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,919
I understand.

389
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,519
How much of that 600
came out of your pocket?

390
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,879
It's under control.

391
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,759
I put you down here cos people
are scared of you, Arthur.

392
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,999
But if you don't straighten up,
it'll be John's turn in London.

393
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,279
No need.

394
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,679
I can handle it.

395
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,719
It's under control?

396
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,319
It's under control.

397
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,239
Fucking tidy profit, though?

398
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,639
It's happening, Tom.

399
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,079
Good.

400
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,119
Straighten up, soldier.

401
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,759
Yes, sir, Sergeant Major.

402
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,239
What's your business?

403
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,079
Sorry, I'm, er, I'm lost here.

404
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,999
Yeah, well, you can't stop here.

405
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,879
- Move on.
- All right.

406
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,519
Twenty-three seconds.

407
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,239
It's all right, Ada,
it'll be Andrew for me.

408
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,119
I'm looking for Ada.

409
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,559
Who are you?

410
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,679
Ada.

411
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,439
I asked you a question.

412
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,239
It's all right, James.

413
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,559
This is my brother.

414
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,959
Who's he?

415
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,359
He rents a room.

416
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,199
You need to rent out rooms?

417
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,079
Actually, she doesn't charge rent.

418
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,639
He's a writer, which means he's skint.

419
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,119
You get up late these days, Ada.

420
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,919
I go to bed late.

421
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,519
Yeah? Where's Karl?

422
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,559
What do you want, Tommy?

423
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,679
God, before you start
sizing him up for a wedding suit,

424
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,399
he's not interested in me.

425
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,759
- Or in girls of any kind.
- Ada!

426
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,279
What? Tommy won't judge you.

427
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,079
He sure as hell won't go to the police.

428
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,159
Look, I'll go and get dressed.

429
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,919
James...

430
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,679
I'm Thomas.

431
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,439
Pleased to meet you.

432
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,399
Can I have a minute
with my sister, please?

433
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,399
Yes, of course.

434
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,279
So, does your lodger know your name?

435
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,039
Yeah. Thorne.

436
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,399
You think I'd tell anybody
anything else?

437
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,239
Your Brummie boys
are all over the papers.

438
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,439
Just one last push?
Then you'll go legit?

439
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,279
Just one more obstacle to get round,
then it'll all be straight?

440
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,879
Actually, yes.

441
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,479
Personally, I find it quite amusing.

442
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,199
Men like you are becoming
very fashionable down here.

443
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,919
No society party in London
is complete without a gangster

444
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,719
for the girls to go giddy for.

445
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,679
Anyway, what is it that you want?

446
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,599
I don't have any children, Ada,

447
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,879
so I have set up a trust fund.

448
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,679
The beneficiaries
will be John's kids and Karl.

449
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,959
In order for Karl to benefit,
I need your signature.

450
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,439
I've set up an account.

451
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,639
The money will be transferred
in the event of my death.

452
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,999
It'll set them up for a new life.

453
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,999
Are you sick?

454
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,759
I'm just doing
what any ordinary man would,

455
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,319
putting my affairs in order.

456
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,679
Did you know they was
going to take the Eden club?

457
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,479
I know about the Eden club, yes.

458
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,736
Did you know they were going
to do it before they did it?

459
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,399
Because that's someone
who's in charge, isn't it?

460
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,079
The one who knows before it happens.

461
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,639
I know what I know, you know.

462
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,919
If you don't know,
then you don't fucking know, do you?

463
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,439
Did you know they was going
to take Wimbledon Docks?

464
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,479
Harringay? The trotting tracks?

465
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,159
Talk, all right?
I genuinely want to hear you.

466
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,559
You've lost control, Alfie.

467
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,959
Have I?

468
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,479
Everybody knows.

469
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,719
- Talk to me, Alfie.
- Talk to you?

470
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,479
All right, I'll talk to you.
I'll fucking tell you how it was, right?

471
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,519
What happened was this.

472
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,119
All the time you were talking about
dirty fucking Jews.

473
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,439
All the fucking time,

474
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,839
dirty fucking Jews, dirty Kikes,
dirty dustbin lids...

475
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,416
- Everyone makes jokes.
- You want to talk about

476
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,679
- not getting into places?
- Everybody makes fucking jokes.

477
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,119
I didn't know you had
no sense of humour!

478
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,639
And I ain't going
to fucking mention, right,

479
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,039
the great big fuck off elephant
in the room.

480
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,919
Look, Alfie...

481
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,719
How many of my bookies
worked Epsom this last May?

482
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,519
None. None.

483
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,399
Not one.

484
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,319
So, for a few fucking jokes and Epsom,

485
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,879
you fucking invite
a tribe of savages into the city

486
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,919
and just fucking
unlock the fucking gates!

487
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,999
I'm sorry, what are you saying, mate?

488
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,079
I'm saying...

489
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,959
I'm sorry about the Jew thing.

490
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,559
- You saying you're sorry?
- Yeah.

491
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,359
- You're sorry about the Jew thing?
- Yeah.

492
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,839
- Really?
- Yeah.

493
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,439
I want that in writing.
Write that down. He said, "I'm sorry".

494
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,479
And also write down

495
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,319
that all our bookies
can go back to Epsom.

496
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,079
- He didn't say that.
- Who's asking you?

497
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,319
Write it down.

498
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,759
It's all right. Come on.

499
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,319
Alfie's an old friend.

500
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,279
My friend.

501
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,239
Now, admit it,

502
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,359
the Peaky Blinders is out of control.

503
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,759
Yeah, they're out
of fucking control, mate.

504
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,159
They come down the canal,
they spread like the fucking clap.

505
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,399
Right. So now they're

506
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,079
- everybody's problem.
- Yeah.

507
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,439
Alfie.

508
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,719
You and me, we've been fighting

509
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,479
- since we was at school.
- Yeah.

510
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,759
All right? Now, also,

511
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,879
- we've been friends.
- Yeah.

512
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,879
You know,
it goes backwards and forwards.

513
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,600
How much better is it
when we're friends?

514
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,559
It's much better, mate, yeah.

515
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,239
You write that down.

516
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,159
So what we're doing here, right,

517
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,879
is we're writing down some
kind of a deal thing, right?

518
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,559
- Yeah, a written deal.
- Written deal, good.

519
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,839
Well, why don't we discuss
the border between the Italians

520
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,959
and the Jews going back
to Farringdon Road.

521
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,640
- Farringdon Road...
- Yeah, Farringdon Road.

522
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,519
Fuck! That's ancient history.

523
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,440
- Write down Farringdon Road.
- No, no, no, write down Camden Road.

524
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,199
- Farringdon Road.
- Camden Road.

525
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,416
- Write down Farringdon.
- Camden.

526
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,559
- Farringdon.
- Camden.

527
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,399
Write down Camden Road.

528
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,319
Just write down "peace".

529
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,439
Just write down "peace", right,

530
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,839
between the Jews and the Italians.

531
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,119
And war against the gypsies.

532
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,599
Fuck.

533
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,879
Mr Thomas Shelby, madam.

534
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,879
Nice house.

535
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,479
Would you like a whisky?

536
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,599
Scotch or Irish?

537
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,719
Irish.

538
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,439
Sorry for the short notice.

539
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,599
I was passing.

540
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,639
We're not quite on the Birmingham road.

541
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,879
It was a small diversion.

542
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,479
Sixty miles, I checked.

543
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,479
That's a small diversion these days.

544
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,839
So, I'm a small diversion.

545
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,159
Good.

546
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,799
Your horse is still out on the gallops,

547
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,679
but I had Mickey prepare this report.

548
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,081
You can read it now if you'd like,
then we can go see her.

549
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,976
Is there enough light for you to read?

550
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,279
Yes, it's fine.

551
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,319
It's getting quite late.

552
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,880
Mickey says she has
the lungs of an elephant.

553
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,640
She's nimble in the heavy going,

554
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,280
but bounces a little on the hard ground.

555
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,199
Sorry, I'll let you read.

556
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,959
So, he thinks she'll favour
good to soft ground?

557
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,599
A little juice in the grass.

558
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,359
Well, that's good for Epsom.

559
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,039
Does he think she's
not good enough for Epsom?

560
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,839
She needs a lot of work.

561
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,319
The race board will need convincing.

562
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,319
I imagine you have some influence.

563
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,560
That's the suggested programme
for the next two months.

564
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,799
Your glass is empty.

565
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,759
It's fine.

566
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,559
Are you hungry?

567
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,599
Yes, a bit.

568
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,719
I can prepare something.

569
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,479
Do you have engine oil?

570
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,039
Before I set off for Birmingham,
the car needs oil.

571
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,919
I'm sure my husband
kept some in the garage.

572
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,399
I can get someone to do it.

573
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,239
This evening or tomorrow?

574
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,999
Well, we're so far from anywhere,
people usually stay over.

575
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,496
Especially before cars,
when it was just carriages,

576
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,159
people used to stay over all the time.

577
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,279
But I have a car.

578
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,759
Yes.

579
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,159
And you have engine oil.

580
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,599
Probably.

581
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,679
But it would be very usual.

582
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,399
What would?

583
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,199
For a guest to stay.

584
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,039
We have a whole wing
called the guest wing.

585
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,079
You...

586
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,959
You have a guest wing.

587
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,559
Well...

588
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,319
May.

589
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,079
Have a smoke.

590
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,799
Thank you.

591
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,879
Ignore this. It's actually all right.

592
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,559
I put all his photos
in a drawer and locked it...

593
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,919
As if that was going
to make a difference.

594
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,599
I'm like a fucking lighthouse keeper...

595
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,359
Out here on my own...

596
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,719
Keeping his flame burning.

597
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,479
But, of course,
when anyone sees a lighthouse

598
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,639
they steer clear, don't they?

599
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,919
Now, do you have a map?

600
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,599
Of the house. Do you have a map?

601
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,199
Because I'm not going to be able
to find my way in the dark.

602
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,479
You see, at midnight,

603
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,399
I'm going to leave my wing

604
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,599
and I'm going to come find you.

605
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,439
And I'm going to turn the handle
of your bedroom door

606
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,479
without making a sound

607
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,279
and none of the maids will know.

608
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,359
You don't know maids.

609
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,399
They hear a pin drop?

610
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,079
If there's a man in the house,
they listen.

611
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,599
They take turns.

612
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,479
So, let them listen.

613
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,359
Right. Day rate, seven shillings.
Loading, unloading.

614
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,199
Night rate, three. Total ten.

615
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,759
Let's go and get a drink.

616
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,239
No, I'm all right.

617
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,919
Come on, it's payday.

618
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,439
Everybody has a drink on payday.

619
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,039
Not me.

620
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,479
You think your mum
don't have a drink on payday?

621
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,319
You think the Lord Almighty
don't have a drink on payday?

622
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,079
Man, it's on fire out there,

623
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,159
women from the BSA offices, honest.

624
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,039
They go out on their own
without their men these days,

625
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,439
in twos and threes now.

626
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,359
Mickey, they go out in twos and
threes and buy their own drinks.

627
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,639
The Marquis,
that's where the BSA secretaries go.

628
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,479
Look, they won't serve a black man
without a Shelby by his side.

629
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,119
So you're using me?

630
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,479
Yeah.

631
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,079
Come on.

632
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,599
I told you, I fucking told you,
this city's gone mad.

633
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,559
Girls go out on their own now.

634
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,639
Two pints of dark mild, please.

635
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,639
Fuck that. We're Peaky boys.

636
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,159
Two whiskies.

637
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,519
You get used to it, then you can't stop.

638
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,559
I don't drink with blacks.

639
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,359
Here we fucking go.

640
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,799
Paddy, they're okay.

641
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,519
Not with me, they're not.

642
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,559
I don't drink in pubs with blacks.

643
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,959
So leave.

644
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,399
Look, my dad is the preacher round here.

645
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,399
He has connections, ask anybody.

646
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,840
I couldn't give a fuck who he is.

647
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,039
I'm telling you to leave it, Paddy.

648
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,719
And I'm telling this darkie
to get out of here.

649
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,199
You know something? Fuck off.

650
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,999
It's all right, Isaiah, come on,
leave it.

651
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,359
- We'll go to my cousin's pub.
- I like it here.

652
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,839
You fucking nigger.

653
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,279
Paddy! The white kid's a Peaky Blinder!

654
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,079
He's Polly Shelby's son!

655
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,519
He's Polly Shelby's son!
Are you fucking suicidal?

656
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,479
Sir...

657
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,799
Sir, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

658
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,559
Get out!

659
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,079
Get out the fucking pub.

660
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,919
I clearly didn't know.

661
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,239
Fuck, let's go. Let's go!

662
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,319
We ordered some drinks

663
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,359
and we're going to drink them.

664
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,039
His face, man.
Did you see his fucking face?

665
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,879
You punch like a fucking kangaroo.

666
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,919
I seen one once in a circus,
you punch like that.

667
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,959
All right, anyway,
I need a fucking drink.

668
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,759
- It's on you.
- It's on me? You just got paid.

669
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,239
Yeah, from you.

670
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,999
You can get a whisky,
maybe even a dark mild.

671
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,519
Fucking hell,
it's packed in here, isn't it?

672
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,560
So it's as easy as that?

673
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,959
Easy as that, John boy.
London, you wouldn't believe it.

674
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,759
Finn, stick your head in a bucket.

675
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,319
No.

676
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,719
The women, John boy, the women...

677
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,719
I've got this one,
she's a dancer, right?

678
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,599
She can do things with her...

679
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,320
If Finn would just piss off,
I'd explain a little bit better.

680
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,759
Well, if it's so good, why are you here?

681
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,439
Decent pints.

682
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,319
The cockneys can't get that right.

683
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,759
He misses us, Finn, that's what it is.

684
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,199
Here they are, look, junior Peaky boys.

685
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,759
What's happened to you?
You been scrapping?

686
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,759
Some idiots at the Marquis of Lorne.

687
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,599
Tried to stop me and Isaiah
from drinking, but it's all right.

688
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,199
We fought them off.

689
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,519
Arthur, we had to stand
our ground and we did.

690
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,199
The Marquis? Where's your dad?

691
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,039
- Preaching.
- Right.

692
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,239
Don't nick any of me chips, Finn!

693
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,280
- Where are you going?
- We won't be long.

694
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,399
Where are they going?

695
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,719
The Marquis of Lorne.

696
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,399
Shame.

697
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,039
It was a nice pub.

698
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,439
Up. Bet the big bastard got cut.

699
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,079
You didn't have to do that for me.

700
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,639
We didn't do it for you, Michael.

701
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,879
We did it for the good name
of the company.

702
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,359
None of this happened, all right?

703
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,399
Come on, let's go and get that drink.

704
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,759
The date has been set.

705
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,679
Three weeks from today.

706
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,839
You checked out his house?

707
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,359
There's coppers all over it.

708
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,679
You'll take care of them?

709
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,959
No. That would arouse suspicion.

710
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,239
You'll have to deal with them yourself.

711
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,839
And if a copper gets killed?

712
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,039
There will be no consequences
for you, I have given you my word.

713
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,999
Which I know to be worthless.

714
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,959
That is why I have been settling
my affairs in the event of my death.

715
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,439
And making your peace
with God, perhaps?

716
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,479
Well, good luck with that.

717
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,479
I have made arrangements
with men I trust.

718
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,519
If I should die,

719
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,039
then you will die.

720
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,999
Know that.

721
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,559
Ritz Hotel.

722
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,079
London, Piccadilly.

723
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,239
Hello?

724
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,079
- Who was that?
- Call got cut.

725
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,976
I guess the telephone lines
in England are not so good?
