1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,524
<i>Previously on Prison Break...</i>

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,145
This is an overview.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,879
That's just the beginning of
what's on here.

4
00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:07,140
You honor your side
of the agreement,

5
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:08,071
and I will do
the unveiling

6
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:08,969
at the conference
tomorrow.

7
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:10,924
I thought we were working
with these people.

8
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:11,713
So did I.

9
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:13,889
Damn well almost got

10
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:14,750
<i>our asses handed to us,</i>

11
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:16,339
- getting these.
- These things are for tomorrow.

12
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:18,013
I want Scylla today!

13
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,330
Vincent Sandinsky.

14
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:20,318
Yes?

15
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,080
Let's go.

16
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,026
What are you going
to do?

17
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:24,640
I warned you not to come,
Michael.

18
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:25,909
Well,
it's not over,

19
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,109
not by a long shot.

20
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:29,939
Christina Rose Scofield.

21
00:00:29,974 --> 00:00:31,279
That name mean anything
to you?

22
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:32,106
No.

23
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:33,383
Yes.

24
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:35,457
How badly
do you want him, Mom?

25
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:37,676
Michael,
listen to me.

26
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:38,890
That's not an answer.

27
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,184
I'll be in touch.

28
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:49,757
I get the ass-kicking
of a lifetime

29
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,801
and you come back
empty-handed?

30
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:53,877
- What?
- Linc and Michael's mother--

31
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:54,806
<i>She's got Scylla,</i>

32
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:56,357
here in Miami.

33
00:00:56,392 --> 00:00:57,499
Fuel the jet.

34
00:00:58,353 --> 00:00:59,751
We're going to Miami.

35
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,878
The guy knows
something.

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,382
Hey.

37
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,565
I don't know what else
I can do to help you guys.

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,194
Please let me go.

39
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:16,498
<i>I-I won't say a word
to anyone</i>

40
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:17,009
about this.

41
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,767
Never heard of the name
Christina Scofield?

42
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:19,643
<i>I told you, no.</i>

43
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:20,992
Never?

44
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:22,006
Never.

45
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:30,230
Yeah.

46
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:32,322
<i>That guy you picked up
at the airport.</i>

47
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:34,974
There's something
you should know.

48
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:36,112
<i>What do you mean?</i>

49
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:38,926
He's not some innocent victim,
Linc.

50
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:42,233
He and Christina
have been exchanging e-mails,

51
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,679
<i>phone calls,
you name it.</i>

52
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:45,343
<i>They've got
some kind of plan.</i>

53
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:46,003
<i>I just...</i>

54
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,780
haven't figured it
out yet.

55
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:49,800
Thanks.

56
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:51,410
So what are you going to do
with him, Linc?

57
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:55,000
Leave town, Michael.

58
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:57,042
Linc?

59
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:03,484
Where's Scylla?

60
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:04,549
No.

61
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:05,845
Where's Scylla?!

62
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:16,831
You ready?

63
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,362
Almost.

64
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:20,350
- Is that Sandinsky's phone?
- Yeah.

65
00:02:29,193 --> 00:02:30,123
Good luck.

66
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:32,000
Thanks,
I may need it.

67
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:41,088
It's Michael again

68
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:42,510
on Sandinsky's phone.

69
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:44,133
<i>I thought
he turned it off.</i>

70
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:44,890
Well, now it's on.

71
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:45,711
Track it.

72
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:47,799
Michael?

73
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,363
Hello, Christina.

74
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:51,602
I hope

75
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:52,743
you're ready to talk.

76
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:54,864
Let's start with
Vincent Sandinsky.

77
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:56,683
<i>Vincent Sandinsky,</i>

78
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,684
the scientist?

79
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,243
He, uh,
he's an old friend of mine.

80
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,762
A bit of a bore,
don't you think?

81
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,322
But who cares about him?

82
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,892
I'd rather
talk about you.

83
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:08,637
<i>I'd rather meet you
face-to-face.</i>

84
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:12,146
Unless you're bringing me Scylla,
I'm not interested.

85
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,159
<i>No Scylla, no meeting.</i>

86
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,612
That's all I can offer.

87
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:18,732
What do you hope
to accomplish?

88
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,046
<i>I need your answer</i>

89
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:20,953
<i>in ten minutes,
and that's</i>

90
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:22,393
the last time
I'm calling back.

91
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:27,618
And found him.

92
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,379
He's in an industrial park
in El Portal.

93
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:32,509
Right up the coast.

94
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:33,319
All right...

95
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:34,739
Let's go.

96
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:39,178
You're lying,
you're lying.

97
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:40,340
I don't work
for the Company.

98
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,175
Six words
that never prove true.

99
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,238
Come on, man,
this is over, look around!

100
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:46,034
What are you doing here?!

101
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:47,380
- I swear I don't know anything, I do!
- What are you doing here?

102
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:48,122
I don't know anything.

103
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:49,254
I don't know
what he's talking about.

104
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,776
I am here
for a conference.

105
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:51,125
That's all.

106
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,385
I don't know
who told you otherwise.

107
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,006
<i>I do,</i>

108
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,567
and Michael's
also full of crap.

109
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,026
He's got
no reason to lie.

110
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,150
Actually, he does.

111
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:58,934
Michael's leading us off the scent,
so he can get in...

112
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:00,392
He doesn't want Christina
to have Scylla

113
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:01,482
any more
than we do.

114
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,574
It's not the first time

115
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,369
<i>he's lied to us.</i>

116
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:04,936
Where is it?

117
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:08,788
<i>No.</i>

118
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:09,705
- Linc.
- <i>Come on, Linc,</i>

119
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,936
he can't talk
if he's dead.

120
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:13,854
You got
three seconds.

121
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,172
No.

122
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:17,152
<i>Burrows!</i>

123
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,337
Put the gun down.

124
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:25,974
Vincent and I
need to talk.

125
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:34,146
Vincent?

126
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:35,159
Yeah.

127
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,672
Yeah.

128
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,409
We had a deal.

129
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:40,559
New deal.

130
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,015
I'm taking charge.

131
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:45,609
<i>Vincent and I</i>

132
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:46,688
are old friends.

133
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:48,414
<i>Where'd you find him?</i>

134
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:50,707
At an airstrip.

135
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:52,804
He's got something to do
with Scylla.

136
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,026
<i>Good.</i>

137
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:57,110
Then you can help me
find it,

138
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:58,072
can't you,
Vincent?

139
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:02,932
And you can help me find
Christina Scofield.

140
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:07,241
Dr. Sandinsky
has been

141
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:10,016
a Company operative
since--

142
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:11,790
How long's it been,
Vincent?

143
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,645
21 years.

144
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,713
21 years of service.

145
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,292
Scientist,
statistician,

146
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:21,689
expert field combatant.

147
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:24,045
What brought you
to Miami?

148
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:28,905
Does that help?

149
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:31,000
<i>She invited me,
okay?</i>

150
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:32,163
She invited me.

151
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,227
- Who?
- Christina Scofield.

152
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:35,468
I'm working with her.

153
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,062
Oh, that brings you
full circle,

154
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:37,873
doesn't it,
Burrows?

155
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:39,400
<i>But you knew that
already.</i>

156
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:41,233
When were you
planning on

157
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:43,820
telling me that your mother
was behind all this?

158
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:46,393
We just found out.

159
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,415
But bottom line is,
you knew.

160
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:50,183
All of you!

161
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,429
On your knees.

162
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:58,996
You heard him,
get down.

163
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,727
Oh, not you.

164
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,665
<i>I don't need
to make deals</i>

165
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,845
with men
who can't do their jobs.

166
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,598
If Bagwell is the only one
who is competent here...

167
00:06:10,797 --> 00:06:12,080
- What?!
- <i>He'll do it alone.</i>

168
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:12,981
Are you serious?!

169
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:14,430
Who do you think
found this guy?!

170
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,153
Where's Scylla?

171
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:22,104
I don't know.

172
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:24,172
I don't.

173
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:26,847
She doesn't tell me
where she keeps it,

174
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:29,006
<i>but I do know
where she's staying.</i>

175
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:31,460
A place called
Edgewater Tower,

176
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:32,888
Room 1099.

177
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,873
You have today.

178
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,760
One day.

179
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:09,082
S04E19:
S.O.B.

180
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,714
You're wasting time,
Burrows.

181
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:17,345
One day.

182
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:28,760
You tipped him off.

183
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:35,298
<i>No, Bagwell.</i>

184
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:37,944
<i>You stay here.</i>

185
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,278
<i>Yeah, Theodore.</i>

186
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:41,651
He needs you.

187
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,811
But you'd better
stay away from us.

188
00:07:54,752 --> 00:07:56,862
This is where Michael's signal
is coming from?

189
00:07:57,197 --> 00:07:58,241
Perfect.

190
00:07:58,685 --> 00:07:59,733
<i>Be careful.</i>

191
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:17,688
Stay here.

192
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,525
Check it out.

193
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:04,928
Let's go.

194
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:06,341
Let's go!

195
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:08,306
He's leaving.

196
00:09:14,715 --> 00:09:16,455
Come on,
he can't be that far away.

197
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:17,564
Let's go.

198
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:25,358
Out.

199
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:44,815
Alright, let's go.

200
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:07,859
<i>All right.</i>

201
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,100
Where is it?

202
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,477
You don't really expect me
to answer that, do you?

203
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,573
<i>Actually, I do.</i>

204
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,824
Because your life
depends on it,

205
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,730
and considering
your track record,

206
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,130
I think it's safe
to assume

207
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:26,355
that you're always looking out
for number one.

208
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,846
I've waited 25 years
for this moment, Michael.

209
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:34,010
There's no way
I can say everything

210
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:34,850
I want to say.

211
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:35,939
Why should I let you?

212
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,550
<i>Because
I'm your mother.</i>

213
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,373
That's something
you can't change.

214
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,768
<i>It's something
you can't take away.</i>

215
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,403
It's nice to meet you,
Sara.

216
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,460
<i>In some ways,
Michael's done very well</i>

217
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:52,432
for himself.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,727
In other ways,
I'm not so sure.

219
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:58,536
Lincoln has led you down
a dark path.

220
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,371
I make my own decisions.

221
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,113
You break Lincoln

222
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:03,702
out of prison
and he goes to work

223
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:04,680
for General Krantz.

224
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,133
And he has his reasons.

225
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,690
But if you're looking for
some kind of common ground

226
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:12,512
between us,
maybe that's it.

227
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,405
I don't want
to see Lincoln working

228
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:15,629
for the Company, either.

229
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,322
At least you've stopped
making excuses for him.

230
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,880
I stopped
making judgments.

231
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,062
Something
I couldn't afford.

232
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,403
But that was a long

233
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,339
<i>time ago,
and that's not why we're here.</i>

234
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,942
No.

235
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,645
You're right.

236
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,882
None of us wants to see Scylla
go back to the Company.

237
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,568
So, if we can
put the past behind us,

238
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,954
maybe we can work
something out.

239
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,352
Like what?

240
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:42,915
Like a deal.

241
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:44,638
"A deal"?

242
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,760
All right,

243
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:49,404
<i>you tell me
where Scylla is,</i>

244
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,109
and we'll work out
the details later.

245
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,427
We'll go 50-50.

246
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,551
A mother-son operation?

247
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,488
Maybe.

248
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,882
But first, Scylla.

249
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:02,767
Please, Michael,
I know better.

250
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,298
We're very similar.

251
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,662
I know what it's like to look
at the big picture,

252
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,723
see all the
little moving parts...

253
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,028
How much easier it is to think
after the surgery.

254
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,084
I know you.

255
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,740
That's why you'll never be able
to manipulate me

256
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,357
like you do
the rest of the world.

257
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,608
You're running
out of time.

258
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,913
All right,
there's no one back here!

259
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,730
Well, they were here,
but of course,

260
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:56,734
there's nobody here now.

261
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,012
'Cause that's
what happens.

262
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,515
<i>You know,
this...</i>

263
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:02,475
whole thing...

264
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,195
It's just...

265
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,979
It's just...
crap!

266
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,102
It's just waste.

267
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,075
We're always
one move behind,

268
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,188
<i>every step
of the way.</i>

269
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,337
Yeah, and it's just going to get
worse now that Bagwell

270
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:14,820
is breathing down
our backs.

271
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,899
How do you make
that kind of mistake, huh?!

272
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,655
And let that inbred
get anywhere near us.

273
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:20,146
<i>No, no, no,
no, no, no...</i>

274
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:22,405
The first mistake
was working for Krantz.

275
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,415
<i>Okay,
that was the first mistake.</i>

276
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:24,283
<i>What do you think's
going to happen</i>

277
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:25,984
now that he's in town
and he has his goons

278
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,183
<i>calling the shots?</i>

279
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:28,325
<i>What's going
to happen now?</i>

280
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,648
<i>Yeah,
I should've known better...</i>

281
00:13:30,682 --> 00:13:32,328
than to get
anywhere near this.

282
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,191
All right, you know what?
We should go.

283
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,464
- <i>Let's go.</i>
- No, we can't go,

284
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,873
because you saw the photos,
right?

285
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,233
You saw the photos,
so you know

286
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,266
what he's going to do
with them.

287
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,729
We should have known

288
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,829
what he was going
to do with them!

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,946
- That's what we should've...
- Hey, hey, hey! Just calm down.

290
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:46,506
You know what,
the deal is over.

291
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,044
Okay?
You know it, I know it.

292
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,827
<i>Everybody knows it.</i>

293
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:49,830
<i>We're not getting
out of here!</i>

294
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,085
<i>We're going to take a walk
right to the gallows,</i>

295
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,630
or somebody else is going
to stab us in the back!

296
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,598
I did that walk
and I survived.

297
00:13:57,194 --> 00:13:58,565
<i>Even if we win...</i>

298
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,805
Do we win?

299
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,302
<i>You don't believe that,
do you?</i>

300
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:02,716
Look, I'm going to do
what I got to do.

301
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,985
If you don't want
to roll with me,

302
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:04,652
that's fine.

303
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,895
<i>What is that?</i>

304
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,968
Rental receipt,
a silver minivan.

305
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:14,897
What is this?

306
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,530
What do you know
about this?

307
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:30,942
We found a whole...

308
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:32,715
box of them
down in Little Cuba.

309
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,778
Guns, too.

310
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:36,003
What do you know
about this?

311
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,555
She wanted me
to speak there.

312
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,474
About Scylla?

313
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,757
She said
she'd give me the script

314
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,130
beforehand,
that's all I know.

315
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:50,090
She said her interest
was purely scientific.

316
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,378
Her interest
was financial.

317
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,960
She came to me
about a year ago with an idea.

318
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,482
<i>Rather than
build our organization</i>

319
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,432
with Scylla
as the permanent cornerstone,

320
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,141
she wanted to use
the technology

321
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:02,675
to make a quick profit.

322
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,837
<i>If certain events
occurred,</i>

323
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:07,003
various nations
might feel the need

324
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:09,607
for a more
modern defense system,

325
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,555
<i>and they'd come to us
for the answers.</i>

326
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,083
Solar weaponry.

327
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,181
Water desalinazation.

328
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,191
Now, what do you know
about all this?

329
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:19,213
I told you all I know.

330
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,612
<i>Well, I thought
it was a crazy idea.</i>

331
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,730
Plan of an amateur.

332
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,231
But I figured
she'd be angry.

333
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,984
She wasn't allowed
to hold a card.

334
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:30,985
Yeah...

335
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,431
Now,
what was that?

336
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,320
I think
it's more than that.

337
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,510
Really?

338
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,028
What did
she tell you?

339
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,900
I know how
the Company operates.

340
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,126
Shell corporations
like Ecofield,

341
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:50,342
rampant misuse
of funds.

342
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,875
You're literally,
sitting on a gold mine.

343
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:55,860
But your leadership

344
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,587
only benefits
you and your friends,

345
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:59,369
ten generations
in the future.

346
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:02,090
And you...

347
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,302
would like to see
the Company implode?

348
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,505
I want to see
something happen.

349
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,780
You think too small.

350
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,549
Laos?

351
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:17,200
<i>We'll all be dead</i>

352
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,360
before that pays off.

353
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:21,881
Uh, "Laos," sir?

354
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,963
Don't trouble yourself.

355
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:28,179
Burrows?

356
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,067
I got a question
for your friend.

357
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,939
What is it?

358
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,732
Ask him what the letters
"DMB" mean.

359
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,730
Do the letters

360
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,363
<i>"DMB" mean
anything to you?</i>

361
00:16:44,106 --> 00:16:45,020
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,339
I thought
you understood me.

363
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:54,802
She said
her place is

364
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:57,689
on the same block as
Dade-Miami Bank.

365
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:01,861
Did you hear that?

366
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,679
I got it.

367
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,689
He'd better be
telling the truth.

368
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,115
See what else
the doctor knows.

369
00:17:08,396 --> 00:17:10,918
- No...
- What's Christina's plan?!

370
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,345
I don't know.

371
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,540
I don't know.

372
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:19,647
Maybe we should've...

373
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,128
Maybe we should've
followed her or something.

374
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,252
Sit down for me.

375
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:26,753
Please?

376
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,030
How about
I talk to her?

377
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,098
I might have
some perspective.

378
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,897
She didn't leave me
when I was six.

379
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:39,438
Okay.

380
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,118
I'm sorry
we had to meet this way, Sara.

381
00:17:53,153 --> 00:17:54,681
I'm sorry
we had to meet at all.

382
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,277
<i>Michael's been through
a lot in</i>

383
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:57,216
<i>the last year
at some point.</i>

384
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:58,512
It's going to be
too much for him.

385
00:17:58,953 --> 00:17:59,962
Michael can handle it.

386
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,130
He's never known a life

387
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,216
without change.

388
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,381
Oh, you say that
like you know him.

389
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,224
Oh, I do.

390
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:06,973
Better than you.

391
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:09,432
I don't see
how that's possible.

392
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,679
Well, you will
when your child's born.

393
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,160
<i>See, I wasn't sure at first,
but you do have</i>

394
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:19,366
that drawn look.

395
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,169
And I see the way
you protect

396
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:23,299
yourself
when you sense danger.

397
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,125
You don't even know
you're doing it.

398
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,250
It's instinct.

399
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,808
And what is it you know about
maternal instinct?

400
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:33,326
I've tried
to be a mother.

401
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,440
Even to Lincoln.

402
00:18:34,476 --> 00:18:35,786
How can you
say that?

403
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,389
You left them...

404
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,575
without so much
as an explanation.

405
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,656
But if Michael
would listen--

406
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:44,857
<i>You know what?
You can stop.</i>

407
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,172
You can't justify
what you did.

408
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,672
<i>Michael doesn't know
you're pregnant,</i>

409
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,442
<i>does he?</i>

410
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,796
What happened?

411
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,399
Uh...
I got nothing.

412
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:22,650
- Hello, Joyce.
- Hi.

413
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,809
How are you?
My name is, uh, Don Self,

414
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,261
Homeland Security.
Don't worry,

415
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:27,016
there's nothing the matter.

416
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:29,230
I'm just here doing a favor
for my friend.

417
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:31,090
See, his mother passed away
yesterday.

418
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,090
<i>Okay, and her last will
and testament</i>

419
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,929
<i>is in, uh,
one of your security boxes.</i>

420
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:36,819
It's actually Box 6468.

421
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:38,433
<i>Is he authorized
to access it?</i>

422
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,164
<i>See, that's the problem.
He's not.</i>

423
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,860
<i>But we're willing to fill out
all the paperwork...</i>

424
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,308
I'm sorry.
Only authorized individuals are allowed

425
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:45,502
- to access safe deposit...
- Listen, lady,

426
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:46,591
I need to get
in that box.

427
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,522
Where's your boss?

428
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,395
<i>Sir?</i>

429
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,760
Sir, can I help you?

430
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,369
Yeah. I need to get in my mom's
safe deposit box.

431
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:53,990
- Do you have a court order?
- No.

432
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,890
- DMB policy prevents anyone--
- Here's the policy.

433
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,821
Okay,
I need to open Box 6468

434
00:19:57,856 --> 00:19:59,700
<i>right now.
Name's Don Self, Homeland Security.</i>

435
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,802
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Frank?</i>

436
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,623
Number 6468
was accessed a minute ago.

437
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,660
<i>He just left.</i>

438
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,464
It was the guy
with the silver suitcase.

439
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,391
There he is.

440
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,236
Hey, that looks like the guy
from the embassy.

441
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,483
Mr. Banarjee,
how are you?

442
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,566
I'm trying to reach
Christina Hampton.

443
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:47,164
She's in a meeting
right now.

444
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,176
If I don't talk to her
before five...

445
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,311
The deal is off.

446
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,074
<i>Okay.</i>

447
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,862
This is
my final offer.

448
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,836
You're going to take me
to Scylla,

449
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,537
and then
you can walk.

450
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,107
No questions.

451
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,653
No one
tells the General.

452
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:24,186
You can live
the rest of your life

453
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:25,064
like this
never happened,

454
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,830
but Scylla is mine.

455
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,883
Lincoln would never let
that happen.

456
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,447
He doesn't have to know.

457
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:34,377
Even as children,
you couldn't agree.

458
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,328
You fought about
everything.

459
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,721
The two of you couldn't
be more different.

460
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,518
But you know that,
don't you, Michael?

461
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,850
This isn't about Lincoln.

462
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,333
You have blue eyes,
he has green.

463
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,229
<i>He played with trucks.</i>

464
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,602
You took apart
the television set.

465
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,800
And I don't
need to point out

466
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:55,674
the difference in IQ...

467
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:57,963
<i>or temperament.</i>

468
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,700
<i>You know
what I'm getting at,</i>

469
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,569
don't you,
Michael?

470
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:06,285
<i>I don't have
any idea</i>

471
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:08,172
what you're talking about.

472
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,978
You've always known it
deep in your heart.

473
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,313
You just had
no one to confirm it.

474
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,599
Lincoln...

475
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,825
isn't your brother.

476
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,483
It's true.

477
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,154
I-I should have
told you before,

478
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,277
but you always
looked up to him, and...

479
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,999
<i>I had no idea
things would happen like this.</i>

480
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,839
You don't know
what you're saying.

481
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:52,930
Have you ever

482
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,368
seen pictures of Lincoln
as a baby?

483
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:57,585
- Yes.
- No.

484
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:00,757
There aren't any.

485
00:23:03,878 --> 00:23:07,449
<i>Your father didn't adopt him
until he was three years old.</i>

486
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,070
<i>His parents
worked for the Company.</i>

487
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:15,582
They were killed
in an explosion in Manila.

488
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:17,982
<i>Aldo brought him home
the next day.</i>

489
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:19,478
He felt
it was his duty.

490
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,256
He didn't ask me
how I felt.

491
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,471
I...
I never bonded with him

492
00:23:27,502 --> 00:23:28,860
like mother and son.

493
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:33,146
He was always
so angry.

494
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,918
Understandably so...

495
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:38,063
<i>He was too young</i>

496
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:40,497
to remember
his mother, but...

497
00:23:42,114 --> 00:23:44,477
<i>He always knew
something was missing.</i>

498
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,612
I can't believe
you're playing this card.

499
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,165
I'm sorry, Michael.

500
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,535
<i>But I felt
differently about you.</i>

501
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,307
And you could tell.

502
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,089
That's why

503
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:02,624
<i>you always felt guilty.</i>

504
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,980
<i>Why you were always</i>

505
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,760
throwing yourself
over the cliff

506
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,909
after Lincoln was already dead
at the bottom.

507
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:11,015
It's why you went to prison
and pissed your life away.

508
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,008
You don't know
why I did

509
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:14,134
the things I did!

510
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:15,470
You weren't there!

511
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,596
Who knows what
you could have accomplished.

512
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,183
<i>But you always felt
like you had to</i>

513
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:25,457
<i>make less of yourself...</i>

514
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:30,222
To make Lincoln look
less pathetic in comparison.

515
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:33,450
Lincoln was more

516
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:37,370
of a brother to me
than you were ever a mother.

517
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,034
<i>You left.</i>

518
00:24:40,483 --> 00:24:41,569
<i>He stayed.</i>

519
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,177
He fed me.

520
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,390
Kept me
off the streets.

521
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,777
Put me through school.

522
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,904
How?

523
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,060
By getting in trouble
over and over again,

524
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,545
just like he is
right now.

525
00:24:57,908 --> 00:24:59,342
What do you mean,
right now?

526
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:00,237
Where is he?

527
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:01,060
He's out

528
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,035
looking for Scylla,
and he's not going to find it.

529
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:06,850
Maybe you should call him
and tell him.

530
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:09,978
<i>Unless
there's too much</i>

531
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,604
bad blood
between you.

532
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,552
Or no blood.

533
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,615
Who's the guy
in the ring?

534
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,574
Is it Michael?

535
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:49,455
He's gonna be all right.
Just, just relax.

536
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,430
Where is he?

537
00:26:00,497 --> 00:26:01,946
All right,
keep up with him, come on.

538
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,427
<i>I am.</i>

539
00:26:02,431 --> 00:26:03,316
Just shut up.

540
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,084
<i>It's not that I</i>

541
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:12,360
don't want to help you.

542
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:15,499
It's just that I hate to see you
go running after him again.

543
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:20,529
- Come here!
- Michael.

544
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:23,629
- Michael!
- Where is he?

545
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,701
Okay.
You want to go running after him,

546
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,287
flush your life
down the toilet

547
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,276
<i>once and for all?
Go ahead!</i>

548
00:26:32,983 --> 00:26:33,714
Where is he?

549
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,463
If you don't tell me where he is,
or I'll kill you,

550
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,786
myself, I swear!

551
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,441
I'll kill you myself.

552
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:40,582
<i>Michael!</i>

553
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:42,489
<i>Michael!</i>

554
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:43,920
<i>Michael!</i>

555
00:26:46,627 --> 00:26:48,827
Come on!
Tell me!

556
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,390
Where is he?
Where is he?

557
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,324
Where is Lincoln?

558
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:57,266
Where is Lincoln?

559
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:58,261
All right.

560
00:26:58,443 --> 00:26:59,117
<i>Fine.</i>

561
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:02,312
There's an energy conference

562
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:05,166
at the Panda Bay Hotel
in about an hour.

563
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,252
He'll be there.

564
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,759
That's the truth.

565
00:27:43,115 --> 00:27:44,104
I'm sorry.

566
00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:47,023
I don't know
what to think.

567
00:27:47,258 --> 00:27:48,628
Go.
Go, go go.

568
00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:49,751
Go find him.

569
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:52,648
I got her. Go.

570
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:54,120
If she gives you
any trouble...

571
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:56,996
If she gives you
any trouble...

572
00:27:57,027 --> 00:27:57,593
I know.

573
00:27:57,918 --> 00:27:59,673
Just...
Go.

574
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,175
You have surpassed expectations,
Bagwell.

575
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:35,320
You're much more
than an informant.

576
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:38,011
I multitask.

577
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:40,842
Well, if things go
as well as expected here,

578
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:42,787
you'll be rewarded
accordingly.

579
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:46,109
As a special liaison
to the Company?

580
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,438
Yes.

581
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:50,153
What exactly
does that entail?

582
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,041
Well, that would be
up to you.

583
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,653
Most Company operatives
choose their own career path,

584
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:59,006
though I can't say
what would suit you.

585
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:03,041
What do sexual predators
from Alabama typically do,

586
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:04,976
uh, aside
from the obvious?

587
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:07,910
Those days are behind me,
General.

588
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:10,657
What I lack
in formal education,

589
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:12,497
I more than
make up for in...

590
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:16,176
natural skills
and curiosity.

591
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,695
And as you've seen,
my loyalty knows no bounds.

592
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,365
Then you shouldn't have
any difficulty

593
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,856
passing your final exam.

594
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:24,712
<i>Now, you didn't</i>

595
00:29:24,747 --> 00:29:27,760
expect that
a few phone calls on the sly

596
00:29:28,206 --> 00:29:30,015
would set you up for life,
did you?

597
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,622
No, sir.

598
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,536
I'm ready for anything.

599
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,221
Good.
Then prepare for this.

600
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,082
When Burrows brings Scylla
back to us,

601
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:43,137
I will fly it safely back
to Los Angeles,

602
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,421
and you will be the one
to put a bullet in his brain.

603
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:56,812
<i>Sara?</i>

604
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:03,655
<i>What's going on
in there?</i>

605
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,646
<i>Sara?</i>

606
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:09,223
What do you want?

607
00:30:10,284 --> 00:30:12,089
Oh, please,
keep that open.

608
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,560
Why?
So you can

609
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,892
lob more accusations
and assumptions out at me?

610
00:30:17,678 --> 00:30:19,240
I haven't made any.

611
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:21,839
Lincoln is adopted.

612
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,933
And you're pregnant.

613
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:28,497
<i>You don't deny it,
do you?</i>

614
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:31,627
You should tell him.

615
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,060
He'd be happy,
even under the circumstances.

616
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:36,756
It really isn't
any of your business.

617
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,674
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

618
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,496
Sometimes,
in-laws...

619
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,599
overstep their bounds,
but...

620
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,030
You know,
when it comes right down to it,

621
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,131
I am the only mother
any of you will ever have, so...

622
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,790
You shouldn't
throw that away so easily.

623
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,678
Yeah, you know,
the only thing I get from you

624
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:56,860
is a great example of the mother
I don't want to be.

625
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,249
<i>Sara?</i>

626
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,504
It doesn't have to be
like this.

627
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:04,596
Yeah, it does.

628
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,664
That was your decision
a long time ago.

629
00:31:06,862 --> 00:31:07,641
Sara...

630
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,735
Can I just give you

631
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,244
one piece of advice?

632
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:15,557
Stay out of the bars.

633
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,826
- That's good advice.
- I have friends in AA.

634
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,575
They're only alcoholics.

635
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,930
I can only imagine
what it's like for you,

636
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,859
trying to stay off
the smack.

637
00:31:31,214 --> 00:31:32,229
It's morphine.

638
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,660
Hospital-grade morphine.

639
00:31:45,651 --> 00:31:48,462
Christina Scofield
will not be leaving Miami tonight.

640
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,208
I want eyes at
every airport and gas station

641
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,750
between
here and Atlanta.

642
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,835
And I want the names of everyone
attending that conference.

643
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,171
I thought you might be
asking that question,

644
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,840
so I called the
front desk of the hotel.

645
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,349
Said I was
from the newspaper.

646
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,402
Excuse the spelling.

647
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,302
These are all scientists.

648
00:32:09,337 --> 00:32:10,592
I told you.

649
00:32:10,627 --> 00:32:11,630
<i>Those
are the speakers.</i>

650
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,090
Names below are
"special guests."

651
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,189
Sounded like bigwigs
from all over the world.

652
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,260
"Frederich,
Carlotto,

653
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,226
Linarte,
Ban..."

654
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:20,715
"Banarjee"?

655
00:32:21,699 --> 00:32:24,457
- Naveen Banarjee?
- Who is that?

656
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,174
The son of prime minister
Nandu Banarjee.

657
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,460
He has a known

658
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,579
interest in
solar weapons technology.

659
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,878
This will all be over
by the end of the day.

660
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,746
Come on, Linc,
where are you?

661
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,117
<i>It's Linc.</i>

662
00:32:52,152 --> 00:32:53,130
<i>You know
what to do.</i>

663
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:53,954
Linc, it's me.

664
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,672
Call me
when you can.

665
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:55,662
We got to talk.

666
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:12,446
Mahone!

667
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,160
<i>This way!</i>

668
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,783
Christina.

669
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:56,165
Don't move.

670
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:58,258
Or I'll kill you both.

671
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:20,985
Where is he?

672
00:34:21,574 --> 00:34:22,551
Where did he go?

673
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:24,572
<i>There.</i>

674
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:25,567
- Right there, right there.
- <i>Where is he?</i>

675
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,387
- Lincoln, stop!
- <i>Why?</i>

676
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,268
Wait, wait.

677
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:43,779
That's the hotel.

678
00:34:44,205 --> 00:34:45,228
<i>The energy conference.</i>

679
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,028
That's right--
It's today.

680
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:50,393
The silver van.

681
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:52,046
<i>The rental van.</i>

682
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,679
They want us here.

683
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:54,990
Something's up.

684
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:56,245
What the hell
is going on?

685
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:04,148
Downey.

686
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:05,491
It's for a getaway.

687
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,476
Linc, no!

688
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,631
Where are you?

689
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,271
<i>Running.</i>

690
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,468
Burrows is on my ass.
Are you okay?

691
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:14,187
<i>I was worried</i>

692
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:15,194
you didn't get away.

693
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,980
<i>This whole thing
could go to hell.</i>

694
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,230
I'm fine.

695
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,373
I'm right on time.

696
00:35:19,973 --> 00:35:20,893
<i>See you soon.</i>

697
00:35:23,627 --> 00:35:24,151
Down.

698
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,911
Down!

699
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:29,265
Good girl.

700
00:35:34,094 --> 00:35:35,267
He'll never forgive you
for this,

701
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,355
and neither
will his brother.

702
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:41,016
Soon,
this will all be behind us.

703
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,051
Maybe I can meet
my grandson one day.

704
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,442
Namaskar.
(Hello.)

705
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,554
My apologies,
Naveen.

706
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,802
Where have you been?

707
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,564
I was told that
you would call.

708
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,560
I got hung up
on a few details for this evening.

709
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,810
You spoke with Downey?

710
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:49,887
<i>It did very little</i>

711
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:50,921
to reassure me.

712
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,483
I need to speak to
Dr. Sandinsky.

713
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,655
Oh, you haven't heard?

714
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,106
<i>Dr. Sandinsky
had a family emergency.</i>

715
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,156
His wife
was in a terrible accident.

716
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,921
I spoke with him
this morning.

717
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,293
He took a private jet out
this afternoon.

718
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,790
It's very late...

719
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:07,629
<i>to be making
these decisions now.</i>

720
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:09,860
Yes,
but you've come all this way.

721
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:10,576
You are prepared

722
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:11,932
<i>to give your speech,
aren't you?</i>

723
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:12,991
Fine.

724
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,826
<i>But in light of the fact,</i>

725
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:16,800
that I did not speak
with the doctor,

726
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,099
<i>I'll amend my offer.</i>

727
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,494
$1 million in
exploratory research.

728
00:37:22,803 --> 00:37:24,320
<i>The rest will follow
in the weeks to come.</i>

729
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,109
That's very generous,
Naveen.

730
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,557
<i>History
will thank you.</i>

731
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,311
<i>Your country
will thank you.</i>

732
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,855
See you soon.

733
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,886
May I have your attention,
please?

734
00:37:49,149 --> 00:37:50,326
<i>We're about to begin.</i>

735
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,364
<i>Thank you.
Welcome to Miami Beach.</i>

736
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,011
<i>And thank you</i>

737
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:56,636
for attending the
first global conference of its kind,

738
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,873
where great minds will meet
to explore our energy future.

739
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,960
The importance
of finding new ways

740
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,784
to power our world
should not be underestimated.

741
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:06,537
It's running.

742
00:38:06,572 --> 00:38:07,092
Okay.

743
00:38:18,555 --> 00:38:20,182
They rented this
in Linc's name.

744
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:21,577
Look at this.

745
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,104
These passports.
It's us.

746
00:38:24,497 --> 00:38:25,364
It's a setup.

747
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:27,333
- For what?
- It's a setup!

748
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:32,082
Okay, thank you.

749
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:42,408
5 o' clock.

750
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,036
If Burrows doesn't call
in the next five minutes,

751
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:46,230
you're going downtown.

752
00:38:48,853 --> 00:38:50,063
<i>General,
you should see this.</i>

753
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:51,870
<i>...environmental summit
in the city of Miami.</i>

754
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,666
<i>Today, the venue will be
the Panda Bay Hotel,</i>

755
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:56,226
<i>where security
has been tightened</i>

756
00:38:56,232 --> 00:38:58,011
<i>for the arrival of
important guests.</i>

757
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:00,519
<i>This includes
Naveen Banarjee,</i>

758
00:39:00,554 --> 00:39:02,816
<i>son of Prime Minister
Nandu Banarjee,</i>

759
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:05,490
<i>who is scheduled to be
the event's keynote speaker.</i>

760
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,240
<i>Banarjee's
fragile political position</i>

761
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:11,188
<i>may leave him vulnerable
to criticism on the world stage.</i>

762
00:39:11,423 --> 00:39:14,267
<i>He has aggressively sought
to place his ideas in the</i>

763
00:39:14,302 --> 00:39:16,146
- <i>forefront of environmental policy...</i>
- Christina's plan.

764
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:17,901
What she needed to profit
from Scylla.

765
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,713
An incident
that'll domino into global warfare.

766
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,400
<i>For new forms
of greener energy like</i>

767
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,513
<i>sun and wind...</i>

768
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,687
<i>And how these ideas</i>

769
00:39:27,688 --> 00:39:28,751
<i>- were implemented.
- Krantz.</i>

770
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:30,343
You're out.

771
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:32,039
It's over now.

772
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:38,120
No.

773
00:39:43,976 --> 00:39:44,845
You do it.

774
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,718
Do it!

775
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:19,577
Hey!

776
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:21,898
You need a pass!

777
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:22,987
<i>At this point
in our history,</i>

778
00:40:23,022 --> 00:40:25,687
<i>solar power accounts
for less than one-tenth of</i>

779
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:28,789
one percent of the total power
generated in our world.

780
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:31,730
<i>And in the next ten years,
that number</i>

781
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,232
<i>should increase
to ten percent,</i>

782
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,614
but it's still
not enough.

783
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,692
We must strive
to seek new alternatives

784
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,687
so that we can break this cycle
of oil dependence.

785
00:40:41,444 --> 00:40:43,556
<i>We cannot do that
without your help.</i>

786
00:40:43,925 --> 00:40:45,265
So, that's why
we're here today.

787
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,076
To explore

788
00:40:46,096 --> 00:40:47,360
<i>our new energy future</i>

789
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,326
and envision
a new tomorrow.

790
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,743
<i>Now, our first guest is
an author and an entrepreneur.</i>

791
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:54,604
As well as having
a notable heritage,

792
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:56,222
he has spoken
to audiences

793
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:57,227
<i>across the world.</i>

794
00:40:57,262 --> 00:40:59,946
Please welcome,
Naveen Banarjee.

795
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:07,789
Thank you,
thank you.

796
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,649
Good evening,
my friends.

797
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,232
It is my pleasure
to be here with you today,

798
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,958
<i>in this beautiful city
of sunlight.</i>

799
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,378
<i>Throughout
the United States,</i>

800
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,096
<i>I find there
to be great interest</i>

801
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,513
<i>in the changing way</i>

802
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,137
that we all
power our world.

803
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:29,500
<i>Many times
I have been approached...</i>

804
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,547
No!

805
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,878
With a proposal
to reinvent the wheel.

806
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:34,508
<i>New resources...</i>

807
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:01,525
Michael!

808
00:42:07,198 --> 00:42:07,756
<i>Linc!</i>

809
00:42:08,448 --> 00:42:09,235
We've got to go.

810
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,776
She set
the whole thing up.

811
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:19,031
She set
the whole thing up.

812
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,924
<i>Do you have it?</i>

813
00:42:28,388 --> 00:42:29,196
Right here.

814
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,228
How'd it go?

815
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,467
The van was there
with the passports.

816
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,076
I just got off the phone
with our contact at the bank.

817
00:42:36,076 --> 00:42:37,254
And they've got
clean video

818
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,072
<i>of Burrows
trying to access the box.</i>

819
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:41,619
He must have trashed
the hotel room.

820
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,512
His hands were
all over the shells.

821
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,301
You see Michael?

822
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:48,853
He was
there on my way out.

823
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,576
Lincoln's right back
where he started.

824
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,325
But really it's too bad
about Micheal.

825
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,200
And I know you, uh...

826
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:00,867
Shut up and drive.

827
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:17,480
