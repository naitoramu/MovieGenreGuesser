1
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>I can feel you breathe</i>

2
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:21,229
<i>I can feel your heart beat faster</i>

3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,359
<i>Take me home tonight</i>

4
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,362
<i>I don't want to let you go
'til you see the light</i>

5
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,446
Walt.

6
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,370
We need you at 3500 Lockwood right now.

7
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,081
Sal, what is it?

8
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,667
It's your brother.

9
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,002
I'm on my way.

10
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,286
DEA.

11
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,794
Walt.

12
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,224
Sorry, man.

13
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,254
No liquids.

14
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,797
This goes through.

15
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,409
Go ahead.

16
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,982
Hello, Neto.

17
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,570
Look.

18
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,451
Brought you this in case you already
drank all the other ones I sent.

19
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,538
I don't like this shit.

20
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,670
Can we talk?

21
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,676
I know why you're here.
They got Zuno.

22
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,762
In the States.

23
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,015
He talks, you're done.

24
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:50,975
Yeah?

25
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,394
What else have you heard?

26
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,645
That...

27
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,900
the plazas are restless.

28
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:04,781
Trouble at the top makes
room for new blood.

29
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,908
Some you know, some you don't.

30
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,665
You were right about Camarena.

31
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,418
It really fucked up everything.

32
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,463
And now you want my help.

33
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,718
Know the thing about prison?

34
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,053
You're never alone.

35
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,890
But it always feels like you are.

36
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,895
You sit in your fancy house...

37
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:41,359
with your trophy wife,
with that monkey, Azul...

38
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,612
You've got all these
people around you...

39
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,657
but the truth is you've got no one.

40
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,954
'Cause you chose a bunch of
dirtbag lawyers and politicians

41
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,622
- over your friends.
- Yeah?

42
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,417
Since then,
I don't solve your problems.

43
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,254
What do you want me to do,
ask your forgiveness?

44
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,924
I did what I had to do, you know that.

45
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:13,433
Must be tiring, convincing yourself
you're the good guy?

46
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,522
I made a deal with the Gulf.

47
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,904
You got Guerra to move into coke?

48
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,613
Yeah.

49
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,119
And I'm going to use it to force the
Colombians to pay us in product.

50
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,913
So we can move into retail.

51
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,083
You and your fucking plans.

52
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,421
Neto, are you listening?
We're going to be selling over there.

53
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,123
When I'm done, I'll be the
most powerful man in Mexico,

54
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,759
and I promise to get you out of here.

55
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,891
But I can't with that fucking
American still choking me.

56
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,268
He really got to you.

57
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,729
I need it to go away.

58
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,273
Okay.

59
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,525
Here's what you should do.

60
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,613
You're gonna turn yourself
in to the Americans.

61
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,948
Turn myself in.

62
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,242
It's easy.

63
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,872
Walk right up to Uncle Sam
and say, I surrender.

64
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,332
That's it.

65
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,502
You've gotta give the
Americans what they want.

66
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,962
And if they want you, you're fucked.

67
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,590
This will never end.

68
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,717
Never.

69
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,320
So get your ass into an
American prison 'cause,

70
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,971
if you get done in Mexico,

71
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,517
I've got a feeling you'll end up
in a cell right next to mine.

72
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:42,313
And when the animals in here,

73
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,191
like Rafa, come to cut you open...

74
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,820
I'll make sure they go nice and slow.

75
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,723
So Félix gave the order for
Kiki Camarena's murder.

76
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,393
He must've had approval.

77
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,187
Someone in the government?

78
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,289
Can you give us a name?

79
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,156
My uncle.

80
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,117
The Minister of Defense.

81
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,705
Could you give us his name, please?

82
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,587
God.

83
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,797
He's given up everything.

84
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,717
So there you go.

85
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,969
And what happens now?

86
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,349
Just have to get him in
front of the grand jury,

87
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,889
get his testimony on record.

88
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,559
State holds Mexico
City's feet to the fire,

89
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,520
and they hand over
every asshole involved

90
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,438
just to make it all go away.

91
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,440
Put all those motherfuckers in jail.

92
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,900
- Good work, Walt.
- I'm gonna go grab a smoke.

93
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,318
So we'll do it in Panama.

94
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,100
I'll set the meeting
with the Colombians.

95
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,972
I'll get Noriega to send security.

96
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,643
Type of thing that'll
impress Colombians.

97
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,478
That's a good idea.

98
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,313
I'm very much looking forward

99
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:51,150
to seeing you wipe the smug looks
off those sons of bitches' faces.

100
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,903
So sometime next week?

101
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,781
I hope it's taken care of by then.

102
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,949
Hope what's taken care of?

103
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,743
Your problem.

104
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,578
In America.

105
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,955
Zuno.

106
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,752
Yeah. I'm on it.

107
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,631
All right then.

108
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:17,301
But, Félix, have you heard about
this thing with Matta's plane?

109
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,858
The plane was shot down

110
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,397
over the Nicaraguan jungle.

111
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,516
Indications are it was
connected to the CIA.

112
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,560
The weapons were headed to the Contras

113
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,813
battling the communist Sandinistas.

114
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,357
The downing of the plane has
raised questions in Washington

115
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,984
about a possible secret arms deal.

116
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,154
I intend to pursue this inquiry

117
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,532
with cold objectivity.

118
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,494
My loyalty to my country
exceeds my loyalty...

119
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,912
You know what, Azul?

120
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,958
Tell that idiot Matta
I want to meet right now.

121
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,961
Go on then.

122
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,381
- Hey.
- Hey.

123
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,760
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

124
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,345
Come on in.

125
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,315
Hey, I...

126
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,485
I got you a little something.

127
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,114
Splurged at the airport, huh?

128
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,449
One-stop shopping.

129
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,577
So...

130
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,165
So the case I told you
about, Camarena...

131
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,543
One of the guys just flipped,
could get the whole conspiracy.

132
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,378
It'd be a big win for us.

133
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,298
That's good, Walt.
Can you hand me that?

134
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,425
Anyway, the...

135
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:27,348
DEA needs to question him,
so I got a couple days off

136
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,851
before they put him in front of
a grand jury, and I was...

137
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,000
Well, I was kind of thinking

138
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,275
I'd really like to take
Danny fishing tomorrow.

139
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,528
Kid could use some guy time.

140
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,074
- He gets out at 2:00, right?
- 3:20.

141
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,584
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

142
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,338
A little to the left.
A little more. There it is.

143
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,756
Lower, lower, lower.

144
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,842
I'll warn you. Lower, lower, lower.

145
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,261
We can fill up three or more of those.

146
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,137
- Three?
- Yeah.

147
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,722
There it is.

148
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,976
We'll have to hire a
shitload of people then.

149
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,563
No problem. Acosta waves
his finger, shit gets done.

150
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,150
Respect and fear go a long way.

151
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,612
So we store the coke there?

152
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,364
Yeah.

153
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,047
Can't bust what they can't see.

154
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,450
What now?

155
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,745
Who the fuck is this?

156
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,081
Fuck me. Acosta's gringa.

157
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,251
Pablo?

158
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,961
Hey!

159
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,922
How are you, love?

160
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,841
Mimi... Mimi, Mimi.

161
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,718
Is this going to be a problem?

162
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,180
I'll handle it.

163
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,644
A fucking tax, Palma?

164
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,563
To use the Tijuana plaza?

165
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,984
When the time is right, I'll talk
to Félix, get him to lift it.

166
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,280
They kick us in the balls, and
we sit here and do nothing?

167
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,949
For now, we pay it.

168
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,079
And adjust our volume through the ports.

169
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,058
Look, Palma, I got an idea...

170
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,252
You're not an idea guy, Chapito.

171
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,506
Have you made sure all the
trucks are running well?

172
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,842
Done.

173
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,386
Very good.

174
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,311
Follow me, please.

175
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,615
Nice place.

176
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,867
Thank you for seeing me.

177
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,040
So how are you?

178
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,220
I've got 200 kilos of coke

179
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,500
I want you to help me
move over the border.

180
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,842
Who sold them to you?

181
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,469
Cali?

182
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,138
They're not the only
ones that have coke.

183
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,938
My brothers would kill
you if they found out...

184
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,267
Benjamín already knows.

185
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,898
I see they don't tell you everything.

186
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,608
Their mistake.

187
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,237
Oh, really?

188
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,907
We start with this load, then expand.

189
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,076
Move a ton a month, our way.

190
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,997
- If Félix finds out...
- He comes after me.

191
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,165
You hide in Benjamín's shadow.

192
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,171
Félix pushes your family around,
but what's he delivered?

193
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,090
Seizures are up.

194
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,967
I hear he hasn't even paid you.

195
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,346
He was done the second
he killed that DEA agent.

196
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,225
I offer you the future.

197
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,686
Your own supply.

198
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,442
Look...

199
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,446
you've asked twice.

200
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,073
My family's patience has run out.

201
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,912
I suggest you leave Tijuana. Now.

202
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,841
I thought you were the
brains behind your brothers.

203
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,260
What'd you expect?

204
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,180
Turn my back on my family
because we're both women?

205
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,850
Why not?

206
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,243
Come in.

207
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,745
I'll make room.

208
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,468
I'm not a bath guy.

209
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,262
Hey, watch it!

210
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,515
My boots!

211
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,702
Why do you always have this
fucking grumpy face on?

212
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,437
What are you thinking about, baby?

213
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,815
What do you think about Amado?

214
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,321
He's different than you,
that's for sure.

215
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,949
Yes.

216
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,744
They all are now.

217
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,290
Game's changing.

218
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,836
Passing you by?

219
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,839
No.

220
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,508
Pissing me off.

221
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,221
Maybe it's time to stop.

222
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,443
That why you came out here?

223
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,487
To tell me I've had enough?

224
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,576
You do what you want,
Pablo. I know that.

225
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,245
And you?

226
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,374
You've got this way of getting me
to do what you want.

227
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,546
Like I could tell Pablo
Acosta what to do.

228
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,842
I can't even get you to get
in the fucking bath with me.

229
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,140
Hey! I said quit it!

230
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,852
You are a big fucking baby.

231
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,522
No.

232
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,274
No.

233
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,943
Pablo, no!

234
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,448
Not with the boots on, no!
No, Pablo, no! Please!

235
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,910
There!

236
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,787
Always get your way.

237
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,671
If you stopped working...

238
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,092
there'd be more baths and less runways.

239
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,847
Smell better, for sure.

240
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,438
They don't respect me.

241
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,150
Palma thinks I'm a joke,
won't listen to my ideas.

242
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,488
Fucking tired of it.

243
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,406
Language, Joaquín.

244
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,158
Sorry, Ma.

245
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,454
Do this, drive here, shoot him...

246
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,955
Like a child.

247
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,376
You've always been strong, son.

248
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,545
You used to take a
beating from your father

249
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,966
so your brothers and
sisters didn't have to.

250
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,425
Know why?

251
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,178
Because you're different.

252
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,182
You surprise people, Joaquín.

253
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,768
They underestimate you.

254
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,522
You're a protector.

255
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,316
Always looking out for your own.

256
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,528
But who protects you, my little lion?

257
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,531
You, Ma.

258
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,908
Who else?

259
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,453
Cochi?

260
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,583
Our Lord, Jesus Christ.

261
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,754
Was gonna say that next.

262
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,217
He came from nothing, like you, son.

263
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,845
Turn to him for answers.

264
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,889
And he'll help you build
your kingdom too.

265
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,150
You were in Honduras?

266
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,818
Building another school.

267
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,321
You should try it.

268
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,116
- It's good for the soul.
- I'm sure.

269
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,246
Feeling guilty about all those
M16s you've been sending south?

270
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,750
I just carry the guns.

271
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,919
These other assholes shoot them.

272
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,299
You have any issues with that
plane that got shot down?

273
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,219
Some, in the States.

274
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,846
I'm confident it'll blow over.

275
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,852
I need to talk with your
friends in the CIA.

276
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,439
The people who want to arrest you?

277
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:23,110
- The DEA and CIA aren't the same.
- You can't trust them.

278
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,260
They'll have you on a
direct flight to the States

279
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,115
before you can say a word.

280
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,703
Not when they see how much money
I have for their Nicaraguan friends.

281
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,374
You want to buy their help.

282
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,459
Yes.

283
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,462
Walk right up to Uncle Sam...

284
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,215
and give him what he wants.

285
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,301
Untraceable cash.
They love that, don't they?

286
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,304
How much did I give them last time?

287
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,014
Two million?

288
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,436
What if I give them ten this time?

289
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,438
Just to start.

290
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,316
CIA's nothing if not opportunistic.

291
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,698
But you'll have to be careful, Félix.

292
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,783
You killed one of them.

293
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,744
They don't forget that.

294
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,374
Then I'll make them forget.

295
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,494
What the hell are we doing here?

296
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,635
I bought it.

297
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,056
You bought this warehouse?

298
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,766
Come.

299
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,269
This way.

300
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,732
Look that way.

301
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,194
See the border?

302
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,864
- Yes.
- See that house?

303
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,866
With the green roof?

304
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,534
Yeah, I see it.

305
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,536
Bought that one too.

306
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,539
You bought that dump?

307
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,250
It's 442 meters from here to that house.

308
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,878
And I'm gonna connect them.

309
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,798
I'm going to build a tunnel, Cochi.

310
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,680
You're going to build a tunnel

311
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,764
under the U.S. border,
from here to there?

312
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:16,264
This is your big idea?

313
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,933
That's right.

314
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,062
All the fancy shit they
got to keep us out...

315
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,898
planes, cameras, fences...

316
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,694
still one place
the gringos never look.

317
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,494
You've fucking lost your mind.

318
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,496
Think about it, man.

319
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,625
This protects us from everything.

320
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,462
From the brothers, the tax,
and U.S. Customs.

321
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,090
All of it, Cochi.

322
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,800
What'd Palma say?

323
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,386
Doesn't want to listen to my ideas.

324
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,846
So I'm gonna build it
and show him after.

325
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,182
He'll come on board when he sees it.

326
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,060
Come on, man. You didn't make
it past the third grade.

327
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,854
How the fuck are you gonna
build a 400-meter tunnel?

328
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,856
No, brother.

329
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,611
I love you, but we're hitters.

330
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,196
That's what we do.

331
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,866
Not forever.

332
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,585
Guess we're building a fucking tunnel.

333
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,297
Let's do it.

334
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,508
We'll start today.

335
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,512
How's school?

336
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,556
You like the fourth grade?

337
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,641
I'm in fifth now.

338
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,353
Fair enough. To fifth grade.

339
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,110
Here's your rig.

340
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,159
All right.

341
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,078
Here we go.
Let's see what's out there.

342
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,757
Follow me.

343
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,103
Mr. Félix Gallardo.

344
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,771
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

345
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,064
Relax.

346
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,191
He's just going to pat him down.

347
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,527
Turn around.

348
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,780
You like killing Americans, Pancho, huh?

349
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,953
Good?

350
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,080
All right. Follow me.

351
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,456
Hey. Just him.

352
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,335
It's okay. Hand me that.

353
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,545
I'll be back.

354
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,843
How goes it?

355
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,263
Well, it's going, sir.

356
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,015
I wasn't sure we'd pull it off,
but here we are.

357
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,348
Of course.

358
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,227
I found the best contractor in Tijuana!

359
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,814
Run!

360
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,904
Come out!

361
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,616
Come out! Come out!

362
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,201
What the fuck happened?

363
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,579
And Juan?

364
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,997
Where's Juan?

365
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,861
No photos of Greg.

366
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,574
They must be all in my room.

367
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,330
So this guy goes on the stand today.

368
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,459
He's gonna lay it all out.
Everything.

369
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:59,547
So I was thinking maybe we
could celebrate tonight.

370
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,341
Danny has a sleepover.

371
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,260
Okay, well...

372
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,554
maybe some other time.

373
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,408
You know, me and him had a really
good time fishing the other day.

374
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,025
What is it?

375
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,196
You know this isn't how
this works, right?

376
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,365
Just 'cause Greg took him fishing
doesn't mean you can just show up

377
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,450
- and do the same thing.
- Hey, look, I didn't mean...

378
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,852
What do you want, Walt?

379
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,125
Coming here, sending money every month.

380
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,544
I'm sorry.

381
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,672
I just wanted to make sure the
two of you are taken care of.

382
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,007
That's what he would've wanted.

383
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,553
Look, I get it. He was your brother.

384
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,516
But you're not responsible for us.

385
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:58,022
And I'm trying to move on here.

386
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:04,320
Yeah.
I'm not doing so good with that.

387
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,200
How about you talk to
me about your work?

388
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,998
Take down enough of these
assholes to get even?

389
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,918
There is no even.

390
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,758
Look, Walt...

391
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,430
Greg was an addict.

392
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,310
That's what got him killed.

393
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,313
Not you.

394
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,817
Yeah.

395
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,236
I still fucking miss him.

396
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,784
Listen...

397
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,830
the way things are working
out with this case,

398
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,416
I'm gonna have my pick of spots.

399
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,628
And I may get posted back up here.

400
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,131
Now, I understand that
it's hard for you,

401
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,218
but I'd really like to be
a part of Danny's life.

402
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,347
Okay?
I think it'd be good for him.

403
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,519
Danny would like that.

404
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,231
Good.

405
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,610
I appreciate it.

406
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,839
Gotta set it up behind.
It'll kill the fire.

407
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,721
Wait! Where are you taking me?

408
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,098
To the airplane.

409
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,226
No, no. No way I'm getting in there.

410
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,561
I'd rather talk out here.

411
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,982
He's traveling through, about
to take off in ten minutes.

412
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,567
I'm not getting aboard.

413
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,030
You talk on the plane, or not at all.

414
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,099
There he is.

415
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,934
The man who made Mexico matter.

416
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,854
Gotta stop meeting in
the jungle like this.

417
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,689
Have a seat.

418
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,400
Take a seat. I'll translate.

419
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:52,238
He said you have to stop meeting
in the jungle like this.

420
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,799
You really shat the sheets

421
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,745
with this whole Camarena thing.

422
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,414
Made yourself dinner talk in D.C.

423
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,175
It's an unfortunate event.

424
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,977
It was an unfortunate event.

425
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,139
That's one way of putting it.

426
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,523
Tell him I've got what he needs in here.

427
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,718
He says he's got what you...

428
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,816
Oh, no, I got it.

429
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,654
You've already done
so much, Señor Félix.

430
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,990
You got onto my plane.

431
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,784
- What?
- Man who killed a federal agent?

432
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,243
- Let's go.
- What?

433
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,705
Guess not as smart as they say.

434
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,040
What's he saying? Wait, wait!

435
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,126
Listen carefully, my friend. I don't
need your fucking coke money.

436
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,213
It's not worth nearly as much to me
as flying you back to the States

437
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,132
and dropping you like a
trussed hog in the DEA lobby.

438
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,761
I get all kinds of love from Justice,
some good PR for the agency.

439
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,270
Now if you don't want to go...

440
00:34:58,298 --> 00:34:59,847
Will you translate? What's he saying?

441
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,218
I can have Rick here discharge
his firearm into your temple

442
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,559
and bury you in the jungle.

443
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,478
Wait! Put that down!

444
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,938
Tell him to open it!

445
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,606
There's something in here you need.

446
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,900
Open it.

447
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,111
Open! Open! Open!

448
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,656
Tell him to open it! Open!

449
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,459
What the fuck?

450
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,924
Maps.

451
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,929
Of the routes I'll use to fly your guns

452
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,380
through the region.

453
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,058
One of Matta's planes
was shot down, correct?

454
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,770
And your Congress knows about it?

455
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,773
Yes.

456
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,317
How long before that
comes back to Matta?

457
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,640
How long before your whole
arms program here is torched

458
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,400
because of it?

459
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,577
Go on.

460
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,627
I'll take over his entire
organization. It will be mine.

461
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:16,424
I'll make sure you'll continue
to get your guns and money.

462
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,010
But I'll hide them in one
of my shell companies.

463
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,721
See what I'm getting at?

464
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,307
The investigation won't matter.

465
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,602
Imagine, new routes, new airstrips.

466
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,939
Your program goes on,
and no one will know.

467
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,860
So no Matta, no problem.

468
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,155
Exactly.

469
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,900
I have to say it's been eons

470
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,455
since someone actually surprised me.

471
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,165
What did he say?

472
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,337
That's good.

473
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,672
So do we have a deal?

474
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,365
What about that sword hanging
over your head, hmm?

475
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,973
How can I be sure you won't
get a visit from the DEA

476
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,335
in the middle of the night,
leaving me back where I started?

477
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,563
Wait, wait! The DEA, I understood.

478
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,482
The DEA worries me a lot.

479
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,609
This is the deal.

480
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,445
I take care of this,
you take care of the DEA.

481
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,530
The CIA can manage that, right?

482
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,146
Mr. Zuno Arce, you provided your answers

483
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,872
in private interviews
with law enforcement,

484
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,251
so you'll just be confirming your
testimony for the grand jury.

485
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,335
Understood?

486
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,003
Yes.

487
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,092
You owned the house at
881 Lope de Vega Street

488
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,387
where DEA Special Agent Enrique
Camarena was murdered?

489
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,221
Yes.

490
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,978
But that was not your only
involvement in the murder,

491
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,340
correct?

492
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,936
Yes.

493
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,800
Is it your understanding that
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo

494
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,275
approved the murder

495
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,819
of Special Agent Camarena?

496
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,028
No.

497
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,746
But in your interviews,
you said, explicitly,

498
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,291
that Mr. Félix Gallardo gave the order.

499
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,502
You understand, Mr. Zuno Arce,

500
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,129
if you deny again,

501
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,464
you can be charged with perjury
in front of a grand jury,

502
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,632
which is a felony.

503
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,847
I have never met Félix Gallardo.

504
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,041
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

505
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,573
We can't use any of Zuno's testimony

506
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,700
if he doesn't stand
behind it in open court.

507
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,410
Information is still valuable, Jack.

508
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,579
Yeah, and we have names
that we didn't have before.

509
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:58,002
Then we use it.
Treat Zuno like a source.

510
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,629
Take what we got from him
and keep going, Walt.

511
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,048
All right, moving forward, do you...

512
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,260
Hey. Sorry to interrupt, Jack.

513
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,055
Just wanted to come down and
thank all these good people

514
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,389
for all their hard work.

515
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,851
Now, where is the man
who tagged the big buck,

516
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,770
the one who got Zuno in cuffs?

517
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,273
This is Agent Breslin. He's been
heading up Operation Leyenda.

518
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,817
- Ted Kaye, State.
- Mr. Kaye.

519
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,194
Ah, please, Ted.

520
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,322
You did a heck of a job
down there, Agent Breslin.

521
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,699
Boy, that thing with the plane?

522
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:32,244
As my kid says, a little too
much for my liking, awesome.

523
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,041
People needed to know what happened
down there, and now they do,

524
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,168
- thanks to you.
- Thank you, sir.

525
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,670
We were just discussing
how to move forward.

526
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,672
- Move forward?
- Yeah.

527
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,301
My people tell me that
Zuno is going down

528
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,513
for the kidnapping, torture
and murder of Kiki Camarena.

529
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,056
That's correct, sir...

530
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,017
Yeah, so he'll be spending
the rest of his life in prison.

531
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,436
The nephew of the Minister of Defense?

532
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,272
That's a big win.
Black eye for the PRI.

533
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,985
You want us to end the investigation?

534
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,115
I mean, your star witness
fell apart, Jack.

535
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,700
This doctor is making noise

536
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,952
about illegal kidnapping,
so I don't, you know...

537
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:16,664
All due respect, these assholes
killed one of our agents.

538
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,792
With approval from some of the
most powerful men in Mexico.

539
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,670
Okay, hold on, Jack. You gotta be
careful with that kind of talk.

540
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,672
Read the testimony, sir.

541
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,551
Okay, look...

542
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,219
the fact is...

543
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,389
we all wanted more.

544
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,016
Right?
The American people wanted more,

545
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,937
so we just gotta look...
to other ways to find it.

546
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,065
Now we've got this new
anti-drug abuse bill

547
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,025
that's gonna cost Mexico a lot of money.

548
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,235
- Money?
- Yeah.

549
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,779
They get a bad grade on
our certification standards

550
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,072
or lose millions in aid.

551
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,907
We shove it right down their throats.

552
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,618
A bad grade, huh?
Man, you're unbelievable.

553
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,328
- Excuse me?
- Agent Breslin...

554
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,456
No, I have men on my team,

555
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,167
Mexicans who have risked their
lives and their families,

556
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,130
thinking that we could
make a change down there.

557
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,770
But maybe the problem isn't down there.

558
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,339
Maybe the problem is that you
guys just don't give a shit.

559
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,720
Well, check out Serpico here.

560
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:20,102
Whatever you and your Mexican friends
did down there, it didn't work.

561
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,940
Your whole entire damn
operation, Agent Breslin,

562
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,526
is a shit sandwich.

563
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,447
Now, I came in here to put a
little mustard on it for you,

564
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,040
so you could smile, pretend to chew,

565
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,200
and we could all go home friends.

566
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,665
But I see you're not that type
of guy, so let me just be clear.

567
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,461
You call up your team from Guadalajara,

568
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,797
and you crawl back into whatever
cage they let you out of.

569
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,759
And you be happy that
you still have a job.

570
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,928
For now.

571
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,519
All right. Have some
drinks on Uncle Sam.

572
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,978
Your work here is done.

573
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,480
Again, great job.

574
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,779
Fucking Ivy League piece of maggot shit.

575
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,930
Come on, honey. Lunch is ready.

576
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,521
Bro... it's over.

577
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:33,277
Chapo. No point digging him out
of a perfectly good grave.

578
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,112
We need to get the hell out of here.

579
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,865
I don't give a fuck.
He's blocking my tunnel.

580
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,408
We have to see the signs.

581
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,534
We can't keep going.

582
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,588
Chapo, is that Juan?

583
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,729
This is the sign, Cochi.

584
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,734
He who perseveres, conquers.

585
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:26,622
Appreciate you coming back
to Juárez, Pablo. I mean it.

586
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,459
Gave me no choice, Dopey.

587
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,506
All a man's got is his word, no?

588
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,426
Hello, love.

589
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,510
Hello, gorgeous.

590
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,680
- How are you?
- Hi, Amado.

591
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,434
That's how you greet a lady?

592
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,107
Hello, Mimi.

593
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,194
He didn't know I was coming, did he?

594
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,030
Thought you two could
get to know each other.

595
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,826
Besides, who doesn't like surprises?

596
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,830
Isn't he a pain in the ass?

597
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,379
Time for a smoke.

598
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:20,843
Just gotta add a little something,
so it's nice and perfect.

599
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,679
Mind smoking that outside, hon?

600
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,473
That's fine.

601
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,518
I'll just fuck off for a bit.

602
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,737
Amado...

603
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:51,707
You know as well as I,
Pablo doesn't wanna be here.

604
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,252
I think it's time he settles down.

605
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,546
Are you trying to get him killed?

606
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,798
You know people don't
retire in our line of work.

607
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:04,261
Yeah, well, Pablo's not most people.
You know that.

608
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,889
You just here to put that
nonsense in his head?

609
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:11,101
He gets to come home for good,
and you get to run Juárez.

610
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,760
And I don't have to
watch him risk his life

611
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,149
for this bullshit anymore.

612
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:22,738
No. You got some balls. I mean...

613
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,865
I know what you mean.

614
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,497
You like him, don't you?

615
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,125
He pisses me off.

616
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,378
But yeah, I like him.

617
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,547
Well...

618
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,719
Look, I'm just trying to look
out for him. To protect him.

619
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,847
I could use your help.

620
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,558
Look, Mimi...

621
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,898
if Pablo decides to get out...

622
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,110
I can't protect him from Félix.

623
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,695
Not you, not anybody.

624
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,074
You want him safe? Then we
have to keep him in Juárez.

625
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,451
It's the only way.

626
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,746
Understand?

627
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,417
Okay.

628
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,919
I'll do what I can.

629
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,675
Don't worry, boss.

630
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,176
We'll figure it out.

631
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,101
Sergio.

632
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,812
Your friend, what's he like?

633
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,566
He's a piece of shit.
But at this point...

634
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,532
Set it up.

635
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,701
You got it.

636
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,590
Why are you up? Can't sleep?

637
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,763
Five a.m. roll call in
prison right about now.

638
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,603
You look the same.

639
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,067
Well, maybe a little more
tired, but the same.

640
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,069
Gee, thanks.

641
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,281
Yeah.

642
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,284
Well, it's tiring trying
to protect this family.

643
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,370
Try sitting in prison.

644
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,166
Then talk to me about
protecting family.

645
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,214
You regret it?

646
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,134
Yes.

647
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,805
Can't get back the time I lost.

648
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,104
But it was my call, no?

649
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,106
Not Benjamín's. Or Ramón's.

650
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,733
Mine.

651
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,865
Must be nice making your own choices.

652
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,913
It's become more apparent to me that...

653
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,750
all we've got are the choices we make.

654
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,738
You want to tell me

655
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,289
why the fuck you've
been following me, hmm?

656
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,457
Walt.

657
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,260
Don't believe we've met.

658
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,087
Yeah, well, I know
who you are. Sit down.

659
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,714
- Take it easy.
- Sit the fuck down.

660
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,682
Buy you a drink?

661
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,894
- One Scotch.
- Okay, sir.

662
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,940
Why are you here?

663
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,444
I'm an Astros fan.
Thought I'd catch a game.

664
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,530
Yeah? Astros are in St. Louis
through the weekend, shithead.

665
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,159
You know why I'm here.
To make sure Zuno doesn't talk.

666
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,997
You gonna shoot me, Walt?

667
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,750
Well, you just gave me a
good goddamn reason to.

668
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,128
That deal was made a
thousand miles over my head.

669
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,545
I'm just the one who made
sure it went down smooth.

670
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,257
You're not helping your cause, man.

671
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,010
I did not have a choice.

672
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,138
You know I went after
Félix when Kiki died.

673
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,058
A lot of questions
about how he got away.

674
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,685
Well, they were not wrong.

675
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,566
Your boys brought me in
because they trusted me.

676
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,523
Shit, I even liked Kiki.

677
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,260
But you got a taste of
how Félix operates.

678
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,361
One second you're in control...

679
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:13,862
You made a choice.

680
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,406
Yeah.

681
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,578
Well, I've been trying to
live that down ever since.

682
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,334
What's that house you go to, Walt?

683
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,213
I mean, I didn't expect
you to be a family man.

684
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,590
Cute kid.

685
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:37,969
What do you want?

686
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:45,018
Félix still thinks he owns me.
Means I can help you.

687
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,854
Yeah? I think you've
helped enough already.

688
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,065
Look, if it wasn't me,
it'd be somebody else.

689
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,608
Until you get help from the inside,

690
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,194
you're gonna keep running into
a brick wall just like Kiki.

691
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:58,115
Those pieces of shit are gonna
get away with killing him, Walt.

692
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,785
My intel, your men and resources.

693
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,621
We're gonna make those
motherfuckers pay.

694
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,629
You know, I'm not in the
habit of trusting a cop

695
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,003
working for the biggest
narco in Mexico, but...

696
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,923
good luck with that.

697
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,551
Well, if you ever get serious...

698
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,262
give me a call.

699
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,493
Sergio didn't mention
you were so pretty.

700
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,746
Nice to meet you. Please, join me.

701
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,874
Thank you, that's all.

702
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,211
Sit. Would you like anything to drink?

703
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,337
No, thank you.

704
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,882
How can I help you?

705
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,551
I hear you've got a six-figure
debt at the tracks.

706
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,137
Well, yeah...

707
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,681
I pick winners on occasion.

708
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,351
Well, I've got product
that can pay it off.

709
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,728
Just need you to move it.

710
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:15,483
Moving coke without the brothers'
approval? That's a big risk.

711
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,320
Split's 60/40.

712
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,489
Fair, considering you need me.
And the money.

713
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,743
Forty percent?

714
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,333
We've got a deal.

715
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,796
But I'd like to get to
know you better first...

716
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,174
and then I'll move your coke.

717
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,076
I've got a shower in the back
big enough for the both of us.

718
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,138
Who the fuck are you?

719
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:47,849
Hello.

720
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,731
Think you could make a deal in
my town without me knowing?

721
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,024
And with this piece of shit?

722
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,777
Enedina, she came to me.

723
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,863
You ever been shot in the nuts, Nieves?

724
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,325
I understand it's the most painful
thing you can do to a man.

725
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,536
They explode... like grapes.

726
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:13,416
A bullet in each of them if
you step out on us again.

727
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,210
Is that clear, man?

728
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:17,963
Absolutely.

729
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,050
Take her.

730
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,551
Let go of me!

731
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,179
Fuck, Enedina!

732
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,944
I told you to leave Tijuana.

733
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,075
You obviously don't know me.

734
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,084
I'll move your coke.

735
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,089
But make no mistake...

736
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,675
I call the shots.

737
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,388
All right, let's do it.

738
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,772
Hey, hold up. Hold up.

739
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,443
You built that?

740
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,794
Honestly, I didn't
think you could do it.

741
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,533
But you still stuck by me.

742
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,830
I'm gonna need people like you.

743
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,253
Half a fucking tunnel, and
you think you're a boss.

744
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,089
Fucking Chapo.

745
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,806
Shit.

746
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,891
Shut that off.

747
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,146
What's up, Palma?

748
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,230
Hey, Palma.

749
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,859
This is...

750
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,447
Welcome to my tunnel.

751
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,283
I call it Cocaine Alley.

752
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,912
Cocaine Alley...

753
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:18,249
Boss, we move the coke through
here instead of the port,

754
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,919
and we save a lot of dough.

755
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,891
Fuck.

756
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,811
This is good work, Chapito.

757
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,816
What're you assholes waiting for?

758
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,236
Get to fucking work. Dig!

759
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,160
Your nephew shared your name with them.

760
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,080
If the Americans didn't know
what a piece of shit you were,

761
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,498
they do now.

762
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,377
We need to make sure the
party still supports you.

763
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,382
So, what do we do?

764
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,140
Let's go.

765
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,227
Rather than having the CIA do it,

766
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:29,404
Félix decided to have his partner,
the Minister of Defense,

767
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,948
tip off Matta's location to the DEA,

768
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:35,326
giving the U.S. a big
victory in the war on drugs

769
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,450
and getting the minister back
in the party's good graces.

770
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:39,492
Not to mention,

771
00:57:39,493 --> 00:57:42,750
Félix was right about the shit-storm
Matta's plane would cause.

772
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,129
But by the time you heard about
the secret arms for hostages deal

773
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:49,340
known as the Iran-Contra
Affair, it didn't matter.

774
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,342
Félix had already filled the void.

775
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,139
Even with Matta gone,
the flow of guns didn't miss a beat.

776
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,184
And Félix not only got a new partner,

777
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,896
he also took control of one
more leg of the business,

778
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,856
the coke routes into Mexico.

779
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,258
DRUG BARON MATTA BALLESTEROS
CAPTURED IN HONDURAS

780
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,880
Yeah, Félix sure knew

781
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,987
how to make the most of his old buddies.

782
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,031
He used them to crush Leyenda

783
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,075
and strengthen his leverage with
the Colombians in one move.

784
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,953
We're done.

785
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,372
State put a bullet in us.

786
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,626
A couple weeks to close up shop
and put in for new assignments.

787
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,389
Finally get this motherfucker's name,
and we can't do shit about it.

788
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,757
Well, that's pretty
much the shape of it.

789
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:32,550
Fuck.

790
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,636
- Y'all see this shit?
- What?

791
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,931
They arrested Matta-Ballesteros.

792
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,682
Did you know about this?

793
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,643
Not a fucking clue.

794
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,102
One of Félix's partners goes down,

795
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,896
and we don't know a
goddamn thing about it?

796
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,900
They made a fucking deal.

797
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:53,112
Your people, his people,
they make trades.

798
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,281
We get fucked.

799
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,575
There's nothing we can do?

800
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,244
It's over?

801
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,458
COMMANDER FEDERAL JUDICIAL POLICE

802
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,794
No, it's not over.

803
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,005
Not yet.
