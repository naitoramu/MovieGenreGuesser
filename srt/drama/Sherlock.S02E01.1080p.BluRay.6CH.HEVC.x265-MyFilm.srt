A power play with the
most powerful family in Britain.

301
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,409
Now, that is a dominatrix. Ooh, this is
getting rather fun, isn't it?

302
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,527
- Sherlock...
- Hmm.

303
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,728
- Where is she?
- Uh, in London, currently.

304
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,245
- She's staying...
- Text me the details,

305
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,651
I'll be in touch by the end of the day.

306
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,290
Do you really think
you'll have news by then?

307
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,124
No, I think I'll have the photographs.

308
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,568
One can only hope
you're as good as you seem to think.

309
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,850
I'll need some equipment, of course.

310
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,206
Anything you require,
I'll have it sent over.

311
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,726
- Can I have a box of matches?
- I'm sorry?

312
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,609
Or your cigarette lighter,
either will do.

313
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,091
- I don't smoke.
- No, I know you don't,

314
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,083
but your employer does.

315
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,290
We have kept a lot of people
successfully in the dark

316
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,283
about this little fact, Mr. Holmes.

317
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,010
I'm not the Commonwealth.

318
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,286
And that's as modest as he gets.
Pleasure to meet you.

319
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,846
Late rs!

320
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,529
Okay, the smoking, how did you know?

321
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,002
The evidence was right under your nose,
John, as ever you see

322
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,447
- but do not observe.
- Observe what?

323
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,931
The ashtray.

324
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,521
Kate?

325
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,764
We're going to have a visitor.
I'll need a bit of time to get ready.

326
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,281
- A long time?
- Hmm, ages.

327
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,124
What are you doing?

328
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,802
I'm going into battle, John,
I need the right armour.

329
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,483
- No.
- Nah.

330
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,845
- Works for me.
- Everything works on you.

331
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,405
- So, what's the plan?
- We know her address.

332
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,725
- We just ring her doorbell?
- Exactly. just here, please.

333
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,802
You didn't even change your clothes.

334
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,609
Then it's time to add
a splash of colour.

335
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,483
- Are we here?
- Two streets away, but this will do.

336
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,644
- For what?
- Punch me in the face.

337
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,960
Shade?

338
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,288
- Blood.
- Punch you?

339
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,921
Yes, punch me, in the face.
Didn't you hear me?

340
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,963
I always hear "punch me in the
face" when you're speaking,

341
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,008
- but it's usually sub-text.

346
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,167
You want to remember,
Sherlock, I was a soldier.

347
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,163
- I killed people.
- You were a doctor!

348
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,765
I had bad days!

Hmm.

You should always use gloves
with these things, you know.

453

Heaviest oil deposit is always
on the first key used,

454
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,969
that's quite clearly a three,
but after that the sequence

455
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,405
is almost impossible to read.

456
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,369
I see from the make
that it's a six-digit code.

457
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,090
It can't be your birthday,
no disrespect,

458
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,323
but clearly you were born
in the '80s and 8's barely used,

459

- so...
- I'd tell you the code right now,

460

- Sorry, Sherlock.
- Miss Adler, on the floor!

464

Don't you want me on the floor too?

No, sir, I want you to open the safe.

Why would you care?

467
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,887
- Sir, the safe, now, please.

469

Well if you've been listening,
you'll know she didn't.

I'm assuming you didn't, Mr. Holmes.

For God's sake, she's the one
who knows the code, ask her!

473
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,370
Yes, sir, she also knows the code
that automatically calls

474
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,647
the police and sets off
the burglar alarm.

475

- Mr. Holmes doesn't...

One more word out of you, just one,

with the insides of your head.

00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,045
But what was that noise?

604
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,007
Did you know there were
other people after her, too, Mycroft,

605
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,525
before you sent John and I in there?

606
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,688
CIA trained killers,
I think excellent guess.

607
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,966
Yeah, thanks for that, Mycroft.

608
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,045
It's a disgrace, sending your
little brother into danger like that.

609
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,925
Family is all we have in the end,
Mycroft Holmes!

610
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,490
Oh, shut up, Mrs. Hudson!

611
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,005
- Mycroft!
- Hey!

612
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,963
- Apologies.
- Thank you.

613
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,247
- Though do, in fact, shut up.

I can put maximum surveillance on her.

Why bother?
You can follow her on Twitter.

619

I believe her username is TheWhipHand.

Hello?

Why does your phone make that noise?

624
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,251
What noise?

625
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,049
That noise, the one it just made.

626
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,929
It's a text alert,
it means I've got a text.

627
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,363
Hmm. Your texts
don't usually make that noise.

628
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,644
Well, somebody got hold of the phone
and apparently as a joke,

629
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,161
personalised their text alert noise.

630
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,807
Hmm, so every time they text you...

632
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,885

- Could you turn that phone down a bit?

633
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,883

See, I'm wondering who could have
got hold of your phone,

636
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,202
because it would have been
in your coat, wouldn't it?

Where do you get that idea?

Bond Air is go, that's decided.
Check with the Coventry lot.

641
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,851
Talk later.

642
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,128
What else does she have?

643
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,881
Irene Adler.

644
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,371
The Americans wouldn't be
interested in her

645
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,046
for a couple of
compromising photographs.

646
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,281
There's more.

647
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,771
Much more.

648
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,281
Something big's coming, isn't it?

649
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,727
Irene Adler is no longer
any concern of yours.

650
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,087
From now on, you will stay out of this.

651
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,766
Oh, will I?

652
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,162
Yes, Sherlock.

653
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,043
You will.

654
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,204
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a long and arduous apology

655
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,964
to make to a very old friend.

656
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,610
Do give her my love.

No, no, no, I can get this.
No, Sarah was the doctor

665
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,008
and then there was the one with
the spots and then the one with the nose

666
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,686
and then... Who was after
the boring teacher?

Hello, everyone. Sorry, hello.
Uh, it said on the door just to,

- just come up.

Wow!

675
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,323
So we're having
a Christmas drinkies, then?

676
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,323
- No stopping them, apparently.
- It's the one day of the year

677
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,164
where the boys have to be nice to me,

678
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,004
so it's almost worth it.

679
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,250
- John? The counter on your blog...
- Hmm?

680
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,891
- Molly, want a drink?
- It still says 1,895.

681
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,769
Oh no, Christmas is cancelled.

682
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,410
And you've got a photograph of me
wearing that hat!

683

- People like the hat.
- No, they don't. What people?

684
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,603
- How's the hip?
- Oh, it's atrocious,

685
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,091
but thanks for asking.

686
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,891
I've seen much worse,
but then I do post-mortems.

687
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,800
Oh, God, sorry.

688
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,843
- Don't make jokes, Molly.
- No, sorry.

689
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,809
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

690
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,081
I wasn't expecting to see you.

691
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,049
I thought you were going to be
in Dorset for Christmas?

692
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,884
That's first thing in the morning,
me and the wife,

693
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,530
we're back together, it's all sorted.

694
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,409
No, she's sleeping with a PE teacher.

695
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,011
And John, I hear you're off
to your sister's, is that right?

696
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,522
- Yeah.
- Sherlock was complaining. Saying.

697
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,046
First time ever, she's cleaned-up
her act, she's off the booze.

698
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,531
- Nope.
- Shut up, Sherlock!

699
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,001
I see you've got a new boyfriend, Molly,
and you're serious about him.

700
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,366
What? Sorry, what?

701
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,647
In fact, you're seeing him
this very night and giving him a gift

702
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,370
- Take a day off.
- Shut up and have a drink.

703
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,205
Oh, come on, surely you've all
seen the present at the top of the bag.

704
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,884
Perfectly wrapped with a bow.
All the others are slapdash at best.

705
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,083
It's for someone special, then.

706
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,640
The shade of red echoes her lipstick,
either an unconscious association

707
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,529
or one that she's deliberately
trying to encourage.

708
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,046
Either way, Miss Hooper
has love on her mind.

709
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,281
The fact that she's serious about him
is clear from the fact

710
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,284
she's giving him a gift at all.
That always suggests long-term hopes,

711
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,283
<i>however forlorn,
and that she's seeing him tonight</i>

712
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,328
<i>is evident from her make-up
and what she's wearing.</i>

713
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,610
Obviously trying to compensate
for the size of her mouth and breasts...

714
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,170
You always say such horrible things.
Every time. Always.

715
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,726
Always.

716
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,206
I am sorry. Forgive me.

was busy with... Christmas.

The face is a bit sort of bashed-up,
so it might be a bit difficult.

- That's her, isn't it?

00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,881
She had an item in her possession,

754
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,485
one she said her life depended on.

755
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,562
She chose to give it up.

756

Where is this item now?

No. Did he take the cigarette?

- Yes.
- Shit!

- There's nothing in the bedroom.

Well, it looks like he's clean.
We've tried all the usual places.

No, I'll do anything for you,

I'm not doing, tell me!

There, I've said it now,
I'll even walk your dog.

You were right, he thinks it's Mycroft.

Hmm, I believe you.

It was definitely you.

850
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,721
DNA tests are only as good
as the records you keep.

Oh, and I bet you know

Then how come I can see you
and I don't even want to?

860
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,369
Tell him you're alive.

Oh come on, it's not code,

No letters past K,
the width of the plane is the limit.

The numbers always appear
randomly and not in sequence,

Only a jumbo is wide enough to
need a letter K or rows past 55,

1053
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,080
which is why there's always an upstairs.

1054

There's a row 13, which eliminates
the more superstitious airlines.

1055
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,923
Then there's the style
of the flight number, 007,

1056
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,126
that eliminates a few more.

1057
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,202
And assuming the British point
of origin, which would be logical,

of the information

that the crisis is imminent,

1061
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,291
the only flight that matches all
the criteria and departs within the week

1062
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:07,570
is the 6:30 to Baltimore tomorrow
evening from Heathrow airport.

1063
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,287
Please don't feel obliged to tell me
that was remarkable or amazing.

1064
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,361
John's expressed that thought

1065
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,408
in every possible variant
available to the English language.

1066
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,050
I would have you right here,

1067
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,805
on this desk, until you
begged for mercy twice.

1068
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,008
John, please can you check those
flight schedules, see if I'm right?

1069
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,324
Yeah, I'm on it, yeah.

1071
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,771
- I've never begged for mercy in my life.
- Twice.

1072
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,000
Uh, yeah, you're right, flight 007.

1073
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,446
- What did you say?
- You're right.

1074
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,409
No, no, after that,
what did you say after that?

1075
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,528
007. Flight om.

1076
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,649
007, 007, 007, 007. Something.

1077
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,769
Something 007, 007. What?

1078
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,211
007, 007.

1079
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,890
007. 007 what?

1080
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,209
What, something, what?

1081
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,731
Bond Air is go.

1082
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,971
Bond Air is go.

1083
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,326
Bond Air is go.

1084

01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,365
Is it nice?

1090
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,690
Where's John?

1091
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,762
He went out, a couple of hours ago.

1092
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,007
- I was just talking to him.
- He said you do that.

1093
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,122
What's Coventry got to do
with anything?

1094
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,285
It's a story.

1095
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,251
Probably not true.

1096
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,129
In the Second World War,
the Allies knew

1097
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,965
that Coventry was going to get bombed
because they'd broken the German code

1098
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,327
but they didn't want the Germans
to know that they'd broken the code

1099
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,209
so they let it happen anyway.

1100
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,691
Have you ever had anyone?

1101
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,731
I'm sorry?

1102
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,007
And when I say had,
I'm being indelicate.

1103
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,084
- I don't understand.
- I'll be delicate, then.

1104
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,845
- Let's have dinner.
- Why?

1105
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,251
- You might be hungry
- I'm not.

1106
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,481
Good.

1107
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:30,090
Why would I want to have dinner

1108
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,083
if I wasn't hungry?

1109
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,443
Mr. Holmes,
if it was the end of the world,

1110
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,569
if this was the very last night,

1111
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,883
would you have dinner with me?

<font color="#404040">MRS HUDSON:</font> Sherlock?

Too late.

1114
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,928
That's not the end of the world,
that's Mrs. Hudson.

1115
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,887
Sherlock, this man was at the door,
is the bell still not working?

1116
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,041
He shot it.

1117
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,929
Have you come to take me away again?

1118
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,605
- Yes, Mr. Holmes.
- Well, I decline.

1119
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,329
I don't think you do.

1120
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,925
There's going to be a bomb
on a passenger jet.

1121
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,604
The British and American
governments know about it,

1122
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,887
but rather than expose
the source of their information,

1123
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,247
they're going to let it happen.
The plane will blow up.

1124
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,802
Coventry all over again

1125
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,324
The wheel turns, nothing is ever new.

1126
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,122
Well, you're looking all better.

1127
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,804
How are you feeling?

1128
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,846
Like putting a bullet
in your brain, sir.

1129
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,206
<font color="#DF01D7">(SHERLOCK SCOFFS)</font>

1130
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:37,361
They'd pin a medal on me if I did, sir.

1131
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,003
The Coventry conundrum.

1132
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,167
What do you think of my solution?

1133
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,963
The flight of the dead.

1134
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,004
Plane blows up midair,
mission accomplished for the terrorists,

1135
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,401
hundreds of casualties but nobody dies.

1136
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,410
Neat, don't you think?

1137
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:39,762
You've been stumbling around
the fringes of this one for ages.

1138
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,320
Or were you too bored
to notice the pattern?

1139
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,406
They wouldn't let us see
Granddad when he was dead.

1140
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,290
She's not my real aunt.
I know human ash.

1141
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,011
We ran a similar project
with the Germans a while back,

1142
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,323
though I believe one of our passengers
didn't make the flight.

1143
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,767
But that's the deceased for you,

1144
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,771
late, in every sense of the word.

1145
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,211
How is the plane going to fly?

1146
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,011
Oh, of course, unmanned aircraft,
hardly new.

1147
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,801
It doesn't fly. It will never fly.

1148
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,721
This entire project is cancelled.

1149
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,929
The terrorist cells have been informed
that we know about the bomb.

1150
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,409
We can't fool them now.

1151
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,049
We've lost everything.

1152
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,489
One fragment of one email
and months and years of planning,

1153
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,491
finished.

1154
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,806
- Your MOD man.
- That's all it takes.

1155
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,809
One lonely, naive man,
desperate to show off,

1156
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,529
and a woman clever enough
to make him feel special.

1157
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,802
You should screen your defence people
more carefully.

1158
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,885
I'm not talking about the MOD man,
Sherlock, I'm talking about you!

1159
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,604
A damsel in distress.

1160
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,404
In the end, are you really so obvious?

1161
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,884
Because this was textbook.

1162
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,924
The promise of love, the pain of loss,
the joy of redemption.

1163
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,967
Then give him a puzzle
and watch him dance.

1164
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,202
- Don't be absurd!
- Absurd?

1165
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,366
How quickly did you decipher
that email for her?

1166
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,451
Was it the full minute?

1167
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,087
Or were you really eager to impress?

1168
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,606
I think it was less than five seconds.

1169
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,968
I drove you into her path.

1170
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,885
I'm sorry. I didn't know

1171
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,570
- Mr. Holmes, I think we need to talk.
- So do I.

1172
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,521
There are a number of aspects
I'm still not quite clear on.

1173
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,364
Not you, junior, you're done now.

1174
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,882
There's more, loads more.

1175
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,527
On this phone I've got
secrets and pictures and scandals

1176
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,409
that could topple your whole world.

1177
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,882
You have no idea how much
havoc I can cause

1178
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,962
and exactly one way to stop me.

1179
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,488
Unless you want to tell your
masters that your biggest security leak

1180
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,244
is your own little brother.

1181
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,845
We have people who can get into this.

1182
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,607
I tested that theory for you.

1183
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,291
I let Sherlock Holmes
try it for six months.

1184
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,930
Sherlock, dear, tell him what you found
when you x-rayed my camera-phone.

1185
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,886
There are four additional units
wired inside the casing.

1186
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,167
I suspect containing acid
or a small amount of explosive.

1187
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,766
Any attempt to open the casing
will burn the hard drive.

1188
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,251
Explosive.

1189
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,644
It's more me.
Some data is always recoverable.

1190
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,481
Take that risk.

1191
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,689
You have a passcode to open this.

1192
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,003
I deeply regret to say we have people
who can extract it from you.

1193
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,687
Sherlock?

1194
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,761
There will be two passcodes,

1195
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,161
one to open the phone,
one to burn the drive.

1196
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,802
<i>Even under duress, you can't
know which one she's given you</i>

1197
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,008
and there would be no point
in a second attempt.

1198
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,811
Oh, he's good, isn't he?
I should have him on a leash.

1199
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,050
In fact, I might.

1200
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,803
We destroy this, then.
No one has the information.

1201
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,531
Fine. Good idea.

1202
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,688
Unless there are lives of
British citizens

1203
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,444
depending on the information
you're about to burn.

1204
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,761
Are there?

1205
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,282
Telling you would be playing fair.

1206
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,882
I'm not playing any more.

1207
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,967
A list of my requests

1208
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,522
and some ideas about my protection
once they're granted.

1209
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,844
I'd say it wouldn't blow much
of a hole in the wealth of a nation,

1210
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,285
but then I'd be lying.

1211
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,929
I imagine you'd like to sleep on it?

1212
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,762
- Thank you, yes.
- Too bad.

I had a bit of help.

about how to play the Holmes boys.

1224

Do you know what he calls you?

1225
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,726
The Ice Man

1226
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,085
and the Virgin.

1227
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,447
Didn't even ask for anything,
I think he just likes to cause trouble.

1228
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,443
Now, that's my kind of man.

1229

I said no.

Very, very close, but no.

1234
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,249
You got carried away.

1235
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,449
The game was too elaborate,
you were enjoying yourself too much.

1236
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,244
There's no such thing as too much.

1237
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,527
Oh, enjoying the thrill
of the chase is fine.

1238
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,001
Craving the distraction of the game,
I sympathise entirely,

1239
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,684
but sentiment?

1240
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,604
Sentiment is a chemical defect
found in the losing side.

- You.
- Oh, dear God.

Look at the poor man.

1245

You don't actually think
I was interested in you?

1246
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,968
Why? Because you're
the great Sherlock Holmes,

1247

No.

love is a mystery to me

01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,648
but the chemistry is incredibly
simple and very destructive.

1254
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,844
When we first met, you told me
that disguise is always a self-portrait.

1255
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,604
How true of you.
The combination to your safe,

1256
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,047
your measurements, but this,
this is far more intimate.

1257
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,920
This is your heart and
you should never let it rule your head.

into a Witness Protection scheme

She will survive and thrive,

- but he will never see her again.
- Why would he care?

1286
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,802
He despised her at the end.

1287
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,121
Won't even mention her by name,
just The Woman.

1288
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,411
Is that loathing or a salute?

One of a kind,
the one woman who matters?

1290
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,602
He's not like that.
He doesn't feel things that way.

1291
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,801
I don't think.

1292

My brother has the brain
of a scientist or a philosopher,

1293
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,001
yet he elects to be a detective.

- I don't know.
- Neither do I.

He'll be okay with this,

That's why I decided to tell him that.
