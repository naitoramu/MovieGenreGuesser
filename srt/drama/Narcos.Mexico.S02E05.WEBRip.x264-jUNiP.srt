1
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,933
<i>Somewhere out on that horizon</i>

2
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,856
<i>Out beyond the neon lights</i>

3
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,820
<i>I know there must be
something better</i>

4
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,860
<i>But there's nowhere else in sight</i>

5
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,790
<i>It's survival in the city</i>

6
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:28,630
<i>When you live from day to day</i>

7
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,636
<i>City streets don't have much pity</i>

8
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,890
<i>When you're down,
that's where you'll stay</i>

9
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,773
<i>In the city</i>

10
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,860
<i>In the city</i>

11
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,729
<i>I was born here in the city</i>

12
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,652
<i>With my back against the wall</i>

13
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,533
<i>Nothing grows
and life ain't very pretty</i>

14
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,490
<i>No one's there
to catch you when you fall</i>

15
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,540
Héctor Palma has been running Sinaloa

16
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,760
since he left Juárez.

17
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:27,976
Amado Carrillo Fuentes was sent
to Juárez to manage Pablo Acosta.

18
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,352
And he does not like it.

19
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,896
We don't need the fucking ABC's, man.

20
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,356
We know half this shit.

21
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,941
Is that right?

22
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,611
Well, did you know the Sinaloans are
moving cocaine through Tijuana?

23
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,281
Using the Arellano Félix organization?

24
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,286
Or how about this?
It's not a happy marriage.

25
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,621
In fact, they fucking hate each other.

26
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,500
The Arellano Félix boys bitched about
sharing their plaza for months.

27
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,960
But to keep them happy,

28
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,922
Félix put a tax on any product
the Sinaloans move through TJ.

29
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,383
But these guys...

30
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,011
they're not the tax-paying type.

31
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,723
As of yesterday, Palma told
Benjamín to kiss his ass.

32
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,392
And now the Sinaloans

33
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,520
are pulling all their
cocaine out of Tijuana.

34
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,940
How much we talking?

35
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,235
It's at least three
or four hundred keys.

36
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,408
Not moving too fast for you, am I?

37
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,738
So, what happens

38
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,248
when they don't haul their
shit back to Mazatlán?

39
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,772
Things get interesting.

40
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,252
These guys are going to
move a lot of weight,

41
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,463
and they're going to take a
tremendous risk to do it.

42
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,132
It leaves you with an opportunity.

43
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,218
You want to take Félix Gallardo down?

44
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,220
Testify.

45
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,681
Take immunity.

46
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,767
You could do it from a courtroom.

47
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,019
You may not value my life, but I do.

48
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,105
How's it work?

49
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,566
The money from Félix?

50
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,902
You on a regular payroll?

51
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,364
Or you just take a pinch out of
the envelopes he has you deliver?

52
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,033
What was your name again?

53
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,251
You got some crew, Walt.

54
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,754
Must explain all your success.

55
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,298
Let me know if you guys find your balls.

56
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,342
If nothing else...

57
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,929
maybe you guys actually learned
something today, right?

58
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,310
Prick.

59
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,615
You asked me to listen. I did.

60
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,659
But I still don't like it.

61
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,287
You know the kind of shit
I've heard about this guy?

62
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,040
And now he's seen all our faces.

63
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,587
No ticket home for us
three if he starts talking.

64
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,383
Sure.

65
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,218
But we've seen his face too.

66
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,471
Félix finds out he was here...

67
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,389
he's dead.

68
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,559
So we're supposed to trust him?

69
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,852
Fuck, no.

70
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,147
We treat him like any other CI.
Trust but verify.

71
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,857
Dirtbag edition.

72
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,901
We see where it leads.

73
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,321
Come on.

74
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,283
Heath told us to wrap
this shit up, right?

75
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,620
Maybe we put 400 keys on
the table before we go.

76
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,124
You know, get one real win out
of this whole fucking thing.

77
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,880
What's it gonna be, guys?

78
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,062
Your brothers' agreement with
the Sinaloans has ended.

79
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,273
It leaves us with an opportunity.

80
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,943
By using your family's
infrastructure, routes,

81
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,695
we piggyback our loads
through customs.

82
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,991
And once the product clears the
border? Arrives in the States?

83
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,284
Then what?

84
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,827
We use your drivers.

85
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,340
And how long till that
gets back to my brothers?

86
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,374
Just like that.

87
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,877
What do you have in mind, boss?

88
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,216
We do this? We do it right.

89
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,720
And we do it our way.

90
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,727
Work in Tijuana's hard to find.

91
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,856
No one knows that
better than the gringos.

92
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,196
A recruiting agency based in
San Diego has an office in Tijuana,

93
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,823
which sponsors women for work visas.

94
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,162
The gringos place them
in jobs across the border.

95
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,541
They earn American wages
for cleaning hotel rooms.

96
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,251
Houses.

97
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,545
Offices.

98
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,380
These women cross the border
on foot every morning,

99
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,425
looking for a chance
to better their lives.

100
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,595
And the company takes advantage of that.

101
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,930
They pick them up,

102
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,560
shuttle them back at
the end of a long shift,

103
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,397
and in return, take a
piece of their earnings.

104
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,192
Company's end is 84%.

105
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,947
Because with 20 American
dollars in their pocket,

106
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,490
who's going to complain?

107
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,369
It's more than these women
will ever make in Mexico.

108
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,124
So your plan's to bribe
your way into this company?

109
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,255
I bought it last week.

110
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,508
I run the books for my brothers.

111
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,636
Seemed like a nice addition
to our holdings.

112
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,141
Starting tomorrow, our girls
are taking home full wages.

113
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,477
On top of the $500
more to move our coke.

114
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,687
Mules.

115
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,524
You say these women cross daily on foot.

116
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,901
How much could they possibly carry?

117
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,653
Figure, half-a-pound a girl.

118
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,826
But 35,000 people cross the
San Ysidro bridge every day.

119
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,537
We have employed 700 of them.

120
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,206
That's 350 pounds...

121
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,000
each day.

122
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,502
Any other questions?

123
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,468
Close it.

124
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,433
Get in that one.

125
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:48,272
Not leaving any shit behind
this time? Goat or something?

126
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,151
If only you had some common sense,

127
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,861
just a little bit,

128
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,073
you would've turned
that pig into carnitas.

129
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,908
What a waste.

130
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,453
Already had as much Sinaloan
shit as we could swallow.

131
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,708
Bet your brother could teach
you how to swallow more hog.

132
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,418
What the fuck did you say?

133
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,505
Behave yourselves, ladies!

134
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:19,136
Good luck stuffing all that coke
into a raft. Motherfuckers.

135
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,599
Get some men to follow them,
make sure they leave the city.

136
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,921
They're moving. Headed
south on Los Higos. Over.

137
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,760
Copy that. We're on it.

138
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,359
Need to hire more fucking guys.

139
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,403
We're not making our quota.

140
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,073
Amado! The boss wants you.

141
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,748
Hello. Hello?

142
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,254
Hey! Let me know if Acosta calls back.

143
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,008
No, not Acosta. The boss-boss.

144
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,760
From Guadalajara.

145
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,441
But according to Amado,
we have to build.

146
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,068
I think about four...

147
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,030
Look at this guy.

148
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,492
Should write up a citation.

149
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,160
Where's your hard hat, man?

150
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,538
Fucks up my hair.

151
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,622
What's up, Félix?

152
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,418
Was giving him an update
on all our progress.

153
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,545
Things are going well.

154
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,508
We're doing all right.

155
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,676
Acosta was here all day yesterday.

156
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,345
Want me to get him on the phone?

157
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,805
I didn't come to see him.

158
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,473
I came here to talk to you.

159
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,556
- All right then.
- Good to meet you, sir.

160
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,102
Anything you ever need
in Juárez, let me know.

161
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,729
Thank you, comandante.

162
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,527
Great.

163
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,699
I always liked construction sites.

164
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,160
Seeing things being built.

165
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,498
You checking up on me, or what?

166
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,836
What do you think of him?

167
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,630
- Aguilar?
- Yeah.

168
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,926
He's smart, ambitious...

169
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,847
a real piece of shit.

170
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,768
But half of the cops
here owe him their jobs.

171
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,062
- Yeah.
- And he knows everyone, right?

172
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,146
Yeah.

173
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,818
Good, he can keep an eye
on this while you're away.

174
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,070
We're going on a trip.

175
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,614
Where the fuck to?

176
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,825
Panama. Let's go.

177
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,886
We just passed the highway entrance.

178
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,476
They're headed north.

179
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,729
The trucks are definitely
going to the border.

180
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,357
These dipshits are actually
gonna try to cross?

181
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:10,159
Amat, tell Ossie to pull
back and let us tag back in.

182
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,452
Copy that.

183
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,727
So you gonna tell me?
What the fuck is in Panama?

184
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,940
Yeah. A meeting with the
Colombians. I want you there.

185
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,650
Why Panama?

186
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,361
Neutral territory.

187
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,678
I made a deal with Juan
Nepomuceno Guerra.

188
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,490
The Gulf is joining the Federation.

189
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,159
The old man's going to be there.

190
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,579
I'll explain the Colombians'
future to them.

191
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,874
From now on, they pay us in product.

192
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,005
That puts us in their business.

193
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,882
That's the idea.

194
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,759
Over the next six months,

195
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,513
they'll get pushed out of the retail
cocaine business in America.

196
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,891
The Colombians are no
longer in charge, man.

197
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,102
It's my turn.

198
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,190
What the fuck are you talking about?

199
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,902
If I control the path to market,

200
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,362
they won't have a choice.

201
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,156
With Matta in prison,

202
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,952
someone will have to take control
of transportation, right?

203
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,830
We will run our own fleet of planes.

204
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,458
You'll be in charge of
the whole operation.

205
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:47,214
You wanted to know why you're here.
There it is. Congratulations.

206
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,679
We'll build runways
in Chiapas, Veracruz.

207
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,474
We refuel there, then drop
the shit off in Juárez.

208
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,477
Which becomes our main distribution hub.

209
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,023
I told you it was important.

210
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,528
The fucking Colombians
will work for us now.

211
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,870
The money coming in...

212
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,915
it makes us untouchable.

213
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,629
How long you been working on this?

214
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,217
My whole life.

215
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,599
We'll control this business,
from Bogotá to New York.

216
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:45,773
Escobar, Cali, the fucking PRI...

217
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,192
they will all fall in line.

218
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,695
This transforms us.

219
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,906
You ready for that?

220
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,742
You bet I'm ready.

221
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,245
Look at you.

222
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,999
I sometimes thought you
would back out on me.

223
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,003
Why would I back out?

224
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,010
Sir, we are about to land.

225
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,720
Thanks, darling.

226
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,724
Those guys will be at
the hotel in an hour.

227
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,018
The old man and his nephew
are meeting us there.

228
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,858
Good work.

229
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,741
'Mon!

230
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,875
What?

231
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,460
You okay?

232
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,258
You seen Ramón today?

233
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,803
In one of his moods.

234
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,724
Got a call. They told me
he was in the park again.

235
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,522
Ramón's not the one
I worry about. He's fine.

236
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,320
You should be happy

237
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,195
we got those Sinaloans out of
the warehouse this morning.

238
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:18,615
Should've seen their faces,
packing up their shit.

239
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,286
Couldn't handle the tax, I guess.

240
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,539
- Yeah, impressive.
- Yeah.

241
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,585
Don't forget Mom has that
doctor's appointment at 4:00.

242
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,461
Make sure someone's there to take her.

243
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,964
You can't take her?

244
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,084
You have a date or something?

245
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,262
- Yeah, Benjamín.
- What?

246
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,348
That cute guy from the
café finally asked me out.

247
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,248
Target's stopped. Going into
another warehouse. Over.

248
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,169
Copy that.
We're two klicks behind.

249
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,923
Why would you move 400 keys of cocaine

250
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,467
from one warehouse to
another ten miles away?

251
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,019
These guys are up to some dirt.

252
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,355
Gotta be.

253
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,968
All right, fellas, we'll be on
the north side of the street.

254
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,404
You guys find a spot and post up.
Over.

255
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,489
Copy.

256
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,225
- Mr. Félix.
- Yeah.

257
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,977
The boss will be up shortly.

258
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,437
Good. I'll let my associates
know. Thank you.

259
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,816
Excuse me. Everybody out,
let's go. All of you.

260
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,364
We have to go, man.

261
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,825
- Let me work.
- We have to go now.

262
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,743
Almost done.

263
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,829
Don't take long.

264
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,958
Hey, are you done?

265
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,881
Almost, sir.

266
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,552
Never know who's listening.
Better to be certain.

267
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,635
Yeah.

268
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,974
I'm sure it is.
Need to be on your toes.

269
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,312
It's a good spot to hide a camera.

270
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,943
Let's see.

271
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,370
All right then.
Think you're done here.

272
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,750
I handle security.
This is my normal routine.

273
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,255
Excuse me, sir.

274
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,633
Good luck with your meeting.

275
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,057
What's your name?

276
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,434
Salcedo.

277
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,395
We're done, right?

278
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,043
Reception.

279
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,963
Connect me to Nepomuceno
Guerra's room, please.

280
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,552
There's no one under that name
checked into the hotel, sir.

281
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,346
Okay, wait.

282
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,808
And Juan Ábrego,
do you have that name?

283
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,934
One moment.

284
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,145
We missing someone?

285
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,986
Looks like you were expecting company.

286
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:36,081
No. No, just us. Drink?

287
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:43,547
Guess somebody was mistaken.

288
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,681
Well then...

289
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,185
You said you had something
important to discuss.

290
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,107
I hope so. I had to rearrange
a lot of shit to be here.

291
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,779
Let's get the fuck out of here.

292
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,579
Right.

293
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,664
Well, I almost forgot.

294
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,459
I also have something to tell you.

295
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,921
We've made a deal with
one of your countrymen.

296
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,924
He's gonna be moving powder for us too.

297
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,513
He's a real old-timer.

298
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,892
Like fucking Al Capone or something.

299
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,271
Family's big in heroin,
but that's changing.

300
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,439
Thanks to me.

301
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,441
He's called...

302
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,277
Juan Nepomuceno Guerra.

303
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,029
Ever heard of him?

304
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:54,992
Yeah.

305
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,621
Yeah, I've heard of him.

306
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,881
Don't worry. It doesn't
affect our arrangement.

307
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,925
Far as I'm concerned,

308
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,427
there's room for everyone.

309
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,012
Mexico is a big country.

310
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,097
Right?

311
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,849
Yes.

312
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,483
What've you got?

313
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,157
We're going to need you
to send us more product.

314
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,748
That's why we're here.

315
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,717
Still having problems
keeping your people happy?

316
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,721
Making payroll can be tough.

317
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,975
How much?

318
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,893
As much as you can put together.

319
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,443
Well, let's see.

320
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,655
If we really tried,

321
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,367
in a few months, we could...

322
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:22,914
put together, say, 65,000 kilos.

323
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,377
That's what, 70 tons?
More or less.

324
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,170
That's good.

325
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,509
That's good.

326
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,514
But you know the deal.

327
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,809
Once that shit leaves
Colombia, you're responsible.

328
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,561
For every gram.

329
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,900
Talk to your partners if you'd like,

330
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,818
and let me know what they decide.

331
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,027
No.

332
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,530
No, no need.

333
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,826
My partners and I trust each other.

334
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,120
We're family.

335
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,498
Same for you, no?

336
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,335
No.

337
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,919
I don't have partners.

338
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,298
That's right.

339
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,049
Right.

340
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,139
Since the Honduran got
grabbed by the DEA,

341
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,392
you'll have to handle transportation
too. That a problem?

342
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,312
No problem.

343
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,984
You know...

344
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,488
Matta-Ballesteros wasn't my partner.

345
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,534
If he was our partner,
I'd be asking questions

346
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:45,830
about how he got busted after
all this time in the game.

347
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,544
He wasn't family.

348
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,631
So it's not my business.

349
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,510
But I liked him.

350
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,679
He was cool.

351
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,764
Yes.

352
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,315
Well, my partners like making money.

353
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,193
So this deal works out,
they'll be happy.

354
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,113
And if it doesn't, then...

355
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,493
well, we'll see what happens next.

356
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,125
By the way, I didn't catch your name.

357
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,837
Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

358
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,840
Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

359
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,591
I won't forget it.

360
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,595
I like knowing who
transports my merchandise.

361
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,975
It will be a pleasure to work
with you as well, Amado.

362
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,981
Okay, gentlemen.

363
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,193
See you later.

364
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,154
Excuse us, gentlemen.

365
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,731
What the fuck, Félix?

366
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,984
How are we going to move
that much coke?

367
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,361
What was I supposed to do?
There was no choice.

368
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:45,825
If we fuck up 65,000 kilos,
that's a death sentence.

369
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,912
Fucking Guerra, that motherfucker.

370
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,045
I need planes to move that amount,
and we don't have any.

371
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,463
Then get some, Amado.

372
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,756
Get them.

373
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,070
- Hello.
- You made a mistake today, old man.

374
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,656
Miguel Ángel, my boy.

375
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,820
You caught me with my apron on again.

376
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,452
I'm making supper for the little ones.

377
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,663
Look, as things turn out,

378
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,541
I decided not to go through
with the arrangement.

379
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:38,294
I know you're moving coke
for the Colombians now.

380
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,838
Well...

381
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:44,467
you were so convincing,
I couldn't resist.

382
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,177
We had a fucking deal!

383
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,720
I wouldn't go so far as that.

384
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,180
Listen to me...

385
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,516
No, you listen to me, Miguel Ángel.

386
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,310
You have high-profile problems.

387
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,772
And I'm a quiet man, by nature.

388
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,567
Any problems I have had,

389
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,862
I've dealt with them.
You know that.

390
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:09,617
And I commend you on that,
I really do, but I have to wonder...

391
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,162
how long would I have lasted,

392
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,958
once you got what you
wanted from the Colombians?

393
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,962
Your partners seem to have histories

394
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,756
which are short and tragic,
Miguel Ángel.

395
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,675
In the end, let's just say...

396
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,596
I prefer to tend my own garden.

397
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,682
Stop talking about my fucking partners!

398
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,893
You like Rome so much, right?

399
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,730
I'm going to nail your fat ass
onto a cross, you piece of shit!

400
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,774
I'm going to hang you like a pig
so that your filthy grandchildren

401
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,735
can watch you bleed out
in your fucking ranch!

402
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,612
Then I'll burn it to the ground!

403
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,156
Something tells me that won't happen.

404
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,325
Miguel Ángel...

405
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,951
Life...

406
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,955
is a long journey with a
map written by a fool.

407
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,793
We never know as much as we think...

408
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,296
do we?

409
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,948
Okay, so what are the chances

410
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,546
this plays out our way?

411
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,756
You giving me odds?

412
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,719
This doesn't play out, I'm at a desk
in Phoenix this time next week.

413
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,430
Fucking Phoenix, man.

414
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,059
So, what's the deal with those two guys?

415
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,561
They go way back, huh?

416
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,940
I've never known Walt without Sal.
I don't think I'd want to.

417
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,609
Well, he gave me his word
he would help me out,

418
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,820
put in a good word for
my brother's parole.

419
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,613
Can I count on him?

420
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,949
Walt says he's gonna do
something for you...

421
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
he will.

422
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,998
Got a story, or... you
care to elaborate on that?

423
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,749
No.

424
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,423
- Where is he locked up?
- Kern Valley. Near Fresno.

425
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,301
Twelve years for an
armed robbery charge.

426
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,720
He do it?

427
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,307
Fuck, yeah. A hundred percent.

428
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,435
They're moving again.

429
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,239
You guys seeing this?

430
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,324
Yeah, we see it.

431
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,806
Hold up a second.

432
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,559
Hey, guys, stay on those trucks.
We'll be right behind you.

433
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,938
Who are these guys?

434
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,526
I don't know. They look like they're
part of the Arellano Félix crew.

435
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,074
Guess they're wondering
the same thing we are.

436
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,662
You want to get back on those trucks?

437
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,789
No.

438
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,250
Well, what do you want to do?

439
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,877
I want to take a look for myself.

440
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,350
Tell me something good, Cochi.

441
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,602
How'd the brothers take it?

442
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,687
Any bullshit?

443
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,189
All good.

444
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,610
Fucking dogs have been on
us since we left Tijuana.

445
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,409
What about the other thing?

446
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,744
Pretty good.

447
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,623
Blew a fuse on the ventilator,
but it'll be all right.

448
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,375
All good?

449
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,628
Fucking hot today.

450
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,297
Tell me about it. Heat is a bitch.

451
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,381
Listen to me.

452
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,260
We don't need one of those
workers dying on us, man.

453
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,301
Of course not.

454
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,097
The fuck?
Why haven't you fixed it?

455
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,850
- The fan?
- Yes, goddamn it!

456
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,519
Just needs an industrial cord.

457
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:50,439
Chapo says he found one,
but the prices in Tijuana, man...

458
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,110
But I found a guy that'll give it to us

459
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,404
for half what the stores
in town are selling it at.

460
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,073
You hear that, Héctor? Half-off.

461
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,660
Just fix the fucking fan, Cochi!

462
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,955
Fine.

463
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,876
Guess Lupita's not
giving it to him enough.

464
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,225
Goddamn it. It's empty.

465
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,899
Nothing.

466
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,519
We need air, boss.

467
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,855
Breathe slower.

468
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,567
Fucking hell.

469
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,199
How's the cable coming?!

470
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,995
It's coming! It's coming!

471
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,290
Hurry!

472
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,669
We are suffocating here!

473
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,172
Connect that fucking cable!

474
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,674
Fuck.

475
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,629
Was that running before?

476
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,813
What the fuck are these guys doing?

477
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,359
Well, I guess Calderoni was wrong.

478
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,236
These idiots are going home.

479
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,696
Back to Sinaloa.

480
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,868
Walt, negative on going
across that border.

481
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,370
They're taking Federal Two.
Going eastbound.

482
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,372
Headed back to Sinaloa.

483
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,501
Stay on them for another ten miles.

484
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,549
Why would they bring their shit
all the way back to Sinaloa?

485
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,302
Maybe because it's never left Tijuana.

486
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,059
Something's going on here.

487
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,021
We're staying till nightfall.

488
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,107
I'm going in that fucking warehouse.

489
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,303
Two hundred kilos just like that.

490
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:54,308
The gringos didn't even look
their way. Our people either.

491
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,143
It was brilliant, Enedina.

492
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,606
But we're going to have a problem.

493
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,568
What?

494
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,824
We're going to need more coke.

495
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,534
A lot more.

496
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,458
I'm going to introduce you
to my contact in Colombia.

497
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,923
It's time, partner.

498
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,095
What are we looking for?

499
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,040
Hear that?

500
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:10,110
This guy is fucking my girl.
Fucking bullshit.

501
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,864
Well, she's so fine, I don't blame him.

502
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,742
Shut up, man. Don't fuck with me too.

503
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:23,874
I'm always being made a fool of,
and you still got to fuck with me.

504
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,835
Here are your fucking cigarettes.

505
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,927
They built a fucking tunnel.

506
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,930
Every single one of these
houses on these two blocks

507
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,516
has had the same owner
for the past five years.

508
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,226
Except for this beaut right here.

509
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,563
Bought on foreclosure,
what, three months ago.

510
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,147
Cash buyer.

511
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,025
The other end of the dig.

512
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,370
Okay then. Let's call it in,
put together a team

513
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,822
and hit the shit in San Ysidro.

514
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,033
Well, that's one way to play it.

515
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,244
What does that accomplish?

516
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,122
We're talking 300 keys at least.

517
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,456
Said so yourself.

518
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,250
Getting drugs off the street, right?

519
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,835
I mean, that's what we accomplish.

520
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,337
Pin a fucking medal on our chest.

521
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,797
Is that what you're looking for?

522
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,008
A medal?

523
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,759
Fuck this guy.

524
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,472
You make this bust, it ends there.

525
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,058
You get some coke off the streets,

526
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,601
some junior traffickers go to jail.

527
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,977
Sounds good so far.

528
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,680
What happens when Benjamín
Arellano Félix finds out

529
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,399
that the Sinaloans have built
a tunnel beneath his plaza?

530
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,321
The heat between
the plazas gets turned up.

531
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,990
Now that's bad news for Félix.

532
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,243
You want to dismantle an empire?

533
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:43,828
Divide it.

534
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,504
Walt, you're not seriously
considering this, are you?

535
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,468
This your move all along, comandante?

536
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,138
This guy is playing us.

537
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,436
Yeah, maybe.

538
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,897
But I'm tired of losing.

539
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,528
Walt, we go down this path, man,
I can't hang with you.

540
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,113
I'm out.

541
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,949
I mean it, man.

542
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,832
Well...

543
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,295
then you do what you gotta do, man.

544
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,641
How do we make this happen?

545
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,860
The old fucker's not stupid.

546
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,654
He knows what I can do to him.

547
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,365
Find out why he's not afraid.

548
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,560
When I land in Guadalajara,

549
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,161
tell me what the fuck
he's got in his back pocket.

550
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,081
Got it.

551
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,594
What the fuck did you say?

552
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,930
They built a what?

553
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,732
Ramón!

554
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,951
Get some men.

555
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,731
What the fuck's that?

556
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,543
Don't move, asshole!

557
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,473
How many men are down there?

558
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,269
Boss. What the fuck was that?

559
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,233
They've stopped working down there.

560
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,322
Get them up here.

561
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,658
Let's go, guys.

562
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,786
Move it!

563
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,004
Sinaloan motherfuckers need to learn.

564
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,507
Turn that fucking thing on.

565
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,710
This is bullshit. Dump it faster!

566
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,546
You can't, boss.
Doesn't work like that.

567
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:04,923
Fuck this.

568
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,050
Take that away.

569
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,594
Okay, get the other shit.

570
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,807
So...

571
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,268
all your guys out?

572
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,857
Guess we'll find out.

573
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,165
Get out of here!

574
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,378
Move it!

575
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,423
Move it! Move!

576
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,731
What do we do, boss?

577
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,892
What is it? What's he got?

578
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,185
It's not good.

579
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,902
Who the fuck is this guy?

580
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,072
Budget secretary.

581
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:38,201
PhD from Harvard.
Father was a senator.

582
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,121
Why do I care?

583
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,707
He's going to be the next
president of Mexico.

584
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,921
Hasn't been announced, but
he's been tapped by the PRI.

585
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:54,217
Zuno's arrest in the US
made too much noise.

586
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,428
The party doesn't want a
candidate who's got a nephew

587
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,096
sitting in an American prison.

588
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:03,769
So our fat friend in Mexico City
isn't getting the nomination.

589
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:04,978
You're sure?

590
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,563
The new guy,

591
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,939
as a kid,

592
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,485
spent summers at the coast.

593
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,487
In Matamoros.

594
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,239
Where his father, the senator,

595
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,367
was close friends with a
leading local businessman,

596
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,079
Juan Nepomuceno Guerra.

597
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:25,665
So you want to know what
Guerra has in his back pocket?

598
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,293
The next president of Mexico.

599
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,508
Guerra's been playing
you the whole time.

600
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,801
Old-timers...

601
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,345
they don't fuck around.

602
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,305
Have to admire it.

603
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,391
Fuck admiring it.

604
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,645
I need everything you can
get on that bald asshole.

605
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,271
- There's something else.
- What?

606
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,774
Some shit went down in Tijuana.

607
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,569
A tunnel turned up,
running under the border.

608
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,657
Still trying to pin down
more, but it's bad.

609
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,242
Motherfuckers.

610
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:07,999
Hey, boss.

611
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,878
How was the trip?

612
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,027
Going home, sir?

613
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,533
Go to the apartment at Parque Lineal.

614
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,410
Very good.

615
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,867
Clavel! Clavel!

616
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,080
Sir, are you okay?
Remain calm.

617
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,820
We're getting everything under control.

618
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,253
Please remain calm. Stay inside
while we secure the perimeter.
