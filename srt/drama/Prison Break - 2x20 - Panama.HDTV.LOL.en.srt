1
00:00:00,679 --> 00:00:02,272
Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,819
I want a presidential pardon
for me and my brother.

3
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:08,472
You tell me what's going on--
I can take care of you.

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,636
All I need you to do

5
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:12,070
is tell me exactly what
Agent Mahone told you.

6
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:15,966
I have a job to do,
which I've been made to do.

7
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:17,508
- The phone.
- Wait.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,096
Stay right where you are.

9
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:24,312
Hey!

10
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:33,880
What if I know where
you can get $5 million?

11
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:36,310
- Where is it?
- I could take you there,

12
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,608
if you didn't have to take me back
to the States and turn me back in.

13
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:42,034
Free tickets,
one cabin, one-way.

14
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:43,011
Nice.

15
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:44,970
Sir, in just a few
minutes the president

16
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:47,781
is going to announce a pardon
for Burrows and Scofield.

17
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:51,862
I regret to inform you,
I am stepping down

18
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:55,472
as president of
the United States.

19
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:58,761
There's only one thing we can do.
We gotta disappear.

20
00:00:58,896 --> 00:00:59,781
Forever.

21
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:16,992
Aqui es to maleta,
Senor Stammel.

22
00:01:17,548 --> 00:01:18,570
Gracias.

23
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:37,532
It's very heavy.
What have you got in there?

24
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:41,043
About 75 pounds of none
of your business, Pedro.

25
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:42,863
- For your troubles.
- Gracias.

26
00:01:58,138 --> 00:01:59,073
Go! Go! Go!

27
00:02:04,097 --> 00:02:07,242
Please. T-Bag. T-Bag, please.
I need that money.

28
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:09,021
Andale, you son of
a bitch. Andale!

29
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:13,521
Please, T-Bag, I'm begging you.
Please. Please! No!

30
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:26,191
- What time does the ship leave?
- About ten minutes.

31
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,161
I can't believe
we're running again.

32
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:30,380
It's different now, man.

33
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:31,730
- You think so?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:32,940
We brought the bitch down.

35
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,472
- She stepped down, Linc.
- Because of us.

36
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:37,673
Yet you're still
wanted for murder.

37
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:42,063
When you came to Fox River...
Remember what you said?

38
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,912
You said,
"I'm gonna break you out of here."

39
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:45,570
I'm alive. You did that.

40
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:47,732
You want to look for
the good you look there.

41
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:50,392
Come on,
let's just finish what you started.

42
00:03:14,248 --> 00:03:16,922
- Hello?
- Hey, are you all right?

43
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:19,232
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just heard about the president.

44
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:21,810
- What, what does it mean?
- It means it's time to go.

45
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:24,663
Okay... when?

46
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:26,723
Ten minutes.
How far away are you?

47
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,631
- Five.
- Listen, Sara,

48
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:31,381
Linc and I are on the ship.

49
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,022
This is it.
There's no turning back now, so, uh...

50
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:39,100
I know it's not what you
wanted from your life, but

51
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:43,381
in case your interested,
there is room for one more.

52
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:46,681
Michael Scofield, you asking me to
sail off into the sunset with you?

53
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:50,571
Well, it's more of a freighter,
but, uh... yes.

54
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:52,133
I'll be there.

55
00:03:53,518 --> 00:03:54,683
I'll see you soon.

56
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:06,021
- She's heading West on Leadwell.
- All right.

57
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:08,220
Stay on her,
I'll be right there.

58
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:14,723
- What the hell's this?
- I tried, boss.

59
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:16,262
You saw how he just took off.

60
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:18,242
The only thing I'm seeing
is an escaped con,

61
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:20,280
who's begging to
be taken Nort-ay.

62
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:23,281
Okay, look, maybe we could call

63
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:25,793
the cab company and find out
where T-Bag was dropped off.

64
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,403
Now, you're talking.
I saw some phone...

65
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,883
What's it going to take for you
to forget you ever found us?

66
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:35,102
There ain't enough pesos in TJ.

67
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:38,252
You sure about that?

68
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:41,210
Go ahead, shoot.
But it might not be the best idea

69
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:45,002
seeing as how I'm the only one who
knows where your Chiquita's tied up.

70
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:46,630
Where is Maricruz?

71
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:49,010
If I tell you,
I'm as good as dead.

72
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:51,913
Of course if you shoot,
so is she.

73
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,951
- You're bluffing me.
- Am I?

74
00:04:56,985 --> 00:05:00,490
Let me tell you in words you
might be more familiar with.

75
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:01,981
She's in "the Hole,"

76
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,700
with enough food and water
to last about three weeks.

77
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:09,492
Any longer than that your sweet little
plum's gonna dry up like a raisin.

78
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,551
If anything happens to her,
so help me...

79
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,971
Help you? Way I see it,
it's you who's gotta help me.

80
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:17,071
'Cause you ain't gettin'
your hands on that girl

81
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,492
'til I get my hands
on that money.

82
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,622
Guess that makes us partners.

83
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:28,292
Here we go.

84
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:30,660
She's not here.

85
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:19,050
- Yeah.
- Sara, what's the matter?

86
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:20,162
The ship is leaving.

87
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:29,250
- Michael...
- What's wrong?

88
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:38,122
- Sara.
- I'm already on board.

89
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,443
I'm sorry, I must have just missed you.
Where are you?

90
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,131
- We're on deck.
- Great.

91
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:47,780
I'm on my way up.

92
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:50,423
Love you.

93
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:56,800
We good?

94
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:58,990
Clear vessels port side...

95
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:00,892
Yeah.

96
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:22,373
Son of a bitch.

97
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,032
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

98
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:35,331
No more games, Sara.
You were on your way to see him.

99
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:36,202
No, I wasn't.

100
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,962
You were just compelled to flee
the custody of a Federal Agent?

101
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,880
I couldn't find her.

102
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:56,842
Sara... We got to go back.

103
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,671
Michael, you can't,
there's nothing you can do.

104
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,290
There's always
something you can do.

105
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:04,423
Not this time.
Not this time, man. It's done.

106
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:06,563
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,701
- Scofield or Prison.
- I just wanted a donut, sir.

108
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,440
Get her a donut.
Can we get her a donut?

109
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:20,380
Get her a donut.
Get her a dozen donuts! Look her up!

110
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:17,501
One week later.

111
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,663
Where the hell did
you go, Michael?

112
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:02,730
So, where the hell is Mahone?

113
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:05,242
I don't know, sir.
He's been MIA for the last week or so.

114
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:07,830
You think he knows I've been
barking up one of his trees.

115
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,682
Mr. Franklin, good afternoon.

116
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,633
This is Richard Sullins.
Director of Internal Affairs at the FBI.

117
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:18,450
Which means whenever one of our
people does something wrong,

118
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,891
it's my job to make it right.

119
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,363
How right are we talking about?

120
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:26,911
Well, let's be clear,
you are a convicted felon

121
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:29,012
who broke out of a
state penitentiary,

122
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,460
there's only so much I can do.

123
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,451
Well, there's only
so much I can say.

124
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:34,600
Now, I'm sorry if I seem
a little bit skeptical.

125
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:37,651
But the last time a federal agent
came up in here offering me a deal,

126
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:40,122
there was a string attached...

127
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:42,083
that I was supposed to
put around my neck.

128
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,522
I've been authorized to, uh,
offer you a reduced sentence

129
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:46,963
in exchange for your testimony
against Agent Mahone,

130
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:49,133
instead of 18 years,
you'll be looking at 18 months.

131
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:50,632
18 months?

132
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:52,933
Hey, you know what?
That man tried to kill me.

133
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:55,041
So as soon as he finds
out that I'm singing,

134
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:57,333
I probably won't
even last 18 days.

135
00:10:57,565 --> 00:11:00,520
- Mr. Franklin...
- He threatened my family.

136
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:03,261
Now, I need to be out
there protecting them.

137
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:07,611
So until you can offer me
something like that...

138
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:10,283
I'm not testifying
to a damn thing.

139
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:12,971
Guard!

140
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:17,232
Free man.

141
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:19,003
You and your family.

142
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:21,903
Witness protection,
fresh start.

143
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:24,450
Clean record?

144
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:25,990
Spick-and-span.

145
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:32,638
You put that in writing and
you got yourself a witness.

146
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:44,644
Sir?

147
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,612
I knocked, but...

148
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:51,601
You okay?

149
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:56,160
What does that look like to you?
There, right there.

150
00:11:56,305 --> 00:11:58,590
- Uh, it's a triangle.
- Yeah, I thought so, too.

151
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:05,181
- How about this?
- Right there.

152
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:07,053
It's the mathematical
symbol for Pi.

153
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:10,430
3.14. I'm thinking date,
area code.

154
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:13,571
314, that's Missouri.
So you think Scofield's there?

155
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:16,361
I doubt it.
How's your Greek alphabet, Agent Lang?

156
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:18,803
I don't know. I guess it's...

157
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:24,483
What if I told you that triangle
was a delta and that this,

158
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:27,710
this here was not the
symbol Pi but the letter?

159
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:30,852
I didn't see any of those in
the photos of the tattoos.

160
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:32,252
They weren't in the tattoos.

161
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:34,871
We pulled these from his original
sketches off the hard drive.

162
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:39,582
Scofield numbered all of
the steps of his escape.

163
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:41,093
It's how he kept
everything in order,

164
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,861
but it looks like that
he didn't use numbers,

165
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:45,050
that he used
letters like, um...

166
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:47,771
A sketch of this tattoo.

167
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:50,072
Allan Schweitzer
marked with an alpha,

168
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,561
first letter of the Greek alphabet.
First step of his plan.

169
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:56,071
Epsilon, fifth letter of the Greek
alphabet. Fifth step in his plan.

170
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,411
Here's theta, and kappa...

171
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,660
How about that? Tau?
At the border, right?

172
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:03,511
Getting closer to the end now;
you with me?

173
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:06,133
- So you think...
- His omega...

174
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:07,872
The last letter of
the Greek alphabet...

175
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:09,453
...is the last
step of his plan.

176
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:13,552
What is that?

177
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:15,563
- Christ in a flower?
- A rose.

178
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:17,150
And these numbers-- 617.

179
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:19,192
Could be biblical;
chapter 6, verse 17.

180
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:22,052
6-1-7, 617. June 17th.

181
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,333
- Oh, what's today?
- The 15th.

182
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,413
- So whatever his last step is...
- It's going to happen in two days.

183
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:42,323
What's he saying?

184
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:43,963
Nothing. The same as the rest.

185
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:47,242
Maybe he don't comprende.
What's Spanish for "INS"?

186
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:49,162
Don't be stupid.
We're in Mexico.

187
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,653
You're the illegal one here.

188
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,721
Hey, it doesn't mean he
ain't got family up north

189
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:54,623
trying to clean their
way to a green card.

190
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,262
He knows what I'm
talking about.

191
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,433
Oh, you are too
good to me, Suzi-Q.

192
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,813
Just how I like it.

193
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:47,393
How did I get so lucky?

194
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:51,141
Oh, no, Teddy Bear.
I'm the lucky one.

195
00:14:55,857 --> 00:14:57,721
The day I met you...

196
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,593
was the day I was born.

197
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:09,233
- We're out of time.
- No, Susan,

198
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:12,412
we got our whole
lives together.

199
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:14,240
No, I mean, the hour is up.

200
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:17,271
I'll take care of
you plenty, okay?

201
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:20,423
And since we're rolling here,
so let's, you know, get back...

202
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:22,481
How's it--
what's cookin', good lookin'?

203
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,841
I would really feel better
if you paid me up front.

204
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:27,491
And I told you up front
that if you did this right,

205
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,643
I would take care of you, so...

206
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:35,070
You paid me for an hour.
The hour is up.

207
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,880
If you want me to stay,
I need more money.

208
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,110
Great, great,
you ruined it. Thanks.

209
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:45,150
You know, for a second there,
I was actually like,

210
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:47,160
"This chick has a
brain in her head."

211
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:50,820
Then, if you did,
you wouldn't be a street whore, right?

212
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:54,992
You know,
I don't know who this Suzi-Q bitch is,

213
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,142
but no wonder she wants
nothing to do with you.

214
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:03,281
You didn't just call her a bitch,
did you?

215
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:04,862
Okay.

216
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:07,110
I am going to count to three,

217
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:11,443
and if you don't put your arm down,
I'm going to scream.

218
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:15,791
One, t...

219
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:47,543
We made it.

220
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:49,252
Not yet.

221
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,170
First there's someone
we need to see.

222
00:16:58,906 --> 00:17:00,391
Okay, who's got what?

223
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:03,373
Christ as a rose is a pretty common
theme that runs through the Bible.

224
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:05,493
Martin Luther adopted
it as his coat of arms.

225
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:08,070
And there's the belief that
Christ rose from the dead.

226
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,413
This is Scofield's final step,
a new life.

227
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:11,950
Could be something there.

228
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:16,221
Right. You... keep track of this
on the board. On the board.

229
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,421
- Where's Wheeler?
- Here we go.

230
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:21,110
The Harmonists--
first settlers of New Harmony, Indiana--

231
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:23,640
used a golden rose as
their symbol for Christ.

232
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:24,900
That's a reach.

233
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:26,850
There's a flower called
the Christmas Rose.

234
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,492
Wasn't "Christ Rose" a
German code name for, uh,

235
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:32,302
the counterattack by the Nazis that
led to the Battle of the Bulge?

236
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:33,652
Where was that?

237
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,463
Ardennes Forest on the
Belgium-Germany border.

238
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,833
Yeah, not a bad place to
hide if they can find it.

239
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:42,211
- So you gonna look into that?
- Yeah.

240
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:43,700
All right, what else?

241
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,892
Christ actually rose from the
dead on Easter. Easter Sunday...

242
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:59,403
- Who's got Scofield's file?
- Um, here we go.

243
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:02,061
Here.

244
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:15,723
- Christ in a rose.
- Yeah, what about it?

245
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:20,931
Scofield's mother's name.
Christina Rose Scofield.

246
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:23,361
Hmm, but I thought
she was dead.

247
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:25,051
Well, so did I.

248
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:28,201
So did I.

249
00:18:31,348 --> 00:18:34,302
The very first thing that Scofield
did when they broke out of Fox River

250
00:18:34,486 --> 00:18:37,162
is he picked up a bunch of supplies
that he had stashed in a grave.

251
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:39,690
I want you to find out where
Scofield's mother's buried.

252
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:40,710
And what?

253
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:44,912
- And see if she's buried.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:47,152
- What about Panama?
- What about Panama?

255
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:48,700
Well, when we found
his hard drive,

256
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:51,520
it was full of information about
Central America, Panama in particular.

257
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:52,723
Which he knows you have.

258
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:54,451
The guy's got all
kinds of hubris,

259
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:56,433
but he's smart enough to
stay out of a country

260
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,190
where he knows you'll
be waiting for him.

261
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:01,433
Unless there's something there
that he needs. Or someone.

262
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:06,492
I want a map of Panama, and find out
if Scofield's mom, Christina Rose,

263
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:10,670
has any family in Central America,
any property, anything.

264
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:25,952
The last time I was on a bus like this,
I was heading to Fox River.

265
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:29,800
This country's amazing.
It's beautiful.

266
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:32,983
- What's that smell, man?
- Bananas.

267
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:36,350
And sugar cane.
That's Panama's biggest exports.

268
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:39,210
Come on.
You've been talking about Panama

269
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,501
and bumpy bus rides ever
since we broke out,

270
00:19:41,688 --> 00:19:43,240
and now that we're
actually doing it...

271
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,571
She should have
been here with us.

272
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,763
We got all the time in
the world for that.

273
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:49,591
Some ways down the track,
you and Sara...

274
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:51,411
Can we just get there, please?

275
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:54,603
Sure.

276
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:58,343
Oye! Tipo! Espera!

277
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:07,711
So far, no hits on any connection
between Scofield's mother and Panama.

278
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:09,863
But there are 38 listings
of Christina Rose

279
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:12,770
in various combinations of first name,
middle name and last name.

280
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:16,051
All right, cross-reference the names
with the numbers 6-1-7 from the tattoo.

281
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:18,681
Maybe it's not a date.
See if it's an address, P.O. box.

282
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:19,611
Got it.

283
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:21,053
If anybody pops,
call the Embassy,

284
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:23,601
have them send an officer to pick
up the woman for questioning.

285
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:27,452
I don't think we can just arrest
a foreign citizen without any...

286
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,801
Patriot Act, Agent Lang.
I could arrest your grandmother

287
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:31,951
for missing a stitch in
her macramé if I wanted to.

288
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:35,092
If anybody's helping Scofield, dead or
alive, I want to know who they are.

289
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,621
- That her?
- Yeah.

290
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,330
Hola, Mrs. Vasquez.

291
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:57,371
You're late.

292
00:21:57,655 --> 00:21:59,431
It's much later than
the date you said.

293
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,770
Well, we ran into a
little bit of trouble.

294
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:03,490
Who is this?

295
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,831
It's a business associate.

296
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:10,953
Christina Rose. I remember.

297
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:12,822
You will find her here.

298
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:15,390
- Buena suerte.
- Gracias.

299
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:21,210
Oh, um...
I'll meet you outside.

300
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:24,523
- I forgot to ask something.
- All right.

301
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:32,383
Do you have a
phone I could use?

302
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,911
Yes, uh, I need an
international operator, please.

303
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:43,731
United States.

304
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,411
It's, uh, 312-346...

305
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:50,651
What the hell are you doing?

306
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,802
- Making a phone call.
- You can't.

307
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,902
We don't even know if
she's alive or dead, Linc.

308
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:56,903
If Sara's in custody,
they got her phone.

309
00:22:58,145 --> 00:22:59,741
You want to get caught?

310
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:17,741
Yeah.

311
00:23:17,978 --> 00:23:21,542
Three things I hate, Alex.
Traffic, hockey...

312
00:23:21,738 --> 00:23:23,850
and calling you with the
same question over and over.

313
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:25,380
Well, then don't
call me anymore,

314
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,330
but I do believe the
brothers are in Panama.

315
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:28,342
Is that so?

316
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:31,151
The key to exactly where is
on one of Scofield's tattoos.

317
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:33,773
While I'm thrilled you've
narrowed it down to a country,

318
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,452
that's not why we're talking.

319
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:39,450
- Benjamin Miles Franklin is alive...
- I'm aware of that, yeah.

320
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:42,681
...and being released
from custody.

321
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:45,630
That's not possible. They would
need permission from my office.

322
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,210
Good to know you're
on top of things.

323
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,600
Find me Agent Wheeler.

324
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:03,122
He'll see you now.

325
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:18,800
Forgive me for asking,
sir, but...

326
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:21,981
couldn't we be doing this in my office?
It'd be much more comfortable.

327
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:28,741
I felt we needed to speak freely.
For the next several hours,

328
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:31,693
this is what those in the intelligence
community refer to as a "blind spot."

329
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:33,923
Something to do with the
position of the sun, I'm told.

330
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:37,071
Disrupts long-distance
recording devices.

331
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:42,191
If I may apologize again,
sir, for...

332
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:44,351
the unfortunate outcome
with the president.

333
00:24:44,537 --> 00:24:46,373
I know how important she
was to our interests,

334
00:24:46,495 --> 00:24:48,560
and I assure you that
moving forward, I'll...

335
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,940
You won't be moving anywhere until you
can explain to me how this happened.

336
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:59,160
The brothers...
they're making it...

337
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,760
Still alive.

338
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:08,092
Yes. It appears they were
able to flee the country.

339
00:25:08,327 --> 00:25:09,351
To where?

340
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:12,070
Mr. Mahone seems to
believe they're in Panama.

341
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:24,290
Does our Mr. Mahone know where
exactly in Panama they are?

342
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:25,980
Not yet.

343
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:27,861
Why?

344
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:31,193
How much do you know about Sona,
Mr. Kim?

345
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:33,340
Only what I've been
given clearance on.

346
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:39,640
Perhaps what our situation requires...
is a change in strategy.

347
00:25:44,998 --> 00:25:47,860
How long until the court approves
the arrest warrant for Mahone?

348
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:50,500
Should be anytime now. We're just
waiting for the indictment to come down.

349
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:52,130
Okay, well,
I've got a question for you.

350
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,790
What if he's in there?
I can't keep avoiding him.

351
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:57,370
He reads people.
That's what he does.

352
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:59,350
And if he finds out that
I'm involved in this,

353
00:25:59,575 --> 00:26:01,090
I'm gonna need some
protection from...

354
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:03,400
Wheeler, relax. Take a breath.

355
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:06,031
The only thing Mahone can read
is what you write for him.

356
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,563
Can you act normal?
That's all you have to do--

357
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:11,181
the last thing we want is for
him to get spooked and take off.

358
00:26:11,185 --> 00:26:15,083
- This is all gonna be over soon.
- All right. Thank you.

359
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:17,141
No. Thank you.

360
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:24,902
Wheeler.

361
00:26:26,477 --> 00:26:27,590
Where you been?

362
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:37,461
I got to do this.

363
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:42,120
What are you doing, Alex?
I'm not wearing a wire.

364
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:44,562
You gonna tell me
what's going on here?

365
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:45,750
In old England...

366
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:50,293
the punishment for a
traitorous act was beheading.

367
00:26:51,896 --> 00:26:53,571
Following the execution,
they would

368
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:55,250
hold up the severed
head by the hair--

369
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,611
not, as most people think,
for the crowd to see the head,

370
00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:59,992
but for the head to see
the crowd, because...

371
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:02,332
consciousness sticks around
for another eight seconds.

372
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:05,713
The idea was that it would give the
traitor one more chance to take a
look at...

373
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:08,470
You don't want to do this, okay?
Just take a moment...

374
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,572
If you're gonna stab me in the back,
Agent Wheeler,

375
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,771
be smart enough to
cover up the knife.

376
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,841
You go and visit Franklin
three times this week,

377
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:17,892
called Sullins,
what, twice a day?

378
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:20,220
Didn't you learn
anything working for me?

379
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,660
You got to cover your tracks,
unless you...

380
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,850
unless you want to get caught.

381
00:27:33,037 --> 00:27:35,663
You wanted me to
know it was you.

382
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:41,751
- You're a killer, Alex.
- Is that so?

383
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,860
Soil samples taken
from your yard

384
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:46,122
in connection with the
disappearance of Oscar Shales.

385
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,350
Forensics is prepared
to submit a report

386
00:27:48,495 --> 00:27:51,831
detailing the irregularities in the
shooting of David "Tweener" Apolskis.

387
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:53,843
There's your blatant disregard

388
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:55,970
for protocol in the
death of John Abruzzi...

389
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:59,301
And the escaped con who says
that I told him to kill himself.

390
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:04,260
You think his testimony is gonna
send you into the promised land.

391
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,600
You can erase me, too.

392
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:12,080
But it's not gonna
erase the very real fact

393
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:14,712
that you're gonna spend the
rest of your life in prison.

394
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,221
You know...

395
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:24,293
you remind me of myself
when I was a young agent.

396
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:25,311
What?

397
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:29,881
I wish I could take
that as a compliment.

398
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:33,701
That's some real
fine work, Wheeler.

399
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:35,433
Good job.

400
00:28:36,176 --> 00:28:38,700
Don't you let
anyone scare you...

401
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:41,801
into doing the wrong thing.

402
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:47,593
Let me take you in.

403
00:28:47,777 --> 00:28:49,531
Whatever mess you're in,
we can clean it up.

404
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,703
There's only one way to clean this--
one way.

405
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:02,103
Hey. Got a visitor.

406
00:29:02,987 --> 00:29:04,803
- Yeah, who?
- I don't know.

407
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:06,770
I was just instructed
to bring you down.

408
00:29:06,957 --> 00:29:08,351
Hey, look,
I ain't going nowhere

409
00:29:08,636 --> 00:29:10,670
until you tell me who it is I'm meeting,
all right?

410
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:14,372
You got to stop it.
Listen to me for a second, all right?

411
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:16,482
That's all you got to do
is go out there and check.

412
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:21,601
Guy's kind of tall, okay?
It's the least that you can do. Huh?

413
00:29:26,358 --> 00:29:27,382
What?

414
00:29:27,656 --> 00:29:31,551
- Daddy!
- Oh, my God. Come here.

415
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:35,493
Oh. Oh,
Daddy loves you so much.

416
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:49,000
So, um... is it real?

417
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:54,851
He says you're gonna go free,
that we don't have to run anymore.

418
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:56,391
I mean, what happened?
What changed?

419
00:29:56,536 --> 00:29:59,633
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't you worry about it.

420
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:01,932
You just know that your
man handles things.

421
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:04,600
Ain't that right? That's right.

422
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:07,401
Okay. I don't
believe it but okay.

423
00:30:09,436 --> 00:30:11,922
Benjamin, if I could
just have a quick word.

424
00:30:14,556 --> 00:30:16,050
Yeah. Hey.

425
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:21,221
Why don't you go down the hall
for just a quick second. Okay?

426
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,610
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

427
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:32,433
Here it is.
New address, new identities.

428
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:34,921
Now, the prosecutor's gonna
be getting in touch with you

429
00:30:35,107 --> 00:30:37,501
to go over your testimony,
so you just make sure you show up

430
00:30:37,778 --> 00:30:39,080
where he says and when he says.

431
00:30:39,227 --> 00:30:43,402
Yeah, okay, okay.
But I'm a free man, right?

432
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,033
Free man.

433
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:51,731
Wait a minute.
What about Mahone, you know?

434
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:53,752
'Cause I don't want to be
looking over my shoulder

435
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:55,522
for the rest of my life,
you feel me?

436
00:30:55,705 --> 00:30:57,152
You let me worry about Mahone.

437
00:30:57,347 --> 00:30:59,101
You just worry about
staying out of trouble.

438
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:01,252
You ain't gonna have a
problem with that, trust me.

439
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:02,952
Don't screw it up.

440
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:25,950
How much further?

441
00:31:26,275 --> 00:31:27,301
Not far.

442
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:31,633
You know, for what it's worth,
no one forced Sara to do what she did.

443
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:35,593
Whatever gets you
through the night.

444
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:38,022
The hell does that mean?
I didn't ask you to use her.

445
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:41,171
It's not that simple. Whatever
gets you through the night, buddy.

446
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:42,711
You know what amazes me, Linc?

447
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:47,151
Nothing ever registers
with you. Ever.

448
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:49,251
Just rolls right off your back,
doesn't it?

449
00:31:49,437 --> 00:31:52,541
We ruined Sara's life and it's
like you don't even care.

450
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:53,800
Is that what you think?

451
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,801
Well, we're here,
and Sara's back there in prison.

452
00:31:55,838 --> 00:31:57,532
- Does that seem fair to you?
- None of it's fair.

453
00:31:57,565 --> 00:31:59,483
Just don't make this
about boy loses girl.

454
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:01,920
Who should it be about,
Linc? Westmoreland?

455
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:04,740
- Tweener? LJ? LJ's mom?
- Let me stop you right there.

456
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:07,940
Remember the name of the guard that was
murdered because of the riot I started?

457
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,792
- Shut up, Michael.
- Do you even remember his name?

458
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,262
I bet you remember Veronica's
name though, don't you?

459
00:32:12,496 --> 00:32:14,283
You mention her name again,
I swear to God...!

460
00:32:14,318 --> 00:32:17,583
What about T-Bag?! Linc, he's out there,
now, because of us! You and me!

461
00:32:21,326 --> 00:32:26,641
Every life he takes,
that's blood on our hands.

462
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:28,920
And for what?

463
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:33,152
I didn't ask you to
do what you did.

464
00:32:34,677 --> 00:32:36,263
They were gonna kill you, Linc!

465
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:38,181
Well, maybe you
should've let them!

466
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:40,951
Take that back.

467
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:11,523
As bad as I feel about Sara,
she had a choice.

468
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:13,473
Veronica didn't.

469
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:19,630
I listened to her die, Michael.

470
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,511
I listened to her die,
and there was...

471
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:23,041
there was nothing I could do.

472
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:25,001
Nothing.

473
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,353
We've lost so much, man.

474
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,380
We can't afford to
lose each other.

475
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,121
We just can't.

476
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:10,810
- You going somewhere, Alex?
- I don't know. Am I?

477
00:34:11,855 --> 00:34:14,393
Come on. You know I don't
like to get my hands dirty.

478
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,910
It's surprising the things a man
will do when properly motivated.

479
00:34:28,456 --> 00:34:30,900
Wasn't it you who told me that?

480
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:33,331
You know,
I would kill you right now

481
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:35,613
if I thought it would give
me an ounce of peace.

482
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:40,371
And what would give you peace?

483
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:45,281
I've been able to hold it
together through all this...

484
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:48,603
because there was a light
at the end of the tunnel.

485
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,743
Life...

486
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:54,551
at the end of the tunnel,
for me, for my family.

487
00:34:55,017 --> 00:34:56,653
And now what?

488
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:58,140
Do you see my son?

489
00:34:58,517 --> 00:34:59,961
Do you see my wife?

490
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:03,180
What have I got?
What have you given me?

491
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:06,733
What if I was to tell you

492
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,730
that there was something that
could turn that light...

493
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:15,172
- back on? What would you say?
- I'd say that's the same offer

494
00:35:15,355 --> 00:35:17,842
you made when you dragged me into this,
you little bastard.

495
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:19,360
And look where it's got me now.

496
00:35:19,507 --> 00:35:21,103
They're gonna drag me
before the public.

497
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:24,190
They've gonna prosecute me like...
like some kind of murderer.

498
00:35:24,428 --> 00:35:25,960
There's... There's evidence.

499
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:29,180
Really hard, tangible evidence,
that you can't take away.

500
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:34,920
You're right...
but I can help you get away.

501
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:38,722
And at this point, I don't think
you've got any other options.

502
00:35:42,645 --> 00:35:45,841
Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell
was apprehended in Mexico.

503
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,582
Oh, let me guess.
You want him dead.

504
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,122
Oh, no.

505
00:35:50,955 --> 00:35:54,530
There's been a, uh,
change in strategy.

506
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:56,823
We're gonna need him alive.

507
00:35:57,058 --> 00:36:00,531
I'm talking about a very
real finish line here, Alex.

508
00:36:00,947 --> 00:36:02,253
You've come so far.

509
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,493
How much further
would I have to go?

510
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:07,983
Well, you're lucky.

511
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:11,850
For this,
you only have to go to Panama.

512
00:36:18,097 --> 00:36:20,890
I'm trying to remember the last time
our lives made any kind of sense.

513
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:28,682
Before Mom died.
When it was just the three of us.

514
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,240
Well, there she is.

515
00:36:42,915 --> 00:36:44,741
- Hello, Lang.
- What's going on?

516
00:36:44,978 --> 00:36:47,653
I mean, there'l kinds of suits over
here going through your office.

517
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,791
- I'll explain later.
- All right.

518
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,003
- Um... did you get the fax?
- No. Why? What do you got?

519
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:59,140
Some information on Christina
Rose you might find interesting.

520
00:36:59,378 --> 00:37:01,611
Looks like she was commissioned
about four months before

521
00:37:01,716 --> 00:37:06,233
Scofield robbed that bank by a builder
in Panama named Amparo Vasquez.

522
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:07,681
Son of a bitch.

523
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:19,780
She's beautiful.

524
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:22,402
Yeah, she's not the
real thing, but...

525
00:37:22,548 --> 00:37:25,262
- So where to, man?
- Anywhere we want.

526
00:37:33,715 --> 00:37:35,073
So, is it really over?

527
00:37:35,258 --> 00:37:37,790
Yeah. Yeah, baby,
it's really over. Okay.

528
00:37:50,906 --> 00:37:52,251
What is it, baby?

529
00:37:54,848 --> 00:37:55,863
Huh?

530
00:37:57,065 --> 00:38:02,050
Oh, nothing. Let's go home.

531
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:17,923
Okay, so we checked the
train station in Malinalco,

532
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:23,233
the bus depot in Puebla,
and just about every hotel there is.

533
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:24,862
Hello.

534
00:38:25,187 --> 00:38:27,102
Hey, hey, hey,
slow down, Sancho.

535
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:29,662
Uno momento.

536
00:38:30,027 --> 00:38:31,042
It's for you.

537
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:32,623
Hola.

538
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,431
Sí?

539
00:38:40,827 --> 00:38:42,512
That was the guy from
the tourism bureau.

540
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:43,870
- He found him.
- Where?

541
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,532
An E. Stammel just boarded
a plane to Panama City.

542
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:49,912
What the hell's he
doing in Panama?

543
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:16,051
You speak English?

544
00:39:17,576 --> 00:39:19,640
Say, uh, "Good morning, Teddy."

545
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:22,293
Good morning, Teddy.

546
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:25,151
So then actually, no,
you don't speak English.

547
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:27,961
Hablan ingles around here?

548
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,732
Say, "Good morning, Teddy."

549
00:39:38,925 --> 00:39:40,182
Good morning, Teddy.

550
00:39:43,505 --> 00:39:45,330
Say, "Good morning,
Teddy Bear."

551
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,290
Good morning, Teddy Bear.

552
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:50,962
Do you like wigs?

553
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:54,201
For the right money,
I like anything.

554
00:40:30,997 --> 00:40:34,611
There's nothing.
Nothing on line about Sara's arrest.

555
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:35,990
Maybe they're keeping it quiet.

556
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:38,290
What about the message board?
The Goldfinch thing?

557
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:41,980
Just something
from C-Note and...

558
00:40:42,866 --> 00:40:44,503
There is a message from Sucre.

559
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:45,701
Still running, huh?

560
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:49,771
What?

561
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:57,033
Sucre says T-Bag's here,
in Panama.

562
00:40:57,776 --> 00:40:59,362
How the hell does he know?

563
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:02,080
I don't know.
It says, "The Bag's still has the bag.

564
00:41:02,228 --> 00:41:04,780
He's in Panama City at the Fin
Del Camino hotel. If you're there

565
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:08,511
and want to help put that bird back
in a cage, let me know. Sucre."

566
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:11,363
What the hell is that son
of a bitch doing in Panama?

567
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,752
We got to go after him.

568
00:41:12,945 --> 00:41:14,543
Just let it be, man.
We don't need the money.

569
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:16,073
It's not about the money, Linc.

570
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:17,902
Whatever good we do
from here on out,

571
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:20,002
it doesn't matter as
long T-Bag's out there.

572
00:41:20,197 --> 00:41:23,100
- Michael, we made it.
- Too much has gone wrong. If we could just...

573
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:25,521
If we could just
make this right.

574
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:30,330
Panama City is only an hour away.
And now we know where he's staying.

575
00:41:30,526 --> 00:41:31,872
So call the police.

576
00:41:32,107 --> 00:41:34,640
There's a reason I chose Panama--
there's no extradition laws.

577
00:41:35,427 --> 00:41:38,761
- They're not going to touch him.
- So what are you gonna do?

578
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:40,990
I'll figure something out.

579
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:44,132
Figure it out? Yon't take a piss
without a plan, man. Come on.

580
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:47,271
Look at me-- I never think things
through and look where it got me.

581
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:49,521
Yeah, Panama and a
boat-load of booze.

582
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:52,713
You got me that. I got me death
sentence. Look, let's just...

583
00:41:52,856 --> 00:41:55,251
get out to sea,
think things through,

584
00:41:56,496 --> 00:41:59,262
when the time's right,
we make it right. Okay?

585
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:09,961
I'm in.
Let me know when you get there. Michael.

586
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:22,822
I'll be there tomorrow.
See you there. Sucre.

587
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:32,972
See you soon.

588
00:42:37,585 --> 00:42:38,751
Home sweet home.

589
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:47,192
I got the booze,
but the limes are shot.

590
00:42:53,015 --> 00:42:53,991
Michael?!

591
00:42:56,806 --> 00:42:57,830
Michael!

592
00:43:00,235 --> 00:43:01,022
Michael!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
