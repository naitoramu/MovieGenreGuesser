1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:02,252
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:05,714
It will work out.
You have my word. Be careful.

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,050
Jane's gonna look
after you. Hey.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,887
I have a sister,
I haven't talked to in 15 years.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,722
You think she's
better off for it?

6
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,223
Bruce?

7
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,099
I know we said not
to use this number,

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,851
but I just needed to
know you were okay.

9
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,146
- It was you.
- What are you talking about, Sara?

10
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:26,480
- I got three words for you.
- Yeah?

11
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:28,070
We gotta run.

12
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,948
I want to turn myself in.
But I got one condition.

13
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:35,114
Your wife was released an hour ago.
She'll be here soon.

14
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:38,870
- Just hold up your end of the deal.
- I'll get you Scofield.

15
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,581
An NSA analyst sympathetic
to our cause got his hands

16
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:45,712
on a phone conversation the
president had with Terrence Steadman

17
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:48,462
two weeks after after you
supposedly killed him.

18
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:52,172
24 hours later, Tancredi is dead,
the analyst is missing,

19
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:55,972
and the White House Echelon tapes
have been deleted from the mainframe.

20
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:58,511
There's a tape,
gives us everything we need.

21
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:00,470
Linc will be set
free if we find it.

22
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:02,021
You have something here.

23
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:04,850
There are gonna be a lot of people
who wish you didn't, but you do.

24
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:06,770
You think it's a conversation.

25
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:09,860
One they don't want us to hear.

26
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:14,611
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

27
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:45,273
Oh, my God.

28
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:48,062
Yeah.

29
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:52,652
Patoshik...

30
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,321
Dead.

31
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:56,741
Franklin, incarcerated

32
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:59,362
and assisting with the capture
of Scofield and Burrows.

33
00:01:59,497 --> 00:02:01,371
What exactly is the
protocol with that?

34
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:04,623
I'll handle that.
We're at the halfway mark, people.

35
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,372
Burrows, Scofield...

36
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,790
Bagwell, Sucre--
they're still out there.

37
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,210
Now, I heard a report
came in from...

38
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:16,631
Mexico. Fernando Sucre was almost
apprehended at the airport in Ixtapa.

39
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,732
Excuse me.

40
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:30,652
My office, please.

41
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,112
What the hell are
you doing here?

42
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:36,822
I came for my damn money.

43
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:39,993
- Your what?
- The Patoshik reward money.

44
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:43,282
See, how a reward works is,
someone gets rewarded the money,

45
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:46,452
and since I'm the one
who bloodhounded Haywire,

46
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:49,410
- the money gets rewarded to me.
- You come to my office...

47
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,751
If you'd returned any of my calls,
I wouldn't have had to.

48
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:53,963
We had a deal.

49
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:55,842
The deal was that you
stay under the radar.

50
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,260
Is this under the radar, Brad?

51
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,383
No, this is an office
full of federal agents,

52
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:01,341
who now have all
seen your face.

53
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:03,301
Yeah, I don't care
what they see.

54
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:08,643
Hell, if you don't pay up,
I'll go out there and drop trou.

55
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,872
Patoshik died,
you stupid son of a bitch.

56
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:29,293
There's paperwork involved.
Of course you're going to get the money.

57
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:31,333
But you're gonna
have to be patient.

58
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,540
And if you ever...

59
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:37,303
come in my office again,

60
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:40,011
you'll not only
never see the cash,

61
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,091
you'll never see
another sunrise.

62
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:54,100
Are we gonna keep crying about money
you've already got coming to you?

63
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:59,740
- Or do you want to make some more?
- I'm listening.

64
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,862
Ever been to Mexico?

65
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:10,300
We give this thing to the press,
the government's gonna discredit it,

66
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,413
just like they did
with the tape we made.

67
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:13,540
Okay.

68
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:16,881
So what do we do with it?

69
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:19,512
Dad said there are still
people in the administration

70
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:22,263
that he was working with.
If we give the tape to them,

71
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,382
they'll finally have the
smoking gun they need

72
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:26,012
to bring Caroline
Reynolds down.

73
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:28,893
But they'll release the tape...
not us.

74
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,523
And how can she discredit
her own appointees? Sure.

75
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,981
We're gonna give the only
thing that can exonerate me

76
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:36,311
to someone who works
for the government?

77
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:39,480
The same government
that set me up?!

78
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:43,741
We'll have to find someone we can trust,
someone honest.

79
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:47,162
Jane Phillips.
She'll know someone that can help us.

80
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:49,452
She worked with Dad;
she's watching LJ.

81
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:51,660
I trust her, Michael.

82
00:04:51,795 --> 00:04:53,543
She'll do it;
she'll find someone.

83
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:57,001
Well, I hope you're right.

84
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:01,962
Because this is our last shot.

85
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:07,553
This'll do you right.
She's a Remington 700.

86
00:05:08,356 --> 00:05:09,512
She a clean shot?

87
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,680
Like a good woman,
she does not stray.

88
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:14,690
Varmint, stainless-steel
fluted barrel,

89
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:18,903
heavyweight caliber,
175-grain hollow point.

90
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:24,112
- I'll take the case, too.
- She's a throw-in.

91
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:32,083
Serial numbers have been cleaned.
Chamber's been scraped

92
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:34,872
to throw off ballistics,
just in case you're not, you know,

93
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:37,423
shooting at tin cans.

94
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:42,003
No, I'm hunting bigger
game than that.

95
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:44,920
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

96

Subs by Travis and Raceman

97
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:21,710
Radio silence.

98
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:25,803
Look, I just don't know how often
he checks this thing, all right?

99
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:29,010
It seems not that often, considering
you've posted three messages.

100
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:32,013
I'm starting to wonder
why I need you at all.

101
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,311
To get Scofield. What?
What are we doing here?

102
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:39,100
Well, I can type, and Scofield can't
see who's sending him the messages.

103
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:40,650
Well, you know what,
he's gonna see

104
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,953
whatever little rent-a-Fed cops
that you guys have set up,

105
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,101
whatever place you guys are
gonna set up to meet him.

106
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:47,361
Now, you and I both know how
smart this kid is, right?

107
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:48,821
Clearly smarter than you,

108
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,043
considering you're the one
who's wearing bright orange.

109
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,532
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

110
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:55,040
Fish is not gonna peek
his little white ass out

111
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:58,121
from any rock that he's hiding
unless he sees a familiar face.

112
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,043
A famili...
And that's your face, right?

113
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:01,853
Yeah, you're damn straight it is,
so don't pretend...

114
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,170
You said Sucre... you overheard
him telling Sucre about a Web site!

115
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:07,562
- Don't pretend you don't need me.
- You overheard something?

116
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,880
- Look, he's a Boy Scout, he...
- I don't see...

117
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:11,180
He helps, okay?!

118
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:13,933
If you have a little bit of patience,
he will hit me back!

119
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:16,192
I'm the only one in the world
right now helping your family.

120
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,682
- I help my family, okay?
- So do I.

121
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,033
I'm the one that
got Kacee released,

122
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:20,690
I'm the one that gets
Dede medical care,

123
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:22,323
I'm the one that allows
you to visit them,

124
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,112
and I'm the one that
can take it away.

125
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:27,033
Well, you know what, it looks like
we both need each other, doesn't it?

126
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:27,822
Do we?

127
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:31,283
So I am gonna hold up my end of
the bargain, and guess what?

128
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,780
You hold up yours.

129
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,292
Now, get off my back.

130
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:41,671
You can get what you want.
Just give me what I want.

131
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:43,883
Give me Scofield.

132
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:51,050
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy.

133
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:54,510
- Dad?
- Yeah, it's me.

134
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:57,761
- How you holding up?
- Okay. How about you?

135
00:07:57,938 --> 00:08:02,561
Good. Good. I, uh...
I miss you.

136
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:07,573
Yeah, me, too.
I didn't know you had Jane's number.

137
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:11,240
Yeah, well, uh, we exchanged
numbers when you guys split.

138
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:13,411
You never called.

139
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:14,873
No. Yeah...

140
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:17,783
I'm sorry, it's been,
uh, it's been dangerous.

141
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,540
- You know? A little dangerous.
- It's okay.

142
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:24,421
LJ, uh, listen,
I know I've said this before,

143
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,210
but I think we've
found something

144
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:28,090
that's finally gonna put
this stuff behind us.

145
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:31,388
When it's good, when it's safe,
I'm going to come and get you.

146
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:32,974
You, me, your uncle...

147
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,390
- Dad.
- Yeah?

148
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:40,392
I want you to end this
more than anything, but...

149
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:42,313
I'm in school again.

150
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,271
Under a fake name,
but it's still school, you know?

151
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:46,940
I mean, it's not the same,

152
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:50,402
but it's the closest thing to
a home I've had in a long time.

153
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:54,782
I... I guess...
I guess I'm just saying that...

154
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:56,870
for now, for a while...

155
00:08:57,378 --> 00:09:04,371
I just want to stay in one place,
have something normal.

156
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,710
Yeah, yeah, I... I get it.

157
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,632
I, uh...
I need to speak with Jane.

158
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:13,760
Okay.

159
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,550
I love you, Dad.

160
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:20,600
I love you, too, son.

161
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,652
Mr. Webster.

162
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:33,032
Sorry to keep you waiting.

163
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:34,822
Ah, it's no problem, Doc.

164
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,283
I just, uh,
wanted to tell you how much

165
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:39,452
I appreciate you seeing
me on such short notice.

166
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:42,911
- That's what I'm here for.
- Good.

167
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,212
'Cause I got a few things
I need to get off my chest.

168
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,332
See you, Jane.

169
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:00,720
Cooper Green?

170
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,143
Former deputy attorney general.

171
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,692
Splits his time between DC,
Chicago and New York,

172
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:09,560
Jane says he's been an
ally of Dad's forever.

173
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:11,611
We find him, we got a shot.

174
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,741
How is LJ?

175
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:20,410
He's doing all right.

176
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,871
Cooper Green's office.

177
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:30,921
I'm sorry, Mr.
Green isn't available at this time.

178
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,502
Please, this is very important.

179
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:34,760
Just tell him I have some
information regarding

180
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,473
the sons of Aldo Burrows.

181
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:38,683
- Aldo Burrows?
- Yes.

182
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,890
He and Mr.
Green used to work together.

183
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:43,350
Please hold.
I'll try to reach him.

184
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:47,643
She's tracking him down.

185
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:51,521
Hello.

186
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:55,360
Mr. Green, this is Michael Scofield.
Do you know who I am?

187
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:57,032
Of course. I knew your father.

188
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:58,490
And I know what
happened to him.

189
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:01,282
I'm sorry. He was a good man
trying to do good things.

190
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:02,870
Well, so are we.

191
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:04,701
We have something.

192
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:06,830
- The tape.
- You've heard of it.

193
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:09,370
Well, I know a lot of people
have been looking for it.

194
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:11,420
What's on the tape?

195
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,171
If you want to find out,
there's a bronze statue of a mammoth

196
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:17,263
at the southwest corner of Ebert Park.
I need you there in an hour.

197
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:18,973
- Do you have a blue suit?
- Yes.

198
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:23,011
Wear it, and a red tie.
That way, we'll know who you are.

199
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:28,230
- Ready?
- Yeah.

200
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:34,440
Good luck.

201
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:48,951
- This will work.
- You think?

202
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,000
Hello, Sara.

203
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:34,883
I figured you'd
show up eventually.

204
00:12:35,678 --> 00:12:37,380
You look good, Bruce.

205
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,841
You've done well for yourself
at my father's expense.

206
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,050
I had nothing to do with your father.
Your father was murdered.

207
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,723
By you. And then you tried
to have me killed. Don't...

208
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:50,721
How can you say that?
My line was tapped,

209
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:52,991
and they heard you tell me that
you were at that pay phone.

210
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:55,021
Sara, I've known your
family my entire life.

211
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,110
Which makes your
betrayal disgusting.

212
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,491
For what it's worth,
I've been tortured already.

213
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:02,783
It didn't work.

214
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,671
I shouldn't have to defend
myself to you, Sara.

215
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:08,333
If you can't trust me,
then all I can do is just wish you luck.

216
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,333
Go.

217
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,851
Look, before you get started,

218
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,983
I'm gonna save you
some time here, jefe.

219
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,440
I played rat for you once,
and that was it.

220
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:38,982
I got protection now.

221
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,321
I let the top bangers in here
cherry pick the laundry--

222
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:45,650
clean sheets, new shorts--
and for that,

223
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:49,911
I'm untouchable.
So threaten all you want, homes.

224
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,713
Yo, man,
what are you going to do?

225
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:02,093
You don't look like you play
too much tennis, Manche.

226
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,722
This is probably
more your speed.

227
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:08,972
Entertainment center.
Wide-screen plasma.

228
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:12,391
Pinball.

229
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,810
Pool table.

230
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,522
- Yo, man, what the hell is this?
- Your future.

231
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:20,481
At Kankakee Minimum Security
Correctional Center,

232
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:23,481
where the only thing softer that
the pillows are the guards.

233
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:28,031
I didn't come here to threaten.
I mean, why whip the mule

234
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:31,701
when he'll work even
harder for a sugar cube?

235
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,123
The same connections that got this
fox out of the river so quick,

236
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:38,372
well, I can use
them for you, too.

237
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:44,800
All I need to know is where down in
Mexico your cousin Sucre is headed.

238
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,112
Look, mami, look!

239
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,453
I told you. Llamas!

240
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,033
I think those are alpacas.

241
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,033
That's what I said,
a pack-a llamas.

242
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:17,120
Fernando! Fernando!

243
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,370
Auntie?

244
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,713
My sister's baby boy.

245
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,751
It's so good to see you.

246
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,170
This is my Maricruz...

247
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:31,643
...and this is our child.

248
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:36,431
We will be safe here?

249
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,312
Yes. This is your home now.

250
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:57,202
What I'm trying to tell you, Doc,
is I just feel like I've been

251
00:15:57,378 --> 00:16:00,910
a penny on the train
tracks my entire life.

252
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:06,500
And that 'ole Union Pacific just
keeps on coming, every day,

253
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:08,790
back and forth, just running me down,
running me over,

254
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:12,841
but I will not flatten.
I will not flatten.

255
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,511
You know the nice thing about pennies,
Mr. Webster?

256
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,890
They have dates on them.
And you can pick the date.

257
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:21,851
Your own date. Today's date.

258
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,101
You can get a fresh start.

259
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:27,071
You can be a
brand-new shiny penny.

260
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,993
You know,
I got to be honest with you, Doc;

261
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:32,700
I had no intention
of-- whatsoever--

262
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,953
talking to you once I got
inside your office today,

263
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:41,123
but I have to admit,
I find therapy...

264
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,921
Well, it's therapeutic.

265
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,172
I don't follow.

266
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:51,301
If you didn't plan on talking today,
why did you come in?

267
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:02,941
Well, I saw the ad on the
back of the bus stop today.

268
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,860
And, uh...

269
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:10,111
though it wasn't exactly
like looking in the mirror,

270
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:17,240
you can't deny that there's a
certain commonality in our visages.

271
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:22,961
I guess we do look a
little bit alike...

272
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,542
...but I don't understand.

273
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:36,842
What the hell you
think you're doing?

274
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:06,581
Hello.

275
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:08,582
- Mr. Green?
- Yes.

276
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:12,592
This is Lincoln Burrows.
Do exactly what I say.

277
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:16,633
Your suit jacket.
Toss it in the trash behind you.

278
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:19,550
- Excuse me?
- Do it.

279
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:36,862
All right. I just threw my $2,000
Zegna suit jacket in the garbage.

280
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,033
Good.

281
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:40,783
There's a phone on the
other side of the park.

282
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,082
- Be there in four minutes.
- Four...?

283
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:07,352
Make it quick.
This cell is running out of juice.

284
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,521
You were right.

285
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:13,233
- He's being tailed?
- Yeah. On it.

286
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:22,782
Yeah?

287
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:26,253
- I'm looking for a guy in a suit.
- Lots of guys with suits.

288
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,671
- It's me.
- See the fountain?

289
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,001
- How could I not?
- Get in.

290
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:08,452
They want to drown the mics
in case we bugged him.

291
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:18,092
Hey, mister. This is for you.

292
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,053
- I'm not interested.
- I'm not selling it--

293
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,891
some dude gave me 20 bucks to give
it to the first wet guy I see.

294
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:32,143
- See the building across from you?
- Yeah.

295
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:34,730
- Go inside.
- Look, this is getting ridiculous.

296
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,163
I've done everything you've asked.
If you want to meet me...

297
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:39,322
We've been burned way too many times,
Mr. Green.

298
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,863
We need to make sure that
this thing goes down right.

299
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:44,531
Go inside,
and keep the phone to your ear.

300
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,051
- Yeah.
- Where are we?

301
00:20:58,138 --> 00:21:00,840
He's gone inside the Beck Museum,
but we've got men out back.

302
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,091
He's not going anywhere.

303
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,432
Yeah?

304
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:11,640
Get to Ebert Park.
I have men on Scofield and Burrows.

305
00:21:12,276 --> 00:21:13,520
Ebert Park?

306
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:16,361
Scofield set a meet with a
target we're surveilling.

307
00:21:16,615 --> 00:21:18,572
What the hell is Scofield
doing in Chicago?

308
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:21,943
You're asking why the deer
walked into your crosshairs?

309
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:26,281
- Just take the shot, Mahone.
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

310
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:29,490
- And Alex.
- Franklin.

311
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:31,953
I'm using Franklin to
help me find Scofield.

312
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:34,791
Yeah. We don't need
him for that anymore.

313
00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:39,502
What I do need is a
death with no questions.

314
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:50,763
Hey, look,
it's nothing yet, man,

315
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,232
but I'm sure he'll hit
me real soon, okay?

316
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,192
You know,
if I were in your situation...

317
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,372
...everything you've done,
every decision you've made...

318
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,912
I'd have done the same thing.

319
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,582
You're a good man, good father.

320
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:22,171
There's, uh...
been a change of plans.

321
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:25,883
It looks like I'm not gonna
need your help after all.

322
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:30,602
So you found Scofield.

323
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:35,023
My colleagues are getting
pretty close, yeah.

324
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:36,643
So...

325
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:39,483
So I guess you can
set me free, then.

326
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:44,533
Of course not.

327
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:55,622
- You and me, we had a deal, right?
- Right.

328
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:01,540
I get your wife released,
take care of your daughter's health,

329
00:23:02,295 --> 00:23:03,922
you get me Scofield.

330
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:08,513
But you, you're getting him yourself.
You just said that.

331
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:11,431
I know. I know.
I just want you to know...

332
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:16,813
...that, uh,
I'm going to keep my promise to you

333
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:20,103
and I'm going to
help your family.

334
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:22,562
But I'm gonna need
hour help, too,

335
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,322
and this is something that
you're not gonna want to do

336
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:27,751
and I don't want you to do this, but I
need you to do this and if you don't,

337
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:29,951
I will have Kacee
arrested again,

338
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,071
and I will have Dede's
medical care stopped

339
00:23:32,248 --> 00:23:36,333
and I will hate myself, and it will
make me sick, but I swear to God...

340
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:41,921
I will ruin their lives--
don't make me.

341
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,092
What the hell are
you saying to me?

342
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:48,422
Later today,
you'll get a package in your cell.

343
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:50,552
Its gonna be from me.
I need you to use it. Okay?

344
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:51,760
Okay. What's in it?

345
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,933
Yo.Yo. What the
hell is in it, man?

346
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:59,602
Just use it,
or you'll wish you had.

347
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:01,772
What's in the package?

348
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:04,022
What the hell is in
the package, man?

349
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:06,733
Yo, what the hell is
in the package, man?!

350
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,203
Okay. I'm in the lobby.

351
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,000
Take the stairs to your left.

352
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,133
When you get to the top,
cross the catwalk.

353
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:33,090
Okay, I'm across.

354
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:36,261
Go down the hall,
down the stairs to the basement.

355
00:24:49,368 --> 00:24:50,863
Go through the white door.

356
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,113
The one on the left.

357
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,200
Sara, I wish you had
come to me first.

358
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:01,162
Cooper Green and I go way back.

359
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:03,423
If anyone can help Michael and Lincoln,
it's him.

360
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:05,791
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Is Mr. Green in?

361
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:08,343
- Is he expecting you?
- Bruce.

362
00:25:09,428 --> 00:25:12,172
Oh, good, you're back.
I'm here to help you.

363
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:15,433
- Help me? With what?
- Scofield and Burrows. Where are they now?

364
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,392
- This is absurd.
- This tunnel goes underground.

365
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,642
You're already under
another building.

366
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:22,852
See the second door
on your right?

367
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:27,272
Congratulations. You made it.

368
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:34,531
I'm sorry. Sara Tancredi.

369
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:37,491
I trust you've met with Michael
Scofield and Lincoln Burrows today?

370
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:39,660
Well, I'm sure I'd
remember if I did.

371
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:40,660
Sara?

372
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,963
If you're Cooper Green,
who's with Michael right now?

373
00:25:45,756 --> 00:25:47,130
Mr. Green?

374
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,803
I'm Michael Scofield.

375
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,592
Well, it's nice to
finally meet you.

376
00:25:54,726 --> 00:25:57,302
Do you...
uh, do you have the tape?

377
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,392
It's right here.

378
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:07,690
Yeah.

379
00:26:07,947 --> 00:26:09,361
Lincoln, it's Sara.
Listen to me.

380
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:11,700
The man that Michael's with right now
is not Cooper Green, do you hear me?

381
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,322
The man that Michael's with
right now is not Cooper Green.

382
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,632
We should hurry.
You're in Chicago--

383
00:26:29,886 --> 00:26:32,882
it won't be long before the
Company knows you're in town.

384
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:34,922
Where are we going?

385
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:37,343
Well, we're going to
make sure that that tape

386
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:40,513
- goes in the right hands.
- Whose?

387
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:42,220
A friend.

388
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:45,643
What kind of friend?

389
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:50,231
He's a federal judge.
Is that good enough for you?

390
00:26:51,947 --> 00:26:55,650
This tape is my brother's life.
And mine.

391
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,531
And consequently...

392
00:26:58,828 --> 00:27:00,623
I need a name.

393
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:05,873
Judge Scott Warren,
a lifetime appointee

394
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:08,673
who was put on the bench
by President Mills.

395
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:12,290
He has no job to lose,
no loyalty to Reynolds.

396
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:15,051
He wants to see her gone,
just like us.

397
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:19,183
Well, let's go.
I left my car over by the statue.

398
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:23,812
You were tailed, Mr. Green.
The judge comes to us.

399
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:28,640
- I'll set up the meeting.
- Do you see my clothes?

400
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,520
Your brother made certain

401
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:32,862
that anybody who was
tailing me is long gone,

402
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,150
and on top of that,
I'm an asthmatic.

403
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:37,491
My inhaler is in
my jacket pocket,

404
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:40,282
which Lincoln made
me throw away.

405
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:42,570
I'm okay now,
but in about ten minutes,

406
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:45,413
I'm gonna have a
hard time breathing.

407
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,751
I've got a spare in my glove box,
so could we please

408
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:51,793
just get back to my car?

409
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:01,931
My car is just a
few blocks away.

410
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,640
- Albuterol, Cortizaid or Prednizone?
- What?

411
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:10,272
My mother was an asthmatic.
What do you use in your inhaler?

412
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:12,003
What the hell difference
does it make?

413
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:14,400
Just answer the
question, please.

414
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,782
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

415
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:19,863
How many times I got to
prove myself to you?

416
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:20,952
Just one.

417
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:27,742
Fine. Uh... Cortizaid.

418
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:33,331
I'm sorry. It's just, uh...

419
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:37,710
if you knew what, uh,
if you knew what we've been through...

420
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,722
I understand.

421
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:42,131
Can we now just,
please go to my car?

422
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,641
Yeah.

423
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,490
One-way ticket to Bangkok,
s'il vous plait.

424
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:05,283
Oh, I'm sorry.
We don't have anything until tomorrow.

425
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:09,492
Unless you don't mind taking a
few connections through Chicago,

426
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:11,873
and there's one more
international stop.

427
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:13,960
Whatever leaves first.

428
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,630
Okay. I.D., please.

429
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,591
Okay, Mister... Stammel?

430
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:24,933
Oh, it's, uh, it's Doctor Stammel,
and thank you.

431
00:29:25,308 --> 00:29:27,103
All right,
it'll be just a few minutes.

432
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:28,641
I'll check this
bag for you, sir.

433
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:30,401
Oh, no, that's coming with me.
Give it back.

434
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:35,100
Sir, I know that bag is way over
the weight limit for carry-on.

435
00:29:35,985 --> 00:29:39,363
What difference does a few extra
pounds make on a three-ton aircraft,

436
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:41,002
whether that's up
above or underneath?

437
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,363
- It's an FAA violation.
- Sir, your bag will be safe.

438
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:01,550
Today be a tough day for
travelers in the Windy City

439
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:03,883
as all streets in a six-block
radius of the Seaburn Hotel

440
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:08,391
have been closed to
traffic in anticipation

441
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,141
of President Reynolds's
speech there this evening.

442
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:14,811
This'll be one of several
Midwestern stops for the president

443
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,692
as she ramps up her
election campaign.

444
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:19,402
Hey, Theo, I know you're new,

445
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:21,750
but we use both sides of legal
pads in this office, okay?

446
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:23,693
Before we recycle, we reduce.

447
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,860
The Comanche used
the entire buffalo.

448
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,532
So can we.

449
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:30,660
Actually, a majority of
tribes would farm land

450
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,831
till it was stripped of its utility,
then they'd just... move on.

451
00:30:33,956 --> 00:30:39,173
The Indian as conservationist is a
myth created by white liberal guilt.

452
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:42,502
- Paul.
- Hi, Kristine.

453
00:30:42,596 --> 00:30:45,050
I'd hoped maybe I'd see
you at Dad's funeral.

454
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:47,630
That man died long before
his heart stopped.

455
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,341
That funeral was a formality.

456
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:51,930
- That's really not fair.
- It's true.

457
00:30:52,107 --> 00:30:54,223
So... you want to
know how Mom is?

458
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:56,601
Just 'cause someone spits
you out of your crotch

459
00:30:56,818 --> 00:30:59,313
doesn't make them your mother.
That woman is insane.

460
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:01,981
Do you remember?
Have you suppressed it all?

461
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:05,113
I know, Paul.
I was there every day... unlike you.

462
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:07,613
- I was there for 18 years.
- Then you just left.

463
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:12,410
I was ten, Paul.
You were all I had in the world, and...

464
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:18,002
- you just left me there.
- I'm sorry.

465
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:23,051
If I could have taken you with me,
I would have,

466
00:31:23,178 --> 00:31:25,550
and I've thought
about you every day.

467
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:37,393
I'm not the brother
you remember.

468
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:39,310
I've changed...

469
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,361
in a...

470
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:44,020
really bad way.

471
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,282
To the point where I don't know
what good or bad is anymore,

472
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:54,663
and I am going to do something--
I have to do something...

473
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:59,083
that a lot of people are
going to think is horrible.

474
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:02,083
- Paul.
- And you just remember...

475
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:06,880
the brother yoew up with.
You just remember him.

476
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:15,220
You're my sister,
Kristine, and I love you.

477
00:32:22,447 --> 00:32:25,151
I was out cold.
I don't know where they went.

478
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:28,441
And it was their idea for you to meet
them here in the middle of Chicago?

479
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,070
Yeah.

480
00:32:34,588 --> 00:32:35,870
Oh, man.

481
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:44,422
Mahone.

482
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,633
You brought me in too late.
They're gone.

483
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:51,302
- Then find them.
- Let me get this straight.

484
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:53,721
The brothers come back to
a city that's 15 miles

485
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:56,163
from the prison they escaped from.
Why would they do that?

486
00:32:56,186 --> 00:32:58,810
Maybe it's because the president
is in Chicago to make a speech,

487
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:01,521
and they're up to something,
which is why we need to find them.

488
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:04,563
An all people,
they want to meet with somebody

489
00:33:04,655 --> 00:33:06,773
from the attorney
general's office?

490
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,941
- Your point?
- Burrows is innocent.

491
00:33:10,077 --> 00:33:14,783
Wow, you're good, Alex.
As advertised.

492
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:17,743
No one's truly innocent.

493
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:19,871
You of all people
should know that.

494
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:28,921
It must have been the receptionist.
She's the only one I spoke to.

495
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:44,650
Michael Scofield. Cooper Green.

496
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,583
We got to get as much of that in as
possible before the baby gets here.

497
00:34:42,796 --> 00:34:43,661
Why?

498
00:34:45,008 --> 00:34:48,790
Because, once the baby's
growing in there,

499
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,920
doesn't it just
get kind of wrong?

500
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:52,923
Oh, yeah.

501
00:34:57,348 --> 00:34:58,891
- Whoa.
- What?

502
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,302
I just felt the baby move.

503
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:02,400
Fernando, that's impossible--
it's a little too early...

504
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:04,180
I know what I just felt.

505
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:09,811
Well, the doctor did say that he can
become active after certain activities.

506
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:16,703
- Whoa! Did you feel that?
- Yeah, like a flutter.

507
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,610
Flutter my ass. He's strong.

508
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:21,203
He's going to be the captain
of the National Soccer Team.

509
00:35:22,457 --> 00:35:23,913
You hear that, Junior?

510
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,751
As soon as you're born,
I'm putting a soccer ball in your hands.

511
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,582
No, he's going to have books.

512
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:33,211
Fine. Books about soccer.

513
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:37,840
See, baby.

514
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:40,683
I told you everything
was going to work out.

515
00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:43,431
We're out in the
middle of nowhere,

516
00:35:44,187 --> 00:35:45,560
baby's doing great.

517
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:48,313
Everything's going
to be perfect.

518
00:35:50,156 --> 00:35:53,940
Well, it looks like we've got
nothing but smooth skies ahead,

519
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:56,823
so we should be arriving
in Mexico right on time.

520
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:57,531
Excuse me.

521
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,991
When's the meal coming around?
I'm starved.

522
00:36:00,078 --> 00:36:01,700
As a way to keep
ticket prices low,

523
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:04,410
we have removed the in-flight
meal from our service package.

524
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,952
What's left on the
service package?

525
00:36:07,088 --> 00:36:09,961
Pretzels and bags
of Krispity Krunch.

526
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:11,292
Pretzels.

527
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,500
Just a few minutes.

528
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:21,220
Freshen me up when you
get a chance, darlin'.

529
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,351
Right away, Dr. Stammel.

530
00:36:28,815 --> 00:36:31,192
Dede's doing real good.

531
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:34,820
She's responding to the meds,
um, eating.

532
00:36:36,287 --> 00:36:38,110
She's going to be okay.

533
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,531
Because of you.

534
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:48,333
She's going to be
okay because of you.

535
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:52,171
I need to know...

536
00:36:54,638 --> 00:36:56,843
...that you forgive me.

537
00:36:57,558 --> 00:37:00,383
I know that.
Of course I forgive you.

538
00:37:01,015 --> 00:37:04,142
You know when Dede
was like four,

539
00:37:04,346 --> 00:37:06,181
she wanted to watch this video.

540
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:07,760
And I kept telling
her you know,

541
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:10,981
"After the game,
after the game, okay?"

542
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:13,022
She kept asking
and kept asking,

543
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:15,191
and I lost my patience
and I snapped at her.

544
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,861
I snapped at her real bad.

545
00:37:17,327 --> 00:37:20,241
She went over into
the corner, and...

546
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:24,453
I didn't even go over
and say anything.

547
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,201
Why are you getting
yourself upset

548
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,662
over something that happened years ago,
baby? Years ago. Dede loves you.

549
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,261
Baby, I want you to
do something for me.

550
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:36,463
I want you to tell
her that I'm sorry.

551
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:37,840
I'm so sorry.

552
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:40,673
And that my baby girls
means everything to me--

553
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,323
I want you to tell her that she
means everything to me, okay?

554
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:45,261
You tell her that every day.

555
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:47,183
- Time.
- No matter what...

556
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:50,273
- Ma'am...
- Tell her. Tell her, okay?

557
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:53,523
No matter what,
you promise that, okay?

558
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,273
Ma'am.

559
00:37:54,526 --> 00:37:56,663
Please, please, you got to tell her.
You have to tell her...

560
00:37:56,695 --> 00:37:59,780
- Okay, okay.
- Ma'am. You really have to go.

561
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:03,361
- Tell her, tell her.
- Okay. Okay.

562
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,010
Attention, attention.

563
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,802
All spectators must remain behind
the barricades at all times.

564
00:38:27,228 --> 00:38:29,473
The president will
be arriving shortly.

565
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:31,941
Anyone attempting to
circumvent the barricades...

566
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:33,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

567
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:35,600
Got a Boom Charlie
half block south.

568
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:37,403
Team leader wants
you there right now.

569
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:39,610
- What's the M.O.?
- He's got an IED strapped to...

570
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,910
He asked you to come to
this fountain specifically?

571
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:49,660
Yeah.

572
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,121
Let me take a look
at that park map.

573
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:01,042
Why not the fountain on
the east side of the park?

574
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:03,880
Because this one's closer to
the pay phone he called me on.

575
00:39:04,097 --> 00:39:06,181
No, because this
one's closer to them.

576
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:08,152
They tell you to meet
them at the statue.

577
00:39:08,398 --> 00:39:09,762
Then the fountain.

578
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,890
Then they send you to the
building across the park.

579
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,521
Why?

580
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:18,443
'Cause they want to keep
you in their sights.

581
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:20,481
Because they're watching you.

582
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:23,400
But from where?

583
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,322
Statue, fountain, building...

584
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:30,743
There. The hotel.

585
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:37,870
- You know what you have?
- I think we have a pretty good idea.

586
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,370
What you doing?

587
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:41,540
Getting all unique data
from the memory key

588
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:44,633
so we can identify this key
from any other-- label it,

589
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:48,721
start a proper record of a chain of
custody to present to the judges
I trust.

590
00:39:54,356 --> 00:39:55,022
No.

591
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,563
What's wrong?

592
00:39:57,316 --> 00:39:59,482
No, it's the date stamp
on the memory key.

593
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:02,983
- It's the copy date.
- I'm sorry, what's that?

594
00:40:03,115 --> 00:40:05,281
It's the date the damn
thing was copied,

595
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,993
not the date that the conversation
was originally recorded.

596
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,953
So what?
I mean, you heard what was on the tape.

597
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,701
Without a time stamp of exactly

598
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:16,273
when this conversation
took place,

599
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:18,872
we can't prove that this is
Terrence Steadman talking

600
00:40:19,006 --> 00:40:21,332
after you supposedly
killed him.

601
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:24,133
This could have happened
a year before his funeral.

602
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:27,211
No, it can't be authenticated,
so it can't be

603
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,841
admitted to any
court as evidence.

604
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:32,852
People died because of this.
My family died.

605
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:34,433
I'm sorry.

606
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:39,273
Legally speaking,
this tape is useless.

607
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,690
Alexander Mahone, FBI.

608
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:51,320
Have either of these
men checked in?

609
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:53,872
- No, not that I've seen.
- What about this woman?

610
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:56,453
Yeah.

611
00:40:59,716 --> 00:41:02,373
- Room 10-06.
- 10-06, 10-06. Thank you.

612
00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:09,212
It's not over.
We're this close.

613
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:11,222
You already said it's done.

614
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:14,643
Actually, I said it couldn't help
exonerate you in a court of law.

615
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:18,181
Maybe it can help
you outside the law.

616
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,640
How?

617
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:22,230
Well, we all heard
the conversation.

618
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:26,481
There's more to this tape than
potential proof of Lincoln's innocence.

619
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:29,571
There is proof of
Caroline Reynold's guilt.

620
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:33,860
Guilt about something that she does
not want anyone to know anything about.

621
00:41:33,996 --> 00:41:36,030
So we blackmail her.

622
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:40,701
I'm an officer of the court.
I... I didn't say that.

623
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,710
Blackmail in exchange for what?

624
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:46,921
A presidential pardon.

625
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:49,303
The woman that set me up...

626
00:41:49,638 --> 00:41:51,221
is going to set me free.

627
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:55,513
I think she'll sign
it with her own hand.

628
00:41:58,108 --> 00:42:00,471
Ace Team, Beta Team --
this is Leader One.

629
00:42:06,238 --> 00:42:09,070
The President will reach Home
Base in T minus two minutes.

630
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:32,972
I love you.

631
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:35,930
