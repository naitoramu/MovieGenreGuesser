00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,640
<i>I am a fugitive.</i>

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,620
<i>Three weeks ago,i was incarcerated</i>

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,480
<i>In a panamanian prison.</i>

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,200
<i>While i was there,</i>

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,470
<i>I was approached by the company...</i>

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,840
<i>...a corrupt organization</i>

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,530
<i>Involved in all levels of industry</i>

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,630
<i>And government.</i>

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,300
<i>They gave me two options:</i>

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,470
<i>Break one of their men--</i>

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,280
<i>James whistler-- Out of that prison...</i>

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,740
<i>Or they would kill the only woman i ever loved--</i>

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,800
<i>Dr. Sara tancredi.</i>

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,700
<i>I held up my end and broke whistler out.</i>

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,490
<i>The company...</i>

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,530
<i>...they killed sara anyway.</i>

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,440
<i>I don't know why the company wanted james whistler</i>

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,160
<i>Out of prison,but i've tracked him here to los angeles.</i>

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,600
<i>He's with an agent i know only as gretchen...</i>

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,120
<i>...the same agent who murdered sara.</i>

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,270
<i>It ends today.</i>

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,990
<i>I will seek the justice</i>

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,710
<i>That i now know the system cannot provide.</i>

25
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,190
<i>So if you're reading this letter,</i>

26
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,030
<i>You'll know i died avenging sara's death.</i>

30
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,660
<i>You get the data card.</i>

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,630
We drop it off in the racing form,and we get the hell

32
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,800
Out of there.

33
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,660
Who's the contact we're leaving it for?

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,540
The company wants the card back,period.

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,490
All you need to worry about

36
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,560
Is getting this rig the hell out of there in a hurry.

37
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,590
Oh,i'll be getting it out of there.

38
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,970
Don't you worry about that.

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,400
You worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time.

40
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,850
If you pull this off,you can come up to my room later

41
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,580
And the word "no" won't be in my vocabulary.

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,510
Just make sure we get paid.

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,420
In and out.

44
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,370
Good to see you again.

45
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,230
You,too.

46
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,400
Didn't hear from you for a while.

47
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,290
Started to wonder if you were

48
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,840
Still interested. I am,very much so.

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,670
Well,i needed to approach this carefully.

50
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm sure you understand.

51
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,980
Who you buying it for?

52
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,390
A competitor?

53
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,160
A foreign country? Jason,

54
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,780
You know i can't get into that.

55
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,480
Now,we've been negotiating this for months.

56
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,740
I've jumped through all your hoops.

57
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,040
I've agreed to meet you here.

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,970
Do you want to sell the card to me or not?

59
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,860
Be right back.

60
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,090
That's a lot of secrets on a little piece of plastic.

61
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,880
Let me give you a little bit of advice--

62
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,790
And this is on the house--

63
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,010
Watch your step with that thing.

64
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,310
The company will do anything to get it back.

65
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,090
Don't i know it.

66
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,030
What the hell are you doing? Yeah.

67
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,610
We got to get out of here.

68
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,000
I need to hide the gun.

69
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,270
Take the gun with you!

70
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,610
Where is she?

71
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,850
Michael,you don't understand.

72
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,790
Call gretchen,get her in here now.

73
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,490
You have to trust me.

74
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,060
I'm not your enemy,michael.

75
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,820
James.

76
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,740
We need to leave.

77
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,650
You know,despite everything...

78
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,110
If sara could weigh in right now,

79
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,610
She'd tell me not to kill you.

80
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,620
That's the kind of person she was.

81
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,080
That's the kind of person you took from me.

82
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,910
James,

83
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,940
Didn't you tell him?

84
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,930
He walked in five... shut up!

85
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,690
Gretchen,look at me.

86
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,840
This is for sara.

87
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,760
I never killed sara.

88
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,720
I wouldn't expect someone like you to take this with dignity.

89
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,480
I swear to god she's alive.

90
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,250
Don't. Don't insult me and don't insult her.

91
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,310
She escaped.

92
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,380
We knew if you found out we wouldn't have any leverage.

93
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,240
I fabricated the whole thing.

94
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,450
My brother saw... a head in a box!

95
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,910
From a cadaver.

96
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,850
You ask lincoln what he really saw.

97
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,570
Listen to her,michael. Don't lie to me.

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,290
I'm not lying to you. Lincoln bought it,

99
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,690
You bought it,it worked.

100
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,820
Michael.

101
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,060
Then where is she?

102
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,210
I'll tell you when we get outside.

103
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,950
Right now,

104
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,850
We need to get out of here.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
They found the bodies.

106
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,350
Give me the gun. She's lying.

107
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,600
Is she?

108
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,670
If you pull that trigger,you'll never know.

109
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,630
Kill him,james.

110
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,240
Shut up.

111
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,760
Where is she?

112
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,090
Where is sara?!

113
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,580
Michael,

114
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,850
If you don't give me that gun,

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,630
I'm going to shoot you in the head.

116
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,530
Let's go.

117
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,150
We got a double homicide at the roosevelt hotel.

118
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,510
Sara.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


120
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,660
Do you know the difference

121
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,620
Between a perfectly executed operation

122
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,240
And a failed mission?

123
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,410
Sir? It's small unit leadership.

124
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,430
The allies spent two and a half years

125
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,580
Planning the invasion of normandy,

126
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,820
But on d-Day it came down to a handful of men on a strip of beach

127
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,470
To decide the fate of the world.

128
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,180
What i'm getting at,gretchen,

129
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,110
Is even the best plan is only as good as the moving parts on the ground executing it.

130
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,600
General,we got your card-- What's the problem?

131
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,990
We have nothing.

132
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,520
It's a duplicate.

133
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,390
Almost flawless,

134
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,410
But a duplicate.

135
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,600
That's impossible.

136
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,390
I saw... you know

137
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,530
How important the retrieval of this card is to me,gretchen.

138
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:13,830
You know that this is a security breach that could have catastrophic ramifications for the company.

139
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,060
The only thing i can think of...

140
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,220
There was a blind spot

141
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,520
When whistler was hitting the target.

142
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,870
Maybe he made a duplicate and he still has the original.

143
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,880
You hired him.

144
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,550
You kept him at the tip of the spear.

145
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,610
You insisted that we get him out of sona.

146
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,960
We had to.

147
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,970
He had already made contact with the target.

148
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,910
At that point,it was him or no one,sir.

149
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,760
What's your stake in all of this?

150
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,750
I had nothing to do with it.

151
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,840
Whistler acted on his own.

152
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,820
I swear to you.

153
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,850
General,i can fix this.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,240
You trained me.

155
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,360
Not well enough,apparently.

156
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,140
????

157
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,830
Please.

158
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,630
I have a bank account in dubai

159
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,220
Left over from a slush fund from cobra ii.

160
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,490
It's yours.

161
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,310
No,please,please...

162
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,030
panama city, panama

163
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,700
Hello.

164
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,490
Hey,it's me.

165
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,720
Where are you,man?

166
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,280
Los angeles.

167
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,140
You okay,michael?

168
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,610
No,i'm,i'm safe.

169
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,030
Thank god,thank god.

170
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:26,620
How's lj

171
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,330
And sofia? Yeah,they're,um...

172
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,080
I'm staring at them right now in fact.

173
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,940
They're fine.

174
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,420
You hear about sona?

175
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,570
What about it?

176
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,930
Burned down three days back.

177
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,230
The inmates-- They rioted.

178
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,170
No sign of bellick,

179
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,940
T-Bag,or sucre.

180
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,130
Sucre?

181
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,730
He got popped-- I don't know how.

182
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,000
I mean,the papers listed the names of the inmates,

183
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,210
And he was in there when it went down.

184
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,450
I found whistler and gretchen...

185
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,600
And,uh...

186
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,320
...gretchen said... ...she said sara is still alive.

187
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,770
What did you see,linc?

188
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,630
What do you mean what did i see,michael?

189
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,260
I need you to tell me exactly what you saw.

190
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,780
Michael,sara's gone.

191
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,290
Well,you said it was in a garage,right? So it was dark.

192
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,410
Yeah,it was dark.

193
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,050
But if you're asking me if i picked up the head

194
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,940
To check to see if it was sara,no,michael,i-I...

195
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,420
Lj said he...

196
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,570
He only heard them kill sara,right?

197
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,130
You just got to come back,please.

198
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,940
Come back. Let's just...

199
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,380
Let's just start a new life.

200
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,010
Tell sofia i said hi.

201
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,620
And tell lj...

202
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,020
Tell him his uncle loves him.

203
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,760
Michael,don't do this,please.

204
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,050
arizona desert 5 miles from the mexican border

205
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,770
Out,out!

206
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,120
<i>You need some better ventilation back there,amigo.</i>

207
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,940
<i>Que?</i>

208
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,960
Want to translate that?

209
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,010
Don't worry about it.

210
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,400
<i>Gracias.</i>

211
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,670
Where's your mom?

212
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,810
She'll be here.

213
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,760
What do you mean she'll be here?

214
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,770
We're-We're running out of time.

215
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,560
I got to be up there. Don't worry.

216
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,720
My mom wouldn't let me down.

217
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,100
At least,she hasn't yet.

218
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,920
Bradley!

219
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,400
Over here!

220
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,770
Mom! Mom! Here!

221
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,010
I told you! Don't worry,you'll make it there!

222
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,810
Oh! Oh!

223
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,930
What is it called?

224
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,300
Europeangoldfinch.Net.

225
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,990
It's what we can all use to communicate.

226
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,110
Michael.

227
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,720
Don't worry,i'm alone.

228
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,450
It's good to see you.

229
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,830
So where's your new best friend?

230
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,730
Well... i don't know about that,

231
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,520
But whistler's not who you think he is.

232
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,220
We're working together against the company.

233
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,530
Yeah? Yeah.

234
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,980
And what about gretchen?

235
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,140
She working with you?

236
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,820
He needed her to further his plan.

237
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,800
Look,if the guy was company,he'd have shot you dead back at that conference like she wanted him to.

238
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,380
Do you have any information about sara or not?

239
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,990
Let's go somewhere a little more private.

240
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,660
I want you to tell me right now.

241
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,300
I want you to tell me right now,right here!

242
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,740
Or we can get gretchen on the phone.

243
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,420
Gretchen's dead.

244
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,170
She never showed up.

245
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,970
Come and talk to me,please.

246
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,610
Whistler and i were at that conference to get a data card.

247
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,730
It's like the company's black book.

248
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,860
And it lists all their agents,all their operations.

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,070
They refer to it as "scylla."

250
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,960
Whistler's got it.

251
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,590
Alex,talk to me about sara.

252
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,790
That's all i care about.

253
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,060
I understand that. I want nothing more than to get home to my wife and my son.

254
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,520
But that's not gonna happen for either of us with the company out there trying to kill us.

255
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,420
You don't know anything about sara,do you?

256
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,200
Whistler does.

257
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,910
He tells me he does.

258
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,110
And he wants to tell you.

259
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,610
But he wants something in return.

260
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,520
What? What does he want from me?

261
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,590
To talk to you.

262
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,600
I'm sorry about all that the other night.

263
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,510
If i had more time,i would've explained myself better.

264
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,510
Sure.

265
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,760
What are we doing here?

266
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,090
Alex told you about scylla? Yes.

267
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,640
I have it.

268
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,410
There's one last step involved in order to read the data.

269
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,930
And that step involves breaking into a secured structure.

270
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,580
So now you need my help.

271
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,380
Yeah.

272
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,350
My book,the bird book,the one i lost in sona contained information

273
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,060
That would've helped facilitate the break-In,

274
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,400
But it can still be accomplished,

275
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,690
With your help.

276
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,740
Where's sara?

277
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,950
The only thing i know for sure,

278
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,380
A week ago,some information came through the wire.

279
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,840
Sara may have bought a bus ticket in santa fe.

280
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,560
Headed where?

281
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,210
Chicago.

282
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,230
Michael,if sara's out there,she's not safe-- None of us are.

283
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,970
The company knows we still have the original card,and that's why gretchen was the first to go.

284
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,190
I think we're done here.

285
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,350
We... have a chance for once to get scylla to people that want to take the company down.

286
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,930
I don't want to run anymore. We won't have to run anymore.

287
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,830
I spent the last month thinking sara was dead and that it was my fault.

288
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,310
If she's out there,i'm gonna find her.

289
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,010
That's all i care about.

290
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,850
This can be done within a week.

291
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,350
Less.

292
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,480
At least let me show you...

293
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,920
panama city. panama

294
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,350
These gams,girl.

295
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,080
Don't go.

296
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,060
This ain't no home for a white boy from alabama.

297
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,250
<i>They're here,seor.</i>

298
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,550
The bags are packed.

299
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,230
You kept your word to me.

300
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,930
<i>You're the first that's ever done that. Gracias.</i>

301
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,270
Why must you go after this man?

302
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,650
You could choose not to.

303
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,330
Where i come from,there's something called a blood feud.

304
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,890
<i>Comprende?</i>

305
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,530
Yes.

306
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,980
Michael scofield left me for dead

307
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,770
One too many times,as it turns out.

308
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,120
What is spanish for "little angel"?

309
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,030
<i>Angelita.</i>

310
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,680
<i>Adios,angelita.</i>

311
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,030
Is this legit?

312
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,100
<i>Oh,s? Seor>></i>

313
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,630
For the money you're paying,first class,all the way.

314
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,980
So these are coyotes one could trust.

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,480

317
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,830
As you've seen,

318
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,620
What you're entering into is quite serious.

319
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,230
I realize that.

320
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,070
You're responsible for this now.

321
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,630
You have nothing to worry about.

322
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,760
We'll talk soon.

323
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,210
It's time to clean up now.

324
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,710
Thoroughly.

325
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,930
Everyone who was close to whistler:

326
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,720

Mahone,burrows.

328
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,230
Burrows is still in panama.

329
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,590
Clean up.

Hello.

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,800
????

333
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,450
Where...

334
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,950
Where are you?

335
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,180
Uh,you know.

336
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,720
In the middle of it,as usual.

337
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,250
Panama still?

338
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,050
No.

339
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,350
No.

340
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,170
Are you okay?

341
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,220
Definitely.

342
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,830
Are you?

343
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,630
Yes.

344
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,380
And cameron?

345
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,080
He's fine.

346
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,080
I have to tell you,pam,you know,

347
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,390
I had a plan for all of us to be together.

348
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,290
And...

349
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,900
I'm not gonna stop working on it.

350
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,590
Why do you need a plan if you want to be with someone?

351
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,710
You just be with them.

352
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,550
Don't say that unless you mean it.

353
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,050
'Cause i'll turn this world upside down to get back to you.

354
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,190
So don't say it unless you mean it.

355
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,700
I mean it.

356
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,000
Okay.

357
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,250
Come on,babe.

358
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,910
I-I hate plantains,you know that.

359
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,800
I try your chili burger.

360
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,310
Chili-Chili burger? You loved the chili burger.

361
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,250
Okay,i'm gonna

362
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,050
Make them with my mom's special recipe.

363
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,390
Your mom's special recipe?

364
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,320
You'll love it.

365
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,930
Really?

366
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,340
Yeah! You're gonna love it.

367
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,040
????

368
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,710
It's delicious.

369
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,690
????

370
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,330
Let's get out of here. Drop 'em.

371
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,330
Let's go. Give me your hand. Lj.

372
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,720
Yeah,come with me.

373
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,910
Lincoln,what's going on?

374
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,010
Dad.

375
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,460
We're safe now.

376
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,650
Relax. No.

377
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,140
I saw someone.

378
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,440
Looks like company,i'm sure of it.

379
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,080
Let's just go,okay?

380
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,110
Let's go.

381
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,180
We'll-We'll be fine.

382
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,390
All right,all right. Yeah.

383
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,060
Okay.

384
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,680
Let's go.

385
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,130
Get back.

386
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,230
Dad!

387
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,710
Dad,we have to run.

388
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,070
Go. Get out of here.

389
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,520
Run!

390
00:21:59,690 --> 00:21:59,950
Get going!

391
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,050
Lincoln!

392
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,230
Lincoln!

393
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,350
I'm looking for alex.

394
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,340
I don't know where he is.

395
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,710
No?

396
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,800
No.

397
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,930
Uh,we've been divorced for almost two years now.

398
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,170
We haven't had contact in months.

399
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,650
I would think that might change now that he's back in the u.S.

400
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,810
I am so sick of you people-- What are you a fed?--

401
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,410
Thinking that you can keep on harassing...

402
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,050
I'm not with the government,pam.

403
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,750
Mom,could you come here?

404
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,950
We're done talking...

405
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,250
Bruce bennett.

406
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,240
Do you know who this is?

407
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,670
I do.

408
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,410
I'm looking for sara,and right now,

409
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,720
You're the only person i can think of who can help me.

410
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,200
Hold on.

411
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,230
Where are you?

412
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,060
Back in chicago.

413
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,670
Have you heard from her?

414
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,000
Meet me in front of the drake hotel in a half hour.

415
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,960
Please just tell me... is she alive?

416
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,270
Are you michael scofield?

417
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,730
Are you michael scofield?

418
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,500
Yes,i am.

419
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,540
Hands on your head.

420
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,300
????

421
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,470
Special agent don self,homeland security.

422
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,220
Were you there when james whistler was killed?

423
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,710
I didn't kill him.

424
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,600
I know you didn't.

425
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:57,590
He was an independent contractor who worked for the company for about ten years.

426
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,710
He was assigned to retrieve scylla once it went missing.

427
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,050
Do you know what scylla is?

428
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,450
It's the company's little black book.

429
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,340
So he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me.

430
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,510
What do you want from me?

431
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,690
You're looking at major time.

432
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,790
You know that,right?

433
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,260
So how would you like to walk away from it all...

434
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,400
Not do a day?

435
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,460
In exchange for...? Scylla.

436
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,560
All right. Sara tancredi,last seen in panama,

437
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,340
If you help me find her,

438
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,430
Maybe we've got a deal.

439
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,590
I'm sorry,she's not my department,scylla is.

440
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,380
Then go find it yourself.

441
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,040
It seems to me,

442
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,650
The u.S. Government should have a little more reach than someone who's looking at major time.

443
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,240
To perform the operation,michael,

444
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,440
That would require signatures from about 20 different department heads.

445
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,230
Do you want to bet at least one of them is company?

446
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,360
The only way this is going to work is via freelancer,off the books.

447
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,370
It sounds complicated.

448
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,380
I'll take a pass.

449
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,600
I'm giving you an opportunity to avoid 15 years in jail,

450
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,880
Not to mention the time that your brother's facing.

451
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,870
What are you talking about?

452
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,660
The company tried to take him out in panama.

453
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,700
He,um... reacted,

454
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,440
Apparently.

455
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,630
But i just made a deal with the panamanian authorities

456
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,590
For him to serve out his time in the u.S.

457
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,440
He should be touching ground any time now.

458
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,350
You recognize this handwriting?

459
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,180
This is your father's.

460
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,540
He spent the last two years

461
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,000
Of his life going after this very thing.

462
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,060
Do you believe in fate,michael?

463
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,100
I think i'd like to talk to my brother.

464
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,490
Oh,no.

465
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,820
Oh,no.

466
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,620
What's going...?

467
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,180
Hey,hey! Whoa,whoa!

468
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,090
Stop! Stop! Hey! You don't want to go in there.

469
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,300
You don't want to go in there.

470
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,050
God,she's...

471
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,950
Lilah maria sucre.

472
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,830
She gave her my name?

473
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,540
<i>Soy tu papa.</i>

474
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,820
You're setting me up?

475
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,510
Sucre,you can't keep bringing maricruz down.

476
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,110
You can't do this to her anymore.

477
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,460
Wait. Don't...

478
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,340
Sucre,don't...

479
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,790
Go! Go!

480
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,310
Oh,boy.

481
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,680
We're screwed.

482
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,050
You know why scofield

483
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,930
Gets all twisted up when he's around me?

484
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,760
We're the same,and he just can't stand it.

485
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,430
Drives his ass crazy.

486
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,570
We got the same brilliant mind,

487
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,270
The same natural-Born leader tendency,

488
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,410
The same one-In-A-Million-Type charisma,yes?

489
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,370
He just gonna look down his nose at me?

490
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,480
How you gonna find him?

491
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,120
This.

492
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,710
You're both into birds?

493
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,310
No,no.

494
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,340
It's either gonna take me to him,or he to me.

495
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,050
I just know it.

496
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,410
If i was you,i'd forget about this scofield.

497
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,520
You have plenty of money. See? I mean...

498
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,750
How much money you have in that bag?

499
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,690
Why don't you just mind your own beeswax,huh?

500
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,180
You just keep pointing

501
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,970
This jalopy northbound,all right?

502
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,460
Get me back to the land 'o cotton.

503
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,020
Of course.

504
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,580
Ready.

505
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,780
Only a few people in government will know of the operation.

506
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,010
It has to stay that way,

507
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,990
Or people's lives will be in danger,mine included.

508
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,320
Taking down the company sounds a little bigger than a two-Man job,no?

509
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,450
I'm going to get you help.

510
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,240
I thought you said,you couldn't trust anybody.

511
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,070
Yeah,but maybe you can.

512
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,890
All right,two of your cohorts--

513
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,820
Fernando sucre,and brad bellick were arrested,

514
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,010
They're both facing time,

515
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,360
And alexander mahone is in a colorado jail cell.

516
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,580
Good,let him sit there.

517
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,860
You're going to need mahone if you want to make this happen.

518
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,780
He was working with whistler.

519
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,940
And you'll have me.

520
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,900
Okay? Whatever you need,i'll provide.

521
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,610
Whistler also said something about a second step,

522
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,270
Something about a break-In.

523
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,770
Yeah,the card has all the data on it,

524
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,310
But it's encrypted.

525
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,380
Once you get your hands on it,

526
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,530
You're going to need to find a way to break into the company's headquarters.

527
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,350
It's the only way to unlock what's on the card.

528
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,340
Where's the building?

529
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,140
L.A. Where in l.A.?

530
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't know.

531
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,680
So,we've got a data card,which could be anywhere,

532
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,940
And we've got to break into a building,

533
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,130
The location of which has yet to be determined.

534
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,240
Simple enough.

535
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,650
You've broken out of two penitentiaries.

536
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,100
I'm thinking,uh,breaking into a building isn't too far outside your wheelhouse.

537
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,120
How do you know our dad?

538
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,430
He heard from contacts that i could be trusted.

539
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,850
Your father was a good man.

540
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,560
Why now?

541
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,100
Look,i've been going after the company for five years.

542
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,620
Okay? When whistler was killed yesterday,

543
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,880
The plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation.

544
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,930
But,uh...

545
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,990
I convinced my superiors to give it one more chance.

546
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,140
So this is like job security for you?

547
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,300
What's that?

548
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,260
Well,when we go out there and risk our necks,

549
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,510
You can collect your pension.

550
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,000
No,no,no,lincoln.

551
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,710
Okay,some people still care about their job.

552
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,510
Some people still fight for this country.

553
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:41,180
Maybe you've been a little too
 distracted boosting car stereos and 
breaking heads to remember that.

554
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,510
I don't know. If we do this deal,

555
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,730
After it's done,

556
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,360
You can look for sara... if she's alive.

557
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,470
If we take this deal,we'll both be dead

558
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,900
Long before i get the chance,linc.

559
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,160
You guys must have some big-Time friends.

560
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,660
What are you talking about?

561
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:14,780
Somebody just posted

562
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,790
A significant amount of bail for both of you.

563
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,940
Who?

564
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,160
I don't know,but they're outside.

565
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,160
You're free to go.

566
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,650
Here,take your dad's file. My number's inside.

567
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,560
We ain't doing this. Just take it anyway.

568
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,680
This file,it means nothing to me anymore.

569
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,150
Bruce bennett.

570
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,570
Let's go for a drive.

571
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,600
Thanks.

572
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,230
I thought i'd never see you again.

573
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,630
I have something for you.

574
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,540
Okay.

575
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,620
You left this behind.

576
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,150
Is that what this is about?

577
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,020
You just getting me my rose back?

578
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,390
Yeah. I guess i'm done now.

579
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,930
I can retire.

580
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,570
How much time are you looking at?

581
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,390
They're saying 15 years.

582
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,790
I have to find out for sure.

583
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,190
I heard lincoln say something about a deal.

584
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,460
No jail time.

585
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,960
In exchange for taking down the company.

586
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,470
How?

587
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,900
Exactly.

588
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,870
I love you.

589
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,650
That's all i know right now.

590
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,510
"Will you not yield to the immortal gods?"

591
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,560
"That nightmare cannot die.

592
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,830
"Eternal evil itself.

593
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,410
"There is no fighting her,no.

594
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,300
No power that can fight her."

595
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,070
Now,listen to me-- It's up to you now.

596
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,300
<i>"All that avails is flight."</i>

597
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,420
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

598
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,230
I'm sorry.

599
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,030
Do you want to talk about it?

600
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,820
It's not your fault.

601
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,050
It's not.

602
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,430
Tell me what happened.

603
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,000
It's just the company.

604
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,710
It's just what they do.

605
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:35,960
It wasn't just me.

606
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,750
God,it was you and lj and-And lincoln.

607
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,350
And they won't stop,

608
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,780
And i don't know how to deal with that.

609
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,310
Hey,come here.

610
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,180
Come here. Come here.

611
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,290
Let's go!

612
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,420
Are you okay?

613
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,290
I can't believe they found us so fast.

614
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,690
Should i call... should i call bruce and-And get some place safe?

615
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,300
No place is safe.

616
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,720
They're not gonna stop unless we stop them. Linc?

617
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,260
You thinking what i'm thinking? Let's end this.

618
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,110
But i'm not gonna leave you behind again.

619
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,160
Yeah?

620
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,600
????

621
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,560
Hey.

622
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,690
Hey,papi.

623
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,650
Linc.

624
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,710
I can't tell you how grateful i am for you including me.

625
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,890
Well,sucre vouched for you,bellick.

626
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,030
He said you came through for him down in panama.

627
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,140
Alex?

628
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,040
Michael.

629
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,500
You ready for this?

630
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,330
Yeah. I am.

631
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,200
Bellick: so i hear whistler's bird book

632
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,140
Has details about what we need to steal.

633
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,200
Yeah.

634
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,100
You know who's got it,right?

635
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,330
Please.

636
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,120
We'll die out here.

637
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,430
Thanks for the cash,gringo.

638
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,560
First class all the way.

639
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,890
<i>Do we have any idea where t-Bag is?</i>

640
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,320
That snake could be anywhere.

641
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,270
When we're in l.A.,we can think like convicts,

642
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,960
We just can't act like them.

643
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,360
If we do,we're done.

644
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,120
It goes without saying--

645
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,660
This is your last chance to back out,

646
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,970
'Cause first on the list of things

647
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:58,590
I cannot guarantee you is your safety.

648
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,090
We're all a long way from where this started.

649
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,000
But what i can guarantee you is that if we do this thing right,

650
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,700
We'll be close to where it ends.

651
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,450
Freedom.

652
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,030
Finally.

653
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:19,080
You two-- Let's go.

654
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,860
Hey,mike?

655
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,470
What about sara?

656
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,420
Sara's in.

657
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,360
All right,we're heading out tomorrow.

658
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,160
I have to finalize a few things before we go.

659
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,110
No games and no stunts.

660
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,310
Otherwise,i promise,

661
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,690
You're gonna see a whole different side of me.

662
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,310
Likewise.

663
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,180
Fake ids.

664
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,750
It's a good start,

665
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,330
But there are some things you can't fake,

666
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,700
And there are some things

667
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,470
You can't hide.

668
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,470
Know what i mean?

669
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,150
How high is your threshold for pain?

670
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,140
You sure you don't want a sedative?

671
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,630
We're gonna go into the night.

672
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,220
How do you feel?

673
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,360
Lighter somehow.

674
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,900
Look,i don't know how we're gonna take them down.

675
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,050
I don't even know who they are,

676
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,480
But i do know one thing--

677
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,010
The company's gonna pay for what they did to you.

678
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,080
Let's go.

679
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,260
You sure you're up for this?

680
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,710
If we can do it together,um... yeah.

681
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,620
Absolutely.

682
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,170
A c-130? What do they want...

683
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,260
Want us to parachute out of this thing?

684
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,160
This guy called in a favor to the air force.

685
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,400
It's not like we can be flying commercial,you know?

686
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,460
If you're successful with obtaining scylla,

687
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,600
You'll not only avoid jail time,but you can take great pride

688
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:35,270
In knowing you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat to its own democracy.

689
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,940
If you're killed while doing so,

690
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,040
A proper funeral will be provided.

691
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,690
But if you try to escape,

692
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,520
You will have no funeral.

693
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,810
You will have nothing,

694
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,840
And you will be apprehended and buried where we find you.

695
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:52,120
I sincerely hope we understand each other.

696
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,010
You better hold up your end of the deal.

697
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,670
Let's go!

698
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:15,450
