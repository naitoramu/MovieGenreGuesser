1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,914
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,074 --> 00:00:03,790
Sona's a one way street.

3
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:06,626
What goes in... never comes out.

4
00:00:07,345 --> 00:00:08,295
<i>They got us.</i>

5
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:11,798
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
Are we clear?

6
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:14,538
I'll tell you the plan
when you tell me who you are.

7
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:16,303
- I'm a fisherman.
- Really?

8
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:18,026
My life is in your hands.

9
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:20,015
How's LJ? How's Sara?

10
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:22,475
She's dead, Michael. I lied to you.

11
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:30,066
You are breaking out of this prison,
and you're taking me with you.

12
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:31,318
4 more days.

13
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:34,446
If I'm out of here by then,
I can still do it.

14
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:37,365
There've been 2 escape attempts
in the past 2 days.

15
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,035
Say goodbye to Sona, M. Scofield.

16
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:15,862
My predecessor, Colonel Escamilla,

17
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:18,531
wasn't an effective leader.
He's been replaced.

18
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:21,069
I am general Zavala. Sit.

19
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:23,827
A drink of water?

20
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,126
With all due respect, I had nothing
to do with what happened today.

21
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,770
I always conduct
a thorough investigation,

22
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,703
and there are too many
unanswered questions here.

23
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,427
It is my job to find those answers.

24
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:41,596
If you help me do my job,
I'll help you.

25
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,443
The helicopters.

26
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:46,422
You alone
couldn't be responsible for that.

27
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:49,228
You certainly
weren't flying a helicopter, right?

28
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,939
But you know who sent them.

29
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:54,874
Again, be advised.

30
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:57,237
Telling the truth
is in your best interest.

31
00:01:57,897 --> 00:01:58,897
I am.

32
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:05,912
Let's go for a walk.

33
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,106
I understand your fears,

34
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,277
but the Republic of Panama
cannot allow this sort of activity.

35
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:13,878
If you wish to talk, now is the time.

36
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,148
I would...

37
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:20,844
- if there was anything left to say.
- Then you give me no choice. This way.

38
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,891
This isn't good.
They're putting him in a hot box.

39
00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:30,311
Things are gonna get
much harder for you.

40
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,182
There's no way to win.
You must cooperate.

41
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:38,319
Confess to this escape
and face your punishment by law,

42
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:41,448
or face a far greater
punishment in the Panama sun.

43
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,128
It's up to you.

44
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:47,537
He's done.

45
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:49,834
He's finished.

46
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:30,045

47
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:53,645
I hope my brother's all right.

48
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,765
- Does it hurt?
- It's fine.

49
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:58,568
I'm gonna get to the prison.

50
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:00,836
I was watching the news
in the waiting room.

51
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:02,688
They identified a few bodies, but...

52
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:05,031
- it wasn't them.
- I'll find out when I get there.

53
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,393
- You want to come?
- I don't know.

54
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:10,202
After all that happened,
I don't know what to think anymore.

55
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:13,444
- What more is there to think about?
- James has an answer for everything,

56
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:15,837
- but it never makes sense.
- Stop asking questions,

57
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:17,307
just look at the facts.

58
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,490
I wanted to believe
everything he was saying,

59
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,174
- and I still want him to get out.
- I want him out as well.

60
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,635
Trust me, I've been working on this
every single day.

61
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:29,973
Lincoln, I really appreciate
everything you have done.

62
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:32,266
You saved my life.

63
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:34,652
You didn't have
to help me like that.

64
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:35,956
Yeah. I did.

65
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:43,338
Get in the car.

66
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:57,333
Everywhere I go, there you are.

67
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:00,420
Go home, Sofia.

68
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,187
Part of me wanted to drive
right past this gate, Alex.

69
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:20,648
You don't deserve to be here.

70
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:26,070
Actually, if you take all things
into consideration... I do.

71
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,228
- Thank you.
- Wait.

72
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,374
Don't.

73
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:43,713
My father worked in a mine
for 30 years.

74
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:46,507
He took this into work
with him every day.

75
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,551
Kept him safe till the day he retired.

76
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:51,803
Then he gave it to me.

77
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:56,975
I can't take this.

78
00:05:57,735 --> 00:05:59,312
Give it back when you get out.

79
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:05,902
- Take care of yourself, Alex.
- Yeah.

80
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:46,149
What? You ain't got the guts
to do it yourself?

81
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:48,944
This is for you,
so shut up before I change my mind.

82
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:51,071
After yesterday, you may be doubting

83
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:53,408
my ability to make good
on our agreement.

84
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,744
I need to keep you motivated.
You have one minute.

85
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,637
LJ, thank God you're alive.

86
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,644
- Forget it. You can't do anything.
- There's always something.

87
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:25,429
These guys are thorough.
They follow you everywhere. Trust me.

88
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:30,068
That bitch is crazy.

89
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,019
She cut Sara's head off.

90
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:33,697
I was there.

91
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,597
I closed my eyes, but I heard it.

92
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,954
You listen to me.
I won't let anything happen to you.

93
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:43,022
The next time you see me,
don't take your eyes off me.

94
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:45,362
I'll tell you what to do. All right?

95
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:47,211
Minute's up.

96
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,078
Me and your uncle,

97
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:51,716
we know what we're doing.
We'll get you out of this.

98
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:55,560
- I love you.
- I love you too.

99
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:22,497
Looks like things didn't go so well.

100
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:25,583
- You should be gone.
- So should you.

101
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:27,376
What happened?

102
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,996
It's still happening.

103
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:33,870
I feel bad for Michael,
but we have a way without him.

104
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,010
- You should get some rest.
- What's the way?

105
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:39,721
I'll rest. I'll rest when I'm out.

106
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:41,681
I won't go without you.

107
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:44,317
You have my word.
Now get some rest.

108
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,770
You see Scofield out
in that redneck sauna?

109
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,200
Maybe he has the tattoo
to get out of that one.

110
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:03,079
You were in on it, right? I see you guys
lurking around Lechero.

111
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,707
- Scofield gotta have a plan to escape.
- If so, I know none of it.

112
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,854
Yeah, I bet you don't.

113
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,464
Too many cocktails
out on the Lido deck.

114
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:17,616
Here comes trouble.

115
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:22,932
- Clean it up.
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.

116
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:25,392
You heard what I said?
I told you to do something.

117
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:27,309
- Do it.
- Cleaning up chunks

118
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:30,066
- ain't in my job description anymore.
- Things changed.

119
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:33,234
- You see, you answer to us now.
- You don't scare me, caveman.

120
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:35,425
Go bug someone else!

121
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:20,570
I have a special delivery.

122
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,092
I need to get it in real quick.

123
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:25,661
- How much?
- I gave you ten grand.

124
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:28,651
For the last one.
How much for this one?

125
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:31,125
- No grand.
- Then no thanks.

126
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,351
- Take this water to the prisoner.
- Why should I? He doesn't deserve it.

127
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:52,395
I'll do it.

128
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,645
Hi, brother.

129
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,376
Remember me?

130
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:11,904
This isn't gonna work.

131
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:16,148
- Come on, papi, drink this.
- Don't let anything happen to LJ, OK?

132
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:19,242
It's okay.
He's doing much better than you.

133
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:21,730
Come on. Drink this. You need it.

134
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,854
I'm sorry about Sara.

135
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:39,543
I'll try to sneak more into the prison
next time, okay?

136
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:41,043
I want you to quit.

137
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,488
I can't.

138
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:45,448
- We all have to quit sometime.
- I'm not gonna.

139
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,952
You're in a chicken coop,
you any possible need help.

140
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:50,162
Don't need your help.
Go. Don't come back.

141
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,747
Not after everything you've done for me.

142
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:11,141
So you tried to catch a flight
out of here yesterday?

143
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:14,663
- I had to do what I had to do.
- But you went back on our deal.

144
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:17,404
I was saving my own ass.
You're familiar with the strategy.

145
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:19,682
You watch it! I'm still boss here.

146
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,430
Who cares about who's boss?

147
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,135
Do you wanna get out of here
or do you wanna keep talking about it?

148
00:12:26,873 --> 00:12:27,825
It's okay.

149
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:29,845
We just need to brace it.

150
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:32,295
No. We need the engineer.

151
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:33,996
Move it.

152
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:37,043
Let's get out of here
before Sammy gets back.

153
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:56,520
98 degrees in the shade,
125 in the box.

154
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,104
Let's go inside. We'll have a chat
in the air conditioning.

155
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:03,861
Tomorrow is going to be hotter,
the next day, even hotter.

156
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:06,155
The day after that, you'll be dead.

157
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,823
You don't understand.

158
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,701
If I thought you could help me...

159
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:12,961
I can.

160
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:16,534
You're unaware of the influence
I have in this province.

161
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:20,127
You'd rather I be your ally
than your enemy, wouldn't you?

162
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:22,088
You don't know these people.

163
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:24,805
We can't stop them. Not you,

164
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:27,025
not me.

165
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,296
There was a man,

166
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:34,058
a drug kingpin,
the most powerful man in Panama.

167
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:39,105
A ruthless killer with an army of thugs
and thieves behind him.

168
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:42,400
He killed judges, policemen,
anyone who stood in his way.

169
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,984
They said he couldn't be stopped,
but now...

170
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:47,683
Lechero is in prison,
and I'm in power.

171
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:51,867
I decide whose life is at stake,
and right now, it's yours.

172
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:56,009
From the moment I got here...

173
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:01,627
I've been planning my escape.

174
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:09,969
He's talking.

175
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:11,864
How do you know?

176
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:14,098
You can't get out of the box
any other way.

177
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,367
The people who sent the helicopters,

178
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:39,331
they're the same people who framed
my brother back in the U.S.

179
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:44,211
The same people
who wanted me here in Sona.

180
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:47,548
In order for you to break out
another inmate?

181
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:51,551
Who are these people?

182
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:54,020
I don't know,

183
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,736
but they have my brother's son.

184
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,846
They like to keep collateral.

185
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:04,607
I could be putting his life
in danger as we speak.

186
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,806
If what you told me is true...

187
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:11,155
you would be saving him.

188
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:15,201
I would call my troops and order
a search for the boy immediately.

189
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:17,320
But this story...

190
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,873
- it's fiction.
- It's true.

191
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:26,126
It's what you wanted.
It's the only thing I have left to give.

192
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:28,944
Please.

193
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:31,758
His name is LJ.

194
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:35,634
He's only 16 years old.

195
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:44,803
What's that smell?

196
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:46,263
Armandos.

197
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:50,652
- These things cost money.
- Somebody gave them to me.

198
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:52,445
- Who?
- This guy I...

199
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:54,381
ran some stuff into the prison for him.

200
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,617
Some stuff? Like what? Drugs?

201
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:59,568
- Who cares? He paid me.
- You should have quit that job!

202
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:01,874
I know, OK?
I need some cash for my kid.

203
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:03,666
Maricruz doesn't have insurance.

204
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,402
Listen. I just saw Michael.

205
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:09,380
- He's in solitary confinement.
- What?

206
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,424
They put him in a box in the middle
of the yard, all by himself.

207
00:16:12,713 --> 00:16:14,203
He can't do anything.

208
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:17,346
It's going to be okay.

209
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:20,599
It's not going to be okay.
I don't know what to do, man.

210
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:24,981
Everything's just fallen apart.

211
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:31,329
What you lookin' at?

212
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:32,832
The view.

213
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,379
I can't help but notice
you and Lechero made friends.

214
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,026
He's been hanging out
with a lot of white boys lately.

215
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:41,739
- Got a problem with that?
- No, but Sammy does.

216
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:44,080
I've been looking close,
like I always do,

217
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,402
and I know you all would be
a lot better off

218
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:48,210
if Sammy were no longer around.

219
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:52,423
Wouldn't have to worry about his snout
poking in your business.

220
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:56,510
- And you're suggesting?
- We both know it needs to happen.

221
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,804
There aren't many men
who'd take out Sammy.

222
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:02,301
I have one particular man in mind.
A man who owes me.

223
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:05,620
But if I pull through,
I'm in the club, guaranteed.

224
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,296
- You're gonna see to it.
- All right.

225
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:11,734
I assume you have the power
to make this deal.

226
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,899
I do. Agreed.

227
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:21,210
Right. Well,

228
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:23,359
thank you, sir.

229
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:52,474
Look, I've been thinking about
what you told me,

230
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:55,235
- but I can't quit my job.
- Do what you wanna do.

231
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:57,363
I would if you could kick me
a few bucks.

232
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:59,782
This again? I told you.
I don't have any cash.

233
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:02,284
- What do you expect me to do?
- Do what you want.

234
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:05,287
- You could use my help.
- You're gonna charge your friendship?

235
00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:09,234
- I got a kid on the way!
- And I got a kid I may never see again.

236
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:19,011
Yeah, get me Gretchen.

237
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:30,295
Much to my surprise, there seems to be
some degree of truth to your tale.

238
00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:31,775
Everything is true.

239
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:34,273
- That's for me to determine.
- What more can I say?

240
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,674
This inmate.
The one who you've been sent to free.

241
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:40,335
He should be able to verify
what you told me.

242
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,917
He should but...

243
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:44,576
- I don't know if he will.
- Tell me his name.

244
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:51,165
These people'll kill my nephew. Tell me
you'll do everything to find him.

245
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:53,377
- I will but I need a name.
- I need your word.

246
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:56,515
You have it. I'll find the boy.
Now, the name!

247
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:07,345
What's wrong?

248
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:09,347
Why don't you tell me?

249
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:12,429
I went to that apartment,
your apartment.

250
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:15,190
And this woman showed up
like she knew you.

251
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:17,943
And then I found a passport.

252
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:20,863
Who's Gary Miller?

253
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:24,499
That apartment,

254
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:26,614
that passport,

255
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:28,652
it's all for us.

256
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:32,172
It's how we'll get away.

257
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:36,335
When I get out of this place, I'll be
working on a way for us to be together.

258
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:38,455
We always talked about France,
remember?

259
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:40,137
James... Yeah.

260
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:43,854
Our plan to be together.

261
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:47,681
James, how can I believe you?

262
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:50,546
How can I believe anything anymore?

263
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:57,649
And just know,
just know that I love you.

264
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:12,571
You're facing some serious charges.

265
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:17,905
Michael Scofield told me
there are some people out there

266
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:20,797
who are very determined
to get you out of here.

267
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,511
- What's he talking about?
- You know nothing about this?

268
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:29,515
Scofield's a smart man but...

269
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,434
he's got a rabid imagination.

270
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,645
So you're calling him a liar?

271
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:37,893
More or less.

272
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,579
I've been able to verify the story.

273
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:47,432
I already know everything,
Mr. Whistler, in detail.

274
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:49,493
I just need a name.

275
00:20:50,037 --> 00:20:52,087
Who's in charge on the outside?

276
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:55,207
We can end this right now
if you can provide it.

277
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:00,879
What are you talking about?

278
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:25,946
- What's going on here?
<i>- Gracias.</i>

279
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:33,844
Now,

280
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:36,436
start over.

281
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,717
There you are.

282
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:43,057
And here I am,
without my bag of goodies.

283
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:48,218
I was afraid you were gone for good.

284
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,303
Party would not be the same without you.

285
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:54,600
I'm glad you're back
'cause I need a favor.

286
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:59,851
It involves you, a chicken foot
and a man who's got it comin'.

287
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:03,153
What man?

288
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:06,695
You get well
and you get him in that ring,

289
00:22:06,955 --> 00:22:09,156
and you do that one,
that... neck thing.

290
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,951
In exchange, I'm gonna cover
all your medical expenses.

291
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:19,123
You take your time.
I'm gonna go get my bag right now,

292
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:21,084
put you out of this misery.

293
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:23,462
You're the best cock
in the fight, Alex.

294
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:25,172
Please don't let me down.

295
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,095
Maybe now you'll feel more comfortable
telling me the truth.

296
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:36,516
Are you working with Scofield?

297
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:45,067
- Are you working with Scofield?
- Yes! Yes, I'm working with Scofield.

298
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:47,945
But there's no one else involved.

299
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:58,027
As they say in America,

300
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:00,290
we're gonna get this story straight.

301
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,004
I told him the truth.

302
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:04,819
I suggest you do the same.

303
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:07,104
- I have.
- He's confirmed nothing!

304
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,508
Ask him about the woman
he's been meeting with.

305
00:23:13,104 --> 00:23:15,764
- It's not what you think.
- What matters is what you know.

306
00:23:16,024 --> 00:23:19,767
You know her name and the fact that
he won't admit it tells me that he's no

307
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,020
- innocent bystander in this.
- You know I am!

308
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,731
Prove it. 'Cause it's the only way
to get out of here.

309
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,792
Michael, this is suicide.
They'll kill Sofia.

310
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,861
- and your nephew.
- This is the man

311
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:32,538
who can help us, but he can't
without a name, so tell him!

312
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,579
We don't have a choice.

313
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:41,429
It's over.

314
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:46,670
Gretchen Morgan.

315
00:23:56,827 --> 00:24:00,392
I don't know where she lives,
I don't know how you find her.

316
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,610
That's all I know, her name.

317
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:05,913
Gretchen Morgan.

318
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:19,327
Two more of those.

319
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,873
- Uh-uh. I'm gonna get going.
- No, he'll stay.

320
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:25,584
Relax... Fernando, is it?

321
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,795
I just want to talk a minute.

322
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:29,921
Alone.

323
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:34,513
This right here
is as alone as we're gonna get.

324
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:38,945
I heard about your argument
with Lincoln.

325
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:41,659
You people are everywhere, huh?

326
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:44,895
You know him better than I do,
but from personal experience,

327
00:24:45,504 --> 00:24:47,189
Burrows can be hard to handle.

328
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:49,441
That man doesn't like
to be told what to do.

329
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:52,527
He sure likes bossing
everyone else around.

330
00:24:53,015 --> 00:24:55,447
You have to start looking out
for yourself, Fernando.

331
00:24:55,707 --> 00:24:57,434
Level the playing field.

332
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:59,868
All you have to do is go back,
apologize,

333
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:02,751
tell him you'll stay on
a few more days for free.

334
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:06,041
And tomorrow or the day after, I'll call
you and we'll meet for a drink.

335
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:08,327
In exchange, I'll pay.

336
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:09,920
50 grand.

337
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:12,783
I know what you think,
but I'm not asking you to do anything

338
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:15,884
- that doesn't help everyone in the end.
- How is this helping?

339
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,887
Lincoln causes as many
problems as he solves.

340
00:25:19,147 --> 00:25:22,460
He needs to get out of his own way
and I think you can assist him.

341
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,018
I stay one step ahead,
and you get 50 grand.

342
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:31,011
I don't know.

343
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:34,753
I think you do.

344
00:25:44,162 --> 00:25:45,914
Where do I find this Gretchen Morgan?

345
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,085
She's somewhere here in the city.

346
00:25:50,512 --> 00:25:53,713
That's not much help in a city
of 1M people. It could take days, weeks!

347
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:55,674
I told you. I only know her name.

348
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,469
- I have no idea.
- I do.

349
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:01,972
But I'll need to use your phone.

350
00:26:11,032 --> 00:26:13,705
- What phone are you on?
- Just listen to me.

351
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:18,071
I need to know where and when
your next meeting with Susan B is.

352
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:21,616
Garfield-Price building
downtown in an hour. Why?

353
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:24,109
Garfield-Price, one hour.

354
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:28,056
- Can you give her a message for me?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

355
00:26:28,216 --> 00:26:30,292
Tell her everything is going as planned.

356
00:26:30,552 --> 00:26:32,130
What's going on? Why're you...

357
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,795
Just give her the message.

358
00:26:34,055 --> 00:26:35,462
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

359
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:18,955
- You should have listened.
- You gonna throw down a chicken foot

360
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:22,156
- over a puddle of puke?
- You should have mopped.

361
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,775
Stumpy, wait your turn, man.

362
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:40,654
Excuse me.

363
00:27:40,914 --> 00:27:43,073
I wanted to see
<i>Patròn Lechero, por favor.</i>

364
00:27:44,961 --> 00:27:46,618
What you wanna see him about?

365
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:49,468
I got one of these from him,
and I didn't do nothing.

366
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:50,931
He don't listen.

367
00:27:56,604 --> 00:27:59,589
The fight goes on as planned,
after we eat lunch.

368
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:17,857
You issue a fight?

369
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,360
Yeah. What about it?

370
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,987
It's not your right.

371
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:24,083
It's not your place.

372
00:28:25,262 --> 00:28:26,908
Well, maybe it should be.

373
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:43,044
She's arrived?

374
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:44,387
I'm on my way.

375
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:47,376
You'd better be right.

376
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,815
What happened?

377
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:02,992
It worked.

378
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:04,362
It did?

379
00:29:04,622 --> 00:29:07,630
She came to me just like you said
and offered me a bunch of cash

380
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,118
- to talk behind your back.
- So we stick to the plan?

381
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:11,580
- Yeah.
- Cool.

382
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,330
I'm going to see her right now.

383
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,525
It's okay. I came back for you.

384
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:29,888
Come on now,
everything's gonna be okay.

385
00:29:30,148 --> 00:29:31,848
You can't deprive yourself like this.

386
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:34,893
Get out of here.

387
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:36,603
You don't mean that.

388
00:29:36,863 --> 00:29:38,029
Yeah, I do!

389
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:40,565
You're not talking straight!

390
00:29:40,825 --> 00:29:43,198
Withdrawals are the worst way to die.

391
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,283
You're gonna shake and sweat
until you evaporate into nothing!

392
00:29:46,443 --> 00:29:48,944
It's a long bumpy road to hell.
Is that what you want?

393
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:50,654
Or do you wanna live?

394
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:56,081
I'll see you on the other side.

395
00:30:06,285 --> 00:30:09,573
When you're up all night with diarrhea
running down both your legs

396
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:11,388
and vomit is in your hair,

397
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:14,847
don't come crawling back.

398
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:41,418
It's been a long day.
Let's just get this over with.

399
00:30:41,678 --> 00:30:44,963
I got a message from my brother.
Everything's going ahead as planned.

400
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:48,049
Really? I would think you'd be facing
a major setback.

401
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:50,969
You know Michael.
Always has things worked out.

402
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:53,596
No. Seems to me
he keeps screwing things up.

403
00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:55,934
He's getting things done
a lot faster than you.

404
00:30:56,094 --> 00:30:58,143
Whistler's out by tomorrow, all right?

405
00:30:58,403 --> 00:30:59,560
Gretchen Morgan?

406
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:04,253
General Zavala,
Panamanian National Police.

407
00:31:04,413 --> 00:31:06,734
- Come with us, please.
- Why? What's this all about?

408
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:08,863
No, I don't understand. Wait!

409
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:12,323
I had nothing to do with this!
Nothing!

410
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:26,375
You're denying that you are involved
with escape attempts at Sona prison.

411
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,840
I've never been here
before in my life.

412
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,467
And you've never met any
of the men incarcerated here?

413
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:35,430
- No.
- You know what I've been told?

414
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,759
From prisoners? I can only imagine.

415
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,977
I've been told that you are
the mastermind behind a prison escape

416
00:31:41,237 --> 00:31:43,818
and that you've kidnapped a boy
as collateral.

417
00:31:43,978 --> 00:31:44,978
Really?

418
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:47,066
Am I an alien?

419
00:31:47,326 --> 00:31:48,584
Did I shoot JFK?

420
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:52,989
Sir, I have no idea
who this James Wilson...

421
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:54,873
- Whistler!
- ... is!

422
00:31:55,992 --> 00:31:59,692
I'm just here to relax before I have
to go back to another year

423
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:02,874
of teaching social studies
to freshman idiots.

424
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:04,542
You're a tourist here?

425
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,325
No, not a tourist, sir.

426
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:12,550
I like to think of myself
as a "student of life."

427
00:32:13,258 --> 00:32:14,798
"A student of life"?

428
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:23,948
What did he say?

429
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,558
"Turn on the hose."

430
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:10,784
Fight! Fight! Fight!

431
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:24,080
I'm gonna give you one chance.

432
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:28,070
Did you order the escape
from Sona penitentiary?

433
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,561
Yes or no?

434
00:33:57,968 --> 00:33:59,741
You seem concerned for her.

435
00:34:01,592 --> 00:34:04,704
She holds our entire future
in her hands. Yeah, I'm concerned.

436
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:14,399
Yes or no?

437
00:34:25,293 --> 00:34:28,728
You've proven one thing.
This is not your first time.

438
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:41,679
Come with me.

439
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:57,423
Do you know either of these men?

440
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:01,010
- I've never seen them before.
- That's a lie.

441
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,806
- I've never seen them before.
- Where and when have you seen her?

442
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:07,183
She came to see him in visitation,
right?

443
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:11,354
Is this the woman you work for?

444
00:35:12,907 --> 00:35:14,774
Did she order the prison escape?

445
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:19,496
Yes or no?

446
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:24,283
Yes.

447
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,829
All right, all right.

448
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:30,662
- You're the one in charge?
- No.

449
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:34,074
I don't know anything
about a prison escape.

450
00:35:34,438 --> 00:35:36,173
I'm just the baby-sitter.

451
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,529
- I watch the kid.
- Where is he?

452
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,196
Near Paloma. Highway 2.

453
00:35:43,551 --> 00:35:44,637
I can take you.

454
00:35:44,897 --> 00:35:46,514
Take them back to my office.

455
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:49,851
Put the girl back in the car.
We're going on a drive.

456
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,480
Was it you?

457
00:35:56,183 --> 00:35:57,483
Did you kill Sara?

458
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:01,070
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

459
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:06,451
I'm coming for you.

460
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:10,888
Congratulations.

461
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:13,267
You're the regular Buster Douglas,
aren't you?

462
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:14,925
Hey, what is this?

463
00:37:16,462 --> 00:37:18,388
How'd you get that up there?

464
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,998
Right there. The boy's in there.

465
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:40,830
In here?

466
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,107
I'm sorry.

467
00:37:44,273 --> 00:37:45,456
I am so sorry.

468
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:50,932
I hope he's all right.

469
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:20,811
Pick me up. I'm at the shack.

470
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:23,296
Bring towels.

471
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:30,847
Hi, Lincoln.

472
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:39,333
Augusto.

473
00:38:39,826 --> 00:38:41,105
Good to see you.

474
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:43,065
Yeah, thanks for the cigars.

475
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:47,320
- You didn't open the package?
- I didn't get around to it today.

476
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,491
You need to make a choice.

477
00:38:52,843 --> 00:38:54,660
Lechero's days are numbered.

478
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,976
You agree?

479
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,874
Then you know what you need to do.

480
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:02,335
You've done a good job so far.

481
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:05,181
Now is the time to make a move.

482
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,958
Prove yourself.
Go back in and open the package.

483
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:11,489
and open the package.

484
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:45,336
Come on.

485
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:46,552
Let's go.

486
00:39:46,712 --> 00:39:49,798
- What happened to the General?
- He was found dead this morning

487
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:51,304
off Highway 2.

488
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,550
You're going back inside.

489
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,722
I'm sorry to hear that.

490
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:01,227
He seemed like a nice man.

491
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:32,160
What you doing back in?

492
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,719
If you still wanna get out of here,
I need your phone.

493
00:40:39,201 --> 00:40:40,041
Go inside.

494
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:50,883
What?

495
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:52,486
- How's LJ?
- <i>Fine.</i>

496
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:54,488
But ou know what? Susan's not.

497
00:40:54,877 --> 00:40:56,240
He's fine? You sure?

498
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,659
Yeah.
I just got off the phone with him.

499
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:00,828
<i>Why didn't you tell me
what was going on?</i>

500
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:03,294
He could have died
because of what you did.

501
00:41:03,454 --> 00:41:06,604
We still got Whistler.
As long as we do, we're good.

502
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:10,379
I got to go.

503
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:15,826
Hey, did you see <i>blanco</i>?
He's walking around like the landlord.

504
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:18,801
- You said Lechero'd take care of it.
- He will.

505
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:21,727
He keeps saying that.
If you and Lechero want to go around

506
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:24,268
like an old married couple
fighting this way or that...

507
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:27,480
- Maybe you like it in the kitchen.
- You be careful.

508
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,774
Then do something!
Or the next thing you know,

509
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:32,068
you'll be taking orders
from Scofield.

510
00:41:36,992 --> 00:41:39,293
Some people stop at nothing, right?

511
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:43,889
Yeah. I know.

512
00:41:44,757 --> 00:41:46,693
At least we're back inside.

513
00:41:47,058 --> 00:41:48,496
Which of course is...

514
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:51,670
exactly what you wanted. Isn't it?

515
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,632
- What are you talking about?
- You let the fox into the henhouse.

516
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:57,264
The only reason you gave up
Gretchen's name

517
00:41:57,424 --> 00:41:59,887
was so she could come in
and pull you out of the fire.

518
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:01,806
You wanted me to give up her name.

519
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,532
- You know it doesn't end with her.
- Yeah, I do.

520
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:09,939
The question is how do you?

521
00:42:10,642 --> 00:42:14,239
How does a simple fisherman seem to know
so much about the Company?

522
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,936
When she comes back,

523
00:42:16,677 --> 00:42:17,863
and she will...

524
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:22,210
what am I gonna say?

525
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:25,871
You gonna do this or not?

526
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,501
You can tell her the answer is yes.

527
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,812
But once we're out,
I consider you collateral...

528
00:42:35,014 --> 00:42:36,090
nothing more.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
