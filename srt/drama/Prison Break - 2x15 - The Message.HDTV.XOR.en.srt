00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,176
Yes, I'd like the number
Channel 11 News, please.

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,303
Hang up the phone now.

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,096
This is Michael Scofield.

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,474
I'm at the Cutback Motel,
room 11...

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,646
and I want to turn myself in.

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,650
Where is that ?

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,401
It's Holland,

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,570
where I grew up.
You know that.

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,780
It's beautiful.

11
00:00:30,783 --> 00:00:32,570
This message is for Maricruz.

12
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:34,208
I'll be there...

13
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:35,494
in the airport...

14
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:37,623
in Ixtapa waiting for you.

15
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:40,490
My name is Sara,
and I'm an addict.

16
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:42,370
- Hi, Sara.
- Hi, Sara.

17
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:44,292
I'm just looking to do my time,

18
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,963
I don't want any trouble.

19
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,750
Hey !
Break it up, convict !

20
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:50,421
No, this isn't fun...
what was fun was

21
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,761
when Caroline and I
would talk about you

22
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:55,513
and the schoolboy crush
that you had on her

23
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,340
He proposed to her.

24
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:01,060
- Hey ! Terrence ! Terrence !
- I'm leaving !

25
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:03,233
Terrence, listen to me.

26
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:04,481
Just listen.

27
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:07,230
So many people have suffered
because of this, because of you.

28
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:10,441
But when the press get here,
you can tell the truth.

29
00:01:10,827 --> 00:01:12,440
You can end this.

30
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:13,992
Sorry.

31
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,280
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin</i>

32

It's breaking news
out of Cutback, Montana.</i>

Lincoln Burrows

two of the prisoners who broke out
of Fox River State Penitentiary</i>

in Illinois have continued
to allude the authorities,</i>

36
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:33,553
leaving a trail of crime
in their wake.

37
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:36,430
And today, they left behind
something else.</i>

38
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:39,472
<i>My name in
Lincoln Burrows,</i>

39

00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:51,201
- We're done.
- There's no other way t of here.

41
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:52,700
Next time you decide to hold
a press conference,

42
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:54,443
do it from a room
with a back door.

43
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,201
Just let me think.

44

You need to exit
with the hand in the air.

48
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:06,160
This is a warning.

49
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:08,583
Exit

50
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,581
<i>with your hands up.</i>

51
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,210
- What about him ?
- What about him he's useless.

52
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,210
A dead body ?
We got fingerprints everywhere.

53
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,062
Are you worried someone's
gonna pin a murder on you ?

54
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:19,683
So what's your plan ? Leave the body
walk out the front door ?

55
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:20,680
Yes.

56
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:23,361

- Wait a minute, let me see that ID again.

65

- Okay. Okay. Drop the gun !
- Don't do it !

66
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:04,263
Everybody calm down,
and this won't get ugly.

67
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:06,893
All right, you !
I want keys

What's going on ?

00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:14,831
We're gettin'out of here

Welcome back.

79

- Feeling...
- Much better

80
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:50,732
Update ?

81
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,442
Okay, you got it.

82
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:53,523
Yeah.

Get a lead on something ?

84
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,821
One of the CO's from Fox River,
Brad Bullick,

85
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,493
got locked up last night for the murder
of another guard.

86
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:06,071
Wait ! We're looking for CO's now ?
What about the escapees ?

87
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,280
Scofield ?

88
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:09,661
- Burrow ?
- Nothing on'em currently, also

89
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,210
Franklin's wife.

90
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:13,291
was taken into custody
in the North Dakota.

91
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:14,631
His wife ?

92
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,091
This is Agent Mahone.

93
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,723
How long ago ?

94
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:41,531
I'll make you a deal,
if you don't move a muscle,

95
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:44,491
- I won't blow your head off.
- No one's gonna hurt you, Greg.

96
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:46,913
Where are we going, Michael ?
Can't keep driving.

97
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:49,241
We lost Steadman.
Sara's in the wind...

98
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,711
- Turn it up.
<i>- ... Terrence Steadman</i>

<i>President
Reynold's brother,</i>

100
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:54,340
The president could not
be reached for comment

101
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,383
as she continues
to tour the Midwest,

102
00:04:56,428 --> 00:04:58,341
showing up support
in key states

- Pull over.
- What for ?

108
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,150
Just pull over.

109
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:40,040
Get out !

110
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:44,261
You wanna to drop
off this kid ?

111
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:45,470
Later.

112
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,552
We should get rid of Kellerman,
too. We don't need him.

113
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:50,352
Actually, we do.

114
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:52,222
We still have assets.

115
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,151
It's just a question
of how we use them.

116
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:41,360
Nurse !

117
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,610
Nurse.

118
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:48,531
- You ain't no nurse.
- You right about that.

119
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,951
Oh, that's a pretty shiner
you got, Captain.

120
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,552
Must make you think about
all the times you walked around here

121
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:55,662
in your fancy guard outfit,

122
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:58,621
turning a blind eye to everything
you saw that was wrong.

123
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:01,292
"Who me ?
Oh, I didn't see nothing."

124
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:04,461
How that blind eye feel now ?

125
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,051
- You son of a bitch.
- Get used to it.

126
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:10,091
Hear old one-eyed jack's gonna be
getting screwed in the socket.

127
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:13,432
- Over my dead body.
- No.

128
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,933
A dead man can't feel
a beat-down.

129
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:17,981
And you got a lot more
coming your way.

130
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:21,851
Come on now,
let's go.

131
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:57,392
It'll take the feds a while
to figure that out.

132
00:07:57,396 --> 00:07:58,972
What time is it ?

133
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:00,772
A little after 9 :00.

134
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,561
- It's gonna be tight.
- 450 miles

135
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,103
in six hours.
What do you think ?

136
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,650
- Got to move now if we're gonna make it.
- Eyes front.

137
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,243
Hey, look at this.

138
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:18,583
It's perfect.

139
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,250
- You ready ?
- Yep.

140
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:54,241
Bonito campo, no ?

141
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:59,373
Más o menos.

142
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:02,542
Su acento ?

143
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:03,870
De dónde es ?

144
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,710
Puerto Rico.

145
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:11,638
En esta parte de Méjico, no se
encuentran muchos portoriquenses.

146
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:14,634
Está donde llega ?

147
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:19,102
Lejos.

148
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:22,223
Mil millas.

149
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:26,523
Qué es tan importante
llegar a Ixtapa ?

150
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,860
Qué hay allá ?

151
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:32,863
Toda mi vida.

152
00:09:35,537 --> 00:09:37,162
Una mujer.

153
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:42,952
La única mujer.

154
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:50,463
Ojalá esté aquí
cuando yo llegue.

155
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:26,081
Here, Larry, that's for you.

156
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:27,870
What about this ?

157
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,172
Just what is this ?
It's too small

158
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,593
Why didn't it float ?

159
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:34,762
Why didn't it float ?

160
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:36,300
I need more wood.

161
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:37,673
Wood floats.

162
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:39,552
This will work.

163
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,063
Hey, man.

164
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:54,530
We were just wondering
if you could buy us some beer.

165
00:10:58,535 --> 00:10:59,990
Yeah, sure.

166
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,871
Can I get some food
for my dog, too ?

167
00:11:04,877 --> 00:11:06,500
Do whatever thing
you got to do, man.

168
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:08,660
You can even keep
a beer for yourself.

169
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,253
Huh ?

170
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:11,632
Oh, no.

171
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:14,212
My dad used to drink.

172
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:37,693
You're going to
want to see this.

173
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,663
We've shut down every freeway
in central Montana.

174
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,992
So far, no sign of them.

175
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,330
Go wider. Get troopers
on and 90 and 94,

176
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,293
all the way through Wyoming,
and call Whitefish.

177
00:11:48,296 --> 00:11:50,870
Have him lock down the
Canadian border at 15.

178
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,422
<i>My name is
Lincoln Burrows,</i>

179
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,010
<i>and I'm innocent.</i>

180
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,971
I escaped from
Fox River Penitentiary </i>

181
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,892
because I was sentenced
to death for a crime</i>

182
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:08,351
<i>I did not commit.</i>

183
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:10,731
I did not murder
Terrence Steadman</i>

184
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:14,731
He committed suicide last night
in the Cutback Motel</i>

185
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:17,732
30 miles outside of his home
in Blackfoot, Montana.</i>

186
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:20,690
He killed himself
out of fear.</i>

187
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:24,451
Fear of the people who have been hiding
him for the past three years.</i>

188
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:27,742
The same people
who want my brother dead.</i>

189
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,591
They don't want you to know
who they are,</i>

190
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,872
<i>but know this :</i>

191
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,213
<i>They've stolen
billions of dollars</i>

192
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:36,342
and murdered dozens
of innocent people.</i>

193
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:38,711
And yet they plaster
our faces on the news,</i>

194
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:40,711
<i>and tell you
to be afraid.</i>

195
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:42,672
They are a group
of multinationals</i>

196
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:44,222
<i>with corporate
interests.</i>

197
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:46,550
Together, they're known
as The Company.</i>

198
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:49,142
They are working with
the highest levels of government,</i>

199
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:52,062
including the president
of the United States.</i>

200
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,273
Damage control immediately,

201
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,021
before this hits page one.

202
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,902
- It's already airing, sir.
- Start a wildfire in Florida !

203
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,530
Find a lost storage unit
full of Arabs !

204
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:03,320
I do not care !

205
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:05,662
As long as it's not about
Lincoln Burrows !

206
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,453
<i>And they operate
with impunity</i>

207
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,572
- Go !
<i>- under the cover of the Secret Service,</i>

208
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:12,040
<i>the very people
meant to protect</i>

209
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:13,662
<i>and serve.</i>

210
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,022
- Buena suerte.
- Gracias.

211
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:45,323
Este es el final viaje para tí

212
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,913
No hay viajes
gratis aquí, tipo !

213
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:52,160
Lo siento.

214
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,752
No me entiende. Necesito llegar
a Ixtapa, por favor !

215
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,962
Tenemos un problema aquí ?

216
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:14,350
Usted cocina ?

217
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:15,351
Qué ?

218
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:18,311
Yo quito las plumas.
Mi esposa cocinaba.

219
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:20,192
Ella está murta ahorito.

220
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:22,771
Lo siento, jefe.
Tengo que continuar adelante.

221
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:25,363
Ése era el último bus del día.

222
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,032
Si usted cocina,

223
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:31,490
Le voy a dar un lugar donde pueda
dormir esta noche.

224
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:38,921
Espérese, espérese !

225
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,460
Usted vive allí ?

226
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,673
Sí. La puerta détrás del carro.

227
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:49,972
Usted sabe qué ?

228
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,932
.

229
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,393
Venga por aquí !

230
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:59,312
<i>Much blame has
been placed</i>

231
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:01,193
<i>on another
innocent person :</i>

232
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:03,612
<i>Dr. Sara Tancredi.</i>

233
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,240
Do we know how long
the videotape lasts ?

234
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:07,992
26 minutes, beginning to end.

235
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:09,280
It's all online.

236
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,322
I know I can't ask you
for another chance.</i>

237
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:15,122
<i>I can only hope that,
by now,</i>

238
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:17,161
<i>you've found your
safe haven.</i>

239
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:20,672
Start a transcript.
I need every word.

240
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:22,713
<i>... your commitment
to help others,</i>

241
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:24,211
<i>and I put you in a place</i>

242
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,763
<i>that's every
doctor's nightmare.</i>

243
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,513
I wish I could do things
differently...</i>

244
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,433
Call Montana, have them send
an agent to talk to the cameraman.

245
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:34,533
I wanna know what he saw, what he heard, what
they're wearing, anything he can give us.

246
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,933
- --people murdered by government operatives.
- Yeah.

247
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:40,192
One man, Special Agent
Alexander Mahone,</i>

248
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:42,863
<i>is responsible for
multiple deaths.</i>

249
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,822
He murdered not only John Abruzzi
and David Apolskis,</i>

250
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:48,993
but also the last fugitive
he was assigned to chase :</i>

251
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:50,953
<i>a man named
Oscar Shales.</i>

252
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:53,323
A man who escaped from prison
two years ago,</i>

253
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,873
who remains one
of this country's most wanted</i>

254
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,002
despite the fact
he will never be found.</i>

255
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,722
- The guy's nuts.
<i>- He'll do whatever it takes</i>

256
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:03,462
to make the deaths
look official...

257
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:06,303
like they happened in the line
of duty... disappearances,

258
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:11,800
- Hey, thank you.
- Sure. Here you go.

259
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,851
What's the wood for ?

260
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,731
I'm building a raft.

261
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:26,400
I need more wood if I'm going
to make it to Holland.

262
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:27,901
Holland ?

263
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,031
Yeah.

264
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,570
You want to see it ?

265
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:32,861
The raft ?

266
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,911
You're going to try
to get from here

267
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:39,202
to Holland in that ?

268
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:40,370
Uh-huh.

269
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,173
Yeah, good luck, Gilligan.

270
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:45,213
I'm going to take a leak.

271
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,382
How are you going to know
where you're going ?

272
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,423
Do you have, like,
a map or anything ?

273
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:54,050
Yeah.

274
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:55,683
I do.

275
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:58,601
It's-it's right...
It's right...

276
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,101
Oh, it's right here.

277
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:08,862
That's your map ?

278
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,912
I really hope you make it.

279
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,033
You know, every morning,
I wake up and...

280
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:22,120
wonder what it would be like
to just disappear.

281
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,251
And you're just gonna do it.

282
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,092
I think it's great.

283
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:35,340
Okay.

284
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,232
What happened to your arm ?

285
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,911
My dad drinks, too.

286
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,540
What's going on ?

287
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,000
- Oh, nothing.
- No, no. No, no, don't...

288
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:07,621
- Let me go. Let me go !
- I just want to fix it.

289
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:10,090
No, I wanna make...
Stop !

290
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:14,010
Matt, will you take
me home, please ?

291
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,471
No, I...

292
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,220
Freak.

293
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:48,543
All right, now, Brad,

294
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,083
- how we doing ?
- I could be better.

295
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:53,552
Yeah, that's a
nasty contusion, but

296
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:56,173
it should go down
in about 24 hours.

297
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,551
I got your paperwork here for
your transfer back to Gen Pop.

298
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,552
Already ?

299
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:04,390
Move 'em in, move 'em out.
You know the policy.

300
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:06,893
Katie...

301
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,903
You look nice today.

302
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,613
You worked here over
ten years, right ?

303
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:18,862
Something like that.

304
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:22,572
That's a long time
we've been friends.

305
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:24,033
Brad,

306
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:27,253
if you think I can pull some strings
to keep you out of Gen Pop,

307
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:29,253
- I can't do that.
- Please.

308
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:31,080
Please, You can't send me
back there.

309
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,040
Do you want that responsibility,
knowing what they'll do to me ?

310
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:36,380
Just listen, please.
One more night.

311
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,670
Just let me stay here tonight.

312
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,510
I know you can do that.

313
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:43,931
And when you go home,

314
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:47,311
just leave that
door open for me.

315
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,943
They hung a sheet behind their heads
on the wall.

316
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,070
One of them...

317
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:01,113
the guy with the gun...
he found it

318
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:04,373
while Burrows and Scofield were
talking about how far they had to go.

319
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:09,711
Scofield said something
about 450 miles

320
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:11,253
in six hours.

321
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,542
450 miles to where ?

322
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:17,171
I don't know.

323
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,760
450 miles

324
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:22,800
in six hours.
Any point on this...

325
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,141
circle could be
their final destination.

326
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,431
75 miles per hour,

327
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,191
- stopping for gas.
- It's doable.

328
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:33,313
- Yeah.
- Where are they ?

329
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,111
I'm not sure.

330
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,900
I still need more time.

331
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:41,241
This can't happen fast enough,
Mr. Mahone.

332
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:43,280
They've already
done irreparable damage.

333
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:45,700
Scofield made the video
in a storage facility

334
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:47,832
somewhere between
Great Falls and Helena

335
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,952
<i>not long after sunrise.</i>

336
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,463
<i>From there,
the witness said</i>

337
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,250
they had 450 miles

338
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:54,791
to get where they were going.

339
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:57,921
There's Seattle,
Portland, Salt Lake, Denver...

340
00:20:58,385 --> 00:20:59,210
Denver ?

341
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:01,130
Yes. What ?

342
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:03,510
The president is speaking there
this afternoon.

343
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:05,683
3:00.

344
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,802
Six hours from when they made
the video.

345
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,183
They're going after
the president.

346
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:18,073
A tape purported to be made
by escaped convicts</i>

347
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,032
Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield</i>

348
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:22,191
was immediately dismissed
by the Justice Department</i>

349
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:23,861
<i>as entirely baseless,</i>

350
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,082
which brings us back to the story
we'll be continuing</i>

351
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,621
<i>to follow throughout
the day.</i>

352
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:29,831
The terror threat has been raised
to Orange</i>

353
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:32,500
as a storage unit rented
by several Arab Americans</i>

354
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:34,003
<i>was suddenly...</i>

355
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:36,041
They buried it, dumped it off
the front page

356
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,923
- and buried it.
- It's what they do.

357
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:40,461
They can spin it all they want,
it's out there now.

358
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,840
Give it time,

359
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:43,593
the tape is going to work.

360
00:21:43,806 --> 00:21:45,883
This is a Hail Mary, man.
If we don't get to her...

361
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,863
Getting to her is the easy part.
It's what we do after

362
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:50,642
- that's the problem.
- Which is why this has to happen quickly.

363
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:53,522
Once anyone knows we have her,
the curtain comes down.

364
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,452
Well, I'll notify the White House
to cancel...

365
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:00,520
No. If there's any change
to her itinerary,

366
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:01,873
the brothers will know
something's up,

367
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:04,372
- they're gonna go right back into hiding.
- We've found'em before.

368
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:07,661
- we can certainly find them again...
- These are not pets, Agent Wheeler.

369
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:11,910
Yeah, thanks,
I'm pretty clear on that,

370
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:13,721
but if you're going to use
the commander-in-chief

371
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:15,001
as bailt. It's certainly not...

372
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,502
You have a problem with the way
that I do things?

373
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:21,382
Yeah.

374
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,050
And I'm not the only one.

375
00:22:27,188 --> 00:22:28,300
Is that right?

376
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:31,391
Internal Affairs has asked me
to run all your moves

377
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:33,390
through them from here on out.

378
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:48,200
Then get a pen

379
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:51,242
and make sure you get this
word-for-word.

380
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,583
The president's day
does not change.

381
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,923
The only lead we have is that we know
where these men are headed.

382
00:22:57,968 --> 00:23:00,252
So we're gonna keep
quiet about this

383
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:02,462
and let 'em come.

384
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:05,383
Now, get out of my office.

385
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,431
They're two of the most
recognizable faces

386
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,810
in America.

387
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:18,062
How do they think they were going
to get anywhere near the president?

388
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,401
Because it's not just
the two of them anymore.

389
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:23,150
I'm gonna go take a closer
look at that video.

390
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:26,943
If I may, sir, the president...

391
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:31,621
are you certain we should keep
her in the dark on this?

392
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:35,832
Because there is a
scenario where...

393
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,912
she could be useful.

394
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:43,290
It is...

395
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:45,712
her ass on the line, sir.

396
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,020
And I think we're all pretty clear
she's been known to get her hands dirty

397
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:51,130
when that line gets too close.

398
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:55,512
Maybe we should let her know

399
00:23:56,316 --> 00:23:57,811
just how close it is.

400
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:04,113
Viajar sin dinero es dificíil.

401
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:07,732
Cómo le parece el pollo ?

402
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:11,412
El de mi esposa era mejor.

403
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:15,452
Hace cuánto murió ?

404
00:24:16,126 --> 00:24:17,240
Una semana.

405
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:21,670
Lo siento.

406
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,543
Cuánto tiempo duró casado ?

407
00:24:27,806 --> 00:24:29,593
42 años.

408
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:33,933
Cuál es el secreto ?

409
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:36,051
Estás casado ?

410
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:37,600
No.

411
00:24:38,065 --> 00:24:39,432
Pero espero que pronto.

412
00:24:40,316 --> 00:24:42,141
Se necesita mucho
dinero, sabes,

413
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:44,022
el matrimonio, digo.

414
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:47,192
Gracias por el consejo.

415
00:24:51,787 --> 00:24:53,570
Estas huyendo de algo ?

416
00:24:57,415 --> 00:24:59,082
En busca de algo.

417
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,330
Un hombre viviendo
con una esperanza

418
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:07,842
Te dices eso comme si fuera
algo malo

419
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:11,382
Esperanza es para la gente
que vive sin gracia

420
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:18,722
Hay un cuarto.
de atrás, con una cama.

421
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:19,681
Acabó ?

422
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,561
Gracias

423
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:28,770
No. Gracias a tí.

424
00:25:29,616 --> 00:25:33,070
Lo peor que hay es comer solo.
Buenas noches.

425
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,610
They did a good job
masking the room.

426
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:15,532
No reflections, no flares.

427
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:18,491
Audio markers, church bells,
construction, traffic, anything?

428
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,752
The room tone tells us they were
in a large space...

429
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,203
about 100,000 cubic feet.

430
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:25,752
So the kid with the camera...
his story matches up?

431
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:28,213
We clocked the quality of light
with the time of day, and it

432
00:26:28,215 --> 00:26:30,002
pretty much fits
his wheres and whens.

433
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,461
- All right, content.
- The usual tells...

434
00:26:32,637 --> 00:26:34,723
eyes, hands, feet.

435
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,680
Burrows, we were able to baseline him
off the footage from his trial, so

436
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:39,852
<i>we got even more
clarity there.</i>

437
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:41,760
I escaped from
Fox River Penitentiary</i>

438
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,102
because I was sentenced to death
for a crime I did not commit.</i>

439
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,521
I did not murder
Terrence Steadman.</i>

440
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,600
Okay, there.

441
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:50,230
The eyes.

442
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,532
- See it?
- Yeah, slight shift to the left, then up.

443
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,363
Yeah, blink rate's up here
versus the pattern.

444
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:58,163
<i>He committed
suicide last night</i>

445
00:26:58,165 --> 00:26:59,742
<i>in the Cutback Motel,</i>

446
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:01,282
<i>30 miles outside
from this home</i>

447
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:03,123
<i>in Blackfoot, Montana.</i>

448
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,872
He's lying.

449
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,291
Seems so.

450
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,710
Okay, here,

451
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:14,001
Burrows, arms folded.

452
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,761
He's protecting himself.

453
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:18,603
- We'll do whatever it takes...
- Not a lot of confidence in these words.

454
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,553
...like they happen
in the line of duty.</i>

455
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:23,433
Okay, that means something
other than what he's saying.

456
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:26,932
- Like our father Aldo Burrows...
- Posture, shoulders in,

457
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,310
for emphasis.

458
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,720
- Really wants your attention here.
<i>- Our attorney, Veronica Donovan...</i>

459
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:34,040
- I was on the phone when they shot her
- Right there.

460
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:35,692
- like an animal.
- Adam's apple.

461
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:36,822
Zoom in, zoom in.

462
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:39,702
- What is he saying ?
- He's swallowing. ######

463
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:41,413
- That's a lie.
- Yeah.

464
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:43,452
His behavior is textbook.

465
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:46,413
If there's anything in here about
what they plan on doing in Denver,

466
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,700
they're gonna tell us.

467
00:27:51,178 --> 00:27:53,923
If you say it that way,
it plays too earnest.

468
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:55,250
'Course it will--
it's the truth.

469
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,630
Okay, but the truth sends them home
to the wife and kids.

470
00:27:57,637 --> 00:27:59,303
Lies will keep them busy.

471
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,510
I'm not telling a lie
to the whole country.

472
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:04,761
- It's our one chance to say it out...
- Yeah, say whatever the hell you want...

473
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,603
tell them you're the Green Lantern...
but I know how they break down these tapes.

474
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:09,810
I've done it.

475
00:28:10,197 --> 00:28:12,401
Every detail matters.

476
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:14,442
Bin Laden crosses his legs...
right over left...

477
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:17,071
tells us something completely
different than left over right.

478
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:20,072
- It's not the same message.
- To them, it is.

479
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:23,701
If you want this plan to work,
whatever you say with your mouths,

480
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:26,161
you need to be saying something
different with your bodies

481
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,082
- and your eyes.
- Slightly up and to the left.

482
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:32,881
Yes.

483
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,293
Much blame has been placed

484
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:38,230
- on another innocent person...
- President's motorcade is rolling in.

485
00:28:38,265 --> 00:28:40,020
- So far no sign of the brothers.
- Right there.

486
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:42,181
What's Scofield doing
with his hand?

487
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:45,552
We've been throwing them
a bunch of fast balls.

488
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:47,311
What do you say
we mix it up a little?

489
00:28:47,317 --> 00:28:48,472
Like what?

490
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:52,142
- We think it's Morse code.
- For what?

491
00:28:52,145 --> 00:28:54,521
Right now we've got a phrase,

492
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,480
"The water is warm."

493
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:58,193
Any idea what that might mean?

494
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,861
What the hell does that mean?

495
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:01,113
Nothing.

496
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,611
But it'll take the Feds a while
to figure that out.

497
00:29:03,615 --> 00:29:05,573
We have teams checking
the surrounding counties

498
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:07,282
for the water temps.

499
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,751
It might be a message
to an accomplice.

500
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:14,890
The North Platte river runs through
the city. Maybe they're trying to use...

501
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:17,881
It doesn't mean anything. He's traveling
with an ex-Secret Service guy.

502
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:20,723
I'm guessing they're spoon-feeding us
every lead they want us to follow.

503
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:23,800
So all this is just a distraction
while they go after the president?

504
00:29:23,806 --> 00:29:25,611
They had to know the tape
would be discredited.

505
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:27,802
They had to know that we'd talk
to the cameraman.

506
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:30,943
- There's something else going on.
<i>- Much blame has been placed...</i>

507
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:33,020
<i>on another
innocent person,</i>

508
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:35,520
<i>Dr. Sara Tancredi.</i>

509
00:29:36,986 --> 00:29:38,733
<i>Sara, if
you're listening,</i>

510
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:41,530
I know I can't ask you
for another chance.</i>

511
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,532
I only hope by now you've found
your safe haven.</i>

512
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:46,993
<i>I took advantage of you,</i>

513
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:49,162
<i>of your commitment
to help others</i>

514
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:52,330
and put your in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

515
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:55,213
<i>Sara, if
you're listening,</i>

516
00:29:55,216 --> 00:29:57,460
I know I can't ask you
for another chance.</i>

517
00:29:57,468 --> 00:30:00,342
I only hope by now you've found
your safe haven.</i>

518
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,761
<i>I took advantage of you,</i>

519
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:04,932
<i>of your commitment
to help others</i>

520

521
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:10,390
<i>of your commitment
to help others</i>

522
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:13,142
and put your in a place

523
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:15,942
I've considered many ways
to apologize,</i>

524
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,942
<i>but I must
arrive at one.</i>

525
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:20,481
There's more of the same here.

526
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:22,732
Body language, his tells...

527
00:30:22,998 --> 00:30:25,000
If you ask me, it doesn't look like
he means this at all.

528
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:26,830
I don't care what it looks like.
Play it again.

529
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,823
- I don't see...
- Play it again.

530
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:34,412
I only hope by now you've found
your safe haven.</i>

531
00:30:35,086 --> 00:30:36,752
<i>I took advantage of you,</i>

532
00:30:36,758 --> 00:30:38,881
<i>of your commitment
to help others</i>

533
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:41,380
and put your in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

534
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:43,421
His voice... would you say
he sounds sincere

535
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:46,551
when he's talking to her as opposed to
when he's talking about their crimes?

536
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:48,682
- I... I guess you could say that.
I-  did say that.

537
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:50,260
Would you say that?

538
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:53,353
- but it's too late for that now.
- Yeah.

539
00:30:53,357 --> 00:30:54,682
<i>It's too late for you</i>

540
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:56,351
<i>and for others.</i>

541
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,952
- People murdered by government operatives...
- This isn't about Terrence Steadman,

542
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:01,020
and it's not about
their innocence.

543
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,082
What do you mean ?
They're not going after the president,

544
00:31:02,117 --> 00:31:04,202
They're not going after the president,
they're going after the doctor.

545
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:06,780
I want everything we've got
on Sara Tancredi...

546
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:08,450
friends, families, pen-pals.

547
00:31:08,456 --> 00:31:10,530
If anybody so much as wrote her
a thank-you note,

548
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,452
I want to know where the hell
they are now !

549
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,730
Adónde lo ha encontrado ?

550
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:45,150
Hallé fuera al pueble.
Llegando al sur por el camino 15

551
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:48,153
Reconocimos tu coche,
pero no a él

552
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:51,821
Yo veo

553
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,450
Me alegro que lo trayeron
para atrás

554
00:31:59,046 --> 00:32:02,131
No tuve chansa de darle dinero
para la gasolina.

555
00:32:03,217 --> 00:32:06,000
En se le prestase el coche

556
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:07,513
Sî.

557
00:32:19,778 --> 00:32:22,603
Puedo mandar un oficial
para que te traigan el coche ?

558
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:25,230
No se preocupe.
No es lejos.

559
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:26,940
Él puede caminar.

560
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,401
Gracias. Buenas Noches.

561
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:45,791
Yo...

562
00:32:49,307 --> 00:32:51,130
Encuentra tu muchacha.

563
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:54,470
Después, encuentra
la gracia de Diós.

564
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,032
Sara Tancredi.

565
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,321
Dad dead, mom dead.

566
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:16,910
E-mail account shows a minimal list
of contacts with very little activity.

567
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,373
Credit cards used mostly
for groceries,

568
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:22,923
sporadic clothing shopping
and, uh,

569
00:33:22,928 --> 00:33:24,750
the purchase
of single movie tickets.

570
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:26,790
And ob-gyn records tell us
she's had

571
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,302
very little in the way
of sexual relationship recently.

572
00:33:29,347 --> 00:33:32,382
To tell you the truth, I would say
the bulk of her life was her work.

573
00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:52,740
Excuse me, sir,
where are you going ?

574
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:12,802
Apparently, we took
out a janitor.

575
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:16,091
When it all comes down,
all of this will get cleared up.

576
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:18,182
Well, it ain't coming down
if we don't get Sara.

577
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:19,432
She'll be here.

578
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:22,271
I want to speak to my brother.

579
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:29,770
We got to start thinking about
what to do if she doesn't show.

580
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:32,033
Or if she does.

581
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,783
What if the only reason
this guy's helping us

582
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:38,032
is to get whatever
information Sara has ?

583
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,581
What if this is just
one giant setup ?

584
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:55,303
Well, good night.

585
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:13,320
It's about time you come home.

586
00:35:15,576 --> 00:35:17,951
Been out with that
Feytek boy again ?

587
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:20,572
- Sasha.
- No.

588
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:22,990
You may look like me...

589
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,661
but you take after your mom

590
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,922
when it comes to boys,
now, don't you ?

591
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,880
Hopefully, with a
little better taste.

592
00:35:32,678 --> 00:35:35,633
Damn it, girl, you are gonna
show me some respect.

593
00:35:51,278 --> 00:35:54,403
- I know Sara didn't have many friends.
- She's sort of a loner.

594
00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:56,113
But you were her friend.

595
00:35:56,118 --> 00:35:58,071
Yeah. I like to
to think so, yes.

596
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:00,663
And you have no idea
where she is now ?

597
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:02,283
No.

598
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:05,740
This is a transcript of
the Scofield-Burrows videotape.

599
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:09,040
I highlighted the part where
he talks directly to Sara.

600
00:36:10,428 --> 00:36:12,083
Mean anything to you ?

601
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:13,883
No.

602
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:16,920
You have no idea where
she might meet him, if...

603
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,511
that's his plan ?

604
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:20,593
No.

605
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:25,311
Is Brad Bellick still here
in the infirmary ?

606
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:28,643
- Yeah. Why ?
- You must be loving this.

607
00:36:31,027 --> 00:36:33,111
I didn't drive
all this way to gloat.

608
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:35,613
Well, then what the hell
you come here for ?

609
00:36:39,248 --> 00:36:40,783
First, I really...

610
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:42,530
got to tip my cap to you.

611
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:45,492
You've managed to draw a bead on
the convicts more often than my own staff.

612
00:36:45,498 --> 00:36:47,292
Well, thanks
for the "attaboy," but...

613
00:36:47,295 --> 00:36:51,290
as you can see, the correctional system
doesn't share your gratitude.

614
00:36:52,216 --> 00:36:54,840
I won't take much of your time,
but I do have a few questions.

615
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:56,673
- About...?
- Sara Tancredi.

616
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:59,671
She listed you as a reference on
her job application to work here.

617
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,343
You know her well ?

618
00:37:02,765 --> 00:37:04,930
I'd know her a lot better if
you can get my ass

619
00:37:04,937 --> 00:37:07,560
moved to Ad Seg.

620
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:11,771
I have no influence with the D.O.C....
you know that

621
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:14,770
If you want my help, you do.

622
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:18,731
I'll talk to the warden
and see what I can do...

623
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,860
right after you give me
some answers.

624
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:23,912
Scofield likes to communicate
with Sara via coded message.

625
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,332
Do you recognize
anything here ?

626
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,750
Anything that he may be trying
to tell her ?

627
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:32,872
No. I mean, he's saying
he's sorry.

628
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,752
Not that that's gonna do any good
with Dr. Cold Shoulder.

629
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:38,801
But...

630
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:41,131
What ?

631
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,221
Ad Seg.

632
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,023
Yeah.

633
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,692
All right, you see here,

634
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,980
it says this stuff
about "another chance."

635
00:37:57,987 --> 00:37:59,400
"Safe haven".

636
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:02,283
- That's out of the big book.
- What big book ?

637
00:38:02,288 --> 00:38:05,362
Alcoholics Anonymous.
Sara's in recovery.

638
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:06,992
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

639
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:08,991
Those are the names
of some of the chapters

640
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,252
in the book they use in AA.

641
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:14,083
Do you have a copy of
the Alcoholics Anonymous book ?

642
00:38:16,508 --> 00:38:18,501
<i>Sara, if
you're listening,</i>

643
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,173
I know I can't ask you
for another chance.</i>

644
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:29,760
I can only hope by now
you've found your safe haven.</i>

645
00:38:33,526 --> 00:38:34,981
<i>I took advantage of you,</i>

646
00:38:34,986 --> 00:38:36,811
<i>of your commitment
to help others</i>

647
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:41,403
and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.</i>

648
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:46,752
<i>I've considered many
ways to apologize,</i>

649
00:38:46,787 --> 00:38:49,122
<i>but I must
arrive at one.</i>

650
00:38:53,588 --> 00:38:55,410
- It's getting late.
- I know.

651
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:57,170
She's not here.

652
00:38:57,506 --> 00:38:59,042
I know that, too.

653
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:02,750
There is a chance
she didn't get the message.

654
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,633
Or maybe she's just sick
of all this.

655
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:07,220
The girl bailed on you
back in Gila.

656
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:10,183
What makes you think she's gonna
come running back now ?

657
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:14,020
The same thing that's been keeping us
going for the last three months :

658
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:16,643
- faith.
- Yeah, well...

659
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:19,270
reality's kicking
faith's ass, man.

660
00:39:20,116 --> 00:39:21,693
- Look...
- Wait, wait.

661
00:39:21,946 --> 00:39:22,773
Wait ?

662
00:39:22,776 --> 00:39:25,191
Man, we can't wait anymore.
Listen, listen

663
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,242
<i>Once again,
Michael Crane...</i>

664
00:39:28,537 --> 00:39:30,283
<i>please report to
the front desk.</i>

665
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:32,331
<i>You have a
telephone call.</i>

666
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:35,540
Yeah. Sara Tancredi.

667
00:39:36,086 --> 00:39:38,000
That's right. She might be
with them now. Just...

668
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,460
Yes ! Just call
the local police in Akron

669
00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:42,173
and tell them to get
everyone they have

670
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:44,300
over to St.
Thomas Hospital now.

671
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:51,010
Michael Crane. I think
you have a call for me.

672
00:39:52,645 --> 00:39:54,140
Here you go.

673
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,272
Thank you.

674
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:01,772
This is Mr. Crane.

675
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:04,573
It sounded better
than "Origami."

676
00:40:05,198 --> 00:40:07,862
Even if you got the message,
I wasn't sure you'd respond.

677
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:11,453
I couldn't get to you in time.
This is the only thing I could think of.

678
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:14,743
I swore I'd leave you alone,

679
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:16,910
but I had to contact you.

680
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,003
Because I have something ?

681
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:21,631
How'd you know ?

682
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:25,381
Michael, back in Gila
I was coming back to you.</i>

683
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:30,431
Somebody... grabbed me,
and they, um,

684
00:40:31,186 --> 00:40:33,683
they told me
that my father had given me something.

685
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:35,143
Did someone hurt you ?

686
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:37,433
<i>I-I got away.</i>

687
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:44,060
Michael, I want for
this to be over.

688
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:48,532
That makes two of us.

689
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:51,111
Do you think that's possible ?

690
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:55,081
With your help, yes.

691
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:58,162
It's just a question of looking at
whatever it is your father gave you.

692
00:40:58,628 --> 00:40:59,793
It's just...

693
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:03,541
It's just a key.

694
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:05,842
Well, we'll figure it out.

695
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:07,881
Together.

696
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,342
I like the sound of that.

697
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,141
Me, too.

698
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,783
<i>Hello, Paul.</i>

699
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:41,832
Madam President,
it's been a while.

700
00:41:42,008 --> 00:41:43,001
<i>I know.</i>

701
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:45,500
<i>I'm calling
to apologize.</i>

702
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:47,880
Okay.

703
00:41:49,555 --> 00:41:50,923
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

704
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:53,090
<i>It all just got
away from me,</i>

705
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,142
and I ended up hurting
the one person</i>

706
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:57,552
<i>who's always been
at my side.</i>

707
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:59,851
<i>I want you to
come home, Paul.</i>

708
00:41:59,857 --> 00:42:01,730
<i>We can fix
this together.</i>

709
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:03,562
<i>But not with
those brothers</i>

710
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:06,443
running around the country
tearing down the very office</i>

711
00:42:06,446 --> 00:42:07,942
<i>you helped me build.</i>

712
00:42:09,618 --> 00:42:12,742
- Caroline...
<i>- I want to make it up to you.</i>

713
00:42:12,955 --> 00:42:14,783
<i>Please, bring
them in, Paul,</i>

714
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:17,490
Paul, and everything
can go back to the way it was.</i>

715
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:25,001
I have to go now.
I'll see you soon.</i>

716
00:42:33,266 --> 00:42:34,593
Did you talk to Sara ?

717
00:42:36,646 --> 00:42:38,801
In a few days,
this should all be over,

718
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:40,350
one way or another.

719
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:44,270
Absolutely.

720
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:51,573
