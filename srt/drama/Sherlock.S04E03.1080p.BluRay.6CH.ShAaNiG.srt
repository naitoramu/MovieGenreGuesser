1
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,601
Mummy?

2
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,291
Mummy.

3
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,010
Wake up! Wake up!

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,281
Mummy!

5
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,808
- Wake up.

6
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,966
Help me, please.

7
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,202
I'm on a plane. Everyone's asleep.

8
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,361
Help me.

9
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,569
<i>Hello.
My name is Jim Moriarty.</i>

10
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,009
<i>Welcome to the final problem.</i>

11
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,370
<i>You know I could arrest you.</i>

12
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,522
<i>- What for?
- Wearing a dress like that.</i>

13
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,965
<i>Would you like me to take it off?</i>

14
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,724
<i>Then I'd really have to press charges.</i>

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,847
<i>Press away.</i>

16
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,446
<i>- Isn't that how they got started?</i>

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,971
<i>Who?
Adam and Eve.</i>

18
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,208
<i>Oh, them.
And that turned out okay.</i>

19
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,441
<i>You think so?</i>

20
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,404
<i>I thought it was supposed to be
the beginning of all human misery.</i>

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,208
<i>Now, what was all that about arresting me?</i>

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,930
<i>Well, maybe not arresting you.</i>

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,126
<i>- No?
- I could just keep you</i>

24
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,685
<i>under close watch.</i>

25
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,807
<i>- Very close?</i>

26
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,967
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,890
<i>Shame, I was looking forward
to putting myself</i>

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,724
<i>into the hands of the authorities.</i>

29
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,087
<i>- You were?
- Fingerprinting.</i>

30
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,921
<i>Being searched.</i>

31
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,487
<i>Thoroughly.</i>

32
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,810
Mycroft.

33
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,284
Mycroft.

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,650
Why don't you come out and show yourself?

35
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,051
I don't have time for this.

36
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,407
We have time, brother dear.

37
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,804
All the time in the world.

38
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,368
Mycroft.

39
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,441
Who are you?

40
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,608
You know who.

41
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,561
Impossible.

42
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,731
- Nothing's impossible.

43
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,723
You of all people know that.

44
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,969
Coming to get you.

45
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,291
- There's an east wind coming, Mycroft.

46
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,606
Coming to get you.

47
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,848
You can't have got out! You can't!

48
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,842
- No use, Mycroft.

49
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,843
There's no defense and nowhere to hide.

50
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,566
Sherlock.

51
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,801
Help me.

52
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,360
Experiment complete.

53
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,641
Conclusion,

54
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,207
I have a sister.

55
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,565
This was you? All of this was you?

56
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,687
Conclusion two.

57
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,361
My sister, Eurus, apparently,
has been incarcerated from an early age

58
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,801
in a secure institution
controlled by my brother.

59
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,211
Hey, bro.

60
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,688
Why would you do this...
This pantomime? Why?

61
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,371
Conclusion three.
You are terrified of her.

62
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,087
You have no idea
what you're dealing with. None at all.

63
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,640
New information, she's out.

64
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,285
That's not possible.

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,850
It's more than possible,
she was John's therapist.

66
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,649
Shot me during a session.

67
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,449
- Only with a tranquilizer.
- Mmm.

68
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,766
Still had 10 minutes to go.

69
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,251
Well, we'll see about a refund.

70
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,448
Right, you two,
Wiggins has got your money by the gate,

71
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,921
- don't spend it all in one crack den.

72
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,001
Oh, I hope we didn't spoil
your enjoyment of the movie.

73
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,161
You're just leaving?

74
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,601
Oh, we're not staying here,
Eurus is coming and, uh,

75
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,682
someone's disabled all your security.

76
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,681
Sleep well!

77
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,525
Dr. Watson, why would he do that to me?

78
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,204
- That was insane.
- Uh, yes.

79
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,567
Well, someone convinced him
that you wouldn't tell the truth

80
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,409
unless you were actually wetting yourself.

81
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,201
"Someone"?

82
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,927
Probably me.

83
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,168
So that's it, is it? You're just going.

84
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,526
Well, don't worry.

85
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,442
There's a place for people like you,
the desperate, the terrified,

86
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,727
the ones with nowhere else to run.

87
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,805
What place?

88
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,045
221 B Baker Street.

89
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,561
See you in the morning.

90
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,086
If there's a queue, join it.

91
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,682
For God's sake,
this is not one of your idiot cases.

92
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,603
You might wanna close that window.

93
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,244
There is an east wind coming.

94
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,530
You have to sit in the chair.

95
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,648
They won't talk to you
unless you sit in the chair,

96
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,886
it's the rules.

97
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,088
- I'm not a client.
- Then get out.

98
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,285
She's not gonna stay there, is she?

99
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,649
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- Thank you.

100
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,485
The kettle's over there.

101
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,851
So what happens now?
Are you going to make deductions?

102
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,886
You're gonna tell the truth, Mycroft,
pure and simple.

103
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,247
Who was it said, "Truth is rarely pure
and never simple"?

104
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,084
I don't know and I don't care.

105
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,366
So there were three of us.

106
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,040
I know that now.

107
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,963
You, me...

108
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,682
And Eurus.

109
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,042
A sister I can't remember.

110
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,209
Interesting name, Eurus.

111
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,810
It's Greek, isn't it?

112
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,123
Mmm, yeah, uh, literally,
the god of the east wind.

113
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,047
Yes.

114
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,323
"The east wind is coming, Sherlock."

115
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,083
- You used that to scare me.
- No.

116
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,209
You turned my sister into a ghost story.

117
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,446
Of course I didn't.

118
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,807
- I monitored you.
- You what?

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,925
Memories can resurface.
Wounds can reopen.

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,368
The roads we walk have demons beneath.

121
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,368
And yours have been waiting
for a very long time.

122
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,606
I never bullied you.

123
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,129
I used, at discrete intervals,
potential trigger words to update myself

124
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,680
as to your mental condition.
I was looking after you.

125
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,684
Why can't I remember her?

126
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,366
- This is a private matter.
- John stays.

127
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,726
This is family.

128
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,047
That's why he stays!

129
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,291
So there were three Holmes kids.

130
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,486
What was the age gap?

131
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,804
Seven years between myself and Sherlock,
one year between Sherlock and Eurus.

132
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,370
Middle child. Explains a lot.

133
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,406
So, did she have it too?

134
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,927
- Have what?
- The deduction thing.

135
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,565
"The deduction thing"?

136
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,722
- Yes.
- More than you can know.

137
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,246
Enlighten me.

138
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,087
- You realize I'm the smart one.
- As you never cease to announce.

139
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,290
But Eurus, she was incandescent, even then.

140
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,689
Our abilities were
professionally assessed more than once.

141
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,728
I was remarkable.

142
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,807
But Eurus was described as an
era-defining genius beyond Newton.

143
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,241
Then why don't I remember her?

144
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,891
You do remember her, in a way.

145
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,282
Every choice you've ever made,
every path you've ever taken,

146
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,243
the man you are today,

147
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,768
is your memory of Eurus.

148
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,161
<i>She was different from the beginning.</i>

149
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,806
She knew things
she should never have known,

150
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,808
as if she were somehow aware of truths
beyond the normal scope.

151
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,365
You look funny grown up.

152
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,329
- What's wrong?
- Sorry.

153
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,810
The memories are disturbing.

154
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,325
What do you mean? Examples.

155
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,087
They found her with a knife once.

156
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,321
She seemed to be cutting herself.

157
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,569
Mother and Father were terrified.
They thought it was a suicide attempt.

158
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,450
But when I asked Eurus
what she was doing, she said...

159
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,922
I wanted to see how my muscles worked.

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,081
Jesus!

161
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,288
So I asked her if she felt pain.

162
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,646
And she said...

163
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,324
Which one's pain?

164
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,361
Then what happened?

165
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,811
Musgrave.

166
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,849
<i>The ancestral home
where there was always honey for tea.</i>

167
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,651
<i>And Sherlock played
among the funny gravestones.</i>

168
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,046
 Funny how?

169
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,570
Come on, you lot.

170
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,490
<i>They weren't real.
The dates were all wrong,</i>

171
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,410
<i>an architectural joke
which fascinated Sherlock.</i>

172
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,162
<i>♪ Who will find me?</i>

178
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,441
And under we go.

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,571
- You're starting to remember.
- Fragments.

180
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,444
Redbeard!

181
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,045
Redbeard!

182
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,326
<i>Redbeard?</i>

183
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,447
<i>He was my dog.</i>

184
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,046
<i>Eurus took Redbeard and locked him up</i>

185
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,565
<i>somewhere no one could find him.</i>

186
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,721
Redbeard!

187
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,404
<i>And she refused to say where he was.</i>

188
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,771
Redbeard!

189
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,290
She'd only repeat that song.

190
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,328
Her little ritual.

191
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,169
- Redbeard!
- We begged and begged her

192
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,890
to tell us where he was.

193
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,527
<i>She said...</i>

194
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,444
<i>The song is the answer.</i>

195
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,801
But the song made no sense.

196
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,566
<i>♪ Brother,
And under we go ♪</i>

197
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,366
What happened to Redbeard?

198
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,646
We never found him.

199
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,169
But she started calling him
"drowned Redbeard,"

200
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,242
so we made our assumptions.

201
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,482
Sherlock was traumatized.

202
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,849
Natural, I suppose. He was,
in the early days, an emotional child.

203
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,163
But after that he was different,
as though he'd changed.

204
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,129
Never spoke of it again.

205
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,007
In time, he seemed to forget
that Eurus had ever even existed.

206
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,003
How could he forget?
She was living in the same house.

207
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,286
No.

208
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,647
They took her away.

209
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,161
Why?

210
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,802
You don't lock up a child
because a dog goes missing.

211
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,365
Quite so.

212
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,122
It was what happened
immediately afterwards.

213
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,009
She knows where he is.

214
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,489
We can't make her tell us.
We can't make her do anything!

215
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,961
After that, our sister
had to be taken away.

216
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,241
Where?

217
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,564
Oh, some suitable place,
or so everyone thought.

218
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,409
Not suitable enough, however.

219
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,369
- She died there.
- How?

220
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,848
She started another fire,
one which she did not survive.

221
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,207
This is a lie.

222
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,166
Yes.

223
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,730
It is also a kindness.

224
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,404
This is the story I told our parents
to spare them further pain

225
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,091
and to account for the absence
of an identifiable body.

226
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,162
And no doubt to prevent
their further interference.

227
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,049
That too, of course.

228
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,165
The depth of Eurus's psychosis
and the extent of her abilities

229
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,443
couldn't hope to be contained
in any ordinary institution.

230
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,008
Uncle Rudi took care of things.

231
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,691
Where is she, Mycroft?
Where is our sister?

232
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,051
There's a place called Sherrinford,
an island.

233
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,725
It's a secure and very secret installation

234
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,522
whose sole purpose is to contain
what we call "The Uncontainables."

235
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,524
<i>- The demons beneath the road,</i>

236
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,051
<i>this is where we trap them.</i>

237
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,405
<i>Sherrinford is more than a prison,
or an asylum.</i>

238
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,769
It is a fortress
built to keep the rest of the world safe

239
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,291
from what is inside it.

240
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,446
Heaven may be a fantasy
for the credulous and the afraid.

241
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,720
But I can give you
a map reference for hell.

242
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,161
That's where our sister has been
since early childhood.

243
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,402
She hasn't left, not for a single day.

244
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,087
Whoever you both met,
it can't have been her.

- Keep as still as you can.
- What is it?

251
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,086
It's a drone.

252
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,966
Yeah, I can see that.
What's it carrying?

253
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,329
<i>What's that silver thing
on top of it, Mycroft?</i>

254
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,249
It's a DX-707.

255
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,971
I've authorized the purchase
of quite a number of these.

256
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,771
Colloquially it is known
as the "patience grenade."

257
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,327
"Patience"?

258
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,888
- The motion sensor is activated.

259
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,611
If any of us move,
the grenade will detonate.

260
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,603
- How powerful?
- It'll certainly destroy

261
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,920
this flat and kill anyone in it.

262
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,446
Assuming walls of reasonable strength,
your neighbors should be safe,

263
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,124
but as it's landed on the floor,

264
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,771
I am moved to wonder
if the cafe below is open.

265
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,126
It's Sunday morning,

266
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,487
- so it's closed.
- What about Mrs. Hudson?

267
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,207
Going by her usual routine,

268
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,004
I estimate she
has another two minutes left.

269
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,969
She keeps her vacuum cleaner
at the back of the flat.

270
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,087
So?

271
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,891
So, safer there,
when she's putting it away.

272
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,651
But we have to move eventually.
We should do it when she's safest.

273
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,410
When the vacuum stops,
we give her eight seconds

274
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,767
to get to the back of the flat.
She's fast when she's cleaning.

275
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,887
Then we move.

276
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,403
What's the trigger response time?

277
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,931
Once we're mobile,
how long before detonation?

278
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,685
We have a maximum of three seconds
to vacate the blast radius.

279
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,604
John and I will take the windows,
you take the stairs.

280
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,045
Help get Mrs. Hudson out, too.

281
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,446
- Me?
- You're closer.

282
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,601
You're faster.

283
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,682
Speed differential won't be
as critical as the distance.

284
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,691
Yes. Agreed.

285
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,921
She's further away.

286
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,286
She's moving to the back.

287
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,850
I estimate we have a minute left.

288
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,686
Is a phone call possible?

289
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,807
Phone call?

290
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,360
John has a daughter.
He may wish to say goodbye.

291
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,360
I'm sorry, Dr. Watson,

292
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,284
any movement will set off
the grenade. I hope you understand.

293
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,921
Oscar Wilde.

294
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,205
- What?
- He said, "The truth is rarely pure

295
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,611
"and never simple."

296
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,247
It's from <i>The Importance of Being Earnest.</i>
We did it in school.

297
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,724
So did we, now I recall.

298
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,291
I was Lady Bracknell.

299
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,448
Yeah. You were great.

300
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,561
You really think so?

301
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,926
Yes, I really do.

302
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,485
Well, it's good to know.

303
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,481
I've always wondered.

304
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,560
Good luck, boys.

305
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,971
Three, two, one.

306
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,566
Go!

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,044

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,202

Nah!

312

Thank God!

313
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,964
Usually it's much worse.

314
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,483
I might go and work in a bank.

315

Nah. Not in this weather.

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,801
Just forget about it.

326
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,562
- Yeah, but we've never... It's never...
- Shh.

327
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,161
Who the hell are you?

328
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,925
- My name's Sherlock Holmes.
- The detective.

329
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,006
The pirate.

330
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,011
Golf, whisky, x-ray,

331
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,924
this is a restricted area.
Repeat, restricted area.

332
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,883
You are off course. Are you receiving?

333
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,084
Golf, whisky, x-ray, you are off course.
Are you receiving?

334
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,281
<i>Yeah, receiving you.</i>

335
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,842
<i>This is a distress call. Repeat,
distress call, we're in trouble here.</i>

336
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,400
Golf, whisky, x-ray,
what is your situation?

337
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,090
Golf, whisky, x-ray? Where are you now?

338
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,801
<i>We're headed for the rocks.
We 're going to hit!</i>

339
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,080
- Governor to the control room.
<i>- Lockdown in progress.</i>

340
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,449
<i>Lockdown in progress.</i>

341
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:54,400
<i>Please proceed to designated red stations.</i>

342
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,727
Hold it! Wait, wait, wait!

343
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,925
In the sand!

344
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,131
In the sand!

345
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,244
I need to speak to Mycroft.

346
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,045
He's in hospital,
there was an explosion.

347
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,281
Put me through to the hospital.

348
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,091
He's not conscious.
He's severely injured.

349
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,041
No one is even confident
he's going to pull through.

350
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,009
Where is his brother?
Where's Sherlock Holmes?

351
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,680
Missing.

352
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,762
No, he's not. He's here.

353
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,683
Sir, we found two more from the boat.

354
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,129
<i>He stole our boat!
Him and another fella, with guns!</i>

355
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,531
Where did you find 'em?

356
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,284
<i>North side of the island, sir.</i>

357
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,445
Holding cell, now!

358
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,806
<i>Right, sir.</i>

359
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,124
<i>Lockdown in progress.</i>

360
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,920
This is a mistake! I'm the victim here!

361
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,844
This man stole my boat. He's a pirate.

362
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,689
- Yeah, I really am.
- Please, sit down.

363
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,404
I don't even know who he is!

364
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,451
He's Dr. John Watson, formerly of the
5th Northumberland Fusiliers.

365
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,601
What are you doing here?

366
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,125
It's a hospital. Any work?

367
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,401
It's not a hospital.

368
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,962
I want eyes on Eurus Holmes.
Go straight to the special unit,

369
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,447
deploy green and yellow shift
on my authority.

370
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,887
- Sir.

371
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,163
I'm sparing your blushes because
we're supposed to be on the same side,

372
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,049
and frankly, this is embarrassing.

373
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,889
Oh. Doing a cavity search?

374
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,004
The true art of disguise,
according to your famous friend,

375
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,764
is not being looked at.

376
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,083
But I am looking at you,
aren't I, Mr. Holmes?

377
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,288
- Yes, you are.

378
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,931
But that is sort of the point, isn't it?

379
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,242
See, you should've been looking
at the guy you just gave your pass to.

380
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,206
That's the trouble with uniforms
and name badges,

381
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,487
people stop looking at faces.

382
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,403
You'd be better off with clown outfits.

383
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,204
At least they'd be satirically irrelevant.

384
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,842
Oh, you'll find the real landers
on the north shore,

385
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,081
tied up with two others.

386
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,681
- Two others?
- Mmm.

387
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,366
Well, it was trial-and-error.
We had to find the right waistband.

388
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,487
This is insane.

389
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,080
- This is unnecessary.
- No, your security is compromised,

390
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,326
and we don't know who to trust.

391
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,050
And that justifies dressing up?

392
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,610
Yes, it does!

393
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,324
It justifies dressing up
or any damn thing I say it does.

394
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,481
Now, listen to me.

395
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,404
For your own physical safety, do not speak.

396
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,724
Do not indulge in any non-verbal signal
suggestive of internal thought.

397
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,527
If the safety of my sister is compromised,

398
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,887
if the security of my sister is compromised,

399
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,765
if the incarceration of my sister
is compromised,

400
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,288
in short, if I find any indication
my sister has left this island

401
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,290
at any time, I swear to you, you will not!

402
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,047
- Say thank you to Dr. Watson.
- Why?

403
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,124
He talked me out of Lady Bracknell.
This could have been very different.

404
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,807
Are you in?

405
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,727
Just arriving at the secure unit.
Explain.

406
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,086
<i>Door opening.</i>

407
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,049
<i>Prison within a prison.</i>

408
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,806
Eurus must be allowed
the strict minimum of human interaction.

409
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,207
- Why?
- Since you're determined to meet her,

410
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,770
you're about to find out.

411
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,129
Eyes on Eurus Holmes.
Governor's orders.

412
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,966
Answer yes or no.

413
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,930
Has there ever been,
against my express instructions,

414
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,765
any attempt at a psychiatric
evaluation of Eurus Holmes?

415
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,405
- Yes.
- I presume the tapes are in my office.

416
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,608
- Your office?
- Cast your mind back.

417
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,960
It used to be yours.

418
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,525
- You haven't been down here before,

419
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,722
have you?
<i>Silence of the Lambs,</i> basically.

420
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,370
- You what?
- Keep your distance.

421
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,721
Stay at least three feet away
from the glass and all that.

422
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,963
- Why the headphones?
- She doesn't stop playing.

423
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,326
Sometimes for weeks.

424
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,606
Beaufiful.

425
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,364
- It kills you in the end.
- Aye.

426
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,641
Still beautiful, though.

427
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,687
<i>- Door closing.</i>

428
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,691
<i>Why am I here?</i>

429
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,331
<i>Why do you think you're here?</i>

430
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,209
<i>No one ever tells me.</i>

431
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,368
<i>- Am I being punished?
- Were you bad?</i>

432
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,130
<i>There's no such thing as bad.</i>

433
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,488
<i>- Well, not good.
- Good and bad are fairy tales.</i>

434
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,006
<i>We have evolved to attach
an emotional significance</i>

435
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,560
<i>to what is nothing more
than the survival strategy</i>

436
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,085
<i>of the pack animal.</i>

437
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,686
<i>We are conditioned
to invest divinity in utility.</i>

438
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,649
<i>Good isn't really good,
evil isn't really wrong,</i>

439
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,846
<i>and bottoms aren't really pretty.</i>

440
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,763
<i>You are a prisoner of your own meat.</i>

441
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,961
<i>Why aren't you?</i>

442
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,089
<i>- I'm too clever.</i>

443
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,446
<i>Did you bring it?</i>

444
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,561
Sorry?

445
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,206
<i>My hair band.
Did you bring it like I asked?</i>

446
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,123
I'm not one of the...

447
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,685
I... I don't work here.

448
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,603
<i>My special hair band.</i>

449
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,160
I'm not one of your doctors.

450
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,165
<i>The one I made you steal from Mummy.</i>

451
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,921
<i>It was the last thing
I said to you, remember?</i>

452
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,525
<i>The day they took me away.</i>

453
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,726
No.

454
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,847
<i>No?</i>

455
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,967
We've spoken since then.

456
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,770
You came around to my flat
a few weeks back.

457
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,241
You pretended to be a woman
called Faith Smith.

458
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,367
We had chips.

459
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,329
<i>Does this mean
you didn't bring my hair band?</i>

460
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,204
How did you manage
to get out of this place?

461
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,930
How did you do that?

462
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,321
<i>Easy. Look at me.</i>

463
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,363
I am looking at you.

464
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,042
<i>You can't see it, can you?</i>

465
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,882
<i>You try and try, but you just can't see,</i>

466
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,371
<i>- you can't look.</i>
- See what?

467
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,450
<i>What do you think?</i>

468
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,567
Beautiful.

469
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,166
<i>- You 're not looking at it.</i>
- I meant your playing.

470
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,965
<i>Oh, the music.
I never know if it's beautiful or not.</i>

471
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,724
<i>Only if it's right.</i>

472
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,245
Often they're the same thing.

473
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,246
<i>If they're not always the same thing,
what's the point in beauty?</i>

474
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,367
<i>Look at the violin.</i>

475
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,209
I need to know how you escaped.

476
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,731
<i>Look at the violin.</i>

477
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,085
It's a Stradivarius.

478
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,366
<i>It's a gift.</i>

479
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,369
- Who from?
<i>- Me.</i>

480
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,441
Why?

481
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,010
<i>You play, don't you?</i>

482
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,526
How did you know?

483
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,846
<i>How did I know?</i>

484
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,002
<i>I taught you, don't you remember?
How can you not remember that?</i>

485
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,208
Eurus, I don't remember you at all.

486
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,281
<i>Interesting.</i>

487
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,682
<i>Mycroft told me
you'd rewritten your memories.</i>

488
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,683
<i>He didn't tell me
you'd written me out completely.</i>

489
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,245
What do you mean, "rewritten"?

490
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,600
<i>You still don't know about Redbeard,
do you?</i>

491
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,767
<i>Oh.</i>

492
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,963
<i>This is going to be such a good day.</i>

493
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,969
<i>She smiles at you when you come home.</i>

494
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,008
Everyone we sent in there...

495
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,809
<i>- Like a reflex.</i>
-...it's hard to describe,

496
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,769
- it's like she...
- Recruited them.

497
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,564
<i>Smiling is advertising.</i>

498
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,165
Enslaved them.

499
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,965
She's been capable of that
since she was five.

500
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,165
She's an adult now.

501
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,690
- I warned you. I ordered you.

502
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,331
She's clinically unique. We had to try.

503
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,084
At what cost?

504
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,128
<i>Happiness is a pop song.</i>

505
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,526
<i>Sadness is a poem.</i>

506
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,090
What cost?

507
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,650
Tell me the worst thing that has happened.

508
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,924
She kept suggesting to Dr. Taylor
that he should kill his family.

509
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,047
And?

510
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,645
He said it was like an ear worm,

511
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,206
- couldn't get her out of his head.
- And?

512
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,567
- He left.
- And?

513
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,085
Killed himself.

514
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,446
And?

515
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,081
His family.

516
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,921
<i>You're going to cry.</i>

517
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,009
<i>It's okay if you cry.</i>

518
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,491
<i>I don't need to cry.</i>

519
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,931
<i>I can help you cry.</i>

520
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,807
<i>Play for me.</i>

521
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,442
I need to know how you got out of here.

522
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,888
<i>You know already. Look at me.
Look and play.</i>

523
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,804
<i>No, not Bach. You clearly
don't understand it. Play you.</i>

524
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,007
Me?

525
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,641
<i>You.</i>

526
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,404
<i>Oh, have you had sex?</i>

527
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,846
- Why do you ask?
<i>- The music. I've had sex.</i>

528
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,086
How?

529
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,640
<i>One of the nurses got careless.
I liked it. Messy, though.</i>

530
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,051
<i>People are so breakable.</i>

531
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,525
I take it he didn't consent.

532
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,971
<i>- He?</i>
- She?

533
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,483
<i>Afraid I didn't notice
in the heat of the moment.</i>

534
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,483
<i>And afterwards... Well!</i>

535
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,051
<i>You couldn't really tell.</i>

536
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,845
<i>Is that vibrato or is your hand shaking?</i>

537
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,810
I warned you explicitly.

538
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,325
No one was to talk to her alone.

539
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,641
- You spoke to her.
- I know what I'm doing.

540
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,371
You even brought her a visitor
on Christmas Day.

541
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,167
- I took a calculated risk.
- You gave her a Christmas present.

542
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,570
Remember her Christmas present?

543
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,844
I am aware of the dangers Eurus poses
and equipped to deal with them.

544
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,566
What dangers?

545
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,201
Eurus doesn't just talk to people.

546
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,769
She reprograms them.

547
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,282
Anyone who spends time with her
is automatically compromised.

548
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,566
<i>I'm only trying to help you.
We can help each other.</i>

549
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,402
<i>Helping someone is the best way
you can help yourself.</i>

550
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,567
<i>I don't trust you.</i>

551
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,331
So clearly, you remember me.

552
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,641
<i>I remember everything, every single thing.</i>

553
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,041
<i>You just need a big enough hard drive.</i>

554
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,646
<i>- Sherlock.</i>
- Not now.

555
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,722
<i>- Vatican cameos.</i>
- In a minute.

556
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,762
<i>Let's continue. Did they tell you
to keep three feet from the glass?</i>

557
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,562
- Yes.
<i>- Be naughty, step closer.</i>

558
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,606
- Why?
<i>- Do it.</i>

559
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,886
<i>Step closer.</i>

560
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,961
Tell me what you remember.

561
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,411
<i>You, me and Mycroft.</i>

562
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,044
<i>Mycroft was quite clever.</i>

563
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,169
<i>He could understand things
if you went a bit slow, but you...</i>

564
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,840
<i>You were my favorite.</i>

565
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,330
Why was I your favorite?

566
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,164
<i>Because I could make you laugh.
I loved it when you laughed.</i>

567
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,449
<i>Once I made you laugh all night.
I thought you were going to burst.</i>

568
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,926
<i>I was so happy.</i>

569
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,686
<i>Then Mummy and Daddy
had to stop me, of course.</i>

570
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,762
- Why?
<i>- Well...</i>

571
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,083
<i>Turns out I'd got it wrong.
Apparently, you were screaming.</i>

572
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,965
Why was I screaming?

573
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,446
Redbeard.

574
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,286
- I remember Redbeard.
<i>- Do you, now?</i>

575
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,171
Tell me what I don't know.

576
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,645
<i>Touch the glass.</i>

577
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,891
I put my trust in you.

578
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,850
My implicit trust,
as governor of this institute.

579
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,923
It's obvious when it all started.

580
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,684
Well, she was never the same
after that Christmas.

581
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,650
It's as if you woke her up.

582
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,690
That is entirely beside the point.
You had your orders and failed to act...

583
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,245
- Listen to the tape.
- Sorry?

584
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,211
Do it now. Listen.

585
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,162
- My sister's methods...
- Just listen.

586
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,767
<i>You have no idea how I could help.</i>

587
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,605
<i>Bring me your wife. I want to meet her.</i>

588
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,091
<i>I don't need your help.</i>

589
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,369
Redbeard was my dog.

590
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,881
I know what happened to Redbeard.

591
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,570
<i>Oh, Sherlock.</i>

592
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,211
<i>You know nothing.</i>

593
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,483
<i>Touch the glass
and I'll tell you the truth.</i>

594
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,008
<i>I'll touch it too if you're scared.</i>

595
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,050
<i>I can fix her for you and then
I'll give you her straight back.</i>

596
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,003
<i>Good as new, I promise.</i>

597
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,565
<i>That's all?</i>

598
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,523
<i>What you're proposing is not...
It's not right.</i>

599
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,728
Yeah, everyone who went in there
got affected.

600
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,843
- Enslaved, you said?
- Yes.

601
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,362
- One after the other?
- Yes.

602
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,445
- Dr. Watson, I think...
- Shut up.

603
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,965
<i>Do you trust your wife?</i>

604
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,691
One question.
That's your voice, isn't it?

605
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,280
<i>Do you trust her?</i>

606
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,045
<i>You've got to stop saying these things.</i>

607
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,645
If Eurus has enslaved you,

608
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,762
then who exactly
is in charge of this prisoner?

609
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,121
<i>It's completely inappropriate.</i>

610
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,961
I'm sorry.

611
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,530
- No.
- Very, very sorry.

612
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,648
- No.

613
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,924
<i>You think it's a trick.</i>

614
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,730
<i>You look so...</i>

615
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,723
<i>Unsure. You're not used
to being unsure, are you?</i>

616
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,891
- It's more common than you'd think.
<i>- Look at you.</i>

617
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,447
<i>A man who sees through everything</i>

618
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,960
<i>is exactly the man who doesn't notice...</i>

619
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,449
<i>...when there's nothing to see through.</i>

620
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,768
<i>Do you see how it was done?
I know you like explanations.</i>

621
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,250
Signs, you suspended the signs.

622
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,807
<i>And my voice? Throat mic.</i>

623
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,924
<i>- Puts me through the speakers.</i>

624
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,286
Don't you think it's clever?

625
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,208
- Simple, but clever.
- Transparent.

626
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,331
Well, you do keep asking me
how I got out of here.

627
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,371
Like this.

628
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,681
Get in here, all of you!
Stop me killing him.

629
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,489
No, no, stop me in a minute.

630
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,244
<i>Red alert! Red Alert!
Big red bouncy Red Alert!</i>

631
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,005
- Dr. Watson.
<i>- Klingons attacking lower decks.</i>

632
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,327
<i>Also, cowboys in black hats.</i>

633
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,209
<i>Darth Vader. Don't be alarmed.</i>

634
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,084
<i>I'm here now, I'm here now.</i>

635
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,003
<i>Did you miss me? Did you miss me?</i>

636
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,008
<i>Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? Miss me?</i>

637
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,369

647
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,208
- Mr. Moriarty.
- Big G.

648
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,042
Big G means governor. Street speak.

649
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,562
I'm a bit down with the kids, you know.

650
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,404
I'm relatable that way.

651
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,720
Do you like my boys?

652
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,571
This one's got more stamina,
but he's less caring in the afterglow.

653
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,131
This way, please.

654
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,246
Smell all that insane criminality.

655
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,728
- Do you have cannibals here?
- Yes.

656
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,131
- How many?
- Three.

657
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,805
That's good.

658
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,203
People leave their bodies to science.

659
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,851
I think cannibals would be
so much more grateful.

660
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,482
Oh, isn't that sweet?

661
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,406
Maybe you should sit down.

662
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,563
I wrote my own version of the Nativity
when I was a child.

663
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,801
<i>The Hungry Donkey.</i>

664
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,801
It was a bit gory.

665
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,440
But if you're gonna put a baby in a manger,

666
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,249
you're asking for trouble.

667
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,644
- You know what this place is, of course.
- Of course.

668
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,880
So, am I under arrest again?

669
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,764
You remain a person of interest,

670
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,890
but until you commit
a verifiable crime, you are,

671
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,331
I regret, at liberty.

672
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,206
- Then why am I here?
- You are a Christmas present.

673
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,842
Ah! How do you want me?

674
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:27,001
There is, in this facility,
a prisoner whose intellectual abilities

675
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,841
are of occasional use
to the British government.

676
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,288
What, for, like, really difficult sums,
long division, that sort of thing?

677
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,128
She predicted the exact dates
of the last three terrorist attacks

678
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,771
on the British mainland
after an hour on Twitter.

679
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,365
That sort of thing.

680
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,528
In return, however, she requires treats.

681
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,567
- Last year it was a violin.
- This year?

682
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,610
Five minutes unsupervised conversation...

683
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,563
with you.

684
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,051
Me?

685
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,721
With me?

686
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,281
She has noted your interest
in the activities of my little brother.

687
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,201
So...

688
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,566
What's she got to do with Sherlock Holmes?

689
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,924
Whatever you're about to tell me,

690
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,651
I already know it's gonna be awesome!

691
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,449
<i>I'm your Christmas present.</i>

692
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,161
<i>So what's mine?</i>

693
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,966
<i>Redbeard.</i>

694
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,528
No...

695
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,966
How are you?

696
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,883
Bit of a lump.

697
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,169
True that, but you have your uses.

698
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,960
You see your sister?

699
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,724
- Yes.
- How was that?

700
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,160
Family is always difficult.

701
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,210
Is this an occasion for banter?

702
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,687
- Hmm. Case in point.

703
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,046
Are we phoning someone?

704
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,161
Apparently.

705
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,928
- What's he doing here?
- As he is told.

706
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,246
Eurus is in control.

707
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,923
<i>Help me, please.</i>

708
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,287
I'm on a plane. Everyone's asleep.

709
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,686
Help me.

710
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,164
<i>Hello.
My name 's Jim Moriarty.</i>

711
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,770
<i>Welcome to the final problem.</i>

712
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,251
- It's okay, he's dead.
- He doesn't sound dead.

713
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,764
<i>This is a recorded announcement.</i>

714
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,128
<i>Please say hello
to some very old friends of mine.</i>

715
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,931
Hello? I can hear you talking.
Please help me.

716
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,965
<i>I'm on a plane and it's going to crash.</i>

717
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,881
- What is this? We can't do this.
- Do shut up, dear.

718
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,962
<i>- Is someone there?</i>
- Is this supposed to be a game?

719
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,123
- Be quiet.
<i>- Please help me.</i>

720
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,724
Oh, hello, erm...

721
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,929
Try... Try to stay calm, just...

722
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,044
Tell me what your name is.

723
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,089
I'm not supposed to tell my name
to strangers.

724
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,728
Of course not, very good, but...
I'll tell you mine, my name is...

725
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,446
Hello?

726
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,730
<i>Oh, dear. We seem to have lost
the connection.</i>

727
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,322
How have you done this?
How is any of this possible?

728
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,723
You put me in here, Mycroft.
You brought me my treats.

729
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,447
What treats?

730
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,244
<i>Clever Eurus! You go, girl!</i>

731
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,084
How can that be Moriarty?

732
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,485
Oh, he recorded lots of little messages
for me before he died.

733
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,081
<i>Loved it.</i>

734
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,401
<i>Did you know
his brother was a station master?</i>

735
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,090
<i>I think he was always jealous.</i>

736
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,480
The girl. Where is she?

737
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,241
Can I talk to her again?

738
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,001
Poor little thing.

739
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,445
<i>Alone in the sky on a great, big plane
with nowhere to land.</i>

740
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,445
<i>But where in the world is she?</i>

741
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,161
<i>It's a clever little puzzle.</i>

742
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,365
<i>If you want to apply yourself to it,
I can re-connect you, but first...</i>

743
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,326
That's my wife.

744
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,045
That's my wife!

745
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,609
Oh, God, that's my wife.

746
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,291
<i>I'm going to shoot the governor's wife.</i>

747
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,010
Please, no.

748
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,363
Please, help her.

749
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,801
In about a minute...

750
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,964
Bang! Dead.

751
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,486
Please don't do that.

752
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,800
<i>Well, you can stop me.</i>

753
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,124
- How?
- There's a gun in the hatch. Take it.

754
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,084
You want to save the governor's wife?

755
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,204
Choose either Dr. Watson
or Mycroft to kill the governor.

756
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,485
Oh... Oh, God.

757
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,926
<i>You can 't do it, Sherlock. If you do it,
it won 't count. I'll kill her anyway.</i>

758
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,049
It has to be your brother or your friend.

759
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,850
You have to do this.

760
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,250
Eurus will kill her.

761
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,002
Doesn't appear we have a choice.

762
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,407
Right, then.

763
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,604
<i>Countdown starting...</i>

764
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,682
- How long?
- No, no, no.

765
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,364
The countdown is for me.

766
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,771
<i>Withholding the precise deadline,
I'm gonna apply the emotional pressure</i>

767
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,365
<i>more evenly where possible.</i>

768
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,048
Please give me an explicit verbal
indication of your anxiety levels.

769
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,851
<i>I can't always read them
from your behavior.</i>

770
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,287
I can't do this.

771
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,361
Can't, it's murder.

772
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,607
This is not murder.

773
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,771
This is saving my wife.

774
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,771
<i>I'm particularly focused
on internal conflicts</i>

775
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,442
<i>where strategising round
a largely intuitive moral code</i>

776
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,361
<i>appears to create
a counter-intuitive result.</i>

777
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,329
I will not kill.
I will not have blood on my hands.

778
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,448
Yes, very good, thank you.

779
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,926
Killing my wife is what you're doing.

780
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,726
No.

781
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,926
Okay, fine.

782
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,046
John.

783
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,724
Dr. Watson, are you married?

784
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,083
- I was.
- What happened?

785
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,406
She died.

786
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,770
What would you give to get her back?

787
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,605
I mean, if you could, if it was possible.

788
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,641
What would you do to save her?

789
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,009
Eurus will kill me.

790
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,330
Please save my wife.

791
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,681
There will, I'm afraid, be regular prompts

792
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,445
to create an atmosphere of urgency.

793
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,766
<i>Tick-tock...</i>

794
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,650
<i>Tick, tick, tick. Tick, tick, tick...</i>

795
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,444
<i>Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.</i>

796
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,207
What's your name?

797
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,123
- David.
- Are you sure about this, David?

798
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,446
Of course I'm bloody sure.

799
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,761
Nearly there.

800
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,204
Right, do you want to pray or anything?

801
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,848
With Eurus Holmes in the world,
who the hell would I pray to?

802
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,441
You are a good man,
and you are doing a good thing.

803
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,887
So are you.

804
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,440
I'll spend the rest of my life
telling myself that.

805
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,006
Please...

806
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,690
- Oh, God.

807
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,924
I know that you are scared,
but you should also be very proud.

808
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,843
Just do it.

809
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,561
Be quick.

810
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,085
Tick, tick, tick. Tick, tick, tick.

811
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,682
This is very good, Dr. Watson.

812
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,001
<i>I should have fitted you
with a cardiograph.</i>

813
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,082
- Good bye, David.

814
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,848
<i>Tack, tock, tock, tock.
Tick, tick, tick...</i>

815
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,010
Please...

816
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,129
I can't. Sorry, I can't do it.

817
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,611
Fine, it's all right.

818
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,366
Stop! No, no, stop.

819
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,361
I'm sorry.

820
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,284
- It's all right.
- I'm so sorry.

821
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,241
Remember me.

822
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,361
- No!

823
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,086
You all right?

824
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,881
<i>Interesting.</i>

825
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,488
All right, there you go.
You got what you wanted.

826
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,448
And he's dead.
<i>- Dead or alive,</i>

827
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,441
<i>it really wasn't very interesting,
but you three, you three,</i>

828
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,971
<i>were wonderful.</i>

829
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,401
<i>Thank you.</i>

830
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,083
You see, what you did,

831
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,290
Dr. Watson, specifically,
because of your moral code,

832
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,721
because you don't want blood
on your hands,

833
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,088
- two people are dead instead of one.
- Not two people.

834
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:53,131
<i>Yes. Sorry. Hang on.</i>

835
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,331
- Oh!

836
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,606
<i>What advantage
did your moral code grant you?</i>

837
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,570
Is it not, in the end, selfish

838
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,610
to keep one's hands clean
at the expense of another's life?

839
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,364
You didn't have to kill her!

840
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,491
The condition of her survival was that
you or Mycroft had to kill her husband.

841
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,365
<i>This is an experiment.</i>

842
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,850
<i>There will be rigor.</i>

843
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,203
<i>Sherlock, pick up the gun.</i>

844
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,447
It's your turn next.
When I tell you to use it, and I will,

845
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,290
remember what happened this time.

846
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,011
What if I don't want a gun?

847
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,522
Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.

848
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,325
- For whom?
- You.

849
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,087
<i>- How so?</i>
- If someone else had to die,

850
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,969
would you really want to do it
with your bare hands?

851
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,165
<i>Would waste valuable time.</i>

852
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,327
Probably just take it.

853
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,166
There's only one bullet left.

854
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,685
You will only need one.

855
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,682
But you will need it.

856
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,528
<i>Please... Go through.</i>

857
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,960
<i>There's a few tasks for you</i>

858
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,523
<i>and a girl on a plane
who's getting very, very scared.</i>

859
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,409
- Treats?
- Yes.

860
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,247
You know, a violin.

861
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,841
In exchange for?

862
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,161
She's very clever.

863
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,289
I'm beginning to think you're not.

864
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,007
<i>Come on, now! All aboard.</i>

865
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,964
She must be redecorating.

866
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,131
Is that allowed?

867
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,440
She's literally taken over the asylum.

868
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,364
We have more to worry about
than her choice of colour scheme.

869
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,568
Barely dry. Recent.

870
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,291
That's for our benefit.

871
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,724
As a motivator to your
continued cooperation,

872
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,249
I'm now reconnecting you.

873
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,560
<i>Fasten your seat belts.
It's gonna be a bumpy night.</i>

874
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,962
<i>- Are you still there?</i>
- Yes. Hello.

875
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,681
Hello, we're still here.

876
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,205
- Can you hear us?
- Yes.

877
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,611
<i>Everything's gonna be all right.</i>

878
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,882
<i>I just need you to tell me where you are.</i>

879
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,082
<i>Outside, is it day or night?</i>

880
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,241
Night.

881
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,602
That certainly narrows it down
to half the planet.

882
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,080
What kind of a plane are you on?

883
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,367
<i>I don't know.</i>

884
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,169
- Is it big or small?
<i>- Big.</i>

885
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,521
Lots of people on it?

886
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,444
Lots and lots, but they're all asleep.
I can't wake them up.

887
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,126
Where did you take off from?

888
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,686
<i>And the driver's asleep.</i>

889
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,240
No, I understand, but...

890
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,971
<i>Where did you come from?
Where did the plane take off?</i>

891
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,127
My nan's.

892
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,566
And where are you going?

893
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,165
<i>- Home.</i>
- No. I mean, what airport?

894
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,641
Enough for now! Time to play a new game.

895
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,650
Look on the table in front of you.

896
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,648
<i>Open the envelope if you want
to speak to the girl again.</i>

897
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,082
<i>Earn yourself some phone time!</i>

898
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,607
- This is inhuman. This is insane.
- Mycroft, we know.

899
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,766
Six months ago, a man called Evans
was murdered, unsolved, except by me.

900
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,807
<i>He was shot from a distance
of 300 meters with this rifle.</i>

901
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,761
<i>Now, if the police had any brains,
they'd realize there are three suspects,</i>

902
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,289
<i>all brothers. Nathan Garrideb,
Alex Garrideb and Howard Garrideb.</i>

903
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,962
All these photos are up-to-date,
but which one

904
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,202
pulled the trigger, Sherlock?
Which one?

905
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,484
What's this?
We're supposed to solve this,

906
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,002
- based on what?
- This, this is all we get.

907
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,164
Please make use of your friend, Sherlock.

908
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,005
<i>I want to see you interact with
people that you're close to.</i>

909
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,086
<i>Also, you may have to choose
which one to keep.</i>

910
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,806
What do you make of it?

911
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,929
Am I being asked to prove my usefulness?

912
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,161
Yes, I should think you are.

913
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,209
I will not be manipulated like this.

914
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,521
Fine. John.

915
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,401
John!

916
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,728
Yeah, I think I've seen one of these.
It's a... Buffalo gun.

917
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,004
I'd say 1940s. Old-fashioned sight.
No crosshairs.

918
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,325
Glasses, glasses.

919
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,091
Nathan wears glasses.

920
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,682
Evans was shot from 300 metres.

921
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,843
Kickback from a gun with this caliber...

922
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,607
...would be massive.

923
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,725
No cuts, no scarring.

924
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,531
Not Nathan then. Who's next?

925
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,887
Well done, Dr. Watson!
How useful you are.

926
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,122
Do you have a suspicion
we're being made to compete?

927
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,680
No, we're not competing. There's a plane
in the air that's gonna crash.

928
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,081
So what we're doing is actually
trying to save a little girl.

929
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,202
Today we have to be soldiers, Mycroft.

930
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,210
Soldiers. And that means
to hell with what happens to us.

931
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,685
Your priorities do you credit.

932
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,728
No, my priorities just got a woman killed.

933
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,081
<i>Now, as I understand it, Sherlock,
you try to repress your emotions</i>

934
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,568
<i>to refine your reasoning.
I'd like to see how that works.</i>

935
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,926
<i>So if you don't mind,</i>

936
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,249
<i>I'm going to apply some context
to your deductions.</i>

937
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,731
Oh, dear God!

938
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,889
<i>Two of the Garridebs
work here as orderlies,</i>

939
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,884
<i>so getting the third along
really wasn't too difficult.</i>

940
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,130
<i>Once you bring in your verdict,
let me know,</i>

941
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,404
<i>- and justice will be done.</i>
justice.

942
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,842
- What will you do with them?
<i>- Early release.</i>

943
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,925
You'll drop them into the sea.

944
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,411
Sink or swim.

945
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,447
- They're tied up.
- Exactly! Now there is context.

946
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,603
<i>Please continue with your deductions.</i>

947
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,163
I'm now focussing on the difference
to your mental capacity

948
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,924
a specified consequence can make.

949
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,446
Why should we bother?

950
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,763
What if we're disinclined
to play your games, little sister?

951
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:51,762
<i>I have, if you remember,
provided you with some motivation.</i>

952
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,446
<i>We're getting through the clouds.
Like cotton wool.</i>

953
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,840
Oh, that's nice.

954
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,011
Try to tell me more about the plane.

955
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,485
Why won't my mummy wake up?

956
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,288
So it's got to be one of the other two.

957
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,010
Now, Howard...

958
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,010
Howard is a lifelong drunk.
Pallor of his skin,

959
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,122
terrible gin blossoms on his red nose.

960
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,680
And terror notwithstanding,
a bad case of the DTs.

961
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,887
There's no way he could have taken
that shot from 300 meters away.

962
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,046
So that leaves us with Alex.

963
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,170
Indentations on the temple suggests
he habitually wears glasses.

964
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,289
Frown line suggests a lifetime of peering.

965
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,964
He's short-sighted, or he was.

966
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,690
His recent laser surgery
has done the trick.

967
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,211
- Laser surgery?
- Look at his clothes.

968
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,367
He's made an effort.

969
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,321
That's very good.

970
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,448
Excellent. Suddenly he sees himself
in quite a different light,

971
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,567
now that he's dumped the specs.

972
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,401
Even has a spray tan.

973
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,531
But he's clearly not used to his new
personal grooming ritual.

974
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,369
That could be told by the state
of his fingernails

975
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,767
and the fact that there's hair
growing in his ears.

976
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,080
So it is a superficial job, then.

977
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,970
But he got his eyes fixed,
his hands were steady.

978
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,883
He pulled the trigger, he killed Evans.

979
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,162
<i>Are you ready to condemn the prisoner?</i>

980
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,207
- Sherlock, we can't do this.
- Plane, remember?

981
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,525
Sherlock, are you ready?

982
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,682
- Alex.
<i>- Say it.</i>

983
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,531
<i>Condemn him.</i>

984
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,208
<i>Condemn him in the knowledge of
what will happen to the man you name.</i>

985
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,690
I condemn Alex Garrideb.

986
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,760
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

987
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,965
<i>Congratulations, you got the right one.</i>

988
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,291
<i>Now, go through the door.</i>

989
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,203
You dropped the other two, why?

990
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,806
- Interesting.
- Why?

991
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,285
Does it really make a difference,
killing the innocent

992
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,647
instead of the guilty? Let's see.

993
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,370
<i>The train has left the station.</i>

994
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,647
No.

995
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,884
<i>That felt pretty much the same.</i>

996
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,926
John, don't let her distract you.

997
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,884
- Distract me...
- Soldiers today.

998
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,884
<i>- One more minute on the phone.</i>

999
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,803
<i>Frightened, I'm really frightened.</i>

1000
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,082
It's okay, don't worry,
I don't have very long with you.

1001
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,811
<i>So I just need you to tell me
what you can see outside the plane.</i>

1002
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,967
just the sea. I can see the sea.

1003
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,448
- Are there ships on it?
<i>- No ships.</i>

1004
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,524
<i>I can see lights in the distance.</i>

1005
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,330
- Is it a city?
<i>- I think so.</i>

1006
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,446
She's about to fly over a city
in a pilotless plane.

1007
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,807
- We'll have to talk her through it.
- Through what?

1008
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,931
<i>- Hello, are you still there?</i>
- Still here, just give us a minute.

1009
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,444
Getting the plane away from any
mainland, any populated areas.

1010
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,762
- It has to crash in the sea.
- What about the girl?

1011
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,090
Well, obviously, Dr. Watson,
she's the one who is going to crash it.

1012
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,969
No. We can help her land it.

1013
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,202
And if we fail, she crashes into a city.

1014
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,487
How many will die then?

1015
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,040
How are we gonna get her to do that?

1016
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,529
I'm afraid we're going to have to
give her hope.

1017
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,928
Is there really no one there
that can help you?

1018
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,968
Have you really, really checked?

1019
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,281
<i>Everyone 's asleep.</i>

1020
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,850
Won't you help me?

1021
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,121
We're going to do everything that we can.

1022
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,642
<i>I'm scared. I'm really scared.</i>

1023
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,801
- It's all right, I...

1024
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,644
<i>Now, back to the matter in hand.</i>

1025
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,286
Coffin.

1026
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,966
Problem, someone is about to die.

1027
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,006
<i>It will be, as I understand it,
a tragedy. So many days not lived.</i>

1028
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,209
So many words unsaid.

1029
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,690
Etcetera, etcetera. Etcetera, etcetera.

1030
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,246
Yes, yes, yes. And this, I presume,
will be their coffin.

1031
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,322
Whose coffin, Sherlock?

1032
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,641
Please, start your deductions.

1033
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,888
<i>I will apply some context in a moment.</i>

1034
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,962
Well, allowing for the entirely
pointless courtesy of headroom,

1035
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,566
I'd say this coffin is intended
for someone of about 5'4".

1036
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,409
- Makes it more likely to be a woman.
- Not a child.

1037
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,806
A child's coffin would be more expensive.

1038
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,087
This is in the lower price range,
although still,

1039
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,400
best available in that bracket.

1040
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,931
That was a lonely night on Google.

1041
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,843
This is a practical and informed choice.

1042
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,810
Balance of probability suggests that
this is for an unmarried woman

1043
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,450
distant from her close relatives.

1044
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,363
That much is suggested
by the economy of choice.

1045
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,646
Acquainted with the process of death,

1046
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,927
but unsentimental about
the necessity of disposal.

1047
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,883
- Also the lining of the coffin...
- Yes, very good, Sherlock,

1048
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,122
or we could just look
at the name on the lid.

1049
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,087
Only it isn't a name.

1050
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,170
So, it's for somebody who loves somebody.

1051
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,129
It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.

1052
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,362
This is all about you. Everything here.

1053
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,040
So, who loves you?

1054
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,568
I'm assuming it's not a long list.

1055
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,725
- Irene Adler.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1056
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,404
Look at the coffin.

1057
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,123
Unmarried, practical about death.

1058
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,881
Alone.

1059
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,640
- Molly.
- Molly Hooper.

1060
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,847
She's perfectly safe for the moment.

1061
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,766
<i>Her flat is rigged to explode
in approximately three minutes,</i>

1062
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,088
<i>unless I hear the release code
from her lips.</i>

1063
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,323
<i>I'm calling her on your phone, Sherlock.</i>

1064
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,730
<i>- Make her say it.</i>
- Say what?

1065
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,401
<i>Obvious, Sherly.</i>

1066
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,641
- No.
- Yes.

1067
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,165
<i>Oh, one important restriction.</i>

1068
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,608
<i>You're not allowed to mention in any way
at all that her life is in danger.</i>

1069
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,082
You may not, at any point, suggest
that there is any form of crisis.

1070
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,449
If you do, I will end this session
and her life. Are we clear?

1071
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,445
<i>Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Tick-tock, tick-tock...</i>

1072
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,606
What's she doing?

1073
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,921
She's making tea.

1074
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,530
Yes, but why isn't she answering her phone?

1075
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,806
You never answer your phone.

1076
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,485
Yes, but it's me calling.

1077
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,930
<i>Hi, this is Molly
at the dead center of town.</i>

1078
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,845
<i>Leave a message.</i>

1079
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,123
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

1080
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,041
<i>Just one more time.</i>

1081
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,211
Come on, Molly, pick up.

1082
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,526
Just bloody pick up.

1083
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,966
<i>Hello, Sherlock.</i>

1084
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,401
<i>Is this urgent, because
I'm not having a good day.</i>

1085
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,008
Molly, I just want you to do
something very easy for me

1086
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,241
and not ask why.

1087
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,880
Oh, God, is this one of your stupid games?

1088
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,721
No, it's not a game.
I need you to help me.

1089
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,401
- But I'm not at the lab.
- It's not about that.

1090
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,244
Well, quickly then.

1091
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,326
Sherlock...

1092
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,365
<i>What is it? What do you want?</i>

1093
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,686
<i>Tick-tock, tick-tock...</i>

1094
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,726
Molly, please, without asking why,
just say these words.

1095
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,361
What words?

1096
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,931
"I love you."

1097
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,001
- Leave me alone.
- Molly, no,

1098
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,730
please, no, don't hang up.
Do not hang up.

1099
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,003
Calmly, Sherlock,
or I will finish her right now.

1100
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,331
Why you doing this to me?
Why are you making fun of me?

1101
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,368
<i>Please, I swear,
you just have to listen to me.</i>

1102
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,283
<i>Softer, Sherlock.</i>

1103
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:05,407
Molly, this is for a case.
It's a sort of experiment.

1104
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,608
I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.

1105
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,167
No, I know you're not an experiment.
You're my friend.

1106
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,605
We're friends. But...

1107
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,560
Please, just say those words for me.

1108
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,204
Please don't do this.
Just... just don't do it.

1109
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,450
It's very important. I can't say why.

1110
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,121
But I promise you, it is.

1111
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,128
I can't say that.
I can't... I can't say that to you.

1112
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,924
Of course you can. Why can't you?

1113
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,970
<i>- You know why.</i>
- No, I don't know why.

1114
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,129
Of course you do.

1115
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,087
<i>Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...</i>

1116
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,090
Please, just say it.

1117
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,246
<i>I can 't.</i>

1118
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,089
- Not to you.
- Why?

1119
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,649
Because... Because it's true.

1120
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,920
Because it's true, Sherlock.

1121
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,603
It's always been true.

1122
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,249
If it's true, just say it anyway.

1123
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,762
- You bastard.
<i>- Say it anyway.</i>

1124
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,441
<i>You say it. Go on.
You say it first.</i>

1125
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,371
- What?
- Say it.

1126
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,603
<i>Say it like you mean it.</i>

1127
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,281
Final 30 seconds.

1128
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,961
I...

1129
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,726
I love you.

1130
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,891
I love you.

1131
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,527
Molly.

1132
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,841
Molly, please.

1133
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,811
I love you.

1134
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,680
- Sherlock, however hard that was...
- Eurus, I won. I won.

1135
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,204
Come on, play fair. The girl
on the plane. I need to talk to her.

1136
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,688
I won. I saved Molly Hooper.

1137
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,684
<i>Saved her?</i>

1138
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,050
<i>From what? Oh, do be sensible.</i>

1139
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,242
<i>There were no explosives
in her little house.</i>

1140
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,522
Why would I be so clumsy?

1141
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,002
You didn't win. You lost.

1142
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,531
<i>Look what you did to her.</i>

1143
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,681
<i>Look what you did to yourself.</i>

1144
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,764
<i>All those complicated little emotions.
I lost count.</i>

1145
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:48,283
Emotional context, Sherlock.
It destroys you every time.

1146
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,042
Now please, pull yourself together.

1147
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,568
I need you at peak efficiency.
The next one isn't going to be so easy.

1148
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,045
<i>In your own time.</i>

1149
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,481
Sherlock.

1150
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,049
No. No!

1151
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,051
Look, I know this is difficult
and I know you're being tortured.

1152
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,963
But you have got to keep it together.

1153
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,282
This isn't torture. This is vivisection.

1154
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,601
We're experiencing science
from the perspective of lab rats.

1155
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,970
- Soldiers.
- Soldiers.

1156
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,847
<i>Tick-tock. Tickets, please.</i>

1157
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,211
Hey, sis, don't mean to complain,
but this one's empty.

1158
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,647
What happened?
Did you run out of ideas?

1159
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,803
<i>It's not empty, Sherlock.
You've still got the gun, haven't you?</i>

1160
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,404
<i>I told you you'd need it, because
only two can play the next game.</i>

1161
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,371
<i>just two of you go on from here.
Your choice.</i>

1162
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,367
It's make-your-mind-up time.
Whose help do you need the most?

1163
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,280
<i>John or Mycroft?
It's an elimination round.</i>

1164
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,011
<i>You choose one and kill the other.</i>

1165
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:56,245
<i>You have to choose family or friend.
Mycroft or John Watson.</i>

1166
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,249
<i>Tick, tick, tick...</i>

1167
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:03,849
- Eurus, enough!
- Not yet, I think, but nearly.

1168
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:08,091
<i>Remember, there's a plane in the sky
and it's not going to land.</i>

1169
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,763
- Well...
- Well what?

1170
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,084
We're not actually
going to discuss this, are we?

1171
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,928
I'm sorry, Dr. Watson.
You are a fine man in many respects.

1172
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,363
Make your goodbyes and shoot him.

1173
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,411
- Shoot him.
- What?

1174
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,444
Shoot Dr. Watson.

1175
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,731
There's no questioning who has to
continue from here. It's us.

1176
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,841
You and me.

1177
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,884
Whatever lies ahead
requires brain power, Sherlock.

1178
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,250
Not sentiment.
Don't prolong his agony. Shoot him.

1179
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,725
Do I get a say in this?

1180
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,522
Today we are soldiers.
Soldiers die for their country.

1181
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,130
I regret, Dr. Watson,
that privilege is now yours.

1182
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,484
Shit. He's right.

1183
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,644
He is, in fact, right.

1184
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,730
Make it swift.
No need to prolong his agony.

1185
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,727
Get it over with,
and we can get to work.

1186
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,727
God!

1187
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,324
I should have expected this.

1188
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,366
Pathetic. You always were the slow one.

1189
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,445
The idiot.
That's why I've always despised you.

1190
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,401
You shame us all.
You shame the family name.

1191
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,961
Now, for once in your life,
do the right thing.

1192
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,963
Put this stupid little man
out of all our misery.

1193
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,169
- Shoot him.
- Stop it.

1194
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,366
Look at him. What is he?

1195
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,485
Nothing more than a distraction,

1196
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,131
a little scrap of ordinariness
for you to impress,

1197
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,043
to dazzle with your cleverness.

1198
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,803
- You'll find another.
- Please, for God's sake, just stop it.

1199
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,008
- Why?
- Because on balance,

1200
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,606
even your Lady Bracknell
was more convincing.

1201
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,563
Ignore everything he just said,
he's being kind.

1202
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,120
He's trying to make it easy
for me to kill him.

1203
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,001
Which is why this is going to be
so much harder.

1204
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,170
You said you liked my Lady Bracknell.

1205
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,127
- Sherlock, don't.
- It isn't your decision, Dr. Watson.

1206
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,809
Not in the face, though. Please.

1207
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,607
I promised my brain to the Royal Society.

1208
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,604
Where would you suggest?

1209
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,162
Well, I suppose there is a heart
somewhere inside me.

1210
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,201
I don't imagine it's much of a target,

1211
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,690
but why don't we try for that?

1212
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,285
I won't allow this.

1213
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,371
This is my fault.

1214
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,323
- Moriarty.
- Moriarty.

1215
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,610
Her Christmas treat.

1216
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,807
Five minutes' conversation
with Jim Moriarty five years ago.

1217
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,320
What did they discuss?

1218
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,251
Five minutes' conversation,

1219
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,765
unsupervised.

1220
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,604
Goodbye, brother mine.

1221
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,600
No flowers.

1222
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,006
By request.

1223
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:11,206
<i>Jim Moriarty thought
you'd make this choice.</i>

1224
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,404
He was so excited.

1225
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,722
<i>And here we are, the end of the line.</i>

1226
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,209
<i>Holmes killing Holmes.</i>

1227
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,404
<i>This is where I get off.</i>

1228
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,766
Five minutes.

1229
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,728
It took her just five minutes
to do all of this to us.

1230
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,760
Well, not on my watch.

1231
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,486
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1232
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,364
A moment ago, a brave man
asked to be remembered.

1233
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,051
I'm remembering the governor.

1234
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,766
Ten...

1235
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,049
No, no, Sherlock.

1236
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,721
Nine...

1237
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,411
- Eight.
<i>- You can't.</i>

1238
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,808
- Seven.
- You don't know about Redbeard yet.

1239
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,450
- Six.
<i>- Sherlock!</i>

1240
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,091
- Five.
<i>- Sherlock, stop that at once!</i>

1241
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,086
Four.

1242
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,966
Three.

1243
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,446
Two...

1244
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,166
<i>Hello?</i>

1245
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,489
<i>Hello, are you still there?</i>

1246
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,244
Yes. Yeah, no, I'm still here. I'm here.

1247
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,651
You went away. You said you'd help me
and you went away.

1248
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,970
Yes, I know. Well, I'm sorry about that.
We must have got cut off.

1249
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,648
How long was I away?

1250
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,804
Hours. Hours and hours.

1251
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,922
- Why don't grown-ups tell the truth?
- No, I... I am telling the truth.

1252
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,930
You can trust me.

1253
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,846
<i>- Where did you go?</i>
- I'm not completely sure.

1254
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,524
Um, now, I'll tell you what.

1255
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,683
You've got to be really,
really brave for me.

1256
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,841
Can you go to the front of the plane?
Can you do that?

1257
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,481
<i>- The front?</i>
- Yes. That's right. The front.

1258
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,688
<i>- You mean where the driver is?</i>
- Yes, that's it.

1259
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,482
Okay, I'm going.

1260
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,442
- Are you there yet?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1261
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:38,967
John?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1262
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,121
Where are you?

1263
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,009
I don't know. I've just woken up.
Where are you?

1264
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,851
I'm in another cell. I just spoke
to the girl on the plane again.

1265
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,288
- We've been out for hours.
<i>- What, she still up there?</i>

1266
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,971
Yes. The plane will keep flying
until it runs out of fuel.

1267
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,129
- Is Mycroft with you?
- I have no idea.

1268
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:55,050
I can hardly see anything.
Mycroft? Mycroft?

1269
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,724
- Are you okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1270
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,890
All right. Well, just keep exploring.

1271
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,450
Tell me anything you can
about where you are.

1272
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,205
The walls are rough.
They're rock, I guess.

1273
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,291
- What are you standing on?
- Uh, stone, I think.

1274
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,601
But listen,
there's about two feet of water.

1275
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,001
Chains.

1276
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,563
Yeah, my feet are chained up.
I can feel something.

1277
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,530
<i>Bones, Sherlock.</i>

1278
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,488
<i>- There are bones in here.</i>
- What kind of bones?

1279
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,728
Uh, I don't know, small.

1280
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,565
<i>Redbeard.
Who's Redbeard?</i>

1281
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,327
Oh, hello. Are you at the front
of the plane now?

1282
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,648
Yeah, I still can't wake the driver up.

1283
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,164
That's all right. What can you see now?

1284
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,528
I can see a river.
There's a big wheel.

1285
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:56,731
All right. Well, you and I are gonna
have to drive this plane together.

1286
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,241
Just you and me.

1287
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,848
- We are?
- Yeah, there's nothing to it.

1288
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,969
We just need to get in touch
with some people on the ground.

1289
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,647
Now, um, can you see anything
that looks like a radio?

1290
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,806
No.

1291
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,645
That's all right. Keep looking.
We've got plenty of time.

1292
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,771
- What's wrong?

1293
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,411
<i>- The whole plane's shaking.</i>
- It's just turbulence.

1294
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,931
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

1295
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,440
My ears hurt.

1296
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,768
Does the river
look like it's getting closer?

1297
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,884
- A little bit.
- All right, then.

1298
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,490
That means you're nearly home.

1299

1301
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,761
That's where I am.
I'm in the bottom of a well.

1302
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,242
Why would there be a well in Sherrinford?

1303
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,400
Why is there a draft?

1304

1309
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,765
Yeah, it's just an old building.
I don't care.

very interested in being alive.</i>

more trouble being dead.</i>

1313
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,242
Yep. Still not interested. The plane!

At long last, Sherlock Holmes, it's time

"I am lost.

1416
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,965
"Help me, brother.

1417
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,721
"Save my life

1418
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,931
"before my doom.

1419
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,570
"I am lost

1420
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,611
"without your love. Save my soul.

1421
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,450
"Seek my room."

1422
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,481
Oh, God!

1423
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,847
We're going to crash!
We're going to die!

1424
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,850
I think it's time
you told me your real name.

1425
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,769
I'm not allowed
to tell my name to strangers.

1426
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,604
But I'm not a stranger, am I?

1427
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,886
I'm your brother.

1428
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,600
I'm here, Eurus.

1429
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,449
You're playing with me, Sherlock.

1430
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,320
We're playing the game.

1431
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,164
The game. Yes, I get it now.

1432
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,327
The song was never a set of directions.

1433
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,880
I'm in the plane. I'm going to crash.

1434
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,443
And you're going to save me.

1435
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,246
Look how brilliant you are.

1436
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,800
Your mind has created the perfect metaphor.

1437
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,807
You're high above us, all alone in the sky,

1438
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,360
and you understand everything
except how to land.

1439
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,291
Now, I'm just an idiot.

1440
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,489
But I'm on the ground.

1441
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,649
- I can bring you home.
- No.

1442
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,566
No, no.

1443
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,325
- It's too late.
- No, it's not.

1444
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,566
It's not too late.

1445
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,570
Every time I close my eyes,
I'm on the plane.

1446
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,521
I'm lost.

1447
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,729
Lost in the sky, and...

1448
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,330
No one can hear me.

1449
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,165
Open your eyes.

1450
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,440
I'm here.

1451
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,770
You're not lost any more.

1452
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,606
Now...

1453
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,011
You... You just...

1454
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,406
You just went the wrong way
last time, that's all.

1455
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,325
This time, get it right.

1456
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,770
Tell me how to save my friend.

1457
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,360
Eurus.

1458
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,845
Help me save John Watson.

1459
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,086
- Help.

1460
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,449
We just spoke to your brother.

1461
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,246
- How is he?
- He's a bit shaken up, that's all.

1462
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,290
She didn't hurt him.
She just locked him in her old cell.

1463
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,205
What goes around, comes around.

1464
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,361
Give me a moment, boys.

1465
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,924
Um...
Mycroft, make sure he's looked after.

1466
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,731
He's not as strong as he thinks he is.

1467
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,847
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

1468
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,127
Thanks, Greg.

1469
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,409
Pete, the helicopter ready?

1470
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,560
Let's move her, then.

1471
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:42,967
Is that him, sir?

1472
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,929
- Sherlock Holmes?
- A fan, are you?

1473
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,604
Well, he's a great man, sir.

1474
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,125
No, he's better than that.

1475
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,040
He's a good one.

1476
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,001
- You okay?
- I said I'd bring her home.

1477
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,606
I can't, can I?

1478
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,128
Well, you gave her
what she was looking for.

1479
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,326
Context.

1480
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,211
Is that good?

1481
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,290
It's not good, it's not bad. It's...

1482
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,566
It is what it is.

1483
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,445
Alive! For all these years?

1484
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,568
How is that even possible?

1485
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,804
What Uncle Rudi began,

1486
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,762
I thought it best to continue.

1487
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,764
I'm not asking how you did it, idiot boy!

1488
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,808
I'm asking, how could you?

1489
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,486
I was trying to be kind.

1490
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,686
Kind?

1491
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,201
Kind?

1492
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,207
You've told us that our daughter was dead.

1493
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,240
Better that

1494
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,404
than tell you what she had become.

1495
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,601
I'm sorry.

1496
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,810
Whatever she became,

1497
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,682
whatever she is now, Mycroft,

1498
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,808
she remains our daughter.

1499
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,366
And my sister.

1500
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,689
Then you should have done better.

1501
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,966
He did his best.

1502
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,882
Then he's very limited.

1503
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,525
Where is she?

1504
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,409
<i>Back in Sherrinford, secure this time.</i>

1505
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,366
People have died.

1506
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:14,208
<i>Without doubt, she will kill again
if she has the opportunity.</i>

1507
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,560
There's no possibility
she'll ever be able to leave.

1508
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,770
When can we see her?

1509
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,090
<i>There's no point.</i>

1510
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,204
How dare you say that!

1511
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,566
She won't talk.

1512
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,726
She won't communicate
with anyone in any way.

1513
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,690
She has passed beyond our view.

1514
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,008
There are no words
that can reach her now.

1515
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,646
<i>Sherlock?</i>

1516
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,046
Well?

1517
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,009
<i>You were always the grownup.</i>

1518
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,604
What do we do now?

1519
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,565
Uh, yeah.
I think you better get round here.

1520
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,765
- P.S.

1521
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,246
<i>I know you two.</i>

1522
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,526
And if I'm gone,
I know what you could become.

1523
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,721
<i>Because I know who you really are.</i>

1524
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,205
<i>A junkie who solves crimes to get high.</i>

1525
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,566
<i>And the doctor who never
came home from the war.</i>

1526
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:33,771
Will you listen to me?
Who you really are, it doesn't matter.

1527
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,843
<i>It's all about the legend,</i>

1528
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,641
<i>the stories,</i>

1529
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,010
<i>the adventures.</i>

1530
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:53,171
<i>There is a last refuge for the desperate,</i>

1531
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:55,325
<i>the unloved,</i>

1532
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,726
<i>the persecuted.</i>

1533
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,047
<i>There is a final court of appeal
for everyone.</i>

1534
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,127
<i>When life gets too strange,</i>

1535
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,490
<i>too impossible,</i>

1536
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,480
<i>too frightening,</i>

1537
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,961
<i>there is always one last hope.</i>

1538
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,925
<i>When all else fails, there are two men
sitting, arguing in a scruffy flat,</i>

1539
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:46,806
<i>like they've always been there
and they always will.</i>

1540
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:51,727
<i>The best and wisest men
I have ever known,</i>

1541
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,247
<i>my Baker Street boys,</i>

1542
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:01,923
<i>Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.</i>
