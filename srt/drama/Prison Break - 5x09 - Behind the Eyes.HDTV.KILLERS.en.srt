- <i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...
- LINCOLN: <i>We found Michael.</i>

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,329
Never thought I'd see this face again.

3
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:06,843
You weren't supposed to.

4
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:08,999
I own you, Scofield. If
you're planning something,

5
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:11,268
I'll always be a step ahead of you.

6
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,770
MICHAEL: Your husband.

7
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,104
Jacob is Poseidon.

8
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,764
He's a CIA operative,

9
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:17,088
<i>deep cover.</i>

10
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:19,076
He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.

11
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:21,278
He targeted me for my skills.

12
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,615
<i>Four years ago, he betrayed
me so he could have you.</i>

13
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,533
- How did he betray you?
- MICHAEL: <i>We were meeting a man</i>

14
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:27,634
<i>named Harlan Gaines,</i>

15
00:00:27,662 --> 00:00:29,586
<i>a deputy director of the CIA.</i>

16
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:31,950
<i>Poseidon shot and killed
Gaines that night.</i>

17
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:33,691
<i>I knew I was being set up.</i>

18
00:00:33,726 --> 00:00:35,552
Michael, he's with our son right now.

19
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:38,429
Scofield was looking for
a partner, combing prisons,

20
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:40,864
looking for someone who
could handle himself.

21
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,433
What are you trying to tell me?

22
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:45,620
It was ingrained in you,
son. You got it from me.

23
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:48,038
Screen grab of the Skype
transmission he sent from the desert.

24
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,829
Of all things to encrypt, why that?

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,665
I'm done with 21-Void after this.

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,036
There's no leaving 21-Void, Van.

27
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:56,213
How about you just shut
up and pay me, Burrows?

28
00:00:56,248 --> 00:00:57,381
I don't have it.

29
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,952
You know who I am?

30
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:03,887
I'm gonna get you and
your mother out of here.

31
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:05,535
We need to run.

32
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,929

33

_

34
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:35,219
Do you know that you're a psychopath?

35
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:38,255
I assure you, I'm not the
first CIA man to hide his life

36
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,590
from his family.

37
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,124
You hid it from the CIA.

38
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:43,130
Look, you want to screw something up?

39
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,228
Put a thousand people on it.
You want to get it done right?

40
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,110
Put it in the hands of
a few. What we were doing

41
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:48,532
was advancing this country's cause.

42
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:50,597
How does freeing a man like Abu Ramal

43
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:52,002
advance this country's cause?

44
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:55,539
Well, it doesn't.

45
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,075
The missions before,

46
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,811
they were for the good
of the country, but...

47
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:04,415
No, this one wasn't about country.

48
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,583
It was about you.

49
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:10,596
<i>Nobody wants to die to
their old life, Sara.</i>

50
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:12,756
<i>And Michael didn't.</i>

51
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:18,862
<i>He wanted to hold on
to it so desperately.</i>

52
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:20,664
<i>In that moment, I wanted him</i>

53
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:21,843
to go away,

54
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,301
the whole agreement,

55
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:25,402
and just have you.

56
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,337
You sent him to Yemen to die.

57
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:31,492
Kept telling myself this
was gonna be my last lie.

58
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:36,080
That it would fade with
time as we had anniversaries,

59
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,981
raised that beautiful child.

60
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:39,650
That is not your child.

61
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:41,218
I raised him.

62
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,419
That love is real.

63
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,554
It's not a lie.

64
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:46,087
You are using him as bait.

65
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:47,424
You son of a bitch.

66
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,926
She knows not to hurt him.

67
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,093
You were so obsessed with Michael

68
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:51,261
that you would risk my son!

69
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,263
Michael? You mean you.

70
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,266
You don't love me. Your ego's too big.

71
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,602
You're too busy trying to be
the smartest man in the room.

72
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,904
And then you met my husband,

73
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,339
and you realized

74
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:03,640
he's smarter than you.

75
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:04,842
[laughs]

76
00:03:04,877 --> 00:03:06,310
I don't think so.

77
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:07,203
You sure?

78
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:10,114
I'm positive.

79
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,149
Our love was real, Sara.

80
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:13,260
Past tense.

81
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,620
I still love you.

82
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:20,850
Everything's set, boss.

83
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:22,249
Good.

84
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,766
Got to give you credit.

85
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:30,847
You'll go the whole nine
yards to help one man

86
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:32,102
steal another man's wife.

87
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:33,337
No, no, no. Don't talk to him.

88
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:35,072
Or what? He'll do something

89
00:03:35,107 --> 00:03:37,175
you're not already gonna
do? You're going to kill me.

90
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:39,751
No matter how many times you
tell me you love me first.

91
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:40,563
Shut up!

92
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:42,679
Michael didn't kill Harlan
Gaines. He had no motive.

93
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,381
- Shut up.
- He's the one with the motive.

94
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,250
Harlan Gaines was your CIA director

95
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:47,851
and he was looking into Jacob.

96
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:49,986
He was gonna put him prison.

97
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:55,225
Damn it!

98
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,063
Tape her mouth shut, please.

99
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:01,810
Tape it shut.

[tape unrolling]

101
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:04,868
If you do, an innocent man dies,

102
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:07,433
and the real killer walks.

103
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:08,956
Don't you understand?

104
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,088
Jacob killed Harlan Gaines.

105
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:12,894
Just shut it.

106
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:19,850
Is there a problem?

107
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:25,316
JACOB: Here he comes.
It's time to do this.

108
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:32,062
This place is gonna
burn down in ten minutes.

109
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:35,699
There will be two bodies in it.

110
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,068
And if it's any solace,

111
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:40,704
our son won't be one of them.

I'm gonna get you and

I didn't draw a map.

What are you doing up here, Van?

00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:03,153
I just want to make sure that
we're getting the right guy.

123
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:04,755

Just let my son go.

Orders weren't to ask questions.

129

It was to shoot on sight.

If Scofield killed Harlan Gaines,

we take him to the
police, if we have to.

134

We get this done the right way.

Poseidon would never let us live.

He won't find us.

I told you. We want to
disappear, we disappear.
